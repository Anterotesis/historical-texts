         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to a Review of the Example of his Life
which he hath left you, and which deſerves

ready to do kind Offices to all, and be true

SERMON
On Occaſion of the Death of
The Reverend and Learned
Mr. STEPHEN LOBB,
Who Dyed June 3. 1699.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>HEB. 11. 14.</bibl>
               <q>Foraſmuch then as the Children are partakers
of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe
took part of the ſame, that through death he
might deſtroy him that had the power of
death, that is, the Devil.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS one Thought that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt hath conquer'd Satan,
and deſtroy'd the Power of Death,
may give us Courage and Reſolution to look
that otherwiſe formidable Enemy in the Face.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65877:4"/>
The ſame Conſideration may comfort us, when,
by Death, we loſe our Relations and Friends:
For tho' they depart, yet we knowing that
they <hi>Dye in the Lord,</hi> and that tho' Death
ſtrike them to the Heart; yet the Strength
and Curſe of it is taken off, we ought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
their departure out of this World as a
Happineſs to them, however it gives an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Mourning unto us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly explain the meaning of the
Words of the Text, before I raiſe my Doctrine
from them. They declare that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
was partaker of Humane Nature, with
this deſign, that by Dying he might deſtroy
the Power of Death: and at the ſame time
they give us a thought that will ſuggeſt the
ſtrongeſt Conſolation in a Dying Hour. Chriſt
found, us to be held equally in the Fetters of
Sin, as in the Bands of Death: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
came into the World, aſſum'd our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and dyed, that by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Expiating our Guilt, and ſatisfying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Juſtice, he might deliver us from the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Sin, and the Tyranny of Satan who
held us under the Sentence of the Law as
condemn'd to Dye, and ſo had the Power
of Death over us. That we may more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand that ſad Condition into which
Sin hath brought the Sons of fall'n <hi>Adam,</hi>
and by which Satan hath obtain'd ſuch a
dreadful Dominion over them, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that the Scripture expreſſeth a threefold
Death to which Sinners are obnoxious. One
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65877:4"/>
is that of which we continually ſee viſible
Inſtances, and of which every one of us, tho'
now alive and in health, ſhall at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hour be an Example. This death puts an
end to a Man's being in this World, and the
time will ſurely come in which we ſhall ceaſe
to dwell here, and our Friends ſhall know
us no more, tho' they may remember us. This
Death parts Soul and Body, once ſo dear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in this World, and mutual partners
of Joys, and Pains: And this Death ſends the
Immortal Spirit to an everlaſting State of
Bliſs or Miſery; and lays down the decay'd.
Body in the Grave to be Rebuilt in a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or diſmal Reſurrection. Tho' it is this
Death which the generality of Mankind doth
moſt fear, who regarding this World as all
their Happineſs, account it the worſt thing
they can ſuffer to be remov'd out of it; Yet
there is another Death which is far more
dreadful, that Death which tho' ſtupid Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do not feel, yet ſtrikes through the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of their Souls, and which not only dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the Mind, and damps that holy Fire
which in Man's primitive Conſtitution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
flam'd in his Breaſt, and enkindled
his Affections, and mov'd them toward God;
but deadens all our Powers and Faculties, and
makes Man to be dead in Sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.
and utterly diſabled to do any thing that is
Good. It is by this Death that Satan hath
the advantage and gains a Dominion over us,
and leads us Captive at his Will, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65877:5"/>
tempts us to Sin and Dye, were it not
for this Spiritual Death which hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd
and weaken'd us, and which expoſeth
us defenceleſs to his Attacks, he could not
on all occaſions get ſo eaſie a Victory over
us. Nay, were it not that this Spiritual
Death hath univerſally ſeiz'd Mankind, the
Devil would have little buſineſs on Earth,
and have no more to do here, than in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And now conſequent to this Spiritual
Death is that which is Eternal, which is
all Anguiſh and Torture of Mind without
Intermiſſion or End, and which is that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing
Miſery and Woe under which the
Devils and Damn'd Spirits do hopeleſly groan.
Whereas then we were dead in Sin, and
appointed to dye, as it was a Curſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Sinner, and were Sentenc'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
all the horrors of Eternal Death, Chriſt
came on purpoſe to take off the Curſe of the
one, and entirely to free us from the other.
And ſince it was by dying that he deſign'd to
ſubvert the Devil's Empire of Death, he
took Humane Nature into Union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he might be capable of Suffering,
and Dying. <hi>Foraſmuch as the Children were
partakers of Fleſh and Blood.</hi> The Children,
thoſe of the Sons of Men whom God the
Father had given him. Thus in the Verſe
preceding the Text. <hi>Behold I, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which God hath given me,</hi> in which he
refers to <hi>Iſa. 8. 18. The Children,</hi> thoſe whom
Chriſt came to redeem from the Curſe of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65877:5"/>
Law, and to ſave from the power of Sin, and
Death; and cruel Dominion of the Devil.
<hi>Foraſmuch as theſe Children were partakers
of Fleſh and Blood,</hi> &amp;c. If any ask what is
meant by Fleſh and Blood, his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may ſufficiently reſolve him. We all
feel the Miſeries, Sorrows and Pains of our
corrupt and frail Conſtitution, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been weakened by various Diſeaſes which
inceſſantly batter our decaying Frame, we
muſt lie down, and die. By Fleſh, and Blood
in Scripture, not mere Humane Nature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſignify'd, but 'tis often meant as it is
deprav'd by Sin, corrupted, and polluted,
<hi>Rom. 8. 4, 5. Gal. 5. 19, 24. 1 Cor.</hi> 15 50.
But in other places of Scripture <hi>Fleſh</hi> and
<hi>Blood</hi> import the Natural Conſtitution of
Man's being without the inherent Malignity
of Sin; <hi>(Matth.</hi> 26. 41.) but yet infirm, and
frail, and ſubject to Pains, and Sorrows. Now
the Children of Men are partakers of Fleſh
and Blood, not only weak and frail, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and defil'd. They all communicate of it
(for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies) and
this corrupted Maſs of Humane Nature tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
firſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> is diffus'd through all his
Poſterity, and is the common portion in which
they participate, and Miſeries and Sorrows
are their wretched Inheritance. Now our
Lord Jeſus aſſum'd Humane Nature into U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with himſelf not with thoſe Corruptions
and Luſts which Infect it in us. No! He was
Holy in the firſt Conſtitution of his Being,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65877:6"/>
               <hi>(Luc.</hi> 1. 35.) in his Conception and Birth:
And all the time of his abode here below
<hi>he was Holy, Harmleſs, and ſeparate from
Sinners,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. And the manner of the
Expreſſion in the Text implyeth as much.
For when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſt's aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
this our Nature, he alters the Phraſe,
he doth not ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it with us, or poſſeſſed it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as we have it in our Perſons with all
the Contagion of Sin adhering to it: But
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he took part of the ſame,</hi>
the ſound part in all the Eſſentials of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Being without the other that was
tainted, and polluted. Now that the Eternal
Son ſhould be as truly Man, as he was God,
was neceſſary, that he might be a fit, and
proper Mediator, that the Threatning of the
Law might be made good, for as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
that Man ſinning ſhould die, this Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
was inflicted on a Perſon who was
really Man bearing our Sins as imputed to
him: It was neceſſary alſo. that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
ſhould aſſume Humane Nature, that
there might be a Change or Commutation of
Perſons between him and us, not Natural as
if we were transform'd into his Being, or he
into ours, but Legal, ſo that he truly appear'd
in our ſtead to anſwer what the violated Law
charg'd upon us, and to ſatisfie offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
He really repreſented us in what he
ſuffer'd, and acted for our Redemption, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as the Sufferings which he endur'd,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65877:6"/>
and the Righteouſneſs which he perform'd
are plac'd to our Account by God his Father,
who admitted that he ſhould put his own
Perſon in the room of our Guilty ones, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Sins upon him and ſuffering the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
due to them, and accepted for us
what Chriſt did, and ſuffered in our ſtead, to
all the real Intents, and Purpoſes of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
as if we had ſuffer'd, and done it our
ſelves. And ſince the manner of making ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for Sin was to be by undergoing the
Penalty which it deſerv'd, and God had threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd,
and this was Death <hi>(Gen.</hi> 2. 17.) not
only Separation of Soul and Body, but the
Wrath of God, which gives deep and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Wounds to a Spirit, it was therefore
needful that the Perſon who offer'd up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as an Expiatory Sacrifice for us ſhould be
Man, that he might be capable of Dying.
For God cannot dye, nor be ſuſceptive of the
Inflictions of his own Wrath and Juſtice.
Nor could an Angel dye, as Death imports
ſeparation of Soul and Body which thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have not, and therefore this among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may be given as a reaſon why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſays <hi>(Heb.</hi> 2. 16.) That <hi>he took not on
him the Nature of Angels but the Seed of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.
For by Death which cannot make
any impreſſion on an Angelick Nature, but
may on the Humane, Chriſt intended <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
him that had the power of Death, that is,
the Devil.</hi> Theſe Words which are the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of my Text expreſs the means by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65877:7"/>
which our Triumphant Lord Jeſus gain'd the
Victory over Satan. He might have employ'd
his Invincible Power as God to conquer this
Enemy of Mankind who had uſurp'd a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the World. The ſame Jeſus who
made Legions of Devils tremble at his Voice,
when he forc'd them by a powerful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to go out of the Man poſſeſs'd; could
by the Power and Glory of his Divinity have
entirely not only vanquiſh'd but deſtroy'd him
without Dying himſelf. But ſince God was
angry with Man, and provok'd by his Sin had
juſtly permitted Satan to have Dominion over
him, and ſince it was by Man's Sin that the
Devil had obtain'd the power of Death,
therefore his Empire could not be ſubverted
but by taking away Sin the ſtrength of it. And
Sin could not be remov'd but by an Expiation
of its Guilt, and aboliſhing the Curſe of the
Law, and appeaſing God's Wrath, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Juſtice. And all this could not be
effected without a Sacrifice ſufficient to make
an Atonement. And no other Sacrifice was
there, or indeed could be but our Dying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:
So neceſſary was it for him to die,
<hi>That by Death he might deſtroy him who had
the Power of Death, that is the Devil.</hi> This
latter part of the Verſe which I fix on as the
Subject of my Diſcourſe affords a Doctrine
ſuitable to the occaſion of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That tho' a Believer is not excus'd from
Dying, yet Satan being conquer'd by Chriſt
hath not the power of Death over him.</hi> He
cannot make it a Curſe to him, for Chriſt
hath taken away Sin which rendred it ſuch.
He cannot diſtract him with amazing Fears,
nor throw his Conſcience into the Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Deſpair from Apprehenſions of Guilt,
for Chriſt by <hi>his Blood hath purg'd his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from Dead Works, that he may draw near
unto God in full dſſurance of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.
22. He cannot affect his Soul with the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Influences of a Spiritual Death, for tho'
indeed it was once <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi>
yet it is now <hi>quickned by Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph.
2. 1. He cannot bring the believing Soul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Confines of Eternal Death, for <hi>there is
no Condemnation to him being in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
Rom. 8. 1. And he <hi>having overcome ſhall not
be hurt of the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. 2. 11. Not
the leaſt part of it can ever be his Portion,
none of its Anguiſh and Woe ever fall upon
him, nor ſhall any of the Flames of Divine
Anger which burn to the loweſt Hell, ever
pierce his Soul, for his Bleſſed Jeſus <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him from the Wrath to come</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.
10. What tho' his Soul muſt part from the
Body as well as others ſince <hi>it is appointed
unto all Men once to die</hi> Heb. 9. 27. Yet there
is no Curſe in his Death, nor can the Devil
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65877:8"/>
ſtrike any Sting of it into his Heart, nor
wound his Conſcience with Deſpair, nor can
all his Malicious Arts do him any Miſchief.
What tho the Believer is not priviledg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the common Fate of all Men, yet he
is ſecur'd from the bad Effects of it, and from
all the dreadful Conſequents which purſue
every wretched Man who dies in Unbelief
and with the weight of all his Sins ſinking
down his Soul. But the Believer even in
dying is in a ſtate of Safety, and Death from
being a Curſe as it is to all others, is chang'd
into a Bleſſing, for it doth not extinguiſh his
Life, but only tranſlate it to Happineſs and
Glory.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. I ſhall ſhew how Satan hath the Power
of Death.</item>
                  <item>II. I ſhall prove that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
hath deſtroy'd the Devil, and his Power of
Death at once.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. How is it that Satan hath the Power of
Death? Hath he any juſt Title to his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions?
Is any Authority due to him? Or
doth he by right ſway the Scepter of this
Kingdom? Or hath he the ſupream Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over the Lives of Creatures as God
hath, who kills, and makes alive as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<hi>Deut. 32. 39. 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 6. No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It is all an uſurp'd Tyranny which God
permits him to exerciſe over fallen Man to
puniſh the Rebellion of that Ingrateful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65877:8"/>
who would not be ſubject to Chriſt's
Milder Scepter. But how did Satan gain this
Power of Death?</p>
               <p>1. He obtain'd it by the Conqueſt of Man,
and by making him a Rebel againſt his God,
ſubdued him to himſelf. He erected his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
upon the Ruins of this fallen Creature,
for ever ſince he overcame our firſt Father in
Paradiſe, his wretched Poſterity have been
the Trophies of his Victory, till Chriſt as a
mightier Conqueror reſcued thoſe whom God
had given to him to be Redeem'd. Thus it
was by Sin that the Devil conquer'd Man,
and obtain'd the power of Death over him
Condemn'd to Dye. Thus it was by Sin that
he enlarg'd his Dominions beyond the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of Hell, and got footing here on Earth,
and ſet up his dark Kingdom in the World,
and rules in the Children of diſobedience,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>2. He hath the Power of Death as he hath
brought Men under the Law of Sin and Death,
inſomuch as they are ſo far from being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to God, and his Righteous Laws as they
are enſlav'd to thoſe of Sin, and the Reward
of their wretched Service and Obedience is
Death, of which the Devil hath the Power,
and it is Sin that gives it him. What is the
Scepter of Chriſt's Kingdom? It is Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8. What is the Scepter of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
Kingdom? Nothing but Sin. It is by
this he gets his Power. It is by this he holds
Men in Bondage. It is by this he wracks,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65877:9"/>
and tortures their Conſciences, and drives
them to deſpair. And it is by this he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to keep the Soul in ſlaviſh fear and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and to hinder it from believing and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>3. Satan more and more encreaſeth this
Power which he hath of Death by promoting
the Efficacy of Sin, and tempting Men to
commit it. How doth he ſtrengthen the Bands
of Death, and tie them faſter on us? It is by
increaſing the force of Sin in drawing us to
reiterated Acts, and ſo we are the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled,
and with all our Struglings are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to get looſe. How is it that he binds Men
over ſecurely to Eternal Death? It is by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
them in Unbelief and Impenitence; <hi>To
treaſure up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath,</hi>
Rom. 2. 5. If we then did but ſeriouſly think,
that every time the Devil enticeth us to Sin,
Death is in the Snare, and that tho he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the Miſchief with the alluring colours
of Pleaſure, Profit, or Honour, yet he really
tempts us to Murther our Souls, we ſhould be
more aware of his many Devices, and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
avoid all thoſe little Artifices by
which he exerciſeth on us the power which
he hath of Death.</p>
               <p>4. He makes uſe of this power in torturing
the Conſciences of Men with the Fears of
Death. Death indeed is ſo contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and looks ſo like an utter extinction of
Being, that if Chriſt had not given us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a Bleſſed Immortality, there is not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65877:9"/>
even a good Man who would not regret to
dye. But he is not upon the wrack perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
tortur'd with the horrors of it as wicked
Men are when they ſee it make near approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to them. For not only the Face of Death
it ſelf is dreadful as it comes to hurry them
from all enjoyments of this Life, in which
they plac'd all their happineſs; but going out
of the World they have a proſpect of the ſad
Regions of Deſpair into which they are entring.
The Devil who flatter'd them before, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeduc'd them to Sin, now puts on his natural
affrighting Viſage, accuſeth, and threatneth
them with all the mercileſs Looks of an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.
And that which makes the thing
more dreadful, the Law of God accuſeth and
condemneth the unbelieving Sinner, and this
gives force to the Devil's Accuſations, for
without it he could not accuſe, threaten, and
perplex any Men with the Terrors of Death.
No! <hi>It is Sin which is the ſting of death, and the
ſtrength of Sin is the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 56. It is thus
the Devil uſeth his Power to keep Men in a
ſlaviſh ſubmiſſion to him, and as a true Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
he Governs his Subjects only by fear.</p>
               <p>5. The Devil hath the power of Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as he is the Inſtrument of God's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
inflicting the ſecond Death. He is the
Jaylour and Executioner in Hell, where Death
keeps its Court, and ſits on a Throne. Now
in this reſpect Satan hath nothing to do with
a Believer, who being freed from Sin, and
the Curſe, and Condemnation of the Law
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65877:10"/>
ſhall never be deliver'd to this Tormentor, as
the Expreſſion is <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 24. Nor hath he
power to inflict Temporal Death on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.
He cannot ſeparate our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as he pleaſeth. If this were permitted
him, what Slaughter and Devaſtation would
he make in the World? He deſtroys indeed
the Souls of Wicked Men, but it is with their
conſent, and they are their own Murtherers.
But Men die according to God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by thoſe ways and means which he
had fore-ordain'd to put an end unto their
Lives.</p>
               <p>II. The ſecond part of my Diſcourſe is to
prove that Chriſt by dying hath deſtroy'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
and the power of Death at once. He
hath deſtroy'd Satan not by extinguiſhing his
Being, for the innumerable Miſchiefs which
he doth, ſhew him to be alive, and very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and active. But as a Tyrant is ſaid
to be ruin'd when his Throne is overturn'd,
and his cruel oppreſſive Government is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
ſo Satan is ſaid to be deſtroy'd, when
his Kingdom is ſo, and this hath Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd
by his Death, for he hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
the Elect Sons of Men out of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Power, and reduc'd them to his own
Kingdom, inſomuch as Satan hath no more
Dominion over them.</p>
               <p>1. It is evident that Chriſt hath deſtroy'd
Satan, and the Power of Death, becauſe his
great Deſign in aſſuming our Nature was to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65877:10"/>
accompliſh this Glorious Work. He came
into the World not to make himſelf Great and
Honourable, and to raiſe an Earthly Empire,
which he might eaſily have done whenever
he pleas'd. But he came to perform a more
dreadful and difficult Undertaking. He came
to ſuffer the Puniſhment due unto us, that ſo
he might be a proper Sacrifice and the great
Propitiation to ſatisfie God's Juſtice, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
his Wrath, and Redeem us who were
obnoxious to it, and ſubject to the Curſe of
the Law. He came to bear our Sins, to be
wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, to be bruis'd
for our Iniquities, to have the Chaſtiſement
of our Peace laid upon him, that by his
Stripes we might be heal'd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. He
came to live miſerably, as a Man of Sorrows,
and acquainted with Grief, and at laſt to die
for us to endure God's Anger, and undergo
Divine Vengeance. And he dyed on purpoſe,
that he might deſtroy the Power of Death,
and that the Curſe and Sting of it being left
in his own Soul, it might do us no hurt.
Thus his great Deſign was to deliver us from
Death, that it might not be a Curſe and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to us when we paſs through its Gloomy
Shaddow, that it might not have power to
hold us in its Bands, but that our Souls might
immediately at the expiring of our lateſt
Breath paſs into a ſtate of Immortal Life and
Unfading Bliſs, and our dead Bodies revive,
and breaking the Priſons of the Grave rejoyce
in a Glorious Reſurrection. This was the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65877:11"/>
great Performance for which he came into the
World; It was for this God the Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him in the Eternal Councils between
him and his Glorious Son. It was for this
the Father ſent him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. And this was
the Work which the Son did chearfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. It was this
great Buſineſs which he had in his Mind and
Thoughts, when he liv'd here on Earth, and
of which he ſo frequently diſcours'd to his
Diſciples. And what! Can we think it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for Chriſt to fail in the Execution of his
principal Deſign. How ſhould he who was
declar'd to be the Son of God with Power fail
in accompliſhing that Work which was the
aim of his Mind, the deſire of his Heart:
That Work concerning which he expreſſeth
the warmeſt eagerneſs of Spirit till it were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd,
<hi>Luke</hi> 22. 15. Nothing certainly
ſhall fruſtrate what Chriſt ſo earneſtly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Nothing can hinder the Believer from
partaking the Fruits, and Benefits of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Performance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34, 35, 38, 39.
No! He Travail'd in the Greatneſs of his
Strength as one Mighty to ſave, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 1.
Sin, Satan, and the Power of Death are
therefore undoubtedly deſtroy'd by his Death.
For tho' he dyed yet he fell in the Field of
Victory, and all thoſe Enemies lay conquer'd
by his ſide, and he conquer'd them that we
might rejoyce in him as being <hi>more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
through him who hath lov'd us, and
done ſo much for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65877:11"/>
2. That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
the Power of Death is apparent from
his having diſarm'd it of its Sting, and Power.
What is the Power of Death? 'Tis Sin, and
when this is taken off from our Conſciences,
the other in whatever unpleaſing Forms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
it approacheth us, is really nothing
more but an eaſie Sleep in the Boſom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
What makes Death a Curſe? 'Tis Sin.
What puts a Sting into it? Nothing but Sin,
and when that is remov'd Death hath no
Curſe in it to blaſt us, no Sting to annoy us,
but is chang'd into a Bleſſing. Now our Lord
Jeſus hath made an end of Sins, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24.
He hath taken off the Guilt of them from
the Conſcience of the Believer, and <hi>purg'd it
from dead Works that he may draw nigh to a
reconcil'd God, and to his ſatisfied Juſtice in
full</hi> aſſurance <hi>of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. How
hath he remov'd the Guilt from us? By ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it on himſelf. And how did he become
Guilty in the Judgment of a Juſt God, and his
Righteous Law? Not as having committed
any Sin, not as having any inherent in him,
but as having our Iniquities imputed to him.
He was made Sin for us and ſo was adjudg'd
Guilty, and oblig'd to ſuffer the Puniſhments
which he had deſerv'd. And this was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for our Pardon and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>We could not have been made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of God in him, unleſs he had firſt been
made Sin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. Thrice Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
then is the Believing Soul whoſe Sins and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65877:12"/>
Guilt and Puniſhment Chriſt hath born. For
whom Chriſt hath ſufferd the Anger of an
Incenſed God which he the wretched Sinner
had provok'd. For whom Chriſt hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
Divine Juſtice, and anſwer'd the Law.
To whom therefore Iniquity is not imputed,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 8. And for that reaſon Death is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of its Power and can do him no hurt.
And for whom Chriſt hath <hi>brought in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan. 9. 24. That his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Soul being cloath'd with it, may when
diveſted of the Body appear with confidence
before a Holy, and Righteous God.</p>
               <p>3. It cannot be deny'd that our Redeemer
hath deſtroy'd Satan and the Power of Death.
Foraſmuch as he hath put a ſtop to his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations:
Put a ſtop did I ſay? I did not ſpeak
enough, Chriſt hath invalidated them, they
are of no force, and vertue, they are frivolous
Gavils, and are rejected at God's Court of
Juſtice. Is Satan thus thrown over the Bar,
that he cannot implead the Believer, nor lay
any thing to his charge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33? Why
then truly he is deſtroy'd, for it is the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the Strength, the very Life of his Soul
to be an Accuſer. This is the Name that is
given him to expreſs that Temper and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which is inſeparable from his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. And therefore when <hi>he is
caſt down,</hi> when he is thrown out of this ill
Office which was his Malicious Delight, he
is wholly diſ-ſpirited. Nor is Satan's Courage
and Strength only enervated, but the Power
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65877:12"/>
of Death is broken too. When doth the fear
of Death prevail over a Man? 'Tis when his
Apprehenſions of are not only diſquieting,
but tormenting. 'Tis when Conſcience flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Guilt in a Sinner's Face, and Satan joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it enforceth the Accuſation, and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it with the greateſt vehemence on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to drive the wretched Soul to deſpair.
But our Lord Jeſus diſanulls theſe Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
inſomuch as they are of no force againſt
a Believer. Were it not for this, Satan would
perplex the poor Soul all its Days, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it out by continually accuſing it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
it at the laſt moment of Life. It muſt
be acknowledg'd, indeed that the Devil is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
permitted to diſturb many Holy Perſons
with his Accuſations. But what then?
Chriſt who hath ruin'd his Power in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
ſteps in to the Soul's Reſcue, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Satan off prevents the attempted Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and reſtores Peace to the Afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>4. It is evident that this our mighty Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath deliver'd us from the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
becauſe he hath recover'd our Souls out
of that Spiritual Death, into which Sin, and
the Devil had thrown them. This was the
Strength of the Devil's Empire in us, for he
could never have rul'd us, had we not been
dead in Sin, nor have led us Captive had we
not been thus weaken'd. 'Tis this Spriritual
Death that makes Men an eaſie Conqueſt to
him, and ſecures the Peace of his Dominion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65877:13"/>
in their Hearts. Chriſt therefore by quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Soul which is dead in Treſpaſſes and
Sins <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 1.) frees it from the Power of
Satan and Death. He thereby gives us a new
Life from the dead, and we are not within
the Dominions of the Devil any longer, for
the Spirit of a Believer is Life, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 10.)
and he is therefore no Subject of Death's
Kingdom. And to ſtrengthen our Aſſurance,
that if we are Believers we are quickned with
Chriſt, <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. 13.) and ſo are no more any
part of Satan's Empire than he himſelf is:
Let us conſider that our Lord Jeſus hath Life
in himſelf for this purpoſe, that as he Lives,
we may live alſo. <hi>God hath therefore given
to the Son to have Life in himſelf, as he hath
Life in himſelf.</hi> Joh. 5. 26. This aſſigns the
cauſe of what is ſaid <hi>V. 25. Why the Dead
ſhould hear the Voice of the Son of God, and
they which hear ſhall Live.</hi> It is the Soul's
Vivification by the Voice of Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
that is meant. For the Hour that Chriſt
ſpeaks of as now coming and inſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
muſt import the time of the Preaching
of the Goſpel which was very near, whereas
the Day of the Reſurrection was Seventeen
Hundred Years diſtant in Futurity. The cauſe
why the Voice of Chriſt makes dead Souls
live is aſſign'd <hi>v. 26. The Son hath Life in
himſelf,</hi> and therefore <hi>Quickens whom he will,</hi>
v. 21. Thus that Spiritual Death in our
Souls by which Satan once kept us under his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65877:13"/>
Subjection is remov'd, and ſo his Power, and
Dominion over us is deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p>5. It is plain, it is openly viſible that
Chriſt hath deſtroy'd Satan who hath the
Power of Death, inaſmuch as he hath broken
his dark Kingdom, ſubverted his Throne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
him from that Authority ſo arrogantly
aſſum'd by him, and thrown him out of that
Empire which he had uſurp'd in the World.
This Chriſt hath done not by Arms, but by
Dying. As <hi>Sampſon</hi> his Type kill'd more at
his Death, than he had through his whole
Life, and tho he dyed, yet fell a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror:
So our Great <hi>Saviour</hi> deſtroy'd all his
and our Enemies by dying, and in the ſight
of all the Angels triumph'd over them when
he Aſcended after his Victory, and will at laſt
openly triumph before the Eyes of all the
World when he ſhall ſit on his Throne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all his Enemies put under his Feet, <hi>Hoh.</hi>
1. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 13.</p>
               <p>6. The Believer knows by his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
which is more convincing than all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which can be urg'd, that Chriſt hath
deliver'd him from the Power of Satan, and
Death, becauſe he feels himſelf freed from
the fear and bondage of it. He knows that
Chriſt hath made his Peace with God, and
brought him into a Juſtified State inſomuch
as nothing can be laid to his charge, and
therefore is not afraid to go to a Reconciled
God who hath fully Pardon'd, and perfectly
Juſtified him. He ſees his Soul ſprinkled
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65877:14"/>
with the Blood of Jeſus (as that of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lamb was on the Poſts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
Houſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 13.) and knows himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from any deſtroying Angel the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God's Vengeance. In what a Horror
were they on that diſmal Night, when Death
march'd in pompous Deſtruction through all
the Cities of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But how were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſur'd
and comforted when they ſaw the
badge of their Safety on the Poſts of their
Doors? In what a Conſternation is a poor
Soul when he regards Death not only as his
Diſſolution, but as having the Wrath of God,
his offended Juſtice, and all the Horrors of
Hell joyn'd with it to render it terrible? But
when he ſees his Conſcience ſprinkled with
the Blood of Jeſus, and purged from Dead
Works, that he may draw nigh to God in
full Aſſurance of Faith, he dreads Death no
longer, when he ſees Chriſt the Captain of
his Salvation to be with him to hearten, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and ſupport him in charging through
this difficult Paſs, he is not apprehenſive of
any danger, but encouraged by his Preſence
tho he go <hi>through the Valley of the Shadow of
Death, yet he fears no Evil,</hi> Pſal, 23. 4. And
is ſo far from thinking it to be any Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to die, as he deſires to depart and to be
with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
               <p>7. Every Inſtance which we have of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
dying proves the Aſſertion of my
Text, and Doctrine, for even by this Death
our Lord Jeſus finiſheth the Ruine of Satan,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65877:14"/>
and of the Power of Death. The Believer's
Victory is now compleated who is <hi>more than
Conqueror,</hi> through the Power and Strength
of Chriſt, he had before fought many a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with Satan, and put him to flight. He
had often reſiſted Sin ſucceſsfully, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it a Repulſe: And now he conflicts
with his laſt Enemy, and overcomes, and his
Death is a Triumphant Chariot to carry him
to Heaven, where he rejoyceth in a ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
from all Sin, and Miſery. It is there
he is out of the reach of all Evils. It is
there that being freed from the Body of Sin;
and Death under which he groan'd <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7.
24.) he feels Diſeaſes and Pains, and Pangs
of Dying no more. It is there he is plac'd
out of the reach of Satan's Temptations, and
violent Aſſaults, for tho that Active and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Spirit purſued him with the fierceſt
Rage while in this World, yet he cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to Heaven, nor will any of his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
carry ſo far. Thus the Day of Death is
the Day of a Believer's finiſh'd Victory, in
which he may truly ſay he <hi>is more than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,</hi>
Rom. 8. 37. And then the Bleſſed
Soul is remov'd from a wretched Abode to
an happier Manſion, and by Death comes to
be more cloſely united unto God the Spring
of all Life, and to the compleat Enjoyment
of that which is Eternal, which is God's Gift
to him, who firſt begun it in him by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
Spirit, and brought him to the entire
poſſeſſion of it at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65877:15"/>
8. The laſt, and moſt ſignal Evidence of
Chriſt's deſtroying the Power of Satan, and
Death, will be when he raiſeth the Dead
Bodies of Believers from the Grave <hi>by his
Spirit which develleth in them,</hi> Rom. 8. 11.
This laſt Day is the Day of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Victory, when, as himſelf was Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
over it at his own Reſurrection, ſo all
his Members in theirs ſhall Triumph over it
too. Then he will appear with all whom he
Redeem'd, and whom he now makes entire
Conquerors by vertue of his Victory, and he
will appear as having made a Conqueſt over
the Grave it ſelf (1 Cor. 15. 25, 26.) <hi>For he
muſt Reign 'till be put all his Enemies under
his Feet, and the laſt Enemy which ſhall be
deſtroy'd, is Death.</hi> Then the Bodies of all
the Elect which have lain for ſo many Ages in
the Grave ſhall at laſt have the dark Priſons
open'd, and aſcend Triumphant over Death
it ſelf. How Great, and Glorious will that
Day be in which at one Word of Command
from Chriſt, the Earth and Seas ſhall give up
the Dead which are in them. <hi>(Rev.</hi> 20. 13.)
and all the Bodies of the Saints ſhall come
forth <hi>new form'd like unto Chriſt's Glorious
Body, according to the working whereby he is
able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf,</hi> Phil.
3. 21. when we ſhall meet the Patriarchs;
and Prophets, the Apoſtles, and Martyrs,
and all our Relations, and Friends (who have
ſlept in Jeſus) in the Morning of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and ſee them ſhining in Glory, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65877:15"/>
our Lord Jeſus with refulgent Majeſty at the
head of them. What an Illuſtrious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of things will this be? Never was
there brighter day then this, when Chriſt
ſhall make an utter End of Death, as he
hath conquer'd, and deſtroy'd Satan, who
had the power of it.</p>
               <p>As there is no Truth in the Goſpel but may
and ought to be practically applyed, let us
ſee what uſe we may make of this Important
Doctrine, which I have endeavour'd to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,

               <p>Is it ſo that Satan hath the Power
of Death over the Soul, and Conſcience of
every unbeleeving Sinner: Then every one
of you who have not believ'd in Chriſt
tremble at the thoughts of your diſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Seriouſly reflect upon your preſent
miſery, and future danger. What can be
more deplorable then your preſent miſery?
You are not only under the Tyranny of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and a baſe vaſſal of his dark Empire.
You are not onely ſervilely addicted to his
obedience, but you are alſo expos'd unto all
miſcheifs which he may and will do you by
exerciſing that power which he hath of
Death. He will ſtrengthen and increaſe that
ſpiritual Death which is in your Souls, for
he will prevailingly tempt you to Evil, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65877:16"/>
ſad experience may convince you, that a Man
by continuing in Sin, and frequent commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it grows more, and more Inſenſible,
and Dead, and all the powers of his mind
are more weaken'd to any Holy or good

becomes Slave to it. What a diſmal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
is this? And yet this is the woful

look beyond the ſpaces of Time, and this
World and take a due proſpect of your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>Hath Death entred into the World
by Sin, let then our ſorrow for our Dead Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Friends ſharpen our hatred, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
againſt it. In every Sickneſs we ſee,
or feel the effects of it, and tho' our Freinds
Dye in the Lord, yet their Death ſhows us
what Sin brought into the World, and when
we hear them breathing out their laſt Groans,
this may bring to our minds what miſchief
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65877:16"/>
Sin does. Let us conſider that tho' our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt has obtain'd the pardon of Sin,
and taken away the infliction of Vindictive
juſtice, yet it is true, that by every Sin
which we commit, we diſpleaſe God and ſo
diſpleaſe him that he will make us to feel
his Fatherly correction. He will put us in
mind by ſome ſevere chaſtiſement how we have
been wanting in our duty and that we have
done that which has not been right in his
ſight. This ſad occaſion then which cauſes
us to Mourn for the loſs of our Freind, may
at the ſame time make us Mourn for our Sins.
Were it not for them, this had never been,
for both he and we ſhould have been Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and ſo never have parted. Therefore the
greater our loſs is, let us deteſt our Sins the
more. Now to Preſs this thought upon you,
and to excite in you, and my ſelf a juſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and indignation againſt Sin by which we
have diſpleas'd God, and which is the cauſe
of that loſs under which we Mourn, Let us
conſider the worth and excellency of the
Perſon who God has been pleas'd to move
from us. I know very well that Sermon's
Preacht upon ſuch occſions are too much
abus'd to flattery, but there is no fear of it
in this caſe, for there is no need of it. I
ſhall onely ſpeak that of our Friend and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Deceas'd, which all that were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with him muſt acknowledge to be true:
And to ſpeak the truth, can't be imputed to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65877:17"/>
Favour, Affection, or any prejudicate opinion. If
we conſider him as a Man or as a Chriſtian
there was every thing in him to endear him to
us. He was of an excellent benign temper, rarely
provok'd to anger, and if he were it muſt be
from ſome weighty cauſe, and yet even then
his paſſion was ſoon over. He was a Man
prone to do good, ready to receive the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
active to promote any publick intereſt,
any cauſe of Chriſt, and the proſperity of
his Church. He was a Man of a diſcerning,
penetrating Spirit, of great ſtrength of mind,
of a firm and ſound judgment and yet which
was an excellency moſt to be admir'd; He
was not proud of theſe admirable endowments,
And as God had beſtow'd upon him theſe
natural abilities (and therefore to praiſe them
is to praiſe God the author of them and to
give him the Glory.) So he took care to
improve them, and to cultivate the rich Soyl.
He was induſtrious to encreaſe his knowledge
by a ſevere application to God and uſeful
ſtudies. But you'll ſay theſe are but humane
accompliſhments, knowledge, Learning, and
Generoſity of Spirit were found in many of
the Philoſophers who knew not Chriſt. 'Tis
true, but our dear Friend and Brother knew
and loved Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel, and
in the whole courſe of his Study, thoſe were
moſt delightful to him, that led him into the
Myſteries of our Redemption. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Divine things moſt raviſht his Soul,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65877:17"/>
and was the Element in which his Spirit
breath'd, and as he lov'd the Goſpel, ſo he
underſtood the truths of ît, and knew how
to vindicate them. In their neceſſary defence
he employ'd that Art of reaſoning of which
he was a Great Maſter, I do not mean an
Art of Sophiſtry and Cavil, but that which
gives juſt Rules for the framing clear, and
diſtinct Ideas, which direct us to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the due perceptions that we have
of things; and which Inſtructs us in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Method of Arguings, that we may not
be confus'd, perplex'd, or miſtaken in our
Reaſoning. This was the Art of which he
made uſe, and he Argued without Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and knew how to be zealous for the
Truth, and yet not be Angry. If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him farther as to his relative Duties, he
was a Loving Husband, a Tender Father,
True to his Friend, Punctual to all Acts of
Kindneſs, and never promis'd more than he
meant to perform: And to name that Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in which he moſt ſhin'd, he was a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Paſtor, labouring in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
converſing with Souls, enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Caſes, and Neceſſities, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
Counſel, or Reproof as was needful.
The Churches of Chriſt have loſt a Man of
great Uſe and Service, a Loſs which I fear
they will every Day feel more and more.
You who are Members of that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over which he was in the Lord; you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65877:18"/>
have loſt a Faithful Paſtor, and
there is nothing to relieve you under this
ſevere Affliction, but this one Thought,
(which indeed is ſufficient) that our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt is the Univerſal Paſtor never
dies, and you walking in his Ways and
obſerving his Ordinances, may be aſſur'd of
his Preſence, Care, and Direction. I am
now to ſpeak unto you who are his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
you have loſt a Loving Father, but
he has left to you a grateful Memory of
himſelf and the Example of his Life. You
lived and converſed with him, imitate him
in that Good Nature, Candour, Ingenuous
Temper, Piety towards God, and Vertuous
Deportment among Men, which endeared
him to you, and to all that knew him. But
above all <hi>know the God of your Father, and
ſerve him with a perfect Heart, and a willing
Mind, if you ſeek him he will be found of
you,</hi> as a Father of which you can never be
depriv'd, <hi>But if you forſake him he will caſt
you off for ever,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. And now
let every one of us make a right uſe of
this Afflicting Providence. Let us ſeriouſly
reflect how many Worthy Miniſters of the
Goſpel we have loſt, and that within the
compaſs of a few Years. Let us lay our
Hands upon our Breaſts, and make a cloſe
Enquiry, what have I done? Or how have I
been wanting in the Performance of my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Let us all conſider this and turn to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65877:18"/>
the Lord with our whole Hearts leaſt he
make an utter End of us and not only take
away ſome Miniſters but all, and the Goſpel
together.</p>

               <p>Is it ſo that our kind Redeemer by dying
hath deliver'd us from the Power of Satan
and Death? Let us have an high, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Senſe of his Love in the Performance of
the extraordinary favour he hath done us,
and of the Ineſtimable Benefits, which we
have receiv'd. It is a ſmall Matter in our
Account that the Eternal Son of God ſhould
deſcend from Heaven and all its Glories, and
take upon him the Form of a Servant, and
he a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
Griefs, and after a Miſerable Life paſs'd on
Earth die to Redeem us from Death? Is it
a ſmall matter that this Glorious Perſon
who lay in the Boſome of the Father
ſhould by undertaking our Cauſe, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his own Perſon inſtead of ours, and
bearing our Sins imputed to him, expoſe
himſelf to all the Threatnings and Curſes
of the Law, and to all the Wrath, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the offended Deity? What mov'd
him to do this? Nothing but that Infinite
Love which is above all our Thoughts, and
which we can never ſufficiently Adore.
And if we regard the Bleſſings which flow
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65877:19"/>
to us with his Blood, and ſpring out of
that Grave in which he lay but three
Days, how Ineſtimable will they appear to
us? What greater Miſery could befall us,
than that Spiritual Death which had ſeiz'd
our Souls, made us Vaſſals to the Devil's
Arbitrary, and Tyrannical Sway, and enſlav'd
us to every Vicious Inclination, and bound us
in Fetters ready for the execution of Eternal
Death? What Happineſs is there greater,
and in which we have more reaſon to rejoice
than to feel the Power of this Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
by that of Chriſt, then to experience
that as he died unto Sin once, we die unto it
daily, then to be free indeed by his making
us the Sons of God, and to ſee the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Fetters knock'd off, and our ſelves deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

than to be ſubject to the Bondage of the
fear of Death which oppreſs'd us with its
intolerable weight? And what can be more
pleaſing to our diſquieted Souls then to be
delivered from theſe Fears which perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tortured them? Now looking on Chriſt
by Faith as their Reſurrection and Life,
they are ready chearfully to go out of the

that we now believe on Chriſt, that we now
live by Faith on the Son of God, and
then we ſhall die in Faith, and Joy. If
we truſt in him all our Days, he may, he
will be our Confidence at our lateſt Hour.
If we hold this Shield of Faith, and never
ſuffer it to ſlip out of our Hands, we
ſhall be able to repel Satan's Fiery Darts,

when we are dying; we ſhall with undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

no Faith in Chriſt, if we come to give up
our Souls before we have in truſt committed
them to him, we can reſign them to nothing
but Hell and Deſpair. Let us conſider what
a dreadful Scene of things will open upon
us in that Hour. Wherever we ſhall turn
our Thoughts, they will encounter nothing
but Objects of Horror. If we reflect on our
forepaſt Lives, we ſee innumerable Sins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardon'd

we hear our own Conſciences accuſing us,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65877:20"/>

If we look back on the World
which we are leaving, the thoughts of
looſing all theſe enjoyments whom we ſo
much lov'd, and purſued as all our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will Torture us with regret. If we
take a view downward there is nothing but
Hell, and Flames ready to receive us. If
we caſt our languiſhing Eyes up to Heaven,
there is God indeed before whom we muſt
appear, but 'tis an angry God, an avenger
of Sin, and now no longer manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Glorious in his Grace, but terrible in
his Juſtice. What hope can the Poor Guilty
Sinners have, when he hath not one Minute
more to promiſe to his affrighted Spirit, but
he muſt immediately appear before God,
whom he hath provok'd all his days? Where
will he have a ſhelter to ſecure him? What
place can he run to for ſafety? Where ſhall
he find a Sanctuary to protect him from God's
Anger? The Blood of Chriſt he deſpis'd,
and he who came to ſave Sinners was never
thought of by him. The Grace of God was
either ſlighted, or turn'd into wantonneſs,
and how can ſuch a Soul think to find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

face of things. We leave this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
World with joy for a better Country
above, of whoſe Poſſeſſion we are aſſur'd.
We have not the leaſt regret in looſing the
pleaſures of Life, becauſe we know that we
are going to our God who with ſmiles and
kindneſs in his looks invites us to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
where there is fulneſs of Joys, and at
his right Hand Pleaſures for evermore. We
ſhall fear no Hell nor Devils, for Chriſt
hath delivered us from the one, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
the other. In whatever manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Death ſhall attack us, our Souls ready
to take their flight, and knowing what a
change they muſt undergo, yet will not be
Amaz'd. If Death comes on a ſudden, we
ſhall Dye without pain, and one eaſy ſtep
out of the Body ſets us in the other
World of Happineſs. If Death makes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
approaches, and we feel pains of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
and expiring Pangs, yet ſtill the
thoughts of God our Kind Father who makes
our Bed in Sickneſs, the aſſurance of Chriſt's
Favour, and that our Peace is made will
make every thing lie eaſy under us, and
cauſe us to rejoyce through all the Traverſes
of a Tedious Sickneſs. We ſhall account
them but as ſo many ſteps, tho a little
Weariſome to our Father's Houſe, and when
Nature is quite ſpent, and our Souls muſt
fall from their Bodies, they will yet fall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65877:21"/>
gently into the Boſome of our Redeemer.
If we would thus Dye, let us now by Faith
commit our Souls to Chriſt for Life, and
Salvation. If we do ſo, we may make
this wiſh in full aſſurance of hope, may
we Dye the Death of the Righteous, and
may our latter End be like his.</p>
