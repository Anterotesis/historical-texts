            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Bowels of Love unfeigned, beſeeching you all in God's moſt Holy Fear and Counſel to ſtand faſt, and make your <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> ſure, which is not (my deareſt Friends) to thoſe External and Shadowy Services, <hi>that could never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as concerning the Conſcience,</hi> in which the Worſhip of the <hi>Jews</hi> formerly, and the Nations now moſtly do conſiſt (Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Beggarly Elements indeed), <hi>but to that Law in the Heart, and Spirit manifeſted in the Inward Parts, which is the Subſtance of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here God is the Teacher of his People, and daily doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh his with the Immediate Virtue of his own Life; For <hi>God Eternal is broken forth,</hi> and by the Mighty Power of his Spiritual Appearance is come, <hi>to ſtain the Beauty of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Superſtitious Men,</hi> and thereby to ſummon all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Kindreds, Tongues</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to Judgment, for their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that he alone may Reign King in the Heart, where the Devil has hitherto had Dominion, that true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> may conſiſt in <hi>fearing him</hi> and <hi>working Righteouſneſs,</hi> by the powerful Operation of the Spirit of Jeſus in them, which my dearly beloved Friends, with all Singleneſs of Heart let us wait to be ſenſible of, that through the glorious Riſing of the pure Power of the Everlaſting God, which is felt by all the Children of the Light, we may be enabled <hi>to work out our great Salvation with Fear and Trembling:</hi> For great and weighty is the Work of the Almighty in this his Day of Appearance, even to adopt us Sons and Daughters of the Moſt High, <hi>by a Participation of his Divine Nature,</hi> that as we have born the <hi>Image of the Earthly, in Pride, Vanity, Wantonneſs, Avarice, and all manner of Impieties;</hi> and that whilſt ſome of us were under great Profeſſions, and the continual Feaſting on Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Elementary Things; ſo that now we may daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, through Obedience to that Pure <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Truth in the Inward Parts,</hi> which leads to all <hi>Meekneſs, Patience</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52321:2"/>
               <hi>Purity,</hi> the Quickening of the New Man, and ſenſibly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>a bearing of the Heavenly Image,</hi> that ſo we may come to feel <hi>the Peace that paſſeth the world's Underſtanding,</hi> and our poor, toſſed, tryed and troubled Spirits in good meaſure fix't and anchor'd, in the Immoveable and Holy State, over all the <hi>Glories</hi> and <hi>Pollutions</hi> of the World, that ſo nothing may ever prevail upon us, <hi>to return into our former wayes and Luſts, committed in our Ignorance: For, the over-flowing Scourge of the Almighty will be upon the Back of the Backſlider, and his ſwift wrath will overtake the Heart that faints by the way; yea, better were it that ſuch had never been viſited with the Glorious Day-ſpring from on High, nor been convinced by the Powerful Perſwaſions of the Holy Spirit concerning the Pure Eternal</hi> WAY <hi>of</hi> TRUTH, <hi>then afterwards to turn from it, and ſo trample the Blood of that moſt Excellent Covenant under foot:</hi> Yea, it will be the moſt Dreadful of all Aggravations to their Eternal Wo and Miſery.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>My dear Friends,</hi> let us not be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted under all our ſharp and heavy <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> whether from within or without; for this I am fully perſwaded of, That the ſame pure Principle of Light and Truth, that hath appeared to give a certain Diſcerning of our States and Conditions, and wrought a Convincement upon our Underſtandings, is able to give us that Succour and Support, if our Minds be but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſtay'd thereon, <hi>as ſhall Sanctifie us throughout in Body, Soul and Spirit;</hi> and ſo preſerve us clean, to God over all.</p>
            <p>And <hi>My Dear Brethren,</hi> Let us not enter into any Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the Lord, but be ſingly given up to know his Will and Work done in us, that we Periſh not, as thoſe of old: And in the Tender Love of Jeſus Chriſt I earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

you, let us no more look back upon our ancient Paſtimes and Delights but with holy Reſolution preſs on, preſs on); for they will ſteal away our precious Souls, beget new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, raiſe the old Life, and finally, enſnare and pollute our Minds again; and what will be the End of ſuch Rebellion, but <hi>Woes and Tribulations from the Hand of the Juſt God, World without end?</hi> Neither let us enter into many Reaſonings with Oppoſers; <hi>For that's the Life God's Power is revealed to ſlay with the Two-edged Sword;</hi> for 'tis the Still, the Quiet and the Righteous Life, which muſt be exalted over all. And this I ſay in a ſound Underſtanding, through the Mercies of the LORD, that <hi>Deadneſs, Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Anguiſh of Spirit,</hi> will be the End of ſuch Diſputing and Pragmatical <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whoſe Religion conſiſts much more in <hi>Words</hi> then <hi>Works, Confeſſing</hi> then <hi>Forſakings,</hi> and in their own <hi>Will-performances</hi> and <hi>External O! ſervations,</hi> then in the <hi>Reformation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of their Souls to God:</hi> And finally, we our ſelves, who have Known ſomething more of the Lord, may alſo reduce our good Conditions to an utter Loſs, by ſeeking to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Dubious Matters in our Underſtandings, and Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about them with every Oppoſer the Devil in a way of Temptation ſhall preſent to us; which does no way Advance our Growth and Encreaſe in the Noble Principle of Truth.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech you, <hi>My Dear Friends,</hi> Let not the Fear of any External Thing overcome the Holy <hi>Reſolutions</hi> we have made to follow the Lamb, Chriſt Jeſus, through all the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, Tryals</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> he and his Followers ever met withal; O! let us be Valiant in God's Cauſe on Earth, who have but a ſhort time and a few dayes to live.</p>
            <p>And let the Conſtancy of the World to the <hi>Momentary Faſhions, Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Pollutions</hi> of it, the more ardently ſtir

us up to expreſs ours, for the Honour of our God againſt them all, <hi>who will Reward us for whatſoever we bear, ſuffer or part withal on his Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, I beſeech you, Let neither <hi>Father nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Siſter nor Brother, Wife nor Child, Houſe nor Land, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties nor Life it ſelf,</hi> deter us from our Holy Conſtancy; but as the faithful Ancients did of old, <hi>through Deſarts, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes and ſolitary Places, in Goats-Skins and Sheep-Skins, endure all Torments and bitter Mockings in this Earthly Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, for the Inheritance which is Everlaſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, <hi>My Dear Friends,</hi> Let us do as we have them for our Example; however, let us be very careful to ſhew all due Reſpect to our Relations, not to be Exalted, nor any wayes Unruly, leſt there be juſt Cauſe taken againſt us, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Truth ſhould ſuffer; but in the <hi>ſtill, retired, holy</hi> and <hi>patient Life,</hi> this pure eternal Principle of Light and Truth (as ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and diligently waited on) certainly brings into, let us all dwell and abide, ſo ſhall we feel the Powerful Operations of God's Holy Spirit, to the more compleat redeeming of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed Souls from under the Dominion of Sin, and to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all of us a clearer Underſtanding and ſounder Judgment of thoſe things that are to be parted from (as, the <hi>Pleaſures, Cares</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the World, that ſtand in the faln Nature, and only nouriſh the ſame, but crucifie the Self-denying Lord of Glory), and of the Things of God, and his ſpiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which are to be adhered to, that in his pure Wiſdom, which is from above, we may all be kept and preſerved, over all the Snares and Temptations of the <hi>Adverſary,</hi> both on the Right Hand and on the Left.</p>
            <p>And as one that is a Travailer in this Way, I even Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech, Caution &amp; Admoniſh you all in the Holy Awe of God, That you never forbear Meeting &amp; Aſſembling of your ſelves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52321:4"/>
with the Holy <hi>Remnant,</hi> amongſt whom we firſt received our Bleſſed Convincement. O! forever let us Honour the Lord's Truth, and thoſe who do ſincerely profeſs the ſame, but more eſpecially, ſuch as were in Chriſt before us; for this is well-pleaſing unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>And let us beware of <hi>Lightneſs, Jeſting</hi> or a <hi>Careleſs Mind,</hi> which grieves the Holy Spirit, <hi>that ſtands ready to ſeal us unto the Day of our perfect Redemption;</hi> but let us be <hi>Grave, Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Temperate,</hi> keeping low in Body, as well as Mind, that in all things we may be Examples, and a Sweet Savour for the God who hath loved and called us.</p>
            <p>And <hi>My Dear Friends,</hi> Let us keep in the Simplicity of the Croſs of Jeſus, even in Plainneſs of Speech, and out of the World's <hi>flattering</hi> and <hi>deceitful Reſpects;</hi> for we are as well to be a Croſs in our <hi>Garbes, Gates, Dealings</hi> and <hi>Salutations,</hi> as <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> to this <hi>Vain, Adulterated</hi> and <hi>Apoſtatized Generation.</hi> So, in the pure Meaſure of Truth, that hath been manifeſted to every Particular, and has convinced us of the Unrighteouſneſs of the World, and the Vanity and Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of all its Profeſſions of <hi>God, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> O let us ſtand and abide! that we may feel it to be our Refuge and ſtrong Tower, when the Enemy ſhall approach, either by Inward Exerciſe, or Outward Bonds and Sufferings, which in all likelihood will ſuddenly overtake us, for the Tryal of our moſt precious Faith; ſo ſhall we ſenſibly experience that heavenly Blood of cleanſing to ſtream therefrom, <hi>which only can give Remiſſion, cleanſe from all Sin, and finally, purge the Conſcience from Dead Works, to ſerve the Living, Everlaſting, Holy God, Almighty, Lord of Hoſts, King of Nations, and King of Saints. And whatſoever things are</hi> True, <hi>whatſoever things are</hi> Honeſt, <hi>whatſoever things are</hi> Juſt, <hi>whatſoever things are</hi> Pure, <hi>whatſoever things are</hi> Lovely, <hi>and whatſoever things are
