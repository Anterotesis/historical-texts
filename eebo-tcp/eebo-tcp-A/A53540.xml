            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>By Rods and Axes had been kept in Awe;</l>

Great <hi>Iames</hi> who to his Throne does now succeed,</l>
               <l>And charg'd him tenderly his Flocks to feed;</l>
               <l>To guide them too, too apt to run astray,</l>
               <l>And keep the Poxes and the Wolves away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here, Painter, if thou canst thy Art Improve,</l>
               <l>And shew the wonders of Fraternal Love;</l>
               <l>How mourning <hi>Iames</hi> by fading <hi>Charles</hi> did stand,</l>
               <l>The Dying grasping the Surviving Hand;</l>
               <l>How round each others Necks there Armes they cast,</l>
               <l>Moan'd with endearing mur'mrings, and embrac't,</l>
               <l>And of their parting Pangs such marks did give,</l>
               <l>'Twas hard to guess which yet could longest live.</l>
               <l>Both their sad Tongues quite lost the pow'r to speak,</l>
               <l>And their kind Hearts seem'd both prepar'd to break</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here let thy curious Pencil next display,</l>
               <l>How round his Bed a beauteous Off-spring lay,</l>
               <l>With their Great Father's Blessing to be Crown'd,</l>
               <l>Like young fierce Lions stretcht upon the ground,</l>
               <l>And in Majestick silent Sorrow drown'd.</l>
            </lg>

This done, suppose the Ghastly minute nigh,</l>
               <l>And Paint the Griefs of the sad Standers-by;</l>
               <l>Th' unwearied Rev'rend Father's pious care,</l>
               <l>Off'ring (as oft as tears could stop) a Prayer.</l>
               <l>Of Kindred Nobles draw a sorrowing Train,</l>
               <l>Whose looks may speak how much they shar'd his pain;</l>
               <l>How from each Groan of his, deriving smart,</l>
               <l>Each fetcht another from a tortur'd Heart.</l>
               <l>Mingled with these, his faithfull Servants place,</l>
               <l>With different Lines of Woe in ev'ry Face;</l>
               <l>With down cast Heads, swoln Breasts, &amp; streaming Eyes,</l>
               <l>And Sighs that mount in vain the unrelenting Skyes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But yet there still remains a Task behind,</l>
               <l>In which thy readiest Art may labour find.</l>
               <l>At distance let the Mourning Queen appear,</l>
               <l>(But where sad News too soon may reach her Ear;)</l>
               <l>Describe her prostrate to the Throne above,</l>
               <l>Pleading with Pray'r the tender cause of Love:</l>
               <l>Shew Troops of Angels hov'ring from the Sky,</l>
               <l>(For They whene'er she call'd were always nigh)</l>
               <l>

Let them attend her Cries and hear her moan,</l>
               <l>With looks of beauteous sadness like her own,</l>
               <l>Because they know her Lord's great Doom is scl'd,</l>
               <l>And cannot (though she ask it) be repeal'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>By this time think the work of Fate is done,</l>
               <l>So any farther sad Description shun,</l>
               <l>Shew him not Pale and Breathless on his Bed,</l>
               <l>'Twould make all Gazers on thy Art fall Dead;</l>
               <l>And thou thy self to such a scene of woe</l>
               <l>Add a new Piece, and thy own statue grow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Wipe therefore all thy Pencils, and prepare</l>
               <l>To Draw a prospect now of clearer Air.</l>
               <l>Paint in an Eastern Sky new dawning Day,</l>
               <l>And there the Embrio's of Time display;</l>
               <l>The forms of many smiling years to come,</l>
               <l>Just ripe for birth, and lab'ring from their Womb,</l>
               <l>Each strugling which shall Eldership obtain,</l>
               <l>To be first, Grac't with Mighty <hi>Iames</hi> his Reign.</l>
               <l>Let the Dread Monarch on his Throne appear;</l>
               <l>Place too the charming Partner of it there.</l>
