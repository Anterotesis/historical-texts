            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

commend the reading of the Diſcourſe following; that ſo
beholding the 18 years War by Sea, which for want of
years you could not then remember; and comparing them with the 18 years
of Peace, in which you have lived, you may conſider three things. Firſt,
that after ſo many pains and perils God hath lent Life to your Father to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your Education. Secondly, what proportion his recompence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
have had to his Services. Laſtly, what juſt cauſe you have to abandon

follow the enſuing Precepts, which I commend to your often peruſal.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, I will put you in mind of the ſmall Means and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
I ſhall leave, that you may rate your Expences accordingly; and yet as
little as it is, 'tis great to me, in reſpect I attained to it by my own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and dangers, and therefore no body can challenge Intereſt in it but my
ſelf, though your Carriage may promiſe the beſt poſſibility.</p>
            <p>Beware you preſume not ſo much upon it, as thereby to grow diſobedient
to your Parents; for what you can pretend to, is but the privilege of two
years of age above your younger Brother; and in ſuch caſes Fathers are like
Judges, that can and will diſtinguiſh of offences and deſerts according to
truth, and will reward and puniſh as they ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
            <p>And becauſe you ſhall know it is no rare or new thing for a man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of his own, I will lay before you a Precedent of your own Houſe, that
ſo often as you think of it, you may remember it with fear, and prevent it
with care.</p>
            <p>The Great Grandfather of your Grandfather was a Knight by Title, and
<hi>John</hi> by name, which name we deſire to retain to our eldeſt Sons; God
bleſſed him with many earthly Benefits, as Wealth, Children, and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
his eldeſt Son was called <hi>John</hi> after his Father, and his ſecond <hi>William</hi>
like to your ſelf and Brother; but upon what diſpleaſure I know not, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we muſt judge the Son gave the occaſion) his Father left him the
leaſt part of his Fortune, though ſufficient to equal the beſt Gentleman of
his Shire, and particularly the ancient Houſe called after his name. His other
Son <hi>William</hi> he inveſted with what your Uncle now enjoys. Both the Sons
whileſt they lived carried the port and eſtimation of their Fathers Children,
though afterwards it fell out that the Son of <hi>John,</hi> and Nephew to <hi>William,</hi>
became diſobedient, negligent, and prodigal, and ſpent all his Patrimony;
ſo that in concluſion he and his Son extinguiſhed their Houſe, and there now
remains no memory of them. As for the ſecond Line and Race, of whom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94124:6"/>
your Uncle and I deſcended, we live as you ſee, though our Eſtates be not
great, and of the two mine much the leaſt; which notwithſtanding is the
greater to me in reſpect I atchieved it with the peril and danger of my Life;
and you will make my contentment in the enjoyment of it the greater, if it
be accompanied with that comfort I hope to receive from you.</p>
            <p>The next thing I will handle ſhall be Arms. Know that Wars by Land
or Sea are always accompanied with infinite dangers and diſaſters, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
rewarded according to Merit: For one Souldier that lives to enjoy
that Preferment which becomes his right by Antiquity of Service, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
fall by the Sword and other caſualties: And if you compare that of a
Souldier with any other Calling or Profeſſion, you will find much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
both in the reward and danger</p>
            <p>Although Arms have been eſteemed in all Ages, and the more as there was
greater occaſion to uſe them; yet you ſhall find they have been always ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to jealouſies and envy; Jealouſies from the State, if the General or other
Officer grow great and popular; ſubject to envy from Inferiors, who through
their perverſe and ill diſpoſitions malign other mens Merits.</p>
            <p>The Advancement of Souldiers is commonly made by Councellors at
home, whoſe eyes cannot witneſs the Services performed abroad; but a man
is advanced as he is befriended, which makes the Souldiers Preferment as
uncertain as his Life is caſual.</p>
            <p>Compare the eſtate and advancement of Souldiers of our time but with
the mean and mercenary Lawyer, and you ſhall find ſo great a difference,
that I had rather you ſhould become Apprentice to the one, than make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the other.</p>
            <p>A Captain that will ſeek to get the love of his Souldiers. as his greateſt
praiſe and felicity, of all other vices muſt deteſt and abandon Covetouſneſs;
he muſt live by ſpending as the Miſer doth by ſparing; inſomuch as few of
them can obtain by War wherewith to maintain themſelves in peace, and where
Wealth wants Preferment fails.</p>
            <p>Souldiers that live in peaceable Iſlands, as in <hi>England,</hi> their Profeſſion is
undervalued, becauſe we ſee not thoſe dangers which make the Souldiers
neceſſary, as others do where Wars are practiſed. And the good ſucceſs in
our Wars hath been ſuch as makes us attribute our Victories, not ſo much to
Valour as to Chance.</p>
            <p>I confeſs the baſe and ill behaviour of ſome Souldiers, hath made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their Callings the leſs eſteemed; for the name of a Captain, which
was ever wont to be honourable, is now became a word of reproach and
diſdain.</p>
            <p>Souldiers may have Reputation, but little Credit; Reputation enough
to defend their Honours, but little Truſt in Commerce of the World; and
not without cauſe, for their ſecurity is the worſe, by how much the danger
of death is the greater.</p>
            <p>Learning is as much to be preferred before War, as the trade of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
before that of the Factor. By Learning you are made ſenſible of the
difference betwixt Men and other Creatures, and will be able to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the good and the bad, and how to walk accordingly. By Learning
you attain to the knowledge of Heavenly Myſteries, and you may frame
your Life accordingly, as God ſhall give you grace. By Learning you are
made capable of Preferment, if it concur with Virtue and Diſcretion; and
the rather becauſe you are a Gentleman by birth, and of good Alliance,
which I obſerve next to Money in this Golden Age is the ſecond ſtep to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94124:6"/>
For one that is preferred by Arms, there are twenty by Learning; and
indeed the Souldier is but a Servant to the Learned, for after his many fought
Battels, and as many dangers of his Life, he muſt yield account of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and be judged, corrected, and advanced as it ſhall pleaſe the other.</p>
            <p>You may wonder to hear me extoll Learning ſo highly above my own
Profeſſion, conſidering the poor Fortune I ſhall leave was atchieved by
Arms; it is enough therefore to perſuade you what I ſay is not conjectural
but approved: for if I did not find this difference, the natural affection of a
Father to a Son would make me diſcover it to you, that you may follow that
which is moſt probable and profitable.</p>
            <p>Good Son, love Souldiers for your Countries ſake, who are the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it; for my ſake, who have made Profeſſion of it; but ſhun the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it as you will do Brawls, Quarrels, and Suits, which bring with them
perplexities, and dangers.</p>
            <p>There are many things to be ſhunned, as being perillous both to Body
and Soul; as Quarrels and occaſions of them, which happen through the
enormities and abuſes of our Age. Eſteem Valour as a ſpecial virtue, but
ſhun Quarrelling as a moſt deteſtable vice. Of two evils it were better to
keep company with a Coward than a Quarreller; the one is commonly ſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and friendly, the other dangerous in his Acquaintance, and offenſive to
Standersby. He is never free from peril, that is converſant with a Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
either for offence given to himſelf, or to others wherein he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
            <p>A true valiant man ſhall have enough to do to defend his own Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
without engaging for others: nor are all valiant that will fight, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Diſcretion makes a difference betwixt Valour and Deſperateneſs. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can happen more unfortunate to a Gentleman, than to have a Quarrel,
and yet nothing ſo ordinary as to give offence; it draweth with it many
miſchiefs both to Body and Soul: being ſlain he is danger of damnation, and
no leſs if he kill the other without great repentance. He ſhall perpetually
live in danger of revenge from the Friends of the Party killed, and fall into
the mercy of the Prince and Law where he liveth; but if for fear and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he avoid and ſhun a Quarrel, he is more odious living than he would be
unhappy in dying.</p>
            <p>Drinking is the foundation of other vices, it is the cauſe of Quarrels,
and then follows Murders. It occaſions Swearing, Whoredom, and many other
vices depend upon it.</p>
            <p>When you behold a Drunkard, imagine you ſee a Beaſt in the ſhape of a
Man. It is a humour that for the time pleaſeth the Party drunk, and ſo
bereaves him of ſence, that he thinketh all he doth delighteth the Beholders;
but the day following he buys his ſhame with repentance, and perhaps gives
that offence in his drunkenneſs, that makes him hazard both Life and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in a Quarrel. You have no man that will brag or boaſt ſo much of
the word Reputation as a Drunkard, when indeed there is nothing more to a
mans imputation than to be drunk.</p>
            <p>A Drunkard is in the condition of an excommunicated perſon, whoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
betwixt Party and Party is of no validity. Avoid (good Son) the
company of a Drunkard, and occaſions of drinking, then ſhall you live free
without fear, and enjoy your own without hazard.</p>
            <p>Whoredom is an incident to Drunkenneſs, though on the contrary all
Whoremaſters are not Drunkards. It is a ſin not waſhed away without the
vengeance of God to the third and fourth generation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94124:7"/>
Beſides the offence to God, it giveth a diſreputation to the party and his
Of-ſpring, it occaſioneth a breach betwixt Man and Wife, encourageth the
Wife oftentimes to follow the ill example of her Husband, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth
Diſlike, Divorce, Diſinheriting of Children, Suits in Law, and Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Eſtates.</p>
            <p>The next and worſt ſin I would have you ſhun is Swearing. I do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
you like a Puritan, that ties a man more to the obſerving of Sundays,
and from taking the Name of God in vain, than to all the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
but I wiſh you to avoid it for the greatneſs of the ſin it ſelf,
for the Plague of God hangeth over the Houſe of the Blaſphemer. Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is odious to the Hearers, it giveth little credit to the words of him that
uſeth it, it affordeth no pleaſure as other ſins do, nor yieldeth any profit to
the party; Cuſtom begetteth it, and Cuſtom muſt make one leave it.</p>
            <p>For your Exerciſes let them be of two kinds, the one of Mind, the other
of Body; that of the Mind muſt conſiſt of Prayer, Meditation, and your
Book; let your Prayers be twice a day, howſoever you diſpoſe of your ſelf
the reſt of the time; Prayers work a great effect in a contrite and penitent
Heart.</p>
            <p>By this I do not ſeek to perſuade you from ſuch Exerciſes and Delights of
body as are lawful and allowable in a Gentleman; for ſuch increaſe health
and agility of body, make a man ſociable in company, and draw good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintants;
many times they bring a man into favour with a Prince, and
prove an occaſion of preferment in his Marriage; they are often times a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
to a mans Life, as in vaulting ſuddenly upon a Horſe to eſcape an
Enemy.</p>
            <p>I will eſpecially commend unto you ſuch pleaſures as bring delight and
content without charge; for others are fitter for greater men than one of your
Fortune to follow.</p>
            <p>Hawking and Hunting, if they be moderately uſed, are like Tobacco, in
ſome caſes wholeſom for the Body, but in the common uſe both labourſom
and loathſom; they alike bring one diſcommodity, (as comonly Vices do)
that they are not ſo eaſily left as entertained.</p>
            <p>Tobacco is hot and hurtful to young Bodies and Stomachs, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the heat of the Liver, which naturally you are ſubject to. It is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to company, eſpecially the Breath of him that takes it; it drieth the
Brain, and many become Fools with the continual uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Let your Apparel be handſom and decent, not curious nor coſtly. A
wiſe man is more eſteemed in his plain Cloth than gay Clothing. It is more
commendable to be able to buy a rich Suit than to wear one. A wiſe man
eſteems more of a mans Vertues and Valour than of his Veſture; but ſeeing
this Age is fantaſtical and changeable, you muſt faſhion your ſelf to it, but in
ſo mean and moderate a manner, as to be rather praiſed for Frugality, than
derided for Prodigality.</p>
            <p>He that delights in curious Cloaths is an Imitator of a Player, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
his Apparel by the part he acts. And as Players appear upon the Stage
to be ſeen of the Spectators, ſo do the Gallants proclaim their Braveries in
open Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>Whileſt I live and you not marry, I ſhall temper this Expence; but when I
die remember what I ſay, ſeek Advancement rather by your carriage; the
curiouſneſs, the reputation you gain by that will be laſting, when this will
appear but like a Flower fading.</p>
            <p>Frame your Courſe of Life to the Country and not to the Court; and
yet make not your ſelf ſuch a ſtranger to great perſons, as in Aſſemblies they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94124:7"/>
ſhould ask others who you are. I confeſs the greateſt and ſuddeneſt riſing is by
the Court; yet the Court is like a hopefull and forward Spring, that is taken
with a ſharp and cold Froſt, which nips and blaſts a whole Orchard except
2 or 3 Trees; for after that proportion commonly Courtiers are preferr'd.
And he that will thrive at Court muſt make his dependency upon ſome great
perſon, in whoſe Ship he muſt imbarque all his hopes; and how unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſuch great perſons are oftentimes themſelves, and how unthankful to
their Followers, we want not Precedents.</p>
            <p>He that ſettles his Service upon one of them ſhall fall into the disfavour of
another; for a Court is like an Army ever in War, ſtriving by ſtratagems to
circumvent and kick up one anothers heels, You are not ignorant of the
aptneſs of this Compariſon by what you know of me, whoſe caſe will ſerve
you for a Proſpective-glaſs, wherein to behold your danger afar off, the
better to prevent it. Yet reverence Lords becauſe they are Noble, and one
more than another, as he is more notable in virtue.</p>
            <p>Be choice of your Company; for as a man makes election of them he is
cenſured: Man lives by Reputation, and that failing he becomes a Monſter.
Let your Company conſiſt of your own rank, rather better than worſe; for
hold it for a Maxim, The better Gentleman the more gentle in his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>Beware they be not accuſed of Crimes, for ſo it may touch you in Credit;
and if you loſe your Reputation in the bud of your Youth, you ſhall ſcarce
recover it in the whole courſe of your Life. Let them be civil in carriage,
for commonly ſuch men are ſenſible above all; let them be learned, for
Learning is a Fountain from whence ſprings another Life; let them be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in Diet and Expence, ſo ſhall you learn to live in health, and increaſe
in wealth.</p>
            <p>Beware they be not cholerick in diſpoſition, or arrogant in Opinion; for
ſo you ſhall become a Slave to their Humours, and baſe by ſuffering. A
cholerick man of all others is the worſt Companion, for he cannot temper his
rage, but on any ſlight occaſion of a Friend becomes an Enemy. Value
true Friendſhip next to Marriage, which nothing but Death can diſſolve;
for the fickleneſs of Friendſhip is oftentimes the ruine of ones Fortune.</p>
            <p>Beware of Gaming, for it cauſes great vexation of Mind. If you loſe, it
begets in you that humour, that out of hope of regaining your loſſes, you
will endanger the loſs of all. Do not preſume too much of your skill in
Play, or making wagers as if you were excellent above others, or have For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
at command; for ſhe is like a Whore variable and inconſtant, and when
ſhe disfavours you, it is with more loſs at once than ſhe recompenceth at
twice.</p>
            <p>Love your Brother and Siſters for their own ſakes, as you are bound by
Nature, but eſpecially for mine whoſe they are. Remember you are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to me, but that God choſe you from the reſt to be a ſtrength and
ſtay to them; think you cannot honor your Father more being dead, than
in ſhewing affection to them he dearly loved; and nothing will more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
you to be mine, than love and kindneſs amongſt your ſelves. You
owe ſomewhat more to me than that I am your Father, in that I ſeek your
Advancement above theirs, of which Obligation I will acquit you conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
you perform what you ought to them. For becauſe Man cannot
himſelf live ever, he deſires to live in his Poſterity; and if I had an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Sons, my greateſt hope muſt depend upon you as you are my eldeſt,
and ſeeing my care is of you above the reſt, do not make my Memory ſo
unhappy, as to give the World an occaſion to ſay, I left an unnatural Son.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94124:8"/>
The onely requeſt I make is, be kind and loving to them, who I know by
their diſpoſition will give you no cauſe of offence. A diſcourteſie from you
will be as ſharp to them as a Razor from another.</p>
            <p>Be courteous and friendly to all, for men are eſteemed according to ther
carriage. There is an old Proverb, <hi>The courteſie of the mouth is of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and coſts little.</hi> A proud man is envied of his Equals, hated by his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and ſcorned by his Superiours; ſo that betwixt Envy, Hate, and Scorn
he is friendleſs.</p>
            <p>Many times a man is condemned to death out of preſumption, eſpecially
when it concurrs with an opinion of his former ill carriage: how much
therefore doth it concern a man in the times of his Proſperity to lay up a ſtock
of Love and Reputation?</p>
            <p>There cannot be a greater Honour than to gain a mans Enemy by a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie;
it far exceeds the kindneſs that is done to another, and doubly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him that receiveth it. Love is a thing deſired by a King from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
by a General from his Souldiers, and by a Maſter from his Servants; he
that hath it is rich by it, it maintains peace in time of peace, and is a ſafe
Bulwork in time of war.</p>
            <p>Do not buy this Love with the ruine of your Eſtate, as many do with
prodigal Expences, and then are requited with pity and deriſion. Let
your Expence be agreeable to the wearing of your Cloaths, better or worſe
according to Company; or the journying your Horſe, the leſs way you go
to day, you may travel the further to morrow; but if you go every day a
long and weariſom Journey, your Horſe will fail, and you be enforc'd to go
on foot. And ſo will it be in your Expences, if you do not moderate them
according to Days and Companies, your Horſe and you may travel faintly
together.</p>
            <p>If you are prodigal in any thing, let it be in Hoſpitality, as moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the will of God, you ſhall feed the hungry, relieve the poor, and
get the love of the rich. What you ſpend among your Neighbours is not
loſt, but procures their loves and helps when you have need, and thereby
you ſhall find Friendſhip in the Country as available as Favour at Court.</p>
            <p>If you are called to any place of Magiſtracy, do juſtice with pity, revenge
not your ſelf of your Enemy under colour of Authority, for that ſhews
baſeneſs, and will procure you hatred. In Money matters favour your
Country, if it be not againſt the preſent profit of the King, for many times
his Name is uſed for the gain of other men.</p>
            <p>Study the Laws, not to make a mercenary practice of them, but onely
for your own uſe, the good of your Neighbours, and the Government of
your Country. Hold the Laws in reverence next to the King; for that
Kingdom is well governed where the King is ruled by the Laws, not the Laws
by the King.</p>
            <p>Be not preſumptuous in your Command, yet ſeek to be obeyed as you
deſire to obey; for as you are above others, others are above you. Give
your mind to accommodate Controverſies among your Neighbours, and you
ſhall gain their Love, which will more avail you than the hate of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
can hurt you.</p>
            <p>Puniſh Idleneſs and other vices, as well for that they are ſuch, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
ſake. Gain love by doing Juſtice, and hate doing wrong, though it
were to your immediate profit.</p>
            <p>If you marry after my death, chuſe a Wife as near as you can ſuitable to
your Calling, Years, and Condition; for ſuch Marriages are made in Heaven,
though celebrated on Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94124:8"/>
If your Eſtate were great, your choice might be the freer; but where the
preferment of your Siſters muſt depend upon your Wives Portion, let not
your Fancy overrule your Neceſſity. It is an old Saying, <hi>He that marrieth
for love hath evil days and good nights:</hi> Conſider if you marry for Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how long you will be raiſing Portions for your Siſters, and the miſery
you ſhall live in all the days of your life; for the greateſt Fortune that a
man can expect is in his Marriage. A wiſe man is known by his actions, but
where Paſſion and Affection ſway, that man is deprived of ſence and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>It is not the Poverty or Meanneſs of her that's married that makes her the
better Wife, for commonly ſuch Women grow elevated, and are no more
mindful of what they have been, than a Mariner is of his eſcape from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at Sea when it is paſt. You muſt ſet your Wife a good example by your
own carriage, for a wiſe and diſcreet Husband uſually makes an obedient
and dutiful Wife. Beware of Jealouſie, for it cauſeth great vexation of
mind, and ſcorn and laughter from your Enemies.</p>
            <p>Many times it is occaſioned by the behaviour of the Husband towards
other Women: in that caſe do like the Phyſician, take away the cauſe of the
infirmity, if not you are worthy to feel the ſmart of it. Jealouſie is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon conceit and imagination, proceeds from a weak, idle, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
Brain; and the unworthy carriage of him that is jealous, many times
maketh a Woman do what otherwiſe ſhe would not.</p>
            <p>If God be pleaſed to give you Children, love them with that diſcretion
that they diſcern it not, leſt they too much preſume upon it. Encourage
them in things that are good, and correct them if they offend. The love of
God to Man cannot be better expreſſed, than by that of a Father to his
Children. Comforts or Croſſes they prove to their Parents, and herein Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is a great help to Nature.</p>
            <p>Let your Children make you to diſreliſh and abandon all other delights
and pleaſures of the world, in reſpect of the comfort and joy you receive by
them. Make account then that Somer is paſt, and the melancholy Winter
approacheth; for a careful and provident Father cannot take delight in the
world and provide for his Children.</p>
            <p>For a concluſion I will recommend two principal Virtues to you, the one
is Secrecy, the other Patience. Secrecy is neceſſarily required in all, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
publick perſons, for many times they are truſted with things, the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof may coſt them their lives, and hinder the deſigns of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
It is a folly to truſt any man with a ſecret, that can give no aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the buſineſs he is truſted with. Councellors of State and Generals,
of Armies, of all other ought to be moſt ſecret, for their deſigns being once
diſcovered, their Enterprizes fail. Silence was ſo much eſteemed among the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> that ſhe was adored for a Goddeſs. The <hi>Romans</hi> kept their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions
ſo ſecret, as that alone was a principal cauſe of their Victories.
But of all others truſt not Women with a Secret, for the weakneſs of their
Sex makes them unſecret. Be patient after the example of <hi>Job,</hi> and you
ſhall become a true Servant of God. Patience deſerveth to be painted with
a Sword in her hand, for ſhe conquers and ſubdues all difficulties. If you
will take advantage of your Enemy, make him cholerick, and by patience
you ſhall overcome him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> being both Emperour and Philoſopher confeſſed, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not the Empire by Philoſophy but by Patience. What man in the
world was ever ſo patient as our Saviour himſelf, by following whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
his Miniſters have converted more by their words, then all the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94124:9"/>
Emperours could deterr by rigour or cruelty of Laws. The impatient
man conteſts with God himſelf, who giveth and taketh away at his good will
and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Let me (good Son) be your Patern of Patience, for you can witneſs with
me, that the Diſgraces I have unjuſtly ſuffered, (my Eſtate being through

in me, or altered my reſolution from my infancy; that is, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo baſe as to inſinuate into any mans favour, who was favoured by the

into the Sea with him.</p>
            <p>2. If any be killed on Land, the party to be buried alive with him killed.</p>

            <p>6. Whoſoever doth ſteal, ſhall have his Head ſhorn, and boiled Pitch poured upon
it, and Feathers ſtrewed upon the ſame, whereby he may be known; and at the firſt
Landing place he ſhall be towed on ſhore.</p>

               <p>UPon the knowledge of the Imbargo made by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in
<hi>Anno</hi> 1585, of the Engliſh Ships, Men, and Goods found in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
Her Majeſty having no means to help or relieve her Subjects by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Treaty, authorized ſuch as ſuſtained loſs by the ſaid Arreſt, to repair
themſelves upon the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and to that end gave
them Letters of Repriſal, to take and arreſt all Ships and Merchandizes that
they ſhould find at Sea, or elſewhere, belonging to the Vaſſals of the ſaid
King.</p>
               <p>Her Majeſty at the ſame time to revenge the wrongs offered her, and to
reſiſt the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Preparations made againſt her equipped a Fleet of 25
Sail of Ships, and imployed them under the command of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi>
as the fitteſt man by reaſon of his Experience and Succeſs in ſundry Actions.</p>
               <p>It is not my intent to ſet down all the particulars of the Voyages treated of,
but the Services done, and the Eſcapes and Overſights paſt, as a warning to
thoſe that ſhall read them, and to prevent the like Errors hereafter.</p>
               <p>This Voyage of Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> being the firſt undertaking on either
ſide, (for it enſued immediately after the Arreſt of our Ships and Goods in
<hi>Spain)</hi> I will deliver my Opinion of it, before I proceed any further.</p>
               <p>One impediment to the Voyage was, that to which the ill ſucceſs of divers
others that after followed, is to be imputed, <hi>viz.</hi> the want of Victuals and
other neceſſaries fit for ſo great an Expedition; for had not the Fleet by
chance met with a Ship laden with Fiſh, that came from <hi>New found Land,</hi> which
relieved their neceſſities, they would have found themſelves reduced to great
extremity.</p>
               <p>The Service that was performed in this Action, was the taking and ſacking
<hi>Sancta Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola, Cartagena</hi> in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and the <hi>Fonta aqua</hi>
in <hi>Florida;</hi> three Towns of great importance in the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> This Fleet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94124:10"/>
was the greateſt of any Nation but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that had been ever ſeen
in thoſe Seas ſince the firſt diſcovery of them; and if it had been as well
conſidered of before their going from home, as it was happily performed by
the Valour of the Undertakers, it had more annoyed the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> than
all other Actions that enſued during the time of the War.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems our long Peace made us uncapable of advice in War; for had
we kept and defended thoſe places being in our poſſeſſion, and provided to
have been relieved and ſuccoured out of <hi>England,</hi> we had diverted the war
from this part of <hi>Europe:</hi> for at that time there was no compariſon betwixt
the ſtrength of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> by Sea, by means whereof we might have
better defended them, and with more eaſe incroached upon the reſt of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could have aided or ſuccoured them.</p>
               <p>But now we ſee and find by experience, that thoſe places which were
then weak and unfortified, are ſince ſo ſtrengthened, as it is bootleſs to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
any Action to annoy the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in his <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though this Voyage proved both fortunate and victorious, yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
it was rather an awakening than a weakning of him, it had been far
better to have wholly declined it, than to have undertaken it upon ſuch ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
grounds, and with ſo inconſiderable Forces.</p>

               <p>HER Majeſty having received ſeveral Advertiſements, that while the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſilent, not ſeeking revenge for the injuries the Ships
of Repriſal did him daily upon his Coaſts, he was preparing an invincible
Army to invade her at home. She thereupon ſought to fruſtrate his deſigns,
by intercepting his Proviſions before they ſhould come to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which was
their place of Rendezvouz, and ſent away Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> with a Fleet
of 30 Sail great and ſmall, 4 whereof were her own Ships.</p>
               <p>The chief Adventure in this Voyage (beſides thoſe 4 Ships of Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties)
was made by the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> who ſought their private gain
more than the advancement of the Service; neither were they deceived of
their expectation.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> underſtanding by two Ships of <hi>Middleborough,</hi> that came
from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> of a Fleet with Victuals, Munition, and other habiliments for
War, riding there, ready to take the firſt opportunity of a wind, to go to
<hi>Lisbon</hi> and joyn with other Forces of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he directed his
courſe for <hi>Cadiz</hi> Road, where he found the Advertiſement he received from
this Ships of <hi>Middleborough</hi> in every point true; and upon his arrival at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
the Ships with great courage, and performed the Service he went
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94124:10"/>
for, by deſtroying all ſuch Ships as he found in Harbour, as well of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
as other Nations that were hired by them; and by theſe means he
utterly defeated their mighty Preparations which were intended againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that year 1587.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Service performed by him was, the aſſaulting the Caſtle of
<hi>Cape Sacre,</hi> upon the utmoſt Promontory of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and three other ſtrong
Holds; all which he took ſome by force, and ſome by compoſition. From
thence he went to the mouth of the River of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he anchored near
<hi>Caske Cadiz;</hi> which the Marqueſs of <hi>St. Cruze</hi> beholding, durſt not with his
Gallies approach ſo near as once to charge him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> perceiving, that though he had done important Service
for the State by this fortunate Attempt of his, yet the ſame was not very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the Merchants, who adventured onely in hope of Profit, and
preferred their private gain before the ſecurity of the Kingdom, or any other
reſpect. Therefore from <hi>Caske Cadiz</hi> he ſtood to the Iſlands of <hi>Tercera,</hi> to
expect the coming home of a <hi>Carreck,</hi> which he had intelligence wintered at
<hi>Moſambique,</hi> and conſequently ſhe was to be home in that moneth. And
though his Victuals grew ſcarce, and his Company importuned his return
home, yet with gentle Speeches he perſuaded, and ſo much prevailed with
them, that they were willing to expect the iſſue ſome few days at the Iſlands;
and by this time drawing near the Iſland of <hi>S. Michael,</hi> it was his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to meet and take the <hi>Carreck</hi> he looked for; which added more Honour
to his former Service, and gave great content to the Merchants, to have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Return of their Adventure, which was the thing they principally
deſired. This Voyage proceeded proſperouſly and without exception, for
there was both Honour and Wealth gained, and the Enemy greatly enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged.</p>

from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the 19th. day of <hi>May</hi> 1588, with the greateſt pride and glory,
and leaſt doubt of Victory, that ever any Nation did; but God being angry
with their inſolence, diſpoſed of them contrary to their expectation.</p>
               <p>The directions from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to his General were, to repair as
wind and weather would give leave, to the Road of <hi>Callice</hi> in <hi>Piccardy,</hi> there
to abide the coming of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> and his Army, and upon their
meeting to have opened a Letter directed to them both with further Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>He was eſpecially commanded to ſail along the Coaſts of <hi>Brittany</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
to avoid being diſcovered by us here; and if he met with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Fleet, not to offer to fight, but onely ſeek to defend themſelves. But
when he came athwart the North Cape, he was taken with a contrary wind
and foul weather and forced into the Harbour of the <hi>Groyne,</hi> where part
of his Fleet lay attending his coming. As he was ready to depart from
thence, they had intelligence by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fiſherman, whom they took
Priſoner, of our Fleets late being at Sea, and putting back again, not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their coming that year; inſomuch that moſt part of the Men belonging
to our Ships were diſcharged.</p>
               <p>This Intelligence made the Duke alter his Reſolution, and to break the
Directions given him by the King; yet this was not done without ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
for the Council was divided in their Opinions, ſome held it beſt to
obſerve the Kings Command, others not to loſe the opportunity offered to
ſurprize our Fleet unawares, and burn and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diego Flores de Valdos,</hi> who had the command of the <hi>Andaluſian</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
and on whom the Duke moſt relied, becauſe of his experience and
judgment, was the main man that perſuaded the Attempt of our Ships in
Harbour, and with that reſolution they directed their courſe for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Land they fell with was the <hi>Lizard,</hi> the Southermoſt part of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi>
which they took to be the <hi>Rams Head</hi> athwart <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and the
night being at hand they tacked off to Sea, making account in the morning
to make an Attempt upon our Ships in <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94124:11"/>
But whileſt they were thus deceived in the Land, they were in the mean
time diſcovered by Capt. <hi>Flemminge</hi> a Pyrat, who had been at Sea pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and upon view of them, knowing them to be the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
with all ſpeed to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and gave warning and notice to our
Fleet, who were then riding at Anchor; whereupon my Lord Admiral haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with all poſſible expedition to get forth the Ships, and before the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
could draw near <hi>Plymouth,</hi> they were welcomed at Sea by my Lord
and his Navy, who continued fight with them untill he brought them to an
Anchor at <hi>Callice.</hi> The particulars of the Fight, and the Succeſſes thereof,
being things ſo well known, I purpoſely omit.</p>
               <p>While this Armado was preparing, Her Majeſty had from time to time
perfect intelligence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Deſigns; and becauſe ſhe knew his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was to invade her at Sea with a mighty Fleet from his own Coaſt, ſhe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
out her Royal Navy under the Conduct of the Lord High Admiral of
<hi>England,</hi> and ſent him to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> as the likelieſt place to attend their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
as you have heard.</p>
               <p>Then knowing that it was not the Fleet alone that could endanger her
ſafety, for that they were too weak for any Enterprize on Land, without
the aſſiſtance of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and his Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> therefore
ſhe appointed 30 Sail of <hi>Holland</hi> Ships to lie at an Anchor before the Town
of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> where the Prince was to imbarque in Flat-bottom'd Boats, made
purpoſely for the Expedition of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus had the Prince by the Queens Providence been prevented, if he had
attempted to put out of Harbour with his Boats; but in truth neither his
Veſſels nor his Army were in readineſs, which cauſed the King ever after to
be jealous of him, and as 'tis ſuppoſed to haſten his end.</p>
               <p>Her Majeſty, notwithſtanding this her vigilant care to foreſee and prevent
all danger that might happen at Sea, would not hold her ſelf too ſecure of
her Enemy, and therefore prepared a Royal Army to welcom him upon his
Landing; but it was not the will of God that he ſhould ſet foot on <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ground, the Queen becoming Victorious over him at Sea, with little hazard
or bloudſhed of her Subjects.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed the Deſign of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the courſe taken by Her
Majeſty to prevent them; I will now collect the Errors committed as well
by the one as by the other, as I have promiſed in the beginning of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>As nothing could appear more rational and likely to take effect, after the
Duke had gotten intelligence of the ſtate of our Navy, than his deſign to
ſurprize them unawares in Harbour, he well knowing that if he had taken
away our ſtrength by Sea, he might have landed both when and where he
liſted, which is a great advantage to an Invader; yet admitting it had took
that effect he deſigned, I ſee not how he was to be commended in breaking
the Inſtructions given him by the King, what blame then did he deſerve,
when ſo ill an event followed by his raſhneſs and diſobedience?</p>
               <p>It was not the want of Experience in the Duke, or his laying the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Valdes,</hi> that excuſed him at his return; but he had ſmarted bitterly for it,
had it not been for his Wife, who obtained the Kings favour for him.</p>
               <p>Before th' Arrival of the Ships that eſcaped in this Voyage, it was known
in <hi>Spain,</hi> that <hi>Diego Flores de Valdes</hi> was he who perſuaded the Duke to break
the Kings Inſtructions; whereupon the King gave commandment in all his
Ports, where the ſaid <hi>Diego Flores de Valdes</hi> might arrive, to apprehend him;
which was accordingly executed, and he carried to the Caſtle of <hi>Sancta An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea,</hi>
and was never ſeen or heard of after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94124:12"/>
If the Kings Directions had been punctually followed, then had his Fleet
kept the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> and arrived in the Road of <hi>Callice</hi> before they had
been diſcovered by us, which might have endangered Her Majeſty and the
Realm, our Ships being ſo far off as <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where then they lay; and
thought the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had not been preſently ready, yet he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
time ſufficient by the abſence of our Fleet to make himſelf ready.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Prince was kept in by the 30 Sail of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Dukes Fleet might have been able to have put the <hi>Hollanders</hi> from
the Road of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and poſſeſt it themſelves, and ſo have ſecured the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and Fleets meeting together; and then how eaſie it had been after their
joyning to have tranſported themſelves for <hi>England?</hi> And what would have
enſued upon their Landing here may be well imagined.</p>
               <p>But it was the will of him that directs all men and their actions, that the
Fleets ſhould meet, and the Enemy be beaten as they were, put from their
Anchorage in <hi>Callice</hi> Road, the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> beleaguered at Sea, and
their Navy driven about <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> with great hazard and loſs;
which ſheweth how God did marvellouſly defend us againſt their dangerous
Deſigns.</p>
               <p>And here was opportunity offered us to have followed the Victory upon
them; for after they were beaten from the Road at <hi>Callice,</hi> and all their
hopes and deſigns fruſtated; if we had once more offered them fight, the
General by perſuaſion of his Confeſſor was determined to yield, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
'tis very likely would have made the reſt to have done the like. But
this opportunity was loſt, not through the negligence or backwardneſs of
the Lord Admiral, but merely through the want of Providence in thoſe that
had the charge of furniſhing and providing for the Fleet; for at that time of
ſo great advantage, when they came to examine their Proviſions, they found
a general ſcarcity of Powder and Shot, for want whereof they were forced
to return home. Another opportunity was loſt not much inferiour to the
other, by not ſending part of our Fleet to the Weſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> of neceſſity were to paſs after ſo many dangers and diſaſters as they
had endured.</p>
               <p>If we had been ſo happy as to have followed this courſe, as it was both
thought and diſcourſed of; we had been abſolutely victorious over this
great and formidable Navy, for they were brought to that neceſſity, that
they would willingly have yielded, as divers of them confeſs'd that were
ſhipwreck'd in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may ſee how weak and feeble the deſigns of Men are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Creator of Man, and how indifferently he dealt betwixt the two
Nations, ſometimes giving one, ſometimes the other, the advantage; and
yet ſo that he onely ordered the Battel.</p>

               <p>THE laſt overthrow of 1588 given to the Invincible Fleet, as they
termed themſelves, did ſo encourage every man to the War, as happy
was he that could put himſelf into Action againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the Voluntiers that went in this Voyage; which the Queen
(conſidering the great loſs the King of <hi>Spain</hi> received in the year paſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it was to be imagined how weakly he was provided at home) was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to countenance, though ſhe undertook it not wholly her ſelf, which
was the main cauſe of its ill ſucceſs and overthrow.</p>
               <p>For whoſoever he be of a Subject, that thinks to undertake ſo great an
Enterpriſe without a Prince's Purſe, ſhall be deceived; and therefore theſe
two Generals in my opinion never overſhot themſelves more, than in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
ſo great a charge with ſo little means; for where there are Victuals and
Arms wanting, what hope is there of prevailing?</p>
               <p>The project of this Voyage was to reſtore a diſtreſſed King to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
uſurped as he pretended; and though the means for the ſetting forth
of this Voyage was not ſo great as was expedient; yet in the opinion of all
men, if they had directed their courſe whither they intended it, without
landing at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> they had performed the Service they went for, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> diſſevered it from <hi>Spain,</hi> and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it in League with <hi>England,</hi> which would have anſwered the preſent
charge, and have ſettled a continual Trade for us to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and the
reſt of the <hi>Portugals</hi> Dominions, for ſo we might eaſily have conditioned.</p>
               <p>But the Landing at the <hi>Groyne</hi> was an unneceſſary lingering and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the other great and main deſign, a conſuming of Victuals, a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Army by the immoderate drinking of the Souldiers, which
brought a lamentable Sickneſs amongſt them, a warning to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
ſtrengthen <hi>Portugal,</hi> and (as great as all this) a diſcouragement to proceed
further being repulſed in the firſt Attempt.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the ill ſucceſs at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> they departed from
thence towards <hi>Portugal,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Penech,</hi> a Maritine Town twelve
Leagus from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where with a ſmall reſiſtance they took the Caſtle, after
the Captain underſtood <hi>Don Antonio</hi> to be in the Army.</p>
               <p>From thence General <hi>Norris</hi> marched with his Land Forces to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> with his Fleet ſailed to <hi>Caske Cadiz,</hi> promiſing from thence
to paſs with his Ships up the River to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to meet with Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi>
which yet he did not perform, and therefore was much blamed by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conſent of all men; the overthrow of the Action being imputed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94124:13"/>
It will not excuſe Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> for making ſuch a Promiſe to
Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> though, on the other hand, I would have accuſed him of
great want of Diſcretion, if he had put the Fleet to ſo great an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſo little purpoſe: For his being in the Harbor of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſignified
nothing to the Taking of the Caſtle, which was two Miles from thence;
and had the Caſtle been taken, the Town would have been taken of
courſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Ships could not furniſh the Army with more Men or Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als:
wherefore I underſtand not in what Reſpect his going up was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and yet the Fleet muſt have endured many Hazards to this little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>For betwixt <hi>Cask Cadiz</hi> and <hi>Lisbon,</hi> there are three Caſtles, St. <hi>John,</hi>
St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Bellin.</hi> The firſt of the three, I hold one of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
Forts to Sea-ward in <hi>Europe;</hi> and the Fleet was to paſs within
Calliver Shot of this Fort; though I confeſs, the paſſing it, was not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Dander: For with a reaſonable Gale of Wind, any Fort is to be paſsed
with ſmall Hazard.</p>
               <p>But at this time there was a General Want of Victuals; and being once
entred the Harbour, their coming out again was uncertain, the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſubject to contrary Winds: In the mean while, the better part of the
Victuals would have been conſumed, and they would have remained there
in ſo deſperate a Condition, as they would have been forced to have fired
one half of the Fleet, for the bringing home of the reſt: for being as they
were, yet after the Army was imbarqued for <hi>England,</hi> many died of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Homeward, and more would have done, if the Wind had took them
ſhort; or, if by the Death of ſome of them, the reſt who ſurvived had not
been the bettr relieved.</p>
               <p>And beſides all theſe Caſualties and Dangers, the <hi>Adilantado</hi> was then in
<hi>Lisbon</hi> with the Gallies of <hi>Spain;</hi> and how eaſily he might have annoyed
our Fleet, by towing Fire-ſhips amongſt us: We may ſuppoſe the Hurt we
did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Year before in <hi>Cadiz</hi> Road; and greater we had done
them, had we had the Help of Gallies.</p>
               <p>It was a wonder to obſerve every man's Opinion of this Voyage, as well
thoſe that were Actions in it, as others that ſtaid at Home; ſome imputing
the Overthrow of it, to the Landing at the <hi>Groyn;</hi> others to the <hi>Portugalls</hi>
failing us of thoſe Helps and Aſſiſtances which were promiſed by <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio;</hi>
and others, to Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi>'s not coming up the River with his
Fleet.</p>
               <p>Though any of theſe three Reaſons may ſeem probable enough, and the
Landing at the <hi>Groyn,</hi> the chiefeſt of the three; yet if we weigh truly the
Defect, and where it was, it will appear, that the Action was overthrown
before their ſetting out from Home, they being too weakly provided of all
things needful for ſo great an Expedition.</p>
               <p>For when this Voyage was firſt treated of, the Number of Ships was
nothing equal to the Proportion of Men: Wherefore they were forced to
make Stay of divers <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> which they met with in our Channel, and
compelled to ſerve in this Action, for the Tranſportation of our Souldiers;
and though theſe Ships were an Eaſe to our Men, who would have been
otherwiſe much peſtered for want of Room; yet their Victuals were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
augmented; but they were put aboard the Ships, like baniſhed men,
to ſeek their Fortunes at Sea, it being confeſſed, that divers of the Ships
had not four days Victuals when they departed from <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94124:13"/>
Another Impediment to the good Succeſs of this Voyage, was, the want
of Field-Pieces; and this was the main Cauſe why we failed of taking <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:</hi>
For the Enemies Strength conſiſting chiefly in the Caſtle, and we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only an Army to countenance us, but no means for Battery, we were
the Loſs of the Victory our ſelves: For it was apparent by Intelligence we
received, that if we had preſented them with Battery, they were reſolved
to parly, and by Conſequence to yield; and this too was made uſe of by
the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> as a main Reaſon why they joyned not with us.</p>
               <p>And there is as much to be ſaid on the <hi>Portugalls</hi> behalf, as an Evidence
of their good Will and Favor to us, that though they ſhewed themſelves
forward upon this Occaſion, to aid us, yet they oppoſed not themſelves as
Enemies againſt us: Whereas if they had purſued us in our Retreat from
<hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>Cask Cadiz,</hi> our Men being weak, ſickly, and wanting Powder,
and Shot, and other Arms, they had in all probability put us to a great
Loſs and Diſgrace. And if ever <hi>England</hi> have the like Occaſion to aid a
Competitor in <hi>Portugal,</hi> we ſhall queſtionleſs, find, that our fair Demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
and Carriage in this Expedition towards the People of that Countrey,
have gained us great Reconciliation among them, and would be of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Advantage to us: For the General ſtrictly forbad the Rifling of their
Houſes in the Country, and the Suburbs of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which he poſſeſs'd, and
commanded, juſt Payment to be made by the Souldiers for every thing they
took, without Compulſion, or rigorous Uſage: And this hath made thoſe
that ſtood but indifferently affected before, now ready upon the like Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to aſſiſt us.</p>

               <p>AS the Fleets of Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> returned from the
Voyage of <hi>Portugal,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> proceeded upon his, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that Coaſt,; and meeting with divers of that Fleet, relieved them
with Victuals, who otherwiſe had periſhed.</p>
               <p>This Voyage was undertaken at his and his Friends Charge, excepting
the <hi>Victory,</hi> a Ship Royal of the Queen's, which ſhe adventured.</p>
               <p>The Service performed at Sea, was the taking of three <hi>French</hi> Ships of the
League in our Channel, and his encountring upon the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> with
Thirteen Hulks, who made ſome Reſiſtance. Out of theſe he took to the
Value of 7000 <hi>l.</hi> in Spices belonging to <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence he croſſed over to the Iſland of <hi>Terceras,</hi> and coming to
St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> with Boats he fetched out two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships from under the
Caſtle, which the ſame Night arrived out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94124:14"/>
In this Courſe, from thence to <hi>Flores,</hi> he took a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship, laden with
Sugars and Sweet-meats that came from the <hi>Maderas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being at <hi>Flores,</hi> he received Intelligencence of divers <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, which
were in the Road of <hi>Fayal,</hi> whereupon he ſuddainly made from that Iſland,
where Captain <hi>Liſter</hi> and Captain <hi>Monſon</hi> gave a deſperate Attempt in
their Boats upon the ſaid Ships; and after along Fight poſſeſſed themſelves
of one of them of 300 Tuns Burden, carrying Eighteen Pieces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and Fifty Men. This Ship, with one other, came from the <hi>Indies,</hi>
two of the reſt out of <hi>Guiney,</hi> and another was Laden with Woad which
that Iſland affords in great Plenty; who putting from thence to Sea, and
coming to the Iſland of <hi>Gracioſa,</hi> after two days Fight, yielded us by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
ſome Victuals: Off that Iſland we likewiſe took a <hi>French</hi> Ship of
the <hi>League,</hi> of 200 Tuns, that came from <hi>New-found-land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, Sailing to the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of the Road of <hi>Terceras,</hi> in the Even-we
beheld 18 Tall Ships of the <hi>Indies,</hi> entring into the ſaid Road, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we after took in her Courſe to the Coaſt of <hi>Spain:</hi> She was laden with
Hides, Silver and Cochineal; but coming for <hi>England,</hi> ſhe was caſt away upon
the <hi>Mounts Bay</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> being valued at 100000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two other Prizes of Sugar we took in our ſaid Courſe to the Coaſt of
<hi>Spain,</hi> eſteemed each Ship at 7000 <hi>l.</hi> and one from under the Caſtle of St.
<hi>Maries</hi> to the ſame Value.</p>
               <p>There was no Road about thoſe Iſlands, that could defend their Ships
from our Attempts; yet in the laſt Aſſault we gave, which was upon a
Ship of Sugars, we found ill Succeſs, being ſharply reſiſted, and two parts
of our Men ſlain and hurt: Which Loſs was occaſioned by Captain <hi>Liſter,</hi>
who would not be perſuaded from Landing in the View of their
Forts.</p>
               <p>The Service performed by Land, was the taking of the Iſland of <hi>Fayall,</hi>
ſome months after the ſurprizing of thoſe Ships formerly mentioned. The
Caſtle yielded us 45 Pieces of Ordinance, great and ſmall: We ſacked and
ſpoiled the Town, and after ranſomed it, and ſo departed.</p>
               <p>Theſe Summer Services, and Ships of Sugar, proved not ſo ſweet and
pleaſant as the Winter was afterwards ſharp and painful: For in our Return
for <hi>England,</hi> we found the Calamity of Famine, the Hazard of Shipwrack
and the Death of our Men ſo great, that the like befell not any other Fleet
during the time of the War. All which Diſaſters muſt be imputed to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Liſter</hi>'s Raſhneſs, upon whom my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> chiefly relyed,
wanting Experience himſelf.</p>
               <p>He was the man that adviſed the ſending the Ships of Wine for <hi>England,</hi>
otherwiſe we had not known the Want of Drink; he was as earneſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
our Landing in the Face of the Fortifications of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> againſt
all Reaſon and Sence. As he was raſh, ſo was he valiant; but paid dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his unadviſed Counſel: For he was one of the firſt hurt, and that
cruelly, in the Attempt of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and afterward drowned in the Rich
Ship, caſt away at <hi>Mounts Bay.</hi>

               <p>FRom the Yeear 1585. untill this preſent Year 1590. there was the
greateſt poſſibility imaginable of enriching our Nation, by Actions at
Sea, had they been well followed; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was grown ſo weak
in Shipping, by the Overthrow he had in 1588, that he could no longer
ſecure the Trade of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>Her Majeſty now finding how neceſſary it was for her to maintain a
Fleet upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt, as well to hinder the Preparations he might
make againſt Her, to repair the Diſgrace he received in 1588. as alſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept
his Fleets from the <hi>Indies,</hi> by which he grew Great and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>She ſent this Year 1590. Ten Ships of her own, in two Squadrons; the
one to be Commanded by Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> the other by Sir <hi>Martin For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſher,</hi>
two Gentlemen of tried Experience.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> underſtanding of this Preparation of hers, ſent forth
20 Sail of Ships, under the Command of <hi>Don. Alonſo de Baſſan,</hi> Brother to
the late Famous Marqueſs of St. <hi>Cruz.</hi> His Charge was to ſecure home the
<hi>Indian</hi> Fleet and Carrecks.</p>
               <p>But after <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> had put off to Sea, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> becoming
better adviſed, than to adventure 20 of his Ships to 10 of outs, ſent for
<hi>Don Alonſo</hi> back, and ſo fruſtrated the Expectation of our Fleet.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe made a Diſpatch to the <hi>Indies,</hi> commanding the Fleets to
Winter there, rather than to run the hazard of coming Home that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
But this proved ſo great a Hind'rance and Loſs to the Merchants of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to be ſo long without Return of their Goods, that it cauſed many
to become Bankrupts, in <hi>Sevil</hi> and other places; beſides, which was ſo
great a weakening to their Ships, to Winter in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that many years
hardly ſufficed to repair the Damage they received.</p>
               <p>Our Fleet being thus prevented, ſpent ſeven months in vain upon the
Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Iſlands: but in that ſpace, could not poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of one Ship of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and the Carrecks, upon which part of
their Hopes depended, came Home without Sight of the Iſlands, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
ſafe at <hi>Lisbon.</hi>

This Voyage was a bare Action at Sea, though they attempted Landing
at <hi>Fayal,</hi> which the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> the year before had taken and

               <p>HER Majeſty underſtanding of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleets Wintering in the
<hi>Havana,</hi> and that Neceſſity would compell them home this Year
1591. ſhe ſent a Fleet to the Iſlands under the Command of the Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Howard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> perceiving her Drift, and being ſenſible how much
the ſafety of that Fleet concerned him, cauſed them to ſet out thence ſo
late in the Year, that it endangered the Shipwrack of them all; choſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hazard the periſhing of Ships, Men and Goods, than their falling
into our Hands.</p>
               <p>He had two Deſigns in bringing home this Fleet ſo late: One was, he
thought the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> would have conſumed his Victuals, and have
been forced Home. The other, that he might in the mean time furniſh
out the great Fleet he was preparing, little inferior to that of 1588. In
the firſt he found himſelf deceived: For my Lord was ſupplied both with
Ships and Victuals out of <hi>England;</hi> and in the ſecond, he was as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented:
For my Lord of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who then lay upon the Coaſt of
<hi>Spain,</hi> had Intelligence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> putting out to Sea, and adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> thereof, the very Night before they arrived at <hi>Flores,</hi>
where my Lord lay.</p>
               <p>The day after this Intelligence, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was diſcovered by my
Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> whom he knew by their Number and Greatneſs, to be the
Ships of which he had warning; and by that means eſcaped the Danger
that Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> his Vice-admiral raſhly ran into. Upon View
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which were 55 Sail, the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> warily, and like a
diſcreet General, weighed Anchor, and made Signs to the reſt of his Fleet
to do the like, with a purpoſe to get the Wind of them; but Sir <hi>Richard
Greenvile,</hi> being a ſtubborn man, and imagining this Fleet to come from
the <hi>Indies,</hi> and not to be the <hi>Armado</hi> of which they were informed, would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94124:15"/>
by no means be perſuaded by his Maſter, or Company to cut his main Sail,
to follow his Admiral; nay, ſo head-ſtrong and raſh he was, that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
violence to thoſe that councelled him thereto.</p>
               <p>But the Old Saying, that a wilful man is the Cauſe of his own Woe, could
not be more truly verified than in him: For when the <hi>Armado</hi> approached
him, and he beheld the Greatneſs of the Ships, he began to ſee and repent
of his Folly; and when it was too late, would have freed himſelf of them,
but in vain: For he was left a Prey to the Enemy, every Ship ſtriving to
be the firſt ſhould board him.</p>
               <p>This wilful Raſhneſs of Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> triumph as much as
if they had obtained a Signal Victory; it being the firſt Ship that ever they
took of Her Majeſties, and commended to them by ſome Engliſh Fugitives
to be the very beſt ſhe had; but their Joy continued not long. For they
enjoyed her but five days before ſhe was caſt away with many <hi>Spaniards</hi> in
her, upon the Iſlands of <hi>Tercera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Commonly one Misfortune is accompanied with another: For the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Fleet, which my Lord had waited for the whole Summer, the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this miſhap, fell into the Company of this <hi>Spaniſh Armado:</hi> who, if they
had ſtaid but one day longer, or the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet had come home but one
day ſooner, we had poſſeſt both them and many millions of Treaſure, which
the Sea afterward devoured: For from the time they met with the Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
and before they could recover home, nigh an hundred of them ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Shipwrack, beſides the <hi>Aſcention</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and the double Fly-boat, that
were ſunk by the ſide of the <hi>Revenge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which was occaſioned by their Wintering in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the late
Diſambogueing from thence: For the Worm which that Country, is ſubject
to, weakens and conſumes their Ships.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this croſs and perverſe Fortune, which happened by means
of Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> would not be diſmayed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
but kept the Sea ſo long as he had Victuals; and by ſuch Ships
as himſelf and the reſt of the Fleet took, defrayed the better part of the
Charge of the whole Action.</p>

and ſupplied the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with Munition, Victuals Shipping and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
againſt us.</p>
               <p>Upon my Lord's Arrival on the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> it was his hap to take
three Ships at ſeveral times, one with Wine, which he unladed into his
own; and two with Sugars, which he enjoyed not long: no more did he
the Spices, which he took out of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For one of the Ships of Sugar, by means of a Leak that ſprung upon her,
was forced to be caſt off, and the men, with much difficulty, recovered the
Shore, and ſaved their Lives.</p>
               <p>The other being ſent for <hi>England,</hi> and toſſed with contrary Winds, was
for want of Victuals forced into the <hi>Groyn,</hi> where they rend'red themſelves
to the Enemies mercy.</p>
               <p>The Spices were determined to be ſent for <hi>England,</hi> and a Ship appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that purpoſe, with other Ships to guard her; and Captain <hi>Monſon</hi>
was ſent on Board her to the Iſlands of the <hi>Burlings,</hi> with a Charge to ſee
her diſpatched for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the other Ships, not obſerving the Directions which were given them,
and the Night falling calm; early in the Morning, this ſcattered Ship
was ſet upon by ſix Gallies; and after a long and bloody Fight, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and the Principalleſt men being ſlain, both Ship and Spices were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
but whether it was the reſpect they had to the Queen's Ship which
was Admiral of that Fleet, or Honor to my Lord that commanded it; or
Hope, by good Uſage of our men, to receive the like again, I know not;
but true it is, that the ordinary men were treated with more Courteſie than
they had been from the beginning of the Wars.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> conſidering the Diſaſters that thus befell him,
and knowing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet's readineſs to put out of Harbor; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
finding his Ship but ill of Sail, it being the firſt Voyage ſhe ever went
to Sea, he durſt not abide the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> but thought it more Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to return for <hi>England,</hi> having (as you have heard) ſent a Pinnace to
my Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> with the Intelligence aforeſaid.</p>

SIR <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who had taſted abundantly of the Queen's Love,
and found it now began to decline, put himſelf upon a Voyage at Sea,
and drew unto him divers friends of great Quality, and others, thinking
to have attempted ſome place in the <hi>Weſt Indies;</hi> and with this reſolution
he put out of Harbour; but ſpending two or three days in fowl Weather,
Her Majeſty was pleaſed to command his Return, and to commit the Charge
of the Ships to Sir <hi>Martin Forbiſher,</hi> who was ſent down for that purpoſe;
but with an expreſs Command, not to follow the Deſign of the <hi>Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſuddain Alteration being known unto the reſt of the Captains,
for the preſent made ſome Confuſion, as commonly it happens in all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Actions. Their General leaving them, they thought themſelves
free in point of Reputation, and at liberty to take what courſe they pleaſed:
Few of them therefore did ſubmit themſelves to the Command of Sir <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Forbiſher,</hi> but choſe rather each one to take his particular Fortune and
Adventure at Sea.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> with two or three other Ships, repaired to the Coaſt of
<hi>Spain,</hi> where he took a <hi>Spaniard</hi> laden with Iron, and a <hi>Portugal</hi> with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
He remained there not without ſome danger, his Ship being ill of Sail,
and the Enemy having a Fleet at Sea.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Boroughs,</hi> Captain <hi>Croſs,</hi> and another, ſtood to the Iſlands, where
they met with as many Ships of my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s, with whom
they conſorted. After ſome time ſpent thereabouts, they had ſight of a
Carreck, which they chaſed; but ſhe recoverd the Iſland of <hi>Flores</hi> before
they could approach her; but the Carreck, ſeeing the Iſlands could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
her from the Strength and Force of the Engliſh, choſe rather, after
the men were got on Shore to fire her ſelf, than we the Enemy ſhould reap
Benefit by her.</p>
               <p>The Purſer of her was taken, and by Threats compell'd to tell of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Company behind, that had Order to fall with that Iſland;
and gave us ſuch particular Advertiſement, that indeed ſhe fell to be ours.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Alonſo de Baſſan</hi> was furniſhing at <hi>Lisbon</hi> 23 of thoſe
Gallions, which the Year before he had when he took the <hi>Revenge;</hi> he was
directed with thoſe Ships to go immediately to <hi>Flores,</hi> to expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Carrecks, who had order to fall with that Iſland, there to put
on Shore divers Ordnance for ſtrength'ning the Town and Caſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> breaking his Directions, unadviſedly made his repair firſt to
St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> and there delivered his Ordnance before he arrived at <hi>Flores;</hi>
and in the mean time one of the Carrecks was burnt, and the other taken,
as you have heard.</p>
               <p>This he held to be ſuch a Diſreputation to him, and eſpecially for that it
happened through his own Error and Default, that he became much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd,
and purſued the <hi>Engliſh</hi> 100 Leagues; but in vain, they being ſo
far a Head.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> being advertiſed of his two Carrecks miſhap, and the
Error of <hi>Don Alonſo,</hi> though he had much favoured him before, in reſpect
of divers Actions he had been in with his Brother, the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Cruz,</hi>
and for what he had lately performed, by taking the <hi>Revenge:</hi> Yet—
the King held it for ſuch a Blemiſh to his Honor, not to have his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
obeyed; and obſerved, that he did not only take from <hi>Don Alonſo</hi> his
Command; but he lived and died too in Diſgrace; which, in my Opinion,
he worthily deſerved.</p>

The Queens Adventure in this Voyage, was only two Ships; one of
which, and the leaſt of them too, was at the taking of the Carreck; which
title, joyned with her Regal Authority, ſhe made ſuch uſe of, that the
reſt of the Adventures were fain to ſubmit themſelves to her Pleaſure, with
whom ſhe dealt but indifferently.</p>

               <p>THE Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi> finding, that many of his Voyages had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
through the Negligence, or Unfaithfulneſs of thoſe who were

them; and arriving upon the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> He took two <hi>French</hi>
Ships of the <hi>League,</hi> which did more than treble the Expence of his Voyage.
My Lord, being one day ſevered from his Fleet, it was his hap to meet
with 12 Hulks, at the ſame place where Captain <hi>Monſon</hi> was taken the
ſame day two years before: He required that Reſpect from them that was
due unto Her Majeſties Ship, which they peremptorily refuſed, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
upon the Strength of their 12 Ships againſt one only; but they found
themſelves deceived: For after two hours Fight he brought them to his
Mercy, and made them acknowledge their Error; and not only ſo, but
they willingly diſcovered, and delivered up to him a great quantity of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Munition, which they carried for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Service.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> having ſpent ſome time thereabouts, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that <hi>Fervanteles de Menega,</hi> a <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the King's General of a
Fleet of 24 Sail, was gone to the Iſlands; he purſued them, thinking to
meet the Carrecks before they ſhould joyn together. At his coming to
<hi>Flores,</hi> he met, and took one of the Fleet, with the Death of the Captain,
who yet lived ſo long as to inform him both where the Fleet was, and of
their Strength: The day after, he met the Fleet it ſelf; but being far too

               <p>THeſe two Generals, preſuming much upon their own Experience and
Knowledge, uſed many Perſuaſions to the Queen, to undertake a
Voyage to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> giving much aſſurance to perform great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and promiſing to engage themſelves very deeply therein, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of both Subſtance and Life. And as all Actions of this Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94124:18"/>
fair, till they come to be performed, ſo did this the more, in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all Men, in reſpect of the two Generals Experience.</p>
               <p>There were many Impediments and Letts to this Voyage, before they
could clear themſelves of the Coaſt, which put them to greater Charge
than they expected; the chiefeſt cauſe of their Lingring, was a miſtruſt our
State had of an Invaſion, and the Danger to ſpare ſo many good Ships
and men out of <hi>England</hi> as they carried with them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> with their uſual ſubtilty, let ſlip no opportunity to put us
in amazement, thereby to diſſolve the Action; and ſent four Gallies to
<hi>Bleuret</hi> in <hi>Brittany,</hi> from thence to ſeize ſome part of our Coaſt, that ſo we
might apprehend a greater Force was to follow. Theſe Gallies landed at
<hi>Penſants</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where, finding the Town abandoned, they ſack'd
and burnt it; but this Deſign of theirs took little effect; for the Voyage
proceeded notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Intent of the Voyage, was to land at <hi>Nombre de dois,</hi> and from thence
to march to <hi>Panuma,</hi> to poſſeſs the Treaſure that comes from <hi>Peru;</hi> and if
they ſaw reaſon for it, to inhabite and keep it. A few days before their
going from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> they received Letters from her Majeſty, of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
ſhe had out of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet was arrived; and
that one of them, with loſs of her Maſt, was put room to the Iſland of
<hi>Porto Ricom.</hi> She commanded them, ſeeing there was ſo good an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
offered, as the readineſs of this her Fleet, and the weakneſs of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ricom,</hi> to poſſeſs themſelves of that Treaſure; and the rather, for that
it was not much out of their way to <hi>Nombre de dois.</hi> It is neither Years,
nor Experience, that can foreſee and prevent all miſhaps, which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Proof, that God is the Guider and Diſpoſer of Mens Actions: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could ſeem more probable to be effected, than this later Deſign, eſpecially
conſidering the Ability and Wiſdom of the two Generals; and yet was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
prevented, and failed in the Execution: For there being five Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
ſent out of <hi>Spain,</hi> to fetch this Treaſure from <hi>Porto Ricom,</hi> in their way
it was their hap to take a Pinnace of the Engliſh Fleet, by whom they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Secrets of the Voyage; and to prevent the Attempt of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ricom,</hi> they haſtened thither with all ſpeed (whilſt our Generals lingred
at <hi>Quadrupa,</hi> to ſet up their Boats) and at their Arrival, ſo ſtrengthened
the Town with the Souldiers, brought in the Prigats, that when our Fleet
came thither, not expecting Reſiſtance, they found themſelves fruſtrate of
their Hopes, which indeed they themſelves were the occaſion of, in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their Deſign with no more Secreſie. This Repulſe bred ſo great a
Diſconceit in Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> as it is thought to have haſtened his days;
and being great and unexpected, did not a little diſcourage Sir <hi>Francis
Drake</hi>'s great Mind, who yet proceeded upon his firſt reſolved Deſign, for
<hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> though with no better Succeſs: For the Enemy having
knowledge of their coming, fortified the Paſſage to <hi>Panuma,</hi> and forced
them to return with loſs. Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who was wont to rule For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
now finding his Error, and the difference between the preſent ſtrength
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and what it was when he firſt knew it, grew melancholly
upon this Diſappointment, and ſuddenly, and I hope naturally, died at
<hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> where he got his firſt Reputation. The two Generals dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all other Hopes being taken away by their Deaths, Sir <hi>Thomas
Baskervile</hi> ſucceeded them in their Command, and began now to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return for <hi>England;</hi> but coming near <hi>Cuba,</hi> he met and fought with
a Fleet of <hi>Spain,</hi> though not long, by reaſon of the Sickneſs and Weakneſs
of his Men. This Fleet was ſent to take the Advantage of ours in its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94124:18"/>
thinking, as indeed it happened, that they ſhould find them both weak,
and in want; but the ſwiftneſs of our Ships, in which we had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> preſerved us. You may obſerve, that from the year
the <hi>Revenge</hi> was taken, untill this preſent year 1595. there was no Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> furniſhed a Fleet for the guarding of his Coaſts,
and ſecuring of his Trade; and though there was little fear of any Fleet
from <hi>England</hi> to impeach him, beſides this in the <hi>Indies;</hi> yet becauſe he
would ſhew his greatneſs, and ſatisfie the <hi>Portugal</hi> of the care he had in
preſerving their Carrecks; he ſent the Count of <hi>Feria,</hi> a young Nobleman
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who deſired to gain Experience, with 20 Ships to the Iſlands;
but the Carrecks did, as they uſed to do in many other years, miſs both
Iſlands and Fleets, and arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſafely. The other Fleets of the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> conſiſted of 24 Ships, their General <hi>Don Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardino
de Villa nova,</hi> an approved Coward, as it appeared when he came
to encounter the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet; but his Defects were ſupplied by the Valor
of his Vice-admiral, who behaved himſelf much to his Honor: His Name
was <hi>John Garanay.</hi>

               <p>THE firſt of <hi>June</hi> 1596. we departed from <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and our Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was the more ſpeedy, by reaſon of the great pains, care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of the 16 Captains, who in their own Perſons, labored the Night
before, to get out ſome of their Ships, riding at <hi>Catwater,</hi> which otherwiſe
had not been eaſily effected. The Third, we ſet Sail from <hi>Canſom Bay,</hi> the
Wind, which when we weighed, was at <hi>Weſt</hi> and by <hi>South,</hi> inſtantly caſt
up to the <hi>North Eaſt,</hi> and ſo continued untill it brought us up as high as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94124:19"/>
the <hi>North Cape</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> and this fortunate beginning put us in great hopes
of a lucky Succeſs to enſue.</p>
               <p>We being now come upon our Enemies Coaſt, it behoved the Generals
to be vigilant in keeping them from Intelligence of us, who therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the <hi>Litneſs,</hi> the <hi>True Love,</hi> and the <hi>Lion's Whelp</hi> (the three chief
Sailors of our Fleet) to run a Head, ſuſpecting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſome Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of Advice out, which they did uſually ſend to diſcover at Sea, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Rumor of a leſs Fleet than this, was made ready in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Ship or Carvel eſcaped from us, which I hold a ſecond Happineſs to
our Voyage: For you ſhall underſtand hereafter, the Inconvenience that
might have happened upon our Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>The <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the ſaid three Ships, took three Fly-Boats that came
from <hi>Cadiz</hi> 14 days before; by them we underſtood the State of the Town,
and that they had no ſuſpition of us, which we looked on as a third <hi>Omen</hi> of
our good Fortune to come.</p>
               <p>The <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> a Ship of <hi>London,</hi> being commanded, as the
other three, to keep a good way off the Fleet, to prevent diſcovery, ſhe
met with a Fly-boat, which made Reſiſtance, and eſcaped from her. This
Fly-boat came from the <hi>Streights,</hi> bound Home, who diſcovering our Fleet,
and thinking to gain Reputation and Reward from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhhaped
her Courſe for <hi>Lisbon;</hi> but ſhe was luckily prevented by the <hi>John</hi> and
<hi>Francis,</hi> another Ship of <hi>London,</hi> commanded by Sir <hi>Marmaduke Darrel,</hi>
who took her within a League of the Shore; and this we may account a
fourth Happineſs to our Voyage. The firſt (as hath been ſaid) was for the
Wind to take us ſo ſuddainly, and to continue ſo long: For our Souldiers
being Shipped, and in Harbor, would have conſumed their Victuals, and
have been ſo peſter'd, that it would have endangered a Sickneſs amongſt
them. The Second, was the taking all Ships that were ſeen, which kept
the Enemy from Intelligence. The Third, was the intercepting of the Fly-Boats
from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> whither we were bound, who aſſured us, our coming
was not ſuſpected, which made us more careful to hail from the Coaſt than
otherwiſe we ſhould have been: They told us likewiſe of the daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the Gallions to come from St. <hi>Jacar</hi> to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and of the Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that lay there, and were ready bound for the <hi>Indies.</hi> Theſe Intelligences
were of great moment, and made the Generals preſently to contrive their
buſineſs both by Sea and Land, which otherwiſe would have taken up a
longer time, after their coming thither, and whether all men would have
conſented to attempt their Ships in Harbor, if they had not known the moſt
part of them to conſiſt of Merchants, I hold very doubtful. The Fourth,
and fortunateſt of all, was the taking of the Fly-boat by the <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
which the <hi>Swan</hi> let go: For if ſhe had reached <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſhe had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make report of the number and greatneſs of our Ships, and might
have endangered the loſs of the whole Deſign, ſhe ſeeing the courſe we
bore, and that we had paſſed <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which was the place the Enemy moſt
ſuſpected, and made there his greateſt preparation for Defence: But had the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
been freed of that doubt, he had then no place to fear but <hi>Andulozia</hi>
and <hi>Cadiz</hi> above the reſt, which upon the leſt warning might have been
ſtrengthened, and we put to great Hazard; he might alſo have ſecured his
Ships, by towing them out with Gallies; and howſoever the Wind had
been, might have ſent them into the <hi>Streights,</hi> where it had been in vain
to have purſued them, or over the Bar of St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> where it had been in
vain to have attempted them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94124:19"/>
And indeed, of the good and ill of Intelligence, we had had ſufficient
experience formerly, Of the good in 1588. For how ſuddainly had we
been taken and ſurprized when it we leſt ſuſpected, had it not been for
Captain <hi>Flemming?</hi> Of the ill in the year before this, by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Barque of Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi>'s Fleet, which was the Occaſion of the
Overthrow of himſelf and the whole Action?</p>
               <p>The <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> we came to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> earlier in the morning than the
Maſters made reckoning of. Before our coming thither, it was determined
in Council, that we ſhould land at St. <hi>Sebaſtians,</hi> the Weſtermoſt part of
the Land; and thither came all the Ships to an Anchor, every man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to land as he was formerly directed; but the Wind being ſo great,
and the Sea ſo grown, and four Gallies lying too, to intercept our Boats,
there was no attempting to land there, without the hazard of all.</p>
               <p>This day was ſpent in vain, in returning Meſſengers from one General to
another; and in the end, they were forced to reſolve upon a Courſe which
Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> Captain under my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> adviſed him to, the
ſame morning he diſcovered the Town; which was to ſurprize the Ships,
and to be poſſeſſors of the Harbor before they attempted landing.</p>
               <p>This being now reſolved on, there aroſe a great Queſtion, who ſhould
have the Honor of the firſt going in? My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſtood for himſelf;
but my Lord Admiral oppoſed it, knowing if he miſcarried, it would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the Overthrow of the Action; beſides, he was ſtreightly charged by
Her Majeſty, that the Earl ſhould not expoſe himſelf to Danger, but upon
great neceſſity.</p>
               <p>When my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> could not prevail, the whole Council withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him he ſent Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> that night, on Board my Lord Admiral,
to reſolve what Ships ſhould be appointed the next day to undertake the
Service. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> had the <hi>Vaward</hi> given him, which my Lord
<hi>Thomas Howard</hi> hearing, challenged in right of his place of Vice-admiral,
and it was granted him; but Sir <hi>Walter</hi> having Order over night to ply in,
came firſt to an Anchor; but in that diſtance from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as he could
not annoy them: And he himſelf returned on Board the Lord General <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi>
to excuſe his coming to Anchor ſo far off, for want of Water to go
higher; which was thought ſtrange, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> which drew much
more Water, and had no more Advantage than he of Tide, could paſs
where his could not: But Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> in the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to ſecond him, paſſing by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> his Ship, Sir <hi>Walter</hi>
the ſecond time, weighed and went higher. The Lord General <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who
promiſed to keep in the midſt of the Fleet, was told by Sir <hi>William Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
that the greateſt Service would depend upon three or four Ships; and
Sir <hi>William</hi> put him in mind of his Honor; for that many Eyes beheld
him.</p>
               <p>This made him forgetful of his Promiſe, and to uſe all means he could
to be formoſt in the Fight. My Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who could not go up in his
own Ship, the <hi>Mere-honor,</hi> betook himſelf to the <hi>Nonperil;</hi> and in reſpect
the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> the <hi>Repulſe</hi> and <hi>Warſpight,</hi> had taken up the beſt of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
by their firſt coming to an Anchor, to his grief he could not get high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Here did every Ship ſtrive to be the headmoſt; but ſuch was the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs
of the Channel, as neither the Lord Admiral, nor any other Ship
of the Queens could paſs on. There was Commandment given, that no
Ship ſhould ſhoot but the Queens, making account, that the Honor would
be the greater, if the Victory were obtained with ſo few. This Fight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finued
from Ten, till Four in the Afternoon: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> then ſet Sail,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94124:20"/>
thinking either to run higher up the River, or elſe to bring their other
Broad Sides to us, becauſe of the heat of their Ordnance; but howſoever
it was, in their floating, they came a ground, and the men began to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Ships: Whereupon there was Commandment given, that all the
Hoys, and Veſſels that drew leaſt Water ſhould go unto them. Sir <hi>William Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
was ſent in the <hi>Repulſe</hi> Boat, with like directions. We poſſes'd our ſelves of
the great Gallions, the <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the <hi>Andrew;</hi> but the <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi>
fired themſelves, and were burnt down before they could be quenched.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit to deſcribe the manner of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships and Gallies,
riding in Harbor at our firſt coming to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> The four Gallions ſingled
themſelves from out the Fleet, as Guards of their Merchants. The Gallies
were placed to flank us with their Prows before Entry; but when they
ſaw our Approach, the next morning the Merchants ran up the River, and
the Men of War of <hi>Port Royal</hi> to the Point of the River, brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a good Order of Fight, moving their Ships a Head and a Stern,
to have their Broad Sides upon us. The Gallies then betook themſelves to
the Guard of the Town, which we put them from before we attempted
the Ships.</p>
               <p>The Victory being obtained at Sea, the L. General <hi>Eſſex</hi> landed his men in
a Sandy Bay, which the Caſtle of <hi>Poyntull</hi> commanded; but they ſeeing the
Succeſs of their Ships, and miſtruſting their own ſtrength, neither offered
to offend his Landing, nor to defend the Caſtle; but quitted it, and ſo
we became Poſſeſſors of it.</p>
               <p>After my Lord's peeceable Landing, he conſidered what was to be done;
and there being no place from whence the Enemy could annoy us, but the
Bridge of <hi>Swaſoe,</hi> which leadeth over from the main Land to the Iſland; by
our making good of which Bridge, there would be no way left for the
Gallies to eſcape us. He ſent three Regiments under the Command of Sir <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers
Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blunt,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Garret</hi> to the Bridge;
who at their firſt coming were encountred by the Enemy, but yet poſſeſs'd
themſelves of it, with the loſs of ſome men; but whether it was for want
of Victuals, or for what other reaſons, our men quitted it, I know not,
and the Gallies breaking down divers Arches paſs'd it, and by that means
eſcaped.</p>
               <p>My Lord diſpatched a Meſſenger to my Lord Admiral, intreating him
to give Order to attempt the Merchants that rode in <hi>Port Royal,</hi> for that
it was dangerous to give them a Night's reſpite, leſt they ſhould convey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Wealth, or take example by the <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> to burn
themſelves. This Meſſage was delivered by Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhley,</hi> and Sir
<hi>William Monſon,</hi> as my Lord Admiral was in his Boat, ready with his Toops
of Seamen to land, fearing the Lord General <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould be put to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
with his ſmall Companies, which were but three Regiments, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all means to ſecond him, and gave order to certain Ships the next
day to purſue him.</p>
               <p>Seeing I have undertaken to ſhew the Eſcapes committed in any of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Voyages, ſuch as were committed here, ſhall without Fear or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
appear to the Judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>Though the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Carriage and Forwardneſs merited much,
yet if it had been with more Adviſement, and leſs Haſte, it would have
ſucceeded better: And if he were now living, he would confeſs, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Monſon</hi> adviſed him, rather to ſeek to be Maſter of the Ships, than of
the Town; for it was that would afford both Wealth and Honor: For the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94124:20"/>
Riches in Ships could not be concealed, or conveyed away as in Towns
they might. And the Ships themſelves being brought for <hi>England,</hi> would
be always before mens Eyes there, and put them in remembrance of the
greatneſs of the Exploit; as for the Town, perhaps it might be ſoon won,
but probably not long enjoyed, and ſo quickly forgotten: And to
ſpeak indifferentiy, by the Earl's ſuddain Landing, without the
Lord Admirals Privity; and his giving Advice by a Meſſage to attempt the
Ships, which ſhould have been reſolved of upon mature Deliberation, no
doubt, the Lord Admiral found his Honor a little Eclipſed, which perhaps
haſtened his Landing for his Reputation ſake, whenas he thought it more
adviſable to have poſſeſs'd himſelf of their Fleet.</p>
               <p>Before the Lord Admiral could draw near the Town, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
had entred it; and although the Houſes were built in that manner, as that
every Houſe ſerved for a Platform; yet they were forc'd to quit them, and
to retire into the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>My Lord at laſt, in deſpite of the Enemy, gained the Market place, where
he found greateſt Reſiſtance from the Houſes thereabouts; and where it
was that that Worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>John Wingfield</hi> was unluckily ſlain.
The Lord General <hi>Eſſex</hi> cauſed it to be proclaimed by Beat of Drum through
the Town, that all that would yield, ſhould repair to the Town-Houſe,
where they ſhould have promiſe of Mercy, and thoſe that would not, to
expect no Favor. The Caſtle deſired Reſpite to conſider untill the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
following; and then by one general Conſent, they ſurrend'red them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the two Lord Generals Mercies. The Chief Priſoners, Men and
Women, were brought into the Caſtle, where they remained a little ſpace,
and were ſent away with Honorable Uſage. The noble treating of the
Priſoners, hath gained an everlaſting Honor to our Nation, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
in particular.</p>
               <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed the Lord Generals had leiſure to be idle the day
following, having ſo great buſineſs to conſider of, as the ſecuring the Town,
and enjoying the Merchants Ships: Wherefore, for the ſpeedier diſpatch,
they had Speech with the beſt men of the City, about the Ranſom to be
given for their Town and Liberties, 120000 Duckets was the Summ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
on; and for Security thereof, many of them became Hoſtages. There
was likewiſe an Overture for the Ranſom of their Ships and Goods, which
the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> hearing of, rather than we ſhould reap any profit by
them, he cauſed them to be fired.</p>
               <p>We found by Experience, that the deſtroying of this Fleet (which did
amount to the value of ſix or ſeven Millions) was the general impoveriſhing
of the whole Country: For when the Pledges ſent to <hi>Sevil,</hi> to take up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for their Redemption; they were anſwered, that all the Town was not
able to raiſe ſuch a Summ, their Loſs was ſo great by the loſs of their Fleet.
And to ſpeak truth, <hi>Spain</hi> never received ſo great an Overthrow, ſo great a
Spoil, ſo great an Indignity at our Hands as this: For our Attempt was at
his own Home, in his Port, that he thought as ſafe as his Chamber, where
we took and deſtroy'd his Ships of War, burnt and conſumed the Wealth
of his Merchants, ſack'd his City, ranſomed his Subjects, and entred his
Country without Impeachment.</p>
               <p>To write all Accidents of this Voyage, wete too tedious, and would
weary the Reader; but he that would deſire to know the Behavior of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well as of us, many confer with divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> men that were
redeemed out the Gallies in exchange for others, and brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94124:21"/>
After we had enjoyed the Town of <hi>Cadiz</hi> a Fortnight, and our men
were grown rich by the Spoil of it, the Generals imbarqued their Army,
with an intent to perform greater Services before their Return; but ſuch
was the Covetouſneſs of the better Sort, who were inriched there, and
the fear of Hunger in others, who complained for want of Victuals, as they
could not willingly be drawn to any farther Action, to gain more Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The only thing that was afterwards attempted, was <hi>Pharoah,</hi> a
Town of <hi>Algarula</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> a place of no Reſiſtance or Wealth, only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
by the Library of <hi>Oſorius,</hi> who was Biſhop of that place; which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
was brought into <hi>England</hi> by us, and many of the Books beſtowed
upon the new erected Library of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Priſoners were taken; but of ſmall account, who told us, that the
greateſt Strength of the Country was in <hi>Lawguſt,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula,</hi>
twelve miles diſtant from thence; becauſe moſt part of the Gentlemen
thereabouts were gone thither, to make it good expecting our coming. This
News was acceptable to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who preferred Honor before
Wealth: And having had his Will, and the Spoil of the Town of <hi>Pharoah</hi>
and Country thereabouts: He Shipped his Army, and took Council of the
Lord Admiral how to proceed. My Lord Admiral diverted his courſe for
<hi>Lawguſt,</hi> alleadging the place was ſtrong, of no Wealth, always held in the
nature of a Fiſher-Town, belonging to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who in their Hearts were
our Friends; that the winning of it, after ſo eminent a place as <hi>Cadiz,</hi>
could add no Honor; though it ſhould be carried, yet it would be the
Loſs of his beſt Troops and Gentlemen, who would rather to die, than
receive Indignity of a Repulſe. My Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> much againſt his Will,
was forc'd to yield unto theſe Reaſons, and deſiſt from that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
               <p>About this time there was a general Complaint for want of Victuals;
which proceeded rather out of a deſire that ſome had to be at home, than out
of any neceſſity: For Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Darrel,</hi> were appointed
to examine the Condition of every Ship, and found ſeven weeks Victuals
(Drink excepted) which might have been ſupplied from the Shore in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and this put the Generals in great hope to perform ſomething more
than they had done. The only Service that was now to be thought on,
was to lie in wait for the Carrecks, which in all probability could not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
us, though there were many Doubts to the contrary; but eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by men of Experience: But in truth, ſome mens deſire home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
were ſo great, that no Reaſon could prevail with, or perſuade
them.</p>
               <p>Coming into the height of the Rock, the Generals took Council once
again, and then the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> offered
with great earneſtneſs, to ſtay out the time our Victuals laſted; and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to have but 12 Ships furniſhed out of the reſt to ſtay with them; but
this would not be granted, though the Squadron of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
voluntarily to ſtay. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> alleadged the ſcarcity of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
and the Infection of his Men. My Lord General <hi>Eſſex,</hi> offered, in
the Greatneſs of his Mind, and the Deſire he had to ſtay, to ſupply
his want of Men and Victuals, and to exchange Ships; but all Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
were in vain: For the Riches kept them that got much, from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more; as if it had been otherwiſe pure want, though not Honour would
have enforced them to greater Enterpriſes.</p>
               <p>This being the laſt Hopes of the Voyage, and being generally withſtood,
it was concluded to ſteer away for the <hi>North Cape,</hi> and afterwards, to view
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94124:21"/>
and ſearch the Harbors of the <hi>Groyn</hi> and <hi>Ferrol;</hi> and if any of the King
of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ships chanced to be there, to give an Attempt upon them.</p>
               <p>The Lord Admiral ſent a Carvel of our Fleet into theſe two Harbors,
and aparrelled the men in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloaths, to avoid Suſpicion. This Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
returned the next day, with a true Relation, that there were no Ships
in the Harbors: And now paſſing all places where there was any hope of
doing good, our Return for <hi>England</hi> was reſolved upon; and the 8th. of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Lord Admiral arrived in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with the greateſt part of
the Army: And the Lord General <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who ſtaid to accompany the St.
<hi>Andrew,</hi> which was under his Charge, and reputed of his Squadron, two
days after us, the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> where he found the Army in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Health, as the like hath not been ſeen, for ſo many to go out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to ſuch great Enterpriſes, and ſo well to return home again,</p>
               <p>He himſelf rid up to the Court, to adviſe with her Majeſty, about the
winning of <hi>Callis,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took the <hi>Eaſter</hi> before: Here was a
good opportunity, to have re-gained the Ancient Patrimony of <hi>England;</hi>
but the <hi>French</hi> King, thought he might with more eaſe re-gain it from the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was his Enemy, than recover it again from us, who were his
Friends.</p>
               <p>My Lord Admiral, with the Fleet, went to the <hi>Downs,</hi> where he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and left the Charge of the Navy, to Sir <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Monſon.</hi> In going from thence to <hi>Chatham,</hi> they endured more foul
Weather, and contrary Winds, than in the whole Voyage beſides.</p>

               <p>HER Majeſty having Knowledge of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s drawing down
his Fleet and Army to the <hi>Groyn</hi> and <hi>Ferrol,</hi> with an intent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into ſome Action againſt Her; and that, notwithſtanding the loſs of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94124:22"/>
thirty ſix Sail of his Ships that were caſt away upon the <hi>North Cape,</hi> in their
coming thither: He prepared with all poſſible means, to revenge the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
we did him the year laſt paſt at <hi>Cadiz.</hi> Her Majeſty likewiſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to defend her ſelf, and fitted out the moſt part of her Ships for the Sea;
but at length, perceiving his Drift was more to afright than offend her,
though he gave it it out otherwiſe, becauſe ſhe ſhould provide to reſiſt him
at home, rather than to annoy him abroad. She was unwilling the great
Charges ſhe had been at, ſhould be beſtowed in vain; and therefore turned
her Preparations another way, than that for which ſhe firſt intended
them.</p>
               <p>The Project of this Voyage, was to aſſault the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Shipping
in the Harbor of <hi>Ferrol,</hi> which the Queen chiefly deſired to do for her
own Security at home; and afterwards to go and take the Iſlands of <hi>Terce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi>
and there to expect the coming home of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet. But neither
of theſe two Deſigns took that effect which was expected: For in our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth, the ſame day we put to Sea, we were taken with a moſt violent
Storm, and contrary Winds; and the General was ſeperated from the Fleet,
and one Ship from another, ſo that the one half of the Fleet were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to return home, and the reſt that kept the Sea, having reached the
Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> were commanded home, by order of the Lord General.</p>
               <p>Thus after their return, they were to adviſe upon a new Voyage, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by their Ships and Victuals, they were unable to perform the former:
Whereupon it was thought convenient all the Army ſhould be diſcharged,
for the prolonging of the Victuals, except a thouſand of the prime Souldiers
of the Low Countries, which were put into her Majeſties Ships, that they
might be the better prepared, if they ſhould chance to encounter the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Fleet. Thus the ſecond time they departed <hi>England,</hi> though not
without ſome danger of the Ships, by reaſon of the Winter's near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p>The firſt Land in <hi>Spain</hi> we fell withal, was the <hi>North Cape,</hi> the place
whither our Directions led us, if we happened to loſe Company; being
there deſcried from the Shore, and not above 12 Leagues from the <hi>Groyn,</hi>
where the <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> lay. We were in good hopes to have enticed
them out of the Harbor to fight us; but ſpending ſome time thereabouts,
and finding no ſuch Diſpoſition in them, it was thought fit no longer to
linger about that Coaſt, leſt we ſhould loſe our opportunity upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Fleet; therefore every Captain received his Directions to ſtand his
Courſe into 36 Degrees, there to ſpread our ſelves <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a heighth that commonly the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſail in from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the Lord General complained of a Leak in his Ship; and
two days after, towards midnight, he brought himſelf upon the Lee to ſtop
it. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and ſome other Ships, being a head the Fleet,
and it growing dark, they could not diſcern the Lord General's Working;
but ſtood their Courſe as before directed; and through this unadviſed
working of my Lord, they loſt him and his Fleet.</p>
               <p>The day following, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was informed by a Pinnace he
met, that the great <hi>Armado,</hi> which we ſuppoſed to be in the <hi>Groyn</hi> and
<hi>Ferrol,</hi> was gone to the Iſlands, for the Guard of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet. This
Pinnace, with this Intelligence it gave us, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſent to look out the General. My Lord had no ſooner received this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but at the very inſtant he directed his Courſe to the Iſlands, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
ſome ſmall Veſſels to Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> to inform him of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Alteration of his Courſe, upon the News received from him, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94124:22"/>
him with all Expedition, to repair to <hi>Flores,</hi> where he would not fail
to be at our Arrival. At the Iſlands we found this Intelligence utterly
falſe: For neither the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships were there, nor were expected there:
We met likewiſe with divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, that came out of the <hi>Indies;</hi> but
they could give us no aſſurance of the coming home of the Fleet; neither
could we recive any Advertiſement from the Shore, which made us half in
deſpair of them.</p>
               <p>By that time we had watered our Ships, and refreſhed our ſelves at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> arrived there, who was willed by the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
after he was furniſhed of ſuch Wants as that poor Iſland afforded, to
make his repair to the Iſland of <hi>Fayal,</hi> which my Lord intended to take.
Here grew great Queſtions and Heart-burnings againſt Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh:</hi>
For he coming to <hi>Fayal,</hi> and miſſing the Lord General, and yet knowing
my Lord's Reſolution to take the Iſland, he held it more adviſable to land
with thoſe Forces he had, than to expect the coming of my Lord: For in
that ſpace the Iſland might be better provided: whereupon he landed, and
took it before my Lord's approach. This Act was held ſuch an Indignity
to my Lord, and urged with that Vehemence, by thoſe that hated Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
that if my Lord, though naturally kind, and flexible, had not feared
how it would have been taken in <hi>England,</hi> I think Sir <hi>Walter</hi> had ſmarted
for it.</p>
               <p>From this Iſland we went to <hi>Gracioſa,</hi> which did willingly relieve our
Wants, as far as it could; yet with humble intreaty to forbear landing with
our Army, eſpecially, becauſe they underſtood there was a Squadron of
<hi>Hollanders</hi> amongſt us, who did not uſe to forbear Cruelty wherever they
came; and here it was that we met the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, which in manner
following, unluckily eſcaped us.</p>
               <p>The Lord General having ſent ſome men of good Account into the Iſland,
to ſee there ſhould be no Injury offered to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> he having paſſed
his word to the contrary; thoſe men advertiſed him of four Sail of Ships
deſcried from the Shore, and one of them greater than the reſt, ſeemed to
be a Carreck: My Lord received this News with great Joy, and divided
his Fleet into three Squadrons, to be commanded by himſelf, the Lord
<hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh.</hi> The next Ship to my Lord, of
the Queen's, was the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> went, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
direction from my Lord to ſteer away <hi>South</hi> that Night; and if he
ſhould meet with any Fleet, to follow them, carrying Lights, or ſhooting
off his Ordnances or making any other Sign that he could; and if he met
with no Ships, to direct his Courſe the next day, to the Iſland of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael;</hi>
but promiſing that Night to ſend 12 Ships after him. Sir <hi>William</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
my Lord, by the Pinnace that brought him this Direction, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things he ſhould have a care to diſpatch a Squadron to the Road
of <hi>Angra</hi> in the <hi>Tercera's:</hi> For it was certain, if they were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> thither
they would reſort.</p>
               <p>Whilſt my Lord was thus contriving his Buſineſs, and ordering his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
a ſmall Barque of his Fleet happened to come to him, who aſſured
him, that thoſe Ships diſcovered from the Land, were of his own Fleet;
and that they came in immediately from them. This made my Lord coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand
his former Direction; only Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> who was the next
Ship to him, and received the firſt Command, could not be recalled back.
Within three hours of his Departure from my Lord, which might be about
12 of the Clock, he fell in company of a Fleet of 25 Sail, which at the firſt
he could not aſſure himſelf to be <hi>Spaniards;</hi> becauſe the day before, that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94124:23"/>
number of Ships was miſſing from our Fleet. Here he was in a <hi>Dilemma</hi>
and great perplexity with himſelf; for in making Signs, as he was directed,
if the Ships proved <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it were ridiculous, and he would be expoſed
to ſcorn; and to reſpite it untill morning, were as dangerous, if they
were the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet: For then my Lord might be out of View, or of
the hearing of his Ordnance: Therefore he reſolved rather to put his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
than his Ship in Peril. He commanded his Maſter to keep the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Gage
of the Fleet, whatſoever ſhould become of him; and it blowing
little Wind, he betook himſelf to his Boat, and rowed up with the Fleet,
demanding of whence they were: They anſwered, of <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> and
asked of whence he was? He told them of <hi>England;</hi> and that the Ship in
ſight was a Gallion of the Queen's of <hi>England,</hi> ſingle and alone, alleadging
the Honor they would get by winning her; his Drift being to draw and entice
them into the Wake of our Fleet, where they would be ſo entangled, as
they could not eſcape; they returned him ſome Shot, and ill Language;
but would not alter their Courſe to the <hi>Tercera's,</hi> whither they were bound,
and where they arrived to our misfortune. Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> returned
aboard his Ship, making Signs with Lights, and Report with his Ordnance;
but all in vain: For my Lord altering his Courſe, as you have heard, ſtood
that Night to St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> and paſſed by the North ſide of <hi>Tercera,</hi> a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, than if he had gone by the way of <hi>Augra,</hi> where he had met
the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet.</p>
               <p>When day appeared, and Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> was in hope to find the
12 Ships promiſed to be ſent to him, he might diſcern the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet two
miles and a little more a Head him, and a Stern him a Gallion, and a Pinnace
betwixt them; which putting forth her Flaggs, he knew to be the Earl of
<hi>Southampton</hi> in the <hi>Garland:</hi> The Pinnace was a Frigat of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet,
who took the <hi>Garland</hi> and the <hi>Rainbow</hi> to be Gallions of theirs; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Flag of the <hi>Garland,</hi> ſhe found her Error, and ſprang a loof, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ink
to eſcape; but the Earl purſued her with the loſs of ſome Time, when
he ſhould have followed the Fleet; and therefore was deſired to deſiſt
from that Chaſe by Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> who ſent his Boat to him. By a
Shot from my Lord, this Frigat was ſunk; and while his Men were rifling
her, Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> and Sir <hi>William Brook</hi> came up in their two Ships, who
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have made us believe were two Gallions of theirs; and
ſo much did my Lord ſignifie to Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> wiſhing him to ſtay
their coming up: for that there would be greater hope of thoſe two Ships,
which there was no doubt but we were able to Maſter, than of the Fleet,
for which we were too weak.</p>
               <p>But after Sir <hi>William</hi> had made the two Ships to be the Queen's, which
he ever ſuſpected them to be, he began to purſue the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet afreſh;
but by reaſon they were ſo far a Head of him, and had ſo little way to ſail,
they recovered the Road of <hi>Tercera;</hi> but he and the reſt of the Ships pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
them, and himſelf led the way into the Harbor, where he found ſharp
Reſiſtance from the Caſtle; but yet ſo battered the Ships, that he might ſee the
Maſts of ſome ſhot by the Board, and the men quit the Ships; ſo that there
wanted nothing but a Gale of Wind to enable him to cut the Cables of the
Hawſers, and to bring them off: Wherefore he ſent to the other 3 great Ships
of ours, to deſire them to attempt the cutting their Cables; but Sir <hi>Fra. Vere</hi>
rather wiſhed his coming off, that they might take a Reſolution what to do.
This muſt be rather imputed to want of Experience than Backwardneſs in
him: For Sir <hi>William</hi> ſent him word, that if he quitted the Harbor, the
Ships would tow near the Caſtle; and as the Night drew on, the Wind
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94124:23"/>
would freſhen, and come more off the Land, which indeed proved ſo, and
we above a League from the Road in the morning.</p>
               <p>We may ſay, and that truly, there was never that poſſibility to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the State of <hi>Spain</hi> as now: For every Royal of Plate we had taken in
this Fleet, had been two to them, by our converting it by War upon
them.</p>
               <p>None of the Captains could be blamed in this Buſineſs: All is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the want of Experience in my Lord, and his flexible Nature to
be over-ruled: For the firſt hour he anchored at <hi>Flores,</hi> and called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> adviſed him upon the reaſons following, after his
Watering, to run <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſpreading his Fleet <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> ſo far as the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wind that then blew would carry them; alleadging, that if the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Fleet came home that Year, by computation of the laſt light Moon,
from which time their diſimboguing in the <hi>Indies,</hi> muſt be reckoned, they
could not be above 200 Leagues ſhort of that Iſland; and whenſoever the
Wind ſhould chop up <hi>Weſternly,</hi> he bearing a ſlack Sail, they would, in a
few days overtake him.</p>
               <p>This Advice my Lord ſeemed to take, but was diverted by divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who coming principally for Land Service, found themſelves tired
by the tediouſneſs of the Sea. Certain it is, if my Lord had followed his
Advice, within leſs than 40 hours, he had made the Queen owner of that
Fleet: For by the Pilot's Card, which was taken in the Frigat, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Fleet was but 50 Leagues in traverſe with that <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wind, when my
Lord was at <hi>Flores,</hi> which made my Lord wiſh, the firſt time Sir <hi>William
Monſon</hi> repaired to him, after the Eſcape of the Fleet, that he had loſt his
Hand ſo he had been ruled by him.</p>
               <p>Being met Aboard Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> we conſulted what to do, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to acquaint my Lord with what had happened, deſiring his Preſence
with us, to ſee if there were any poſſibility to attempt the Shipping, or
ſurprize the Iſland, and ſo to poſſeſs the Treaſure.</p>
               <p>My Lord received this Advertiſement, juſt as he was ready with his
Troops to have landed in St. <hi>Michaels;</hi> but this Meſſage diverted his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and made him preſently caſt about for the Iſlands of the <hi>Tercera's,</hi>
where we lay all this while expecting his coming. In his Courſe from St.
<hi>Michaels,</hi> it was his hap to to take three Ships that departed the <hi>Havana</hi>
the day after the Fleet: Which three Ships did more than countervail the
whole Voyage.</p>
               <p>At my Lord's meeting with us at <hi>Tercera,</hi> there was a Conſultation how
the Enemies Ships might be fetched off, or deſtroyed as they lay; but all
men with one conſent, agreed the impoſſibility of it. The attempting the
Iſland was propounded; but withſtood for theſe reaſons, the difficulty in
Landing, the ſtrength of the Iſland, which was increaſed by fourteen or
fifteen Hundred Souldiers in the Ships, and our want of Victuals to abide
by the Siege. Seeing then we were fruſtrate of our Hopes at the <hi>Tercera,</hi>
we reſolved upon landing in St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> and arrived the day following at
<hi>Punta Delgada,</hi> the Chief City. Here my Lord imbarqued his ſmall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Boats, with offer to Land; and having thereby drawn the Enemies
greateſt Force thither to reſiſt him, ſuddainly he rowed to <hi>Villa Franca,</hi>
three or four Leagues diſtant from thence; which, not being defended by
the Enemy, he took. The Ships had order to abide in the Road of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gada;</hi>
for that my Lord made account to march thither by Land; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Shore at <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> he was informed that the March was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by reaſon of the high and craggy Mountains, which diverted his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94124:24"/>
Victuals now grew ſhort with us, and my Lord General began diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to foreſee the danger in abiding towards Winter upon theſe Coaſts,
which could not afford him an Harbor, only open Roads that were ſubject
to <hi>Southern</hi> Winds; and upon every Wind, he muſt put to Sea for
his ſafety. He conſidered, that if this ſhould happen, when his Troops
were on Shore, and he not able to reach the Land in a Fortnight or more,
which is a thing ordinary, what a deſperate caſe he ſhould put himſelf into,
eſpecially in ſo great a want of Victuals: And ſo concluding, that he had
ſeen the end of all his Hopes, by the Eſcape of the Fleet, he imbarqued
himſelf and Army, though with ſome difficulty, the Seas were now grown
ſo high.</p>
               <p>By this the one half of the Fleet that rid in <hi>Punta Delgada,</hi> put
room for <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and thoſe that remained behind, being thought by
a Ship of <hi>Brazile</hi> to be the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, ſhe came in amongſt them, and
ſo was betrayed: After her there followed a Carreck, who had been ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the like manner; but for the haſty and indiſcreet weighing of a <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
which made her run a Shore under the Caſtle; when the Wind
leſſened Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> weighted with the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> thinking to give
an Attempt upon her, notwithſtanding the Caſtle; which ſhe perceiving,
as he drew near unto her, ſhe ſet her ſelf on fire, and burned down to the
very Keel. She, was a Ship of 1400 Tuns Burden, that the year before
was not able to double the Cape of <hi>bona Eſperanſa,</hi> in her Voyage to the
<hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> but put into <hi>Brazile,</hi> where ſhe was laden with Sugars,
and afterwards thus deſtroyed. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who preſumed more upon
their Advantages than Valors, thought themſelves in too weak a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to follow us to the Iſlands, and put their Fortunes upon a days Service,
but ſubtilly deviſed how to intercept us as we came Home, when we had
leaſt Thought or Suſpicion of them; and their Fleet, that was all this while
in the <hi>Groyn</hi> and <hi>Ferrol,</hi> not daring to put forwards while they knew ours
to be upon the Coaſt, their General the <hi>Adelantada</hi> came for <hi>England,</hi> with a
Reſolution to land at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and fortifie it, and afterwards, with their
Ships, to keep the Sea, and expect our coming home ſcattered.</p>
               <p>Having thus cut off our Sea Forces, and poſſeſſing the Harbor of <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
they thought with a ſecond ſupply of 37 <hi>Levantiſco's</hi> Ships, which
the Marqueſs <hi>Arumbullo</hi> commanded, to have returned and gained a good
footing in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Deſigns of theirs were not foreſeen by us: For we came Home
ſcattered, as they made reckoning, not 20 in number together.</p>
               <p>We may ſay, and that truly, that God ſought for us: For the <hi>Adalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tada</hi>
being within a few Leagues of the Iſland of <hi>Silly,</hi> he commanded all
his Captains on Board him to receive his Directions; but whilſt they were
in Conſultation, a violent Storm took them at <hi>Eaſt,</hi> inſomuch that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
could hardly recover their Ships, but in no caſe were able to ſave
their Boats, the Storm continued ſo furious, and happy was he that could
recover home, ſeeing their Deſign thus overthrown by loſs of their Boats,
whereby their means of Landing was taken away. Some who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſtay, and receive the farther Commands of the General, kept the
Seas ſo long upon our Coaſt, that in the end they were taken; others put
themſelves into our Harbors for Refuge and Succor; and it is certainly
known, that in this Voyage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt eighteen Ships, the St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
and the St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> being two and in the rank of his beſt Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94124:24"/>
We muſt aſcribe this Succeſs to God only: For certainly the Enemies
Deſigns were dangerous, and not to be diverted by our Force; but by his
Will, who would not ſuffer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in any of their Attempts, to ſet
footing in <hi>England,</hi> as we have done in all the Quarters of <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi>
the Iſlands, and both the <hi>Indies.</hi>

               <p>I Cannot write of any thing done in this Year of 1599. For there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
greater Expectation of War, with leſs Performance. Whether it was
a Miſtruſt the one Nation had of the other, or a Policy held on both ſides,
to make Peace with Sword in Hand, a Treaty being entertained by conſent
of each Prince, I am not to examine; but ſure I am, the Preparation was
on both ſides very great, as if the one expected an Invaſion from the other;
and yet it was generally conceived, not to be intended by either; but
that ours had only relation to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was then in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and had a Deſign to try his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> and to be revenged of his
Enemies, as he pretended, and as it proved afterwards by his Fall: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it was, the Charge was not ſo great as neceſſary: For it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known, that the <hi>Adalantada</hi> had drawn both his Ships and Gallies
to the <hi>Groyne;</hi> which was not uſually done, but for ſome Action intended
upon <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> though he converted them after to another uſe,
as you ſhall hear.</p>
               <p>The Gallies were ſent into the Low Countreys, and paſs'd the Narrow
Seas, while our Ships lay there, and with the Fleet the <hi>Atalantada</hi> purſued
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to the Iſlands, whither he ſuſpected they were gone. This
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94124:25"/>
Fleet of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which conſiſted of 73 Sail, were the firſt Ships that
ever diſplayed their Colors in War-like ſort againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in any
Action of their own: For how cruel ſoever the War ſeemed to be in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they maintained a peaceable Trade in <hi>Spain,</hi> and abuſed us. This
firſt Action of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at Sea proved not very ſucceſsful: For after
the Spoil of a Town in the <hi>Canary's,</hi> and ſome Hurt done at the Iſland of
St. <hi>Ome,</hi> they kept the Sea for ſome ſeven or eight months, in which time
their General and moſt of their Men ſickned and died, and the reſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Loſs and Shame. Another Benefit which we received by this
Preparation, was, that our Men were now taught ſuddainly to Arme, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man knowing his Command, and how to be commanded, which before
they were ignorant of: and who knows not, that ſudden and falſe Alarms
in an Army, are ſometimes neceſſary? To ſay truth, the Expedition which
was then uſed in drawing together ſo great an Army by Land, and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
ſo great and Royal a Navy to Sea in ſo little a ſpace of Time, was ſo
admirable in other Coutreys, that they received a Terror by it; and
many that came from beyond Sea, ſaid, the Queen was never more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
abroad for any thing ſhe ever did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>French-men</hi> that came Aboard our Ships, did wonder (as at a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible)
that her Majeſty had rigged, victualled and furniſhed her Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Ships to Sea in 12 days time: And <hi>Spain,</hi> as an Enemy, had reaſon to
fear, and grieve to ſee this ſuddain Preparation; but more, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
how the Hearts of Her Majeſty's Subjects joyned with their Hands,
being all ready to ſpend their deareſt Blood for her and her Service. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
might likewiſe ſee, that if they became inſolent, we could be aſſoon
provided as they; not did they expect to find ſuch celerity in any Nation
but themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is probable too, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Duke, were
hereby drawn to entertain Thoughts of Peace: For as ſoon as our Fleet
was at Sea, a Gentleman was ſent from <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> with ſome Overtures, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for that time they ſucceeded not. However, whether it was, that
the intended Invaſion from <hi>Spain</hi> was diverted, or that her Majeſty was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfied of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> I know not; but ſo it was, that ſhe
commanded the ſuddain Return of her Ships from Sea, after they had layn
three weeks or a month in the <hi>Downs.</hi>

               <p>THE laſt Year, as you have heard, put all men in expectation of War,
which yet came to nothing. This Summer gave us great hope of
Peace; but with the like effect: For by conſent of the Queen, the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Duke, their Commiſſioners met at <hi>Bulloign</hi> in <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi>
to treat of Peace; a place choſen indifferently, the <hi>French</hi> King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94124:25"/>
in League and Friendſhip with them all. Whether this Treaty were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
but in ſhew only, or, that they were out of hopes, to come to any
concluſion; or, what elſe was the true and real cauſe of its breaking off
ſo ſuddenly, I know not; but the pretence was but ſlender, for there grew
a difference about Precedency, betwixt the two Crowns, though it was ever
due to <hi>England;</hi> and ſo the hopes of Peace were fruſtrated, though had it
been really intended, matters might eaſily have been accommodated.</p>
               <p>The Queen ſuſpecting the Event hereof, before their meeting, and the
rather, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entertained with the like Treaty, in 1588
when at the ſame inſtant, his Navy appeared upon her Coaſt to Invade her;
therefore, leaſt ſhe ſhould be guilty of too great ſecurity, in relying upon
the ſucceſs of this doubtful Treaty, ſhe furniſhed the Three Ships before
named, under pretence to guard the Weſtern Coaſt, which at that time was
infeſted by the <hi>Dunkirkers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe there ſhould be the leſs notice taken, part of the Victuals
was provided at <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon,</hi> who was then Admiral
of the Narrow Seas, was appointed General, for the more ſecret carriage of
the buſineſs; ſo as it could not be conjectured, either by their Victualling,
or by their Captain, being Admiral of the Narrow Seas, that it was a Service
from home. As they were in a readineſs at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> expecting Orders,
the Queen beingfully ſatisfied, that the Treaty of <hi>Bulloign</hi> would break off
without effect, ſhe commanded Sir <hi>Richard Lawſon</hi> to haſten to the Iſlands,
there to expect the Carrecks, and <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleet. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other
ſide, being as circumſpect to prevent a miſchief, as we were ſubtil to contrive
it; and believing (as we did) that the Treaty of Peace would prove a
vain, hopeleſs ſhew of what was never meant, they furniſhed Eighteen tall
Ships to the Iſlands, as they had uſually done, ſince the Year 1591. The
General of this Fleet was <hi>Don Diego de Borachero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Ships coming to the Iſlands, they and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had intelligence
of one another, but not the ſight, for that Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> hailed Sixty
Leagues Weſtward, not only to avoid them, but in hopes to meet with the
Carrecks, and <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleet, before they could join them: But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recks
being formerly warned by the taking of one of them, and burning of
another, in 1591. had ever ſince that year, endeavored to ſhun the ſight
of that Iſland, ſo that our Fleet being now prevented, as they had often
before been, (nothing being more uncertain, than Actions at Sea, where
Ships are to meet one another caſually) they returned home, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
time and Victuals, to no purpoſe, and ſeen not ſo much as one Sail,
from the time they quitted the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> till their return, two
Ships of <hi>Holland</hi> excepted, that came from the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> (for then began
their Trade thither) which Ships Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> relieved, finding them
in great diſtreſs and want.</p>

               <p>IN the Year 1600. and part of the Year 1601. there was a kind of ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Arms, though not by agreement, for this Year gave a hope of
Peace; which failing, the former courſe of annoying each other was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
we in relieving the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in aſſiſting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This was the Summer, that the Arch-Duke beſieged <hi>Oſtend,</hi>
which was bravely defended, but principally, by the Supplies out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And towards Winter, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought we leaſt looked
for War, <hi>Don Diego de Borachero,</hi> with 48 Sail of Ships, and 4000 Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
was ſent to Invade <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his way thither he loſt the company of his Vice-Admiral, <hi>Siriago,</hi> who
returned to the <hi>Groyn,</hi> which when the King heard, he was much diſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
with <hi>Siriago,</hi> and commanded him upon his Allegiance, to haſten with
all ſpeed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> as he was formerly directed; <hi>Don Diego,</hi> his Landing
being known in <hi>England,</hi> when it was too late to prevent it; yet, leaſt he
ſhould be ſupplied with further Forces, Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> valiantly entred
the Harbor, drew near their Fortifications, and fought the Enemy for the
ſpace of one whole day, his Ship being an Hundred times ſhot through, and
yet but Eight men ſlain. God ſo bleſt him, that he prevailed in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
deſtroyed their whole Shipping, and made <hi>Siriago</hi> fly by Land into
another Harbor, where he obſcurely Imbarqued himſelf in a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel,
for <hi>Spain.</hi> All this while was the main Army, which Landed with their
General, <hi>Don Juan de Aquila,</hi> ſeated in <hi>Kinſale,</hi> expecting the aid of <hi>Tyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi>
who promiſed every day to be with him. Our Army commanded by
the Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> beſieged the Town, ſo that he
prevented their meeting, and many skirmiſhes paſt betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The Siege continued, with great miſeries to both the Armies, and not
without cauſe, conſidering the Seaſon of the Year, and the condition of
the Country, that afforded little relief to either: ſome few days before
Chriſtmas, <hi>Tyroen</hi> appeared with his Forces, which was ſome little heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Enemy, in hopes to be freed of their Impriſonment, for ſo may
I call it, they were ſo ſtrictly beleagured. The day of agreement, betwixt
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Tyroen,</hi> was Chriſtmas Eve, on which day, there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Earthquake in <hi>England;</hi> and, as many times ſuch Signs prove <hi>aut bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
aut malum Omen;</hi> this proved Fortunate to us, the Victory being
obtained, with ſo little loſs, as it is almoſt incredible.</p>
               <p>This was the day of Tryal, whether <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould continue a parcel of
our Crown, or no; for if the Enemy had prevailed in the Battel, and a
Treaty had not afterwards obtained more then Force, it was to be feared,
<hi>Ireland</hi> would hardly have been ever recovered. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:94124:26"/>
ſeeing the ſucceſs of <hi>Tyroen,</hi> and the impoſſibility for him to re-inforce his
Army, being hopeleſs of ſupplies out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their Poverty daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing,
they made offers of a Parly, which was granted, and after enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Peace there: The Conditions whereof are extant in Print. They
were furniſhed with Ships, and ſecured of their Paſſage into <hi>Spain,</hi> where
arriving in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels, the Ships returned back for <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THE laſt Attempt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> awakened the Queen,
who, it ſeemeth for two or three Years together, entertained the
Hopes of Peace, and therefore was ſparing in ſetting forth her Fleets. But
now perceiving the Enemy had found the way into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it
behoved her to be more vigilant than ever; ſhe reſolved, as the ſafeſt courſe
to infeſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſts with a continual Fleet; and in this year furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Ships aforeſaid, having Promiſe from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> to joyn
to them twelve Sail of theirs; and becauſe this important Service required
great ſpeed, ſhe had not time enough to man them, or ſupply them with
Proviſions altogether ſo well as they were uſually wont to be; but was
content with what could be gotten in ſo ſhort a warning, ſo deſirous was
ſhe to ſee her Ships at Sea.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> ſet ſail with five of them the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and left
Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> behind with the other four, to attend the coming of the
<hi>Hollanders;</hi> though within two or three days after, Sir <hi>William</hi> received
Command from the Queen, to haſten with all ſpeed to Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon;</hi>
for that ſhe was advertiſed, that the Silver Ships were arrived at the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera's.</hi>
Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> hereupon neglected no time, nor ſtayed either
to ſee himſelf better Manned, or his Ships better furniſhed; but put to Sea
the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Intelligence of the Queen's was true: For the Plate Fleet had been
at the <hi>Tercera's,</hi> and departing from thence, in their Courſe for <hi>Spain,</hi> Sir
<hi>Richard Lewſon,</hi> with his few Ships, met them; but to little purpoſe, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reſt of his Fleet, and the help of the 12 <hi>Hollanders.</hi> We may very
well account this not the leaſt Error or Negligence that hath been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our Voyages: For if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had kept touch according to
Promiſe, and the Queen's Ships had been fitted out with Care, we had
made her Majeſty Miſtreſs of more Treaſure than any of her Progenitors e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enjoyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:94124:27"/>
Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi>'s Deſign againſt the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, notwithſtanding
his Renowned Valor, being thus fruſtrated, and by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
croſſed, he plied towards the Rock, to meet Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> as
the place reſolved on between them; but Sir <hi>William</hi> having ſpent 14 days
thereabouts, and hearing no Tidings of him, went round to the <hi>Southward
Cape,</hi> where he was likewiſe fruſtrated of a moſt promiſing Hope: For meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with certain <hi>French-men</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> at the ſame inſtant, he deſcried
three Ships of ours, ſent by Sir <hi>Richard</hi> to look him. Theſe <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Scottiſh</hi> Ships came from St. <hi>Lucas,</hi> and made report of five Gallions, ready
the next Tide to ſet ſail for the <hi>Indies:</hi> They likewiſe told him of two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that departed three days before, wherein went <hi>Don Petro de Valdes,</hi>
to be Governor of the <hi>Havana,</hi> who had ſometimes been Priſoner in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two later Ships were met one Night by the <hi>Warſpight,</hi> whereof
Capt. <hi>Sommers</hi> was Conmander; but whether it was by the Darkneſs of
the Night, or by what other Caſualty (for the Sea is ſubject to many) I
know not, but they eſcaped.</p>
               <p>This News of the five Gallions, and the three Ships of the Queen's ſo
happily meeting together, made Sir <hi>William</hi> direct his Courſe into the
heighth wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were moſt likely to ſail in; and coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that heighth, he had ſight of five Ships, which in reſpect of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Courſe, he made reckoning to be the five Gallions; and thought
that day ſhould fully determine and try the difference between the Strength
and Puiſſance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, their number and greatneſs
being equal: But his Joy was ſoon quailed: For coming up with them, he
found them to be <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships coming out of the <hi>Streights,</hi> and bound home;
but yet this did not diſcourage the Hope he had conceived that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
might be met withall; and the next day he gave Chaſe to one Ship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
that came out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which he took, though he had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without her: For ſhe brought him ſo far to Leeward, that that Night
the Gallions paſſed to Wind-ward, not above eight or ten Leagues off us,
by report of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pinnace that met them, who came into our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the day following. Theſe Misfortunes lighting firſt upon Sir <hi>Richard,</hi>
and after upon Sir <hi>William,</hi> might have been ſufficient Reaſons to diſcourage
them; but they knowing the Accidents of the Sea, and that Fortune could
as well laugh as weep, having good Ships under foot, their Men ſound and
in health, and plenty of Victuals, they did not doubt but that ſome of
the Wealth which the <hi>Indies</hi> ſent forth into <hi>Spain</hi> would fall to their
Shares.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> to begin our new Fortune with a new
Month, Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> and Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> who ſome few Nights
before had met accidentally in the Sea, were cloſe on board the Rock,
where they took two Ships of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Country, bound for <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and
while they were romaging theſe Ships, they deſcried a Carvel from <hi>Cape
Picher</hi> bearing with them; which by Signs ſhe made, they perceived had a
deſire to ſpeak with them. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> immediately chaſed her, and left
Sir <hi>William</hi> with the two <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> to abide about the Rock till his return.
The Carvel being fetcht up, made a relation of a Carreck and 11 Gallies
to be in <hi>Ciſembre</hi> Road; and that ſhe was ſent by two Ships of ours, the
<hi>Nonperil</hi> and the <hi>Dreadnought</hi> which lay thereabouts to look out the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
With what Joy this News was apprehended may be eaſily imagined:
Sir <hi>Richard</hi> made Signs to Sir <hi>William</hi> to ſtand with him; and leſt he ſhould
not be diſcerned, he cauſed the Carvel to ply up with him, wiſhing him
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94124:27"/>
to repair to him; but before they could approach the <hi>Cape,</hi> it was midnight,
and nothing chanced all that time, but the exchanging of ſome Shot, that
paſſed betwixt the Admiral and the Gallies.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>June,</hi> every man looked early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what Ships of her Majeſties were in ſight, which were five in number,
the <hi>Warſpight,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was: For the <hi>Repulſe</hi> he had ſent for
<hi>England</hi> ſome few days before, by reaſon of a Leak; the <hi>Garland,</hi> the <hi>Nonpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi>
the <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> and the <hi>Adventure,</hi> beſides the two <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> taken
the day before. All the Captains reſorted on Board the Admiral, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
which took up moſt part of the day. At firſt there was an Oppoſition
by ſome, who alleadged the Danger and Impoſſibility of taking the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reck,
being defended by the Caſtle and 11 Gallies: But Sir <hi>William Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
prevailed ſo far, as that all conſented to go upon her the next day, and
concluded upon this Courſe following, that he and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
as near the Carreck as they could, the reſt to ply up and down, and
not anchor. Sir <hi>William</hi> was glad of this occaſion, to be revenged of the
Gallies, hoping to requite the Slavery they put him to when he was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in them; and ſingled himſelf from the Fleet a League, that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
might ſee it was in defiance of them; and ſo the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Cruz,</hi>
and <hi>Frederick Spaniola,</hi> the one General of the <hi>Portugal,</hi> the other of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies, apprehended it, and came forth with an intent to fight him;
but being within Shot, were diverted by one <hi>John Bedford</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi>
who undertook to know the Force of the Ship, and Sir <hi>William</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her. Before I go farther, I will a little digreſs, and acquaint you
with the Scituation of the Town, and the manner of placing the Gallies
againſt us. The Town of <hi>Ciſembre</hi> lieth in the bottom of a Road, which
is a good Succor for Ships with a <hi>Northerly</hi> Wind. It is built with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
and near the Sea is erected a ſtrong and ſpacious Fort, well reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with Ordnance: Above the Town, upon the top of a Hill, is ſeated
an ancient, ſtrong Fryery, whoſe Scituation maketh it impregnable, and
able to command the Town, Caſtle and Road; cloſe to the Shore lay the
Carreck, like a Bullwork to the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide of the Caſtle; ſo as it defended
both that, and the <hi>Eaſt</hi> part of the Town: The 11 Gallies had flancked
and fortified themſelves with the ſmall Neck of a Rock on the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide of
the Road, with their Prows right forward, to play upon us, every one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a Cannon in their <hi>Cruzia,</hi> beſides other Pieces in their Prows; and
they were no way to be damaged by us, till our Ships came ſo nigh the
Town, that all theſe Forces might play upon us in one inſtant.</p>
               <p>The Gallies being placed to this great Advantage, they made account
(as a Captain of one of them we took confeſs'd) to have ſunk our Ships
of themſelves, without any farther Help. We ſaw the Tents pitched, and
great Troops of Souldiers drawn together; which was no leſs than the whole
Country in Arms againſt us: The Boats paſs'd betwixt the Shore and the
Carreck all the day long, which we ſuppoſed was to unlade her; but we
found afterwards it was rather to ſtrengthen her with Men and Munition:
Here appeared many Difficulties and Dangers, and little hope of taking her;
but rather of ſinking or burning her, as moſt men conjectured. The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the Gallies was great, they being flancked with the point of a
Rock at our Entrance, as you have heard, it being likewiſe calm, and they
ſhooting low: Another Danger was, that of the Wind: For if it had come
from the Sea, the Road being open, and the Bay deep, our Attempt muſt
have been in vain. And notwithſtanding theſe, and many more apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeen; and that there was no man but imagined, that moſt of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recks
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94124:28"/>
Lading was on ſhoar, and that they would hale her on ground, under
the Caſtle, where no Ship of ours ſhould be able to fleet to her; all which
objections, with many more, were alleadged, yet they little prevailed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination
was perilous, and therefore with all expedition, they thought
convenient to charge the Town, the Fort, the Gallies, and Carreck, all at
one inſtant. And they had determined, if the Carreck had been on ground,
or ſo nigh the ſhoar, that the Queens Ships could not fleet to her, that the
Two Eaſterlings, the day before taken, ſhould Board her, and Burn
her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Third day, early in the morning, every man commending
himſelf to God's Tuition and Protection, expected when to begin, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the agreement the day before. A gale of Wind happening about
Ten of the Clock, the Admiral weighed; ſhot off a Warning-piece, and put
forth his Flag in the Maintop: the Vice-Admiral did the like in his Foretop,
according to the Cuſtome of the Sea; every Captain encouraged his men,
which ſo imboldened them, as though they were grown weak and feeble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they were now revived, and beſtirred themſelves, as if a new Spirit
had been infuſed into them; the Admiral was the firſt that gave the charge,
after him followed the reſt of the Ships, ſhewing great Valor, and gaining
great Honor; the laſt of all, was the Vice-Admiral, at whoſe entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fight, he ſtill ſtrived to get up as near the ſhoar as he could, where
he came to an Anchor, continually fighting with the Town, the Fort, the
Gallies, and Carreck, all together, for he brought them betwixt him, that
he might play both his Broad Sides upon them; there might be ſeen the
Proweſs of the Gallies, ſwim by the ſides of them, the Slaves forſake them,
and every thing in confuſion amongſt them, and thus they Fought, till Five
of the Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>The Vice-Admiral was Anchored to ſuch an advantage, as the Gallies
rowed from one ſide to another, ſeeking to ſhun him, which Sir <hi>Richard
Lewſon</hi> obſerving, came on Board him, and openly, in the view and hearing
of his whole Company, imbraced him, and told him, <hi>He had won his heart
for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſt of the Ships, as they were directed, plied up, except the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
who by the negligence of his Maſter, or ſome other impediment, when
he ſhould have Anchored, fell ſo far to Leeward, as the Wind and Tide car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him out of the Road, ſo that it was the next day, before his Ship
could be fetcht in again; whereat the Admiral was much inraged, and put
himſelf into the <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> and brought her to an Anchor cloſe to the
Vice-Admiral, about Two of the Clock in the Afternoon: There was no
opportunity let paſs, for where the Admiral ſaw defect in any other Ship,
he preſently cauſed it to be ſupplied, and the Eaſterlings, who were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Board the Carrek, beginning to ſaint, and fail of obſerving the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
given them, the Vice-Admiral perceiving it, went on Board them
himſelf, vowing, that if they ſeemed backward in putting in Execution the
deſign of firing the Carreck, they ſhould look for as little Life from the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they could expect from the Enemy. Whilſt the Vice-Admiral was
thus ordering things, Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> came to him, and would in no
caſe ſuffer him to Board the Carreck himſelf, but carried him into the
<hi>Dreadnought,</hi> where they conſulted how to preſerve the Carreck, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
her.</p>
               <p>The reſult of this Reference was, to offer her parley, which they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put in practice, and commanded all the Ships to leave ſhooting, until the
return of the Meſſenger: The man imployed, was one Captain <hi>Sewell,</hi> who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94124:28"/>
had eſcaped, and ſwam to us, having been Four Years Priſoner in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and ſo did many <hi>Turks</hi> and Chriſtians; the effect of this Parley, was to
perſuade them to yield, promiſing honorable Conditions, and he was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
as from himſelf, that the Gallies, whoſe ſtrength they preſumed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were beaten, ſome burnt, the reſt fled; that we had the poſſeſſion of
the Road, the Caſtle not being able to abide our Ordinance, much leſs the
Carreck, and if they refuſed this offer of Mercy, they were to expect all the
Cruelty and Rigor, that a Conpueror could impoſe upon his Enemy: After
ſome Conference to this effect, the Captain of the Carreck told him, He
would ſend ſome Gentlemen of Quality, with Commiſſion to Treat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
that ſome of the like Quality fromus, might repair to him, to the
ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Gentlemen came aboard the <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> where the Admiral and
Vice-Admiral were, attending the return and ſucceſs of Captain <hi>Sewell;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the delivery of their Meſſage, they would needs haſten on Board the
Carreck again, for that, as it ſeemed, there was an uproar and a diviſion in
her, ſome being of opinion to entertain a Parley, others to ſave themſelves,
and ſet her on fire: which Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> hearing, without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
or conference, with Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> what was to be done, he leaped ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
into his Boat, and rowed unto the Carreck; when he drew near to
her, he was known by diverſe Gentlemen on Board her, he having once been
a Priſoner among them: they ſeemed to be very glad of this meeting, and
their paſſed diverſe Imbracements between them, in remembrance of their
old acquaintance: The Captain was called <hi>Don Diego de Lobo,</hi> a Gallant
young Gentleman, of a Noble Houſe. He deſcended down upon the bend
of the Ship, and commanded his men to ſtand aſide; Sir <hi>William</hi> did the
like to his company, in the Boat; the Captain demanded of him, if he had
the <hi>Portugal</hi> Language; he told him, he had ſufficient to Treat of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
acquainted him of the Place he commanded in the Fleet, intimated
the affection and reſpect he bore the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, and that the Treaty
which was offered, proceeded out of his motion, and wiſhed him to make
his propoſals, which were as followeth, The firſt demand he made, was,
<hi>That they ſhould be ſafely put on ſhoar with their Arms.</hi> The Second, <hi>That it
ſhould be done the ſame Night:</hi> The Third, <hi>That they ſhould enjoy their Ship
and Ordinance, as appertaining to the King, but we the Wealth.</hi> The Fourth,
<hi>That the Flag and Ancient ſhould not be taken down, but worn while the Carreck
was unlading,</hi> His Speech being ended, Sir <hi>William</hi> told him, <hi>That his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
gave ſuſpition, that under pretence of Parley, they meant Treachery, or
that their hopes were greater, than there was cauſe; and, but that he knew it was
the uſe of ſome men, to demand great things, when leſs will ſerve them, he would
not loſe his advantage, to entertain a Parley;</hi> he deſired, that what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
might be quickly concluded, for Night growing on, might advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
them, and for his Reſolution, he ſhould underſtand it in few words,
<hi>viz.</hi> To his firſt Demand, <hi>He was willing to yeild, That they ſhould be put on
ſhoar with their Arms.</hi> To the Second, <hi>That he was contented, that they ſhould
be ſet on ſhoar that Night, except Eight or Ten of the Principal Gentlemen; whom
he would detain Three Days.</hi> To the Third, <hi>He held it idle and frivolous, to
imagine, he would conſent to ſeparate Ship and Goods, and eſteemed it</hi> Por Coſa
de burla. To the Fourth, <hi>He would not conſent, being reſolved, never to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Flag to be worn in the preſence of the Queens Ships, unleſs it were
diſgracefully, over the Poop.</hi> There was long expoſtulations upon theſe
points, and Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> ſeeing the obſtinacy of the Captain, offered,
in a great rage, to leap into his Boat, reſolving to break the Treaty, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94124:29"/>
the reſt of the Gentlemen perceiving, and that he had propounded nothing
but what might very well ſtand with their Reputation, they intreated him
once more to aſcend into the Carreck, and they would enter into new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations:
The effect whereof, as it was agreed upon, were theſe that
follow;</p>
               <p>That a Meſſenger ſhould be ſent to the Admiral, to have his Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the points concluded on; and that in the mean time the Flag and
Ancient ſhould be taken down; and if the Admiral ſhould not conſent to
the Agreement, they to have leiſure to put out their Flag and Ancient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fight ſhould begin. That the Company ſhould be preſently ſet on
Shore; but the Captain, with eight other of the principal Gentlemen three
days after. That the Ship with her Goods, ſhould be ſurrendered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Practice or Treaſon. That they ſhould uſe their endeavors, that
the Caſtle ſhould forbear ſhooting whilſt we rid in the Road; and this was
the effect of the Conditions agreed upon. This Carreck Wintered in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſambicke,</hi>
in her return from the <hi>Indies,</hi> a place of great Infection, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the Mortality among them: For of 600 and odd men, twenty
of them lived not to return Home. After a great deal of Calamity and
Mortality, ſhe arrived at this Port of <hi>Ciſembre,</hi> as you have heard, the
Viceroy of <hi>Portugal,</hi> having ſent 11 Gallies to her Reſcue, and 400 <hi>mocas
de Camera,</hi> which is a Title of Gentlemen that ſerve the King upon any
Honourable Occaſion, when they are commanded. That ſhe was brought
to this paſs, and forc'd to yield on theſe Conditions, Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> was
wont to impute to the Gentlemens Acquaintance with Sir <hi>William Monſon.</hi>
Although three days were limited for ſetting the Captain on Shore, yet it
was held Diſcretion not to detain them longer than untill the Carreck was
brought off ſafely to our Ships; and therefore Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> having
carried the Captain, and the reſt of the Gentlemen on board him, where
they Supped, had variety of Muſick, and ſpent the Night in great Jollity;
the Morning following, accompanied them on Shore himſelf, whither
the <hi>Conde de Vitagera</hi> had drawn down all the Force of the whole Country,
amounting to the number of 10000 men.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit to deſcribe the Behavior of the Gallies in the Fight, that
every Man may have that Honor that is due to him: Thoſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Squadron of the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Cruz,</hi> betook themſelves, with
their General, to Flight in the middle of the Fight; but <hi>Frederico Spinola,</hi>
who was to convey his Gallies out of <hi>Spain</hi> into the Low Countreys, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
not the Example of the Marqueſs, but made good the Road; which
the other ſeeing, with Shame returned; but to both their Coſts: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they departed, they found the Climate ſo hot, as they were forc'd to
fly, their Gallies being ſo miſerably beaten, and their Slaves ſo pitifully
ſlain, as there wanted nothing but Boats to poſſeſs them all, as well as
the two we took and burnt; which is a thing hath been ſeldom ſeen or heard
of, for Ships to take and deſtroy Gallies. The number of Men ſlain in the
Town, the Caſtle, the Carreck and Gallies, are unknown, though they
could not chuſe but be many; the Wealth of the Carreck could then as ill
be eſtimated, though after found to be great; the Value of the two Gallies
burnt with their Loading of Powder, is hard to judge, though it's known
to have been a Service of great Importance. For our Loſs, it was not much,
only one man killed in the Fly-Boat, five ſlain, and as many hurt in the
<hi>Garland,</hi> and one hurt in the <hi>Adventure:</hi> Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> had the left
Wing of his Doublet ſhot off, but received no other Hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94124:29"/>
The day following, with a favourable Wind, we ſtood our Courſe for
<hi>England,</hi> which brought us into 47 Degrees; and there we met a Pinnace,
ſent with a Pacquet from the Lords, ſignifying the readineſs of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Fleet to ſupply us, and the ſetting out of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which were
ſo long looked for; which Fleet of <hi>Holland</hi> was in View of the Pinnace the
ſame Night; but paſs'd by us unſeen. This unlooked for Accident made
the Admiral and Vice-Admiral conſider what to do, and concluded, they
could not both appear at Home, and have a Fleet of ſo great Importance
upon the Enemies Coaſt without a Guide or Head; and therefore they
held it fit the Vice-Admiral ſhould put himſelf into the <hi>Nonperil,</hi> as the
ableſt Ship of the Fleet, and make his Return once more to the Coaſt of
<hi>Spain;</hi> but he having taken his Leave, and ſtanding his Courſe for the Coaſt,
a moſt violent Storm, with a contrary Wind took him, which continued
ten days, and diſcovered the weakneſs of his Ship, who had like to have
foundered in the Deep. The Carpenters and Company ſeeing the apparent
Danger, if he bore not up before the Wind, preſented him with a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
beſeeching him to have a regard to their Lives; for by keeping the
Seas they ſhould all periſh. Thus was he forc'd by mere Extremity to bear
room for <hi>England;</hi> and coming for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> he found the Carreck ſafely
arrived, and the Fleet he went back to take Charge of, not to have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Coaſt of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though it be ſomewhat impertinent to this Voyage, to treat of more
than the Succeſs thereof; yet I will a little digreſs, and relate the Miſhap
of that worthy Young Gentleman <hi>Don Diego de Lobo,</hi> Captain of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reck;
and becauſe his Worth will more appear by his Anſwer to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Monſon</hi>'s Offer to him when he was his Priſoner; thus it was: Sir
<hi>William Monſon</hi> told him, he doubted, that by the loſs of the Carreck, he
had loſt his beſt Means; for that he ſuppoſed, what he had gained in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> was laden in her; and therefore offered, that what he would chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
upon his Reputation to be his own, he ſhould have Freedom to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
along with him. The Gentleman acknowledged the Favor to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary;
but replied, that what he had, he had gained by his Sword;
and that his Sword, he doubted not, would repair his Fortunes again, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refuſing to accept any Courteſie in that kind: But, poor Gentleman,
ill Fortune thus left him not: For the Viceroy, <hi>Don Criſtoball de Moro,</hi>
holding it for a great indignity to have the Carreck taken out of the Port,
that was defended by a Caſtle, and guarded with 11 Gallies, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his hearing of the Ordnance to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and in the view of thouſands
of People who beheld it; ſome of them feeling it too, by the loſs of their
Goods that were in her, others grieving for the Death of their Friends that
were ſlain; but every man finding himſelf touched in Reputation.</p>

               <p>And the Viceroy not knowing how to clear himſelf ſo well, as the laying it
upon the Gentlemen he put on Board her, the ſame Night they returned
to their Lodging, he cauſed the moſt part of them, with their Captain, to
be apprehended, imputing the loſs of the Carreck to their Cowardiſe and
Fear, if not Treaſon and Connivance with the Enemy. After ſome time of
Impriſonment, by mediation of Friends, all the Gentlemen were releaſed
but the Captain, who received ſecret Advice, that the Viceroy intended
his Death, and that he ſhould ſeek by Eſcape to prevent it. <hi>Don Diego</hi>
being thus perplexed, practiſed with his Siſter, who finding means for his
Eſcape out of a Window, he fled into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he lived in Exile, from
1602. when this happened, untill 1615. His Government in the <hi>Indies,</hi> for
which he had a Patent in Reverſion, was confiſcate, and he left hopeleſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to return into his Native Country, much leſs to be reſtored to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
an ill Welcome after ſo long and painful a Navigation. Having
thus ſpent thirteen years in Exile, at the laſt he adviſed with Friends, whoſe
Councel he followed, to repair into <hi>England,</hi> there to enquire after ſome
Commanders, that had been at the taking of the Carreck, by whoſe Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
he might be cleared of Cowardiſe or Treaſon in the loſs of her,
which would be a good Motive to reſtore him to his Government again.
In the Year 1515. he arrived in <hi>London,</hi> and after ſome Enquiry found out
Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> to whom he complained of his hard Miſhap, craving
the Aſſiſtance of him and ſome others, whom Sir <hi>William</hi> knew to be at the
taking of the Carreck, and deſired him to teſtifie the manner of ſurprizing
her, which he alleadged, was no more than one Gentleman was bound to
afford another in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> wondered to ſee him, and eſpecially upon ſuch an Occaſion:
For the preſent, he entertained him with all Courteſie; and the longer his
ſtay was in <hi>England,</hi> the Courteſies were the greater, which Sir <hi>William</hi> did
him. Sir <hi>William</hi> procured him a true and effectual Certificate from himſelf,
Sir <hi>Francis Howard,</hi> Captain <hi>Barlow,</hi> and ſome others who were Witneſſes
of that Service; and to give it the more Reputation, he cauſed it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
in the Office of the Admiralty. The Gentleman being well ſatisfied
with his Entertainment, and having what he deſired, returned to <hi>Flanders,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:94124:30"/>
where he preſented his Certificate to the Arch-Duke and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> by whoſe
means he got Aſſurance, not only of the King's Favor, but of Reſtitution
likewiſe to his Government. The poor Gentleman having been thus toſſed
by the Waves of Calamity, from one Country to another, and never find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſt; Death that maſters all men, now cut him off ſhort, in the midſt of
his hopes, as he was preparing his Journy for <hi>Spain;</hi> and this was an end of
an unfortunate gallant young Gentleman, whoſe Deſerts might juſtly have
challenged a better reward, if God had pleaſed to afford it him.</p>

               <p>THe Fleet of Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi> being happily returned, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of a Carreck, as you have heard, and the Queen having now
no Ships upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt, to impeach the Enemies preparations, ſhe
feared, the Fleet which was ready at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> would give a Second Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
upon <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereupon Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> who by this time was
arrived at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> was ſent for in great haſte, by her Majeſty, to adviſe
about, and take on him the charge of the Fleet, then at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> After a
long Conference with Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> in the preſence of her Majeſty,
her Lord Admiral, Treaſurer, and Secretary, it was Reſolved, That Sir
<hi>William</hi> ſhould repair to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and with all ſpeed get forth thoſe Ships,
and others that were there making ready. His directions were, to preſent
himſelf before the Harbor of the <hi>Groyne,</hi> being the place where the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
made their Randevouz, and if he found any likelihood of a deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Ireland,</hi> not to quit that Coaſt untill he ſaw the Iſſue, but if he found
<hi>Ireland</hi> ſecure, and the Enemies preparations to be intended only for defence
of their own Coaſts, then his inſtructions led him thence, to the place where
the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet had order to attend, and expect him; and afterwards, the
whole carriage of the Action was referred to his diſcretion, but with this
caution, that above all reſpects of other profit or advantage, he attended the
affair of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Wind this part of the Summer hung contrary, and
it was Six Weeks before he could clear the Coaſt, during which time, he
loſt his greateſt hopes, by the return of the Carrecks of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet,
which happened a full Month before his arrival: He ſet Sail from <hi>Plymouth</hi>
the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> with a ſcant Wind, which continued with foul Weather,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94124:31"/>
untill he recovered the <hi>Groyne,</hi> chooſing rather to keep the Sea, then hazard
the overthrow of the Voyage by his return.</p>
               <p>He ſtayed at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> until he underſtood that the Fleet which was
ſuſpected to be prepared for <hi>Ireland,</hi> was gone to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> to join with
<hi>Don Diego de Borachero,</hi> who all that Summer durſt not budge forth, for
fear of our Fleet, that made good the Coaſt thereabouts: Sir <hi>William</hi> in his
way to the Rock, commanded his Carvel to repair to the Iſlands of <hi>Bayon,</hi>
as the likelieſt place to procure Intelligence of the State of thoſe parts; as
the Carvel drew near the Iſlands, he diſcerned the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, conſiſting
of Twenty Four Sail, whoſe deſign was, as ſhe underſtood by a Boat ſhe
took, to look out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, whoſe comming they daily expected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coaſt; and meeting Sir <hi>William</hi> with this news, he held it a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to be thus warned of them. Here he took two goodly Ships of <hi>France,</hi>
bound for <hi>Lisbone,</hi> which Harbor he put them from, and took Pledges that
they ſhould directly return into <hi>France,</hi> without touching in any Harbor of
<hi>Spain,</hi> for that he underſtood, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was ill provided of men,
and many other things which theſe Ships could ſupply. Sir <hi>William</hi> and the
<hi>Dreadnought,</hi> were carried with a chaſe into the Road of <hi>Ciſimbre,</hi> where
the Carreck was taken not long before, and after ſome Fight with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
who defended the Veſſel chaſed, they came to a friendly Treaty, and
Preſents paſt between them.</p>
               <p>That Night, while the Admiral rid in the Road, a Carvel comming in,
not miſtruſting him, was taken, but diſmiſſed in a friendly manner; by
whom he underſtood the affairs of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> but could get no notice of the
<hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, which was appointed to attend at the Rock, whither once
more he repaired.</p>
               <p>Coming thither the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> a light was eſpied in the Night,
which the Admiral chaſed, thinking it had been the Fleet of St. <hi>Omer,</hi> or
<hi>Brazil,</hi> bound for <hi>Lisbone,</hi> where they were expected; but drawing ſo
near them, that he might hail them, he found them, by the hugeneſs of their
Veſſels, and the number which anſwered the relation the Carvel made, to
be the <hi>Armado</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> whereupon he ſought means how to clear himſelf,
being ingaged amongſt them, and made a <hi>Spaniard</hi> which ſerved him call to
them, but they could not hear him; the <hi>Adventure</hi> only, and the <hi>Whelp,</hi>
were left with him, the reſt loſing company, Four nights before in a Storm;
the Enemy perceiving our lights, and thinking it to be ſome Fleet of <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi>
ſtood in amongſt us, but the <hi>Adventure</hi> being diſcovered to be an
Enemy, the Alarum was ſoon taken, and they ſhot at her, and ſlew and
hurt ſome of her men; as ſoon as the day appeared, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beheld
the Three <hi>Enliſh</hi> Ships a head them, which they chaſed, and Three of them,
which were better of Sail than the reſt, fetcht upon us, and drew near the
<hi>Whelp,</hi> who was of ſmall Force to reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>But the Admiral reſolving, though it was to his own evident Peril, not
to ſee a Pinnace of her Majeſties ſo loſt, if ſo be he could reſcue her with
the loſs of his Life, though it was much againſt the perſuaſions of his Maſter,
and company, he ſtroak his two Sails for the <hi>Whelp,</hi> and commanded her to
ſtand her courſe, while he ſtaid for the Three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, with hope to
make them have little liſt to purſue us: The Admiral of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
how little he cared for his Three Ships, in that he lingered for their
coming up, took in with the ſhoar, and ſhot off a peice for his Three Ships
to follow him. It may appear by this, as by ſeveral other expeditions of
ours, how much the ſwift Sailing of Ships doth avail, being the principal
advantage in Sea Service, and indeed the main thing we could preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94124:31"/>
in our War againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> having thus eſcaped the
Enemy, in his traverſe at Sea, there happened, as there doth upon all Coaſts,
where there is plenty of Trade, divers occaſions of chaſes; and one day Sir
<hi>William</hi> following one Ship, and the <hi>Adventure</hi> another, they loſt company
for the whole Voyage.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> was advertiſed by a Ship he took, being a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who
came from St. <hi>Lucas,</hi> that the St. <hi>Domingo</hi> Fleet was looked for daily, which
Intelligence made him bear up for the <hi>South Cape,</hi> as well in hopes to meet
with them, as to have news of his Fleet.</p>
               <p>He was no ſooner come to the <hi>Cape,</hi> but he was informed by ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi>
men of War, that the <hi>Domingo</hi> Fleet was paſt by two days before; here he
met with Ships of ſeveral Nations, ſome he reſcued from Pirats, and to
others that were in League with her Majeſty, he gave his ſafe conduct, for
their free paſſage on the Sea; he kept that Coaſt until the <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi>
on which morning he gave chaſe to a Gallion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Caſtle of <hi>Cape Sacre,</hi> before he could fetch her up; although
he knew the ſtrength of the Caſtle, yet he attempted, and had carried her,
had it not been for the fear and cowardize of him at the Helm, who bore up,
when he was ready to Board her: The Fight was not long, but ſharp and
dangerous, for there never paſt ſhot between them, till they were within a
Ships length one of another: The Caſtle plaid her part, and tore his Ship,
ſo that a man might have crept through her: Between the Caſtle and Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they ſlew in the Admiral Ten men, and hurt many more, in the view of
<hi>Sireago</hi> and his Quadron, to the <hi>Weſtward,</hi> and of divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> men of
War, to the <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> who durſt not put themſelves upon the reſcue of Sir
<hi>William,</hi> for fear of the Caſtle: Sir <hi>William</hi> being now left alone, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what head Land ſoever he came unto, he was to encounter a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Squadron, ſtood his courſe that night to Sea, thinking to try, if the Iſlands
of <hi>Terceras</hi> would afford him any better Fortune, but coming within Forty
or Fifty Leagues of the Iſlands, he was taken ſhort with the Wind, yet ſtill,
bearing up what he could for the Rock; but at length finding his Victuals
grew ſhort, his Maſt periſhed, and the dangers he was expoſed to, by keeping
that Coaſt, he directed his courſe for <hi>England,</hi> and came to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> the
<hi>24th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> where he found the <hi>Mary-roſe</hi> and <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> moſt
part of their men being dead or ſick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adventure</hi> arrived within an hour after him, who in her way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fell, amongſt the <hi>Braizl</hi> Fleet, and encountring with them, loſt
divers men, but took none: The <hi>Paragon</hi> was at home long before, with a
Prize of Sugar, and Spices, which countervailed the charge of the Voyage.
The <hi>Quittance</hi> in her return, met Two Ships of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and in fight
with them, her Captain was ſlain, but ſhe acquitted her ſelf very well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further harm. This Fleet, as you have heard, was to keep the Enemy
buſied at home, that he might be diverted from the thoughts of <hi>Ireland;</hi> what
hazard it endured by the Enemy, the fury of the Sea, and foul Weather,
doth appear; and no marvel; for it was the lateſt Fleet in Winter, that
ever kept upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt, as it was likewiſe the laſt Fleet her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
imployed; for in <hi>March</hi> after ſhe died, and by her Death all War cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
As Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> was General of this laſt Fleet, ſo was he a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and a Youth, at the beginning of the Wars, and was at the taking of
the firſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prize, that ever ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, which yet was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
with the loſs of Twenty Five of our men, beſides Fifty hurt. This
Prize was afterwards a Man of War, and ſerved againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
was in thoſe days reckoned the beſt Ship of War we had; ſhe was called
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94124:32"/>
the Commander, and belonged to Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> then Governor of the
Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi>

               <p>SIR <hi>William Monſon</hi> returning with his Fleet, in <hi>November,</hi> there was
a Reſolution to furniſh another againſt <hi>February,</hi> which ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited
with freſh Ships, Men and Victuals in <hi>June.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Lewſon</hi>
was to command the former Fleet, and Sir <hi>William Monſon</hi> the later: For
the Queen found it a Courſe both ſecure and profitable, to keep a
continual Force upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt, from <hi>February</hi> to <hi>November,</hi> that
being the time of greateſt Peril to her Majeſty; and ſhe was the rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
thereto, by the ſafty ſhe found the laſt Summer, and the Wealth
and Riches ſhe had from time to time taken from the Enemy. The
Complaint of the ill furniſhing out of her Ships in other Voyages, made
it more carefully to be look'd unto now, and there was better Choice of
Victuals and Men than uſually had been; but in the mean time, it pleaſed
God to viſit her Majeſty with Sickneſs, which cauſed a ling'ring, though
no abſolute diſſolving of the Fleet; but when her Danger was perceived
to increaſe, the Ships were haſtened out to Sea, it being a point of good
Policy, to keep our Seas guarded from any Forreign Attempt, untill his
Majeſty ſhould be peaceably ſettled in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Fleet departed from <hi>Quinborough</hi> the <hi>22th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and arrived
in the <hi>Downs</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> of the ſame, being the day after her Majeſties Death:
The News whereof, and Commandment to proclaim King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> our Lawful King, and the rightful Inheritor to the Crown,
arrived both together; which put us into two contrary Paſſions, the
one of Grief, the other of Joy: Grief for the Loſs of the Queen, Joy
for accepting of the King in that peaceable manner, which was a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
beyond all Expectation, either at home or abroad.</p>
               <p>As the Deſign of this Fleet was to guard and defend our own Coaſts
from any Incuriſon that might be made out of <hi>France</hi> or the Low
Countreys; ſo the Commanders were vigilant to appear on thoſe Coaſts
once in two days, to diſhearten them, in caſe they had any ſuch Thought;
but the truth is, it was beyond their Abilities, whatever was in their
Hearts to impugn his Majeſty. And becauſe the Arch-Duke would
make the Candidneſs of his Intention apparent to the World, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his Letters of Reprizal againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and publiſhed an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94124:32"/>
Edict for a free and unmoleſted Traffick into <hi>Flanders:</hi> So that now
our Merchants might again trade peaceably into thoſe Parts from which
they had been debarred the ſpace of Eighteen Years. The King find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>France</hi> neither impeached his Right, nor gave any Jealouſie
by the raiſing of an Army; and that the Arch-Duke made a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of his deſire of Peace, his Majeſty did the like, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the League he had with thoſe Princes, with whom the late Queen
had Wars: For Wars betwixt Countreys are not hereditary; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
end with the Death of their Kings: Wherefore he commanded
his Ships to give over their <hi>Southern</hi> Employment, and to repair to
<hi>Chatham,</hi> giving manifeſt Teſtimonies, how deſirous he was that his
Subjects ſhould recover that Wealth and Freedom by Peace, which they
had formerly loſt by War.</p>

Horrible Treaſons
Practiſed by WILLIAM PARRY
Againſt the Queens Majeſty;
AND OF
His Conviction and Execution for the ſame,
The 2d. of March 1584. according to the account of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>William Parry</hi> being a man of very mean and baſe
Parentage, but of a moſt proud and inſolent Spirit,
bearing himſelf always far above the meaſure of his
Fortune, after he had long led a waſteful and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
life, and had committed a great Outrage againſt
one <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> a Gentleman of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> with an intent
to have murthered him in his own Chamber, for the which he was
moſt juſtly convicted; ſeeing himſelf generally condemned with all
good men for the ſame, and other his Miſdemeanours, he left his
natural Country, and gave himſelf to travel into forreign parts
beyond the Seas. In the courſe of this his Travel, he forſook his
Allegiance and dutiful Obedience to her Majeſty, and was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
and ſubjected himſelf to the Pope. After which, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with certain <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and others of like quality, he firſt
conceived his moſt deteſtable Treaſon to kill the Queen (whoſe
life God long preſerve;) which he bound himſelf by Promiſe,
Letters, and Vows, to perform and execute: and ſo with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
he returned into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1583; and ſince that
did practiſe at ſundry times to have executed his moſt deviliſh
purpoſe and determination: yet covering the ſame, ſo much as in
him lay, with a vail and pretence of great Loyalty to her Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon his return into <hi>England,</hi> he ſought to have
ſecret Acceſs to her Majeſty, pretending to have ſome matter of
great importance to reveal unto her: which obtained, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94124:34"/>
ſame ſo privately in her Highneſs's Palace at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> as her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had but one onely Counſellor with her at the time of his
Acceſs, in a remote place, who was ſo far diſtant, as he could not
hear his Speech. And there then he diſcovered unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
(but ſhadowed with all crafty and traiterous skill he had)
ſome part of the Conference and Proceeding, as well with the ſaid
<hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and other Miniſters of the Popes, as eſpecially with one
<hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> a Fugitive, reſiding at <hi>Paris,</hi> who above all others
did perſwade him to proceed in that moſt deviliſh Attempt, (as is
ſet down in his voluntary Confeſſion following,) bearing her
Majeſty notwithſtanding in hand, That his onely intent of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſo far with the ſaid <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and the Popes Miniſters, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to no other end, but to diſcover the dangerous Practices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
and attempted againſt her Majeſty by her diſloyal Subjects,
and other malicious perſons in forraign parts. Albeit it hath ſince
appeared moſt manifeſtly, as well by his ſaid Confeſſion, as by his
dealing with one <hi>Edmond Nevil</hi> Eſq; That his onely intent of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the ſame in ſort as he craftily and traiterouſly did, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to no other end, but to make the way the eaſier to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his moſt deviliſh and wicked purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And although any other Prince but her Majeſty (who is loath
to put on a hard Cenſure of thoſe that proteſt to be loyal, as
<hi>Parry</hi> did,) would rather have proceeded to the puniſhment of a
Subject that had waded ſo far, as by Oath and Vow to promiſe
the taking away of her life (as he to her Majeſties ſelf did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs;)
yet ſuch was her goodneſs, as inſtead of puniſhing, ſhe did
deal ſo graciouſly with him, as ſhe ſuffered him not onely to have
Acceſs unto her preſence, but alſo many times to have private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with her; and did offer unto him, upon opinion once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of his fidelity towards her (as though his wicked pretence
had been, as he proteſted, for her ſervice) a moſt liberal Penſion.</p>
            <p>Beſides, to the end that he might not grow hateful to the good
and well-affected Subjects of the Realm, (from whom he could in
no ſort have eſcaped with ſafety of his life, if his deviliſh purpoſe
had been revealed) her Majeſty did conceal the ſame, without
communicating it to any creature, untill ſuch time as he himſelf
had opened the ſame unto certain of her Council; and that it was
alſo diſcovered, that he ſought to draw the ſaid <hi>Nevil</hi> to have been
a party in his deviliſh and moſt wicked purpoſe.</p>
            <p>A very rare Example! and ſuch as doth more ſet forth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
goodneſs and bounty of her Majeſties Princely nature, than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94124:34"/>
commend (if it be lawful for a Subject to cenſure his Soveraign)
her providence ſuch as ought to be in a Prince and perſon of her
Majeſties wiſdom and quality. And as the goodneſs of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
nature did hereby moſt manifeſtly ſhew it ſelf to be rare in
ſo extraordinary a caſe, and in a matter of ſo great peril unto her
own Royal Perſon; ſo did the malice of <hi>Parry</hi> moſt evidently appear
to be in the higheſt and extreameſt degree: who notwithſtanding
the ſaid extraordinary grace and favour extended towards him,
did not onely perſwade the ſaid <hi>Nevil</hi> to be an Aſſociate in the
ſaid wicked Enterprize, but did alſo very vehemently (as <hi>Nevil</hi>
confeſſeth) importune him therein, as an Action lawful, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and meritorious, omitting nothing that might provoke him to
aſſent thereunto.</p>
            <p>But ſuch was the ſingular goodneſs of Almighty God, (who
even from her Majeſties Cradle, by many evident Arguments,
hath ſhewed himſelf her onely and eſpecial Protector) that he ſo
wrought in <hi>Nevil</hi>'s heart, as he was moved to reveal the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Majeſty; and for that purpoce made choiſe of a faithful
Gentleman, and of good quality in the Court, unto whom upon
<hi>Munday</hi> the 8th of <hi>February</hi> laſt, he diſcovered at large all that had
paſſed between <hi>Parry</hi> and him; who immediately made it known
to her Majeſty: whereupon her Highneſſes pleaſure was, That
<hi>Nevil</hi> ſhould be examined by the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Hatton;</hi> who in the evening of the ſame day did examine
him; and he affirmed conſtantly all which he had before declared
to the ſaid Gentleman.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, her Majeſty continued her ſingular and moſt
Princely magnanimity, neither diſmaid with the rareneſs of the
Accident, nor appaled with the horrour of ſo villanous an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
tending even to the taking away of her moſt gracious life;
(a matter eſpecially obſerved by the Counſellor that was preſent
at ſuch time as <hi>Parry,</hi> after his return, did firſt diſcover unto her
Majeſty his wicked purpoſe; who found no other alteration in her
countenance, than if he had imparted unto her ſome matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;)
which ſheweth manifeſtly how ſhe repoſeth her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
wholly in the defence of the Almighty. And ſo her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
following the wonted courſe of her ſingular Clemency, gave
order that <hi>Parry</hi> the ſame <hi>Munday</hi> in the evening (though not ſo
known to him) ſhould be ſent to Mr. Secretaries houſe in <hi>London,</hi>
he being then there; who according unto ſuch direction as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from her Majeſty, did let him underſtand, That her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94124:35"/>
(in reſpect of the good will ſhe knew he bare unto the ſaid
<hi>Parry,</hi> and of the Truſt that <hi>Parry</hi> did outwardly profeſs to repoſe
in Mr. Secretary) had made eſpecial choice of him to deal with
him in a matter that concerned her highly; and that ſhe doubted
not but that he would diſcharge his duty towards her, according
unto that extraordinary devotion that he profeſſed to bear unto
her.</p>
            <p>And thereupon told him that her Majeſty had been advertiſed
that there was ſomewhat intended preſently againſt her own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
wherewith ſhe thought he could not but be made acquainted,
conſidering the great Truſt that ſome of her worſt-affected Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
repoſed in him; and that her pleaſure therefore was, That
he ſhould declare unto him his knowledge therein: and whether
the ſaid <hi>Parry</hi> himſelf had let fall any ſpeech unto any perſon
(though with an intent onely to have diſcovered his diſpoſition)
that might draw him in ſuſpition, as though he himſelf had any
ſuch wicked intent. But <hi>Parry</hi> with great and vehement prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
denied it utterly; whereupon Mr. Secretary, the rather to
induce him to deal more plainly in a matter ſo important, declared
unto him, That there was a Gentleman of Quality, every way as
good or better than himſelf, and rather his Friend than Enemy,
that would avouch it to his face: Yet <hi>Parry</hi> perſiſted ſtubbornly
in his former denial, and juſtification of his own innocency; and
would not in any reſpect yield that he was party or privy to any
ſuch Motion, Enterprize, or intent. And being lodged that night
at Mr. Secretaries houſe, the next morning he deſired earneſtly to
have ſome further ſpeech with Mr. Secretary; which granted,
<hi>Parry</hi> declared to him, that he had called to remembrance that he
had once ſome ſpeech with one <hi>Nevil</hi> a Kinſman of his (ſo he called
him) touching a point of Doctrine contained in the Anſwer made
to the Book, entituled, <hi>The Execution of Juſtice in</hi> England; by
which book it was reſolved, That it was lawful to take away the
Life of a Prince, in furtherance of the Catholick Religion: But
he proteſted that they never had any ſpeech at all of any Attempt
intended againſt her Majeſties Perſon. Which Denial of his (at
two ſundry times, after ſo much light given him) doth ſet forth
moſt apparently both the Juſtice and Providence of God: His
Juſtice, for that (though he was one of a ſharp conceit) he had
no power to take hold of this Overture, thereby to have avoided
the danger that <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Accuſation might bring him into by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the ſame, as a thing propounded onely to feel <hi>Nevil</hi>'s mind,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94124:35"/>
whom before he had reported unto Maſter Secretary he found a
perſon diſcontented, and therefore his Confeſſion might to very
great purpoſe have ſerved to have cleared himſelf touching the
intent: His Providence, for that of his great Mercy he would
not ſuffer ſo dangerous and wicked a member to eſcape, and to
live to Her Majeſties peril.</p>
            <p>The ſame day at Night <hi>Parry</hi> was brought to the Earl of
<hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s houſe, and there eftſoons examined before the ſaid Earl
of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> Maſter Vice-Chamberlain, and Maſter Secretary:
He perſiſted ſtill in his denial of all that he was charged with.
Whereupon <hi>Nevil,</hi> being brought before him face to face, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Accuſation againſt him. He notwithſtanding would not yet
yield to confeſs it, but very proudly and inſolently oppoſed his
Credit againſt the Credit of <hi>Nevil,</hi> affirming that his <hi>No</hi> was as
good as <hi>Nevil</hi>'s <hi>Yea;</hi> and as by way of recrimination, objected
the Crime to <hi>Nevil</hi> himſelf. On the other ſide, <hi>Nevil</hi> did with
great Conſtancy affirm all that he had before ſaid, and did ſet
down many probable Circumſtances of the Times, Places, and
Manners of their ſundry Conferences, and of ſuch other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
as had happened between them in the courſe of that Action.
Whereupon <hi>Parry</hi> was then committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>Nevil</hi>
commanded by their Honours to ſet down in writing under his
Hand, all that which before he had delivered by words: which
he did with his own hand, as followeth.</p>

                           <hi>WIlliam Parry</hi> the laſt Summer, ſoon after his repulſe in
his Suit for the Maſterſhip of St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> repaired
to my Lodging in the <hi>White Friars,</hi> where he ſhewed himſelf a
perſon greatly diſcontented, and vehemently inveighed againſt
Her Majeſty, and willed me to aſſure my ſelf, that during this
time and ſtate, I ſhould never receive Contentment. But
ſith, ſaid he, I know you to be Honourably deſcended, and a
Man of Reſolution, if you will give me aſſurance, either to joyn
with me, or not to diſcover me, I will deliver unto you the
only means to do your ſelf good. Which when I had promiſed
him, he appointed me to come the next day to his Houſe in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94124:36"/>
                           <hi>Fetterlane:</hi> and repairing thither accordingly, I found him in his
Bed; whereupon he commanded his men forth, and began with
me in this order. <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid he, (for ſo he called me) <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
before God, that three Reaſons principally do induce me to enter
into this Action, which I intend to diſcover unto you; the replanting
of Religion, the preferring of the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Title, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Juſtice, wonderfully corrupted in this Commowealth:</hi> And
thereupon entred into ſome Diſcourſes what places were fit to be
taken, to give entrance to ſuch Forreign Forces as ſhould be beſt
liked of, for the furtherance of ſuch Enterprizes as were to be
undertaken. And with theſe Diſcourſes he paſſed the time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he went to Dinner: after which, the Company being retired,
he entred into his former diſcourſes. <hi>And if I be not deceived,</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>by taking of</hi> Quinborough-<hi>Caſtle, we ſhall hinder the
paſſage of the Queens Ships forth of the River.</hi> Whereunto when
he ſaw me uſe no contradiction, he ſhook me by the hand; <hi>Tuſh,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>this is nothing: If men were reſolute, there is an Enterprize
of much more moment, and much eaſier to perform; an Act honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and meritorious to God and the world.</hi> Which ſeeing me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to know, he was not aſhamed to utter in plain terms, to
conſiſt in killing of her Majeſty: <hi>Wherein,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if you will
go with me, I will looſe my Life, or deliver my Countrey from her
bad and tyrannous Government.</hi> At which Speeches finding me
diſcontented, he asked me, if I had read Doctor <hi>Allen</hi>'s Book,
out of which he alledged an Authority for it. I anſwered, <hi>No,
and that I did not believe that Authority.</hi> Well, ſaid he, what
will you ſay, if I ſhew further Authority than this, even from
<hi>Rome</hi> itſelf a plain Diſpenſation for the killing of her, wherein
you ſhall finde it (as I ſaid before) meritorious? <hi>Good Couſin,</hi>
ſaid I, <hi>when you ſhall ſhew it me, I ſhall think it very ſtrange, when
I ſhall ſee one to hold that for meritorious, which another holdeth
for damnable.</hi> Well, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> do me but the favour to think
upon it till to morrow: And if one man be in the Town, I will
not fail to ſhew you the thing it ſelf: and if he be not, he will
be within theſe five or ſix days; at which time if it pleaſe you to
meet me at <hi>Chanon-row,</hi> we may there receive the Sacrament to
be true each to other, and then I will diſcover unto you both
the party, and the thing itſelf. Whereupon I prayed <hi>Parry</hi> to
think better upon it, as a matter of great charge both of Soul
and Body. I would to God, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> you were as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
perſwaded in it as I am, for then undoubtedly you ſhould
do God great ſervice.</p>

                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94124:36"/>
Not long after, eight or ten days, (as I remember) <hi>Parry</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to viſit me at my lodging in <hi>Herns</hi> rents in Holborn, as he
often uſed, we walked forth into the fields, where he renewed
again his determination to kill her Majeſty, whom he ſaid he
thought moſt unworthy to live, and that he wondred I was ſo
ſcrupulous therein. She hath ſought, ſaid he, your ruine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
why ſhould you not then ſeek to revenge it? I confeſs,
quoth I, that my caſe is hard, but yet am I not ſo deſperate as to
revenge it upon my ſelf, which muſt needs be the event of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
and unpoſſible an enterpriſe. Unpoſſible, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> I
wonder at you; for in truth there is not any thing more eaſie:
you are no Courtier, and therefore know not her cuſtoms of
walking with ſmall train, and often in the Garden very privately,
at which time my ſelf may eaſily have acceſs unto her, and you
alſo when you are known in Court. Upon the fact we muſt have
a Barge ready to carry us with ſpeed down the River, where we
will have a ſhip ready to tranſport us if it be needfull: but upon
my head, we ſhall never be followed ſo far. I asked him, How
will you eſcape forth of the Garden? for you ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to carry any men with you, and the Gates will then be
locked, neither can you carry a Dagge without ſuſpition. As
for a Dagge, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> I care not: my Dagger is enough.
And as for my eſcaping, thoſe that ſhall be with her, will be ſo
buſie about her, as I ſhall finde opportunity enough to eſcape,
if you be there ready with the Barge to receive me. But if this
ſeem dangerous in reſpect of your reaſon before ſhewed, let it
then reſt till her coming to St. <hi>James,</hi> and let us furniſh our
ſelves in the mean time with men and horſe fit for the purpoſe:
we may each of us keep eight or ten men without ſuſpition.
And for my part, ſaid he, I ſhall finde good fellows that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me without ſuſpecting mine intent. It is much, ſaid he, that
ſo many reſolute men may do upon the ſuddain, being well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
with each his Caſe of Dagges: if they were an hundred
waiting upon her, they were not able to ſave her; you coming of
the one ſide and I on the other, and diſcharging our Dagges
upon her, it were unhappy if we ſhould both miſs her. But if our
Dagges fail, I ſhall beſtir me well with a ſword ere ſhe eſcape
me. Whereunto I ſaid, Good Doctor give over this odious
enterpriſe, and trouble me no more with the hearing of that,
which in heart I loath ſo much. I would to God the enterpriſe
were honeſt, that I might make known unto thee whether I want
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94124:37"/>
ſolution. And not long after, her Majeſty came to St. <hi>James's;</hi>
after which, one morning (the day certain I remember not,) <hi>Parry</hi>
revived again his former diſcourſe of killing her Majeſty, with
great earneſtneſs and importunity perſwading me to joyn therein:
ſaying, he thought me the onely man of <hi>England</hi> like to perform
it, in reſpect of my valure, as he termed it.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon, I made ſemblance as if I had been more willing
to hear him than before, hoping by that means to cauſe him to
deliver his minde to ſome other that might be witneſs thereof with
me; wherein nevertheleſs I failed. After all this, on Saturday
laſt, being the ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> between the hours of five and
ſix in the afternoon, <hi>Parry</hi> came to my Chamber, and deſired to
talk with me apart: whereupon we drew our ſelves to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
And where I had told <hi>Parry</hi> before, that a learned man
whom I met by chance in the fields, unto whom I proponed
the queſtion touching her Majeſty, had anſwered me that it was
an enterpriſe moſt villanous and damnable, willing me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my ſelf of it: <hi>Parry</hi> then deſired to know that learned
mans name, and what was become of him, ſaying, after a ſcornful
manner, No doubt he was a very wiſe man, and you wiſer in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
him: and ſaid further, I hope you told him not that I had
any thing from <hi>Rome.</hi> Yes in truth, ſaid I. Whereunto <hi>Parry</hi>
ſaid, I would you had not named me, nor ſpoken of any thing I
had from <hi>Rome.</hi> And thereupon he earneſtly perſwaded me eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoons
to depart beyond the Seas, promiſing to procure me ſafe
paſſage into <hi>Wales,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Britain;</hi> whereat we
ended. But I then reſolved not to do ſo, but to diſcharge my
conſcience, and lay open this his moſt traiterous and abominable
intention againſt her Majeſty: which I revealed in ſort as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <p>IN the year 1570. I was ſworn her Majeſties ſervant, from
which time until the year 1580. I ſerved, honoured, and
loved her with as great readineſs, devotion, and aſſurance as any
poor ſubject in <hi>England.</hi> In the end of that year, and until Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer
1582. I had ſome trouble for the hurting of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the <hi>Temple.</hi> In which action I was ſo diſgraced and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by two great men (to whom I have of late been behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den)
that I never had contented thought ſince. There began my
misfortune, and here followeth my woful fall.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>July</hi> after, I laboured for licence to travail for three years,
which (upon ſome conſideration) was eaſily obtained. And ſo
in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I went over with doubtful minde of return, for that
being ſuſpected in Religion, and not having received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in twenty two years, I began to miſtruſt my advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>September</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to the Church, and adviſed to live without ſcandal, the
rather, for that it was miſtruſted by the Engliſh Catholiques, that I
had Intelligence with the greateſt Councellour of <hi>England.</hi> I ſtaied
not long there, but removed to <hi>Lions</hi> (a place of great Traffick)
where, becauſe it was the ordinary paſſage of our Nation to and
fro, between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> I was alſo ſuſpected.</p>
                        <p>To put all men out of doubt of me, and for ſome other cauſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94124:38"/>
I went to <hi>Millain,</hi> from whence, as a place of ſome danger (though
I found favour there) after I had cleared my conſcience, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my ſelf in Religion before the Inquiſitor, I went to <hi>Venice.</hi>
There I came acquainted with father <hi>Benedicto Palmio, a grave
and a learned Jeſuite.</hi> By conference with him of the hard ſtate
of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> and by reading of the Book <hi>De per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutione
Anglicana,</hi> and other diſcourſes of like argument, 1 <hi>I
conceived a poſſible mean to relieve the afflicted ſtate of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
if the ſame might be well warranted in religion and conſcience
by the Pope, or ſome learned Divines. I asked his opinion; he made
it clear, commended my devotion, comforted me in it,</hi> and after a
while made me known to the <hi>Nuntio Campeggio,</hi> there reſident for
his Holineſs. <hi>By his means I wrote to the Pope, preſented the ſervice,</hi>
and ſued for a Paſport to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to return ſafely into
<hi>France.</hi> Anſwer came from Cardinal <hi>Como,</hi> that I might come,
and ſhould be welcome. I miſliked the warrant, ſued for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I was promiſed: but it came not before my departure
to <hi>Lions,</hi> where I promiſed to ſtay ſome time for it. And being
indeed deſirous to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and loth to go without counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<hi>I deſired</hi> Chriſtofero de Salazar, <hi>Secretary to the Catholick
King in</hi> Venice, <hi>who had ſome underſtanding by conference, of my
devotion to the afflicted Catholicks at home and abroad,</hi> to commend
me to the Duke <hi>di Nova Terra,</hi> Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> and to the
County of <hi>Olivaris Embi,</hi> then Reſident for the King his Maſter
in <hi>Rome:</hi> which he promiſed to do effectually for the one, and
did for the other. And ſo I took my journey towards <hi>Lyons,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came for me an ample Paſſeport (but ſomewhat too late,)
that I might come and go <hi>in verbo Pontificis per omnes juriſdictones
Eccleſiaſticas, abſque impedimento.</hi> I acquainted ſome good Fathers
there, of my neceſſity to depart towards <hi>Paris</hi> by promiſe, <hi>and
prayed their adviſes upon divers points; wherein I was well ſatisfied.</hi>
And ſo aſſuring them that his Holineſs ſhould hear from me
ſhortly, it was undertaken that I ſhould be excuſed for that
time.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>October</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where (upon better opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of me amongſt my Catholick Country-men) I found my
credit well ſetled, and ſuch as miſtruſted me before, ready to truſt
and imbrace me. And being one day at the Chamber of <hi>Thomas
Morgan</hi> a Catholick Gentleman (greatly beloved and truſted on
that ſide) amongſt other Gentlemen, talking (but in very good
ſort) of <hi>England,</hi> I was deſired by <hi>Morgan</hi> to go up with him to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94124:38"/>
another Chamber, where he brake with me, and told me that it
was hoped and looked for, that I ſhould do ſome ſervice for God
and his Church. I anſwered him, I would do it, if it were to kill the
greateſt ſubject in <hi>England;</hi> whom I named, and in truth then
hated. No, no, ſaid he, let him live to his greater fall and ruine
of his houſe:</p>
                        <p>2 It is the Queen I mean. I had him as I wiſhed, and told
him it were ſoon done, if it might be lawfully done, and warranted in the
opinion of ſome learned Divines. And ſo the doubt once reſolved (though
as you have heard I was before reaſonably well ſatisfied) I vowed
to undertake the enterpriſe, for the reſtitution of <hi>England</hi> to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
obedience of the Sea Apoſtolick. <hi>Divers Divines were named.
Doctor</hi> Allein <hi>I deſired,</hi> Parſons <hi>I refuſed. And by chance came
Maſter</hi> Wattes <hi>a learned Prieſt, with whom I conferred, and was
over-ruled.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3 For he plainly pronounced (the caſe onely altered in name)
that it was utterly unlawful: with whom many Engliſh Prieſts
did agree as I have heard, if it be not altered ſince <hi>the book made
in anſwer of The execution of the Engliſh Juſtice was publiſhed,
which I muſt confeſs hath taken hard hold in me,</hi> and (I fear me)
will do in others, if it be not prevented by more gracious hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the quiet and obedient Catholick ſubjects, whereof there
is good and greater ſtore in <hi>England,</hi> than this age will extinguiſh.
<hi>Well notwithſtanding all theſe doubts, I was gone ſo far by letters
and conference in</hi> Italy, <hi>that I could not go back, but promiſed
faithfully to perform the enterpriſe, if his Holineſs upon my offer and
letters would allow it, and grant me full remiſſion of my ſins. 4
I wrote my letters the firſt of</hi> January 1584. <hi>by their computation;
took advice upon them in confeſſion of Father</hi> Anibal <hi>a</hi> Codreto <hi>a
learned Jeſuite in</hi> Paris, <hi>was lovingly embraced, commended, confeſſed,
and communicated at the Jeſuites at one altar with the Cardinals of</hi>
Vandoſmi, <hi>and</hi> Narbone, <hi>whereof I prayed certificate, and encloſed
the ſame in my Letter to his Holineſs, to lead him the rather to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
me; which I required by my Letters, in conſideration of ſo great
an enterpriſe undertaken without promiſe or reward. 5 I went with</hi>
Morgan <hi>to the Nuntio</hi> Ragazzoni, <hi>to whom I read the Letter and
certificate encloſed, ſealed it, and left it with him to ſend to</hi> Rome:
<hi>he promiſed great care of it, and to procure anſwer: And ſo lovingly
imbraced me, wiſhed me good ſpeed, and promiſed that I ſhould be
remembred at the altar. 6 After this I deſired</hi> Morgan, <hi>that ſome
ſpecial man might be made privy to this matter, leſt he dying, and I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94124:39"/>
miſcarrying in the execution, and my intent never truly diſcovered, it
might ſtick for an everlaſting ſpot in my Race.</hi> Divers were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but none agreed upon for fear of beraying. 7 This being
done, <hi>Morgan</hi> aſſured me, that ſhortly after my departure, <hi>the</hi> L.
Fernehurſt <hi>(then in</hi> Paris) <hi>ſhould go into</hi> Scotland, <hi>and be ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt news of the Queens fall to enter into</hi> England <hi>with 20 or
30000 Men</hi> to defend the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (whom, and the
King her Son, I do in my conſcience acquit of any privity, liking,
or conſent to this, or any other bad action, for any thing that ever
I did know.) I ſhortly departed for <hi>England,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Rie</hi>
in <hi>January</hi> 1583. from whence I wrote to the Court, advertiſed
ſome, that I had a ſpecial ſervice to diſcover to the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
8 <hi>which I did more to prepare acceſs and credit, than for any care
I had of her Perſon,</hi> though I were fully reſolved never to touch
her (notwithſtanding any Warrant) if by any device, perſwaſion,
or policy ſhe might be wrought to deal more graciouſly with the
Catholicks than ſhe doth, or by our manner of proceeding in
Parliament meaneth to do, or any thing yet ſeen. I came to the
Court, (then at <hi>Whitehall,)</hi> prayed audience, had it at large, and
very privately diſcovered to her Majeſty this Conſpiracy, much to
this effect, <hi>though covered with all the skill I had:</hi> ſhe took it
doubtfully, I departed with fear. And amongſt other things, I
cannot forget her Majeſties gratious ſpeech then uttered touching
the Catholicks, which of late, after a ſort I avowed in Parliament:
ſhe ſaid to me, that never a Catholick ſhould be troubled for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or Supremacy, ſo long as they lived like good Subjects.
Whereby I miſtruſted that her Majeſty is born in hand, that none
is troubled for the one or the other. It may be truly ſaid, that it
is better than it hath been, though it be not yet as it ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>March</hi> laſt, while I was at <hi>Greenwich</hi> (as I remember) ſuing
for St. <hi>Katherines, came Letters to me from Cardinal</hi> Como, <hi>dated
at</hi> Rome, <hi>the laſt of</hi> January <hi>before, whereby I found the enterpriſe
commended, and allowed, and my ſelf abſolved (in his Holineſs name)
of all my ſins, and willed to go forward in the name of God.</hi> That
Letter I ſhewed to ſome in Court, who imparted it to the Queen:
what it wrought, or may work in her Majeſty, God knoweth:
onely this I know, 9 that <hi>it confirmed my reſolution to kill her, and
made it clear in my conſcience, that it was lawful and meritorious.</hi>
And yet was I determined never to do it, if either policy, practice,
perſwaſion, or motion in Parliament could prevail. I feared to be
tempted, and therefore always when I came near her, I left my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94124:39"/>
Dagger at home. 10 <hi>When I looked upon her Majeſty, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
her many excellencies, I was greatly troubled: And yet I ſaw no
remedy, for my Vows were in Heaven, my Letters and Promiſes in
Earth,</hi> and the caſe of the Catholick Recuſants, and others, little
bettered. Sometimes I ſaid to my ſelf, Why ſhould I care for
her? what hath ſhe done for me? have I not ſpent 10000 Marks
ſince I knew her ſervice, and never had peny by her? It may be
ſaid, ſhe gave me my life. But I ſay (as my caſe ſtood) it had
been Tyranny to take it: And I fear me it is little leſs yet. If
it pleaſe her gratiouſly to look into my diſcontentments, I would
to Jeſus Chriſt ſhe had it, for I am weary of it. And now to
come to an end of this tragical diſcourſe: In <hi>July</hi> I left the Court,
utterly rejected, diſcontented, and as her Majeſty might perceive
by my paſſionate Letters, careleſs of my ſelf. I came to <hi>London:</hi>
Doctor Alleins <hi>Book was ſent me out of</hi> France: 11 <hi>it redoubled my
former conceits: Every word in it was a warrant to a prepared mind:
It taught that Kings may be excommunicated, deprived, and violently
handled: It proveth that all Wars Civil or Forraign undertaken for
Religion, is Honorable.</hi> Her Majeſty may do well to read it, and
to be out of doubt (if things be not amended) that it is a warning,
and a Doctrine full dangerous. This is the Book I ſhewed, in
ſome places read, <hi>and lent it to my Couſin</hi> Nevil (the accuſer) who
came often to mine houſe, put his finger in my Diſh, his hand
in my Purſe; and the night wherein he accuſed me, was wrapped
in my Gown, ſix moneths at leaſt after we had entred into this
Conſpiracy: In which ſpace her Majeſty, and ten Princes in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Provinces might have been killed. God bleſs her Majeſty
from him: for before Almighty God, I joy and am glad in my
ſoul, that it was his hap <hi>to diſcover me in time;</hi> though there were
no danger near.</p>
                        <p>And now to the manner of our meetings. He came to me in
the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſpake to me in this or like ſort.
Couſin, let us do ſomewhat, ſithens we can have nothing. I
offered to joyn with him, and gladly heard him, <hi>hoping becauſe
I knew him to be a Catholick, that he would hit upon that I had in
my head:</hi> but it fell not out ſo. He thought the delivery of the
Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> eaſie, preſuming upon his Credit and Kindred
in the North: I thought it dangerous to her, and impoſſible to
men of our fortunes: He fell from that to the taking of <hi>Barwick:</hi>
I ſpake of <hi>Quinborough</hi> and the Navy, rather to entertain him with
diſcourſe, than that I cared for thoſe motions, <hi>my head being full
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94124:40"/>
of a greater matter:</hi> 12 I told him that I had another manner of
Enterpriſe, more honourable and profitable to us, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
Common-wealth, than all theſe, if he would joyn in it with
me, as he preſently vowed to do: He preſſed to know it; I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to ſleep upon the motion: He did ſo, (and belike over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken)
came to me the next morning to my Lodging in <hi>London,</hi>
offered to joyn with me, and <hi>took his Oath upon a Bible, to conceal
and conſtantly to purſue the enterpriſe for the advancement of Religion;
which I alſo did, and meant to perform: the killing of the Queen was
the matter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The manner and place, to be on Horsback, with eight or ten
horſes, when ſhe ſhould ride abroad about St. <hi>James,</hi> or ſome
other like place. It was once thought fit in a Garden, and that
the eſcape would be eaſieſt by water into <hi>Shepey,</hi> or ſome other
part: but we reſolved upon the firſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This continued as agreed upon many moneths,</hi> until he heard of
the death of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> whoſe Land and Dignity (whereof he
aſſured himſelf) bred belike this Conſcience in him to diſcover a
Treaſon in <hi>February,</hi> contrived and agreed upon in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> If it
coſt him not an ambitious Head at laſt, let him never truſt me.
He brought a tall Gentleman (whom he commended for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Piſtolier) to me to <hi>Chanon-Row,</hi> to make one in the match:
but I refuſed to deal with him, being loth to lay my head upon
ſo many hands.</p>
                        <p>Maſter <hi>Nevil</hi> hath (I think) forgotten, that he did ſwear to
to me at divers times, that all the advancement ſhe could give,
ſhould ſerve but for her ſcourge, if ever time and occaſion ſhould
ſerve: and that though he would not lay hand upon her in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
his heart ſerved him to ſtrike off her Head in the field. Now
leaving him to himſelf, this much (to make an end) I muſt confeſs
of my ſelf, I did mean to try what might be done in Parliament,
to do my beſt to hinder all hard courſes, to have prayed hearing
of the Queens Majeſty, to move her (if I could) to take compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upon her Catholick Subjects; <hi>and when all had failed, to do as I
intended.</hi> If her Majeſty by this courſe would have eaſed them,
though ſhe had never preferred me; I had with all comfort and
patience born it: 13 but if ſhe had preferred me without eaſe or
care of them, the Enterpriſe had held. </p>

                  <head>William Parry's Letter to the Lord Treaſurer, and
the Earl of Leiceſter.</head>
                  <p>MY Lords, now that the Conſpiracy is diſcovered, the
Fault confeſſed, my Conſcience cleared, and Minde
prepared patiently to ſuffer the Pains due for ſo heinous a
Crime: I hope it ſhall not offend you, if crying <hi>Miſerere</hi> with
the poor Publican, I leave to deſpair with curſed <hi>Cain.</hi> My
Caſe is rare and ſtrange, and, for any thing I can remember,
ſingular: A natural Subject ſolemnly to vow the Death of his
natural Queen (ſo born, ſo known, and ſo taken by all men)
for the Relief of the afflicted Catholicks, and Reſtitution of
Religion. The Matter firſt conceived in <hi>Venice,</hi> the Service
(in general words) preſented to the Pope, continued and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
in <hi>Paris;</hi> and laſtly, commended and warranted by
his Holineſs, degeſted and reſolved in <hi>England,</hi> if it had not
been prevented by Accuſation, or by her Majeſties greater
Lenity and more gracious Uſage of her Catholick Subjects.
This is my firſt and laſt Offence conceived againſt my Prince
or Country, and doth (I cannot deny) contein all other
faults whatſoever. It is now to be puniſhed by Death, or
moſt graciouſly (beyond all common expectation) to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
Death I do confeſs to have deſerved; Life I do
(with all Humility) crave, if it may ſtand with the Queens
Honour, and Policy of the Time. To leave ſo great a
Treaſon unpuniſhed, were ſtrange: To draw it by my Death
in example, were dangerous: A ſworn Servant to take upon
him ſuch an Enterprize, upon ſuch a ground, and by ſuch a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
hath not been ſeen in <hi>England:</hi> To Indict him, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
him, bring him to the Scaffold, and to publiſh his Offence,
can do no good: To hope that he hath more to diſcover
than is Confeſſed, or that at his Execution he will unſay any
thing he hath written, is in vain: To conclude, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him in time to make ſome part of amends, were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94124:41"/>
very hard, and againſt former Experiences. The Queſtion
then is, whether it be better to kill him, or (leſt the matter
be miſtaken) upon hope of his amendment to pardon him. For
mine own opinion (though partial) I will deliver you my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
The Caſe is good Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> the Offence is
committed againſt her Sacred Perſon, and ſhe may (of her
Mercy) pardon it without prejudice to any. Then this I ſay,
in few words, as a man more deſirous to diſcharge his troubled
Conſcience, than to live. Pardon poor <hi>Parry,</hi> and relieve him:
for life without living is not fit for him. If this may not be, or
be thought dangerous, or diſhonourable to the Queens Majeſty
(as by your favours, I think it full of Honour and Mercy) then
I beſeech your Lordſhips (and no other) once to hear me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I be Indicted, and afterwards (if I muſt dye) humbly
to intreat the Queens Majeſty to haſten my Trial and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I pray God (with all my heart) may prove as
honourable to her, as I hope it ſhall be happy to me; who
will, while I live, (as I have done always) pray to Jeſus Chriſt
for her Majeſties long and proſperous Reign.</p>

                  <p>RIght honourable Sir, when your Honour demanded me if
Mr. <hi>Parry</hi> did ask me, If it was reaſon to kill the
Queen, indeed and verity, then I had no remembrance at all
thereof. But ſince, thinking on the matter, I have called to
mind the whole faſhion of his dealing with me, and ſome of his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94124:42"/>
Arguments: for he dealt very craftily with me, I dare not ſay
maliciouſly. For I did in no ways think of any ſuch deſign of
his, or of any other, and did anſwer him ſimply after my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and knowledge to the verity of the queſtion. For after
that I had anſwered him twice before, <hi>Quòd omnino non liceret,</hi>
he returned late at Even, by reaſon I was to depart early in the
next Morning toward <hi>Chamberie</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> where I did remain,
and being return'd out of the Cloſe within one of the Claſſes of
the Colledge, he proponed to me of the new matter, with his
Reaſons and Arguments. Firſt, he alledged the utility of the
deed for delivering of ſo many Catholicks out of miſery, and
reſtitution of the Catholick Religion. I anſwered, that the
Scripture anſwereth thereto, ſaying, <hi>Non ſunt facienda mala, ut
veniant bona.</hi> So that for no good, how great that ever it be,
may be wrought any evil, how little that ever it be. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that it was not evil to take away ſo great evil, and induce
ſo great good. I anſwered, That all good is not to be done,
but that onely, <hi>Quod bene &amp; legitime fieri poteſt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Dixi, Deum magis amare adverbia quàm nomina. Quia in
actionibus magis ei placent bene &amp; legitime, quam bonum. Ita
ut nullum bonum liceat facere, niſi bene &amp; legitimè fieri poſſit.
Quod in hoc caſu fieri non poteſt.</hi> Yet ſaid he, that ſeveral learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men were of the opinion, <hi>Quod liceret.</hi> I anſwered, that
they men perhaps were of the opinion that for the ſafety of
many in Soul and Body, they would permit a particular to his
danger, and to the occult judgment of God: Or perhaps ſaid
ſo, moved rather by ſome compaſſion and commiſeration of
the miſerable eſtate of the Catholicks, not for any ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that they did finde in their Books. For it is certain, that
ſuch a thing is not licite to a particular, without ſpecial revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Divine, which exceedeth our Learning and Doctrine. And

FIrſt, three Proclamations for ſilence were made, according to
the uſual courſe in ſuch caſes. Then the Lieutenant was
commanded to return his Precept; which did ſo, and brought
the Priſoner to the Bar, to whom <hi>Miles Sandes</hi> Eſquire, Clerk of
the Crown, ſaid, <hi>William Parry,</hi> hold up thy hand; and he did
ſo. Then ſaid the Clerk of the Crown, Thou art here Indicted
by the Oaths of twelve good and lawful men of the County of
<hi>Middleſex,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Indictment.</note> before Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wray</hi> Knight,
and others, which took the Indictment by the
name of <hi>William Parry,</hi> late of <hi>London,</hi> Gentleman, otherwiſe
called <hi>William Parry,</hi> late of <hi>London,</hi> Doctor of the Law; for
that thou, as a falſe Traitor againſt the moſt Noble and Chriſtian
Prince, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> thy moſt gracious Soveraign and Liege-Lady,
not having the fear of God before thine eyes, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
thy due Allegiance; but being ſeduced by the inſtigation
of the Devil, and intending to withdraw and extinguiſh the
hearty Love and due Obedience which true and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſhould bear unto the ſame our Soveraign Lady, didſt at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> on the firſt day of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
in the 26th year of her Highneſs Reign, and at divers other
times and places in the ſame County, maliciouſly and traiterouſly
conſpire and compaſs, not only to deprive and depoſe the ſame
our Sovereign Lady of her Royal Eſtate, Title and Dignity;
but alſo to bring her Highneſs to Death and final Deſtruction,
and Sedition in the Realm to make, and the Government thereof
to ſubvert, and the ſincere Religion of God eſtabliſhed in her
Highneſs Dominions to alter and ſubvert. And that, whereas
thou <hi>William Parry,</hi> by thy Letters ſent unto <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> didſt ſignifie unto the ſame Biſhop thy purpoſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
aforeſaid, and thereby didſt pray and require the ſame
Biſhop to give thee Abſolution; that thou afterwards, that is to
ſay, the laſt day of <hi>March</hi> in the 26th year aforeſaid, didſt trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
receive Letters from one called <hi>Cardinal de Como,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
unto thee <hi>William Parry,</hi> whereby the ſame Cardinal did
ſignifie unto thee, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had peruſed thy Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and allowed of thine intent; and that to that end he had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94124:44"/>
abſolved thee of all thy Sins, and by the ſame Letter did animate
and ſtir thee to proceed with thine Enterprize; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
thou, the laſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the 26th year aforeſaid,
at Saint <hi>Giles in the fields,</hi> in the ſame County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> didſt
traiterouſly confer with one <hi>Edmund Nevil</hi> Eſquire, uttering to
him all thy wicked and traiterous deviſes, and then and there
didſt move him to aſſiſt thee therein, and to joyn with thee in
thoſe wicked Treaſons aforeſaid, againſt the Peace of our ſaid
Soveraign Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity. What
ſayeſt thou, <hi>William Parry,</hi> Art thou guilty of theſe Treaſons
whereof thou ſtandeſt here Indicted, or not guilty?</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Parry</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry's</hi> anſwer to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</note> Before I plead not guilty, or
confeſs my ſelf guilty, I pray you give me leave
to ſpeak a few words: and with humbling himſelf, began in this
manner. God ſave Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and God ſend me grace to
diſcharge my duty to her, and to ſend you home in charity.
But touching the matters that I am Indicted of, ſome were in one
place, and ſome in another, and done ſo ſecretly, as none can ſee
into them, except that they had eyes like unto God; wherefore
I will not lay my Blood upon the Jury, but do minde to confeſs
the Indictment. It containeth but the parts that have been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read, I pray you tell me? Whereunto it was anſwered, that
the Indictment contained the parts he had heard read, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
whereupon the Clerk of the Crown ſaid unto <hi>Parry, Parry,</hi>
thou muſt anſwer directly to the Indictment, whether thou be
guilty or not.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry</hi> confeſſeth that he is guilty of all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Indictment.</note> I do confeſs that I am guilty
of all that is therein contained: And further
too, I deſire not life, but deſire to die. Unto
which the Clerk of the Crown ſaid, If you confeſs it, you muſt
confeſs it in manner and form as it is compriſed in the Indictment.
Whereunto he ſaid, I do confeſs it in manner and form as the
ſame is ſet down, and all the circumſtances thereof. Then the
Confeſſion being Recorded, the Queens learned Council being
ready to pray Judgment upon the ſame Confeſſion, Maſter Vice-chamberlain
ſaid, Theſe matters contained in this Indictment, and
confeſſed by this man, are of great importance: they touch the
Perſon of the Queens moſt excellent Majeſty in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
the very ſtate and well-doing of the whole Common-wealth,
and the truth of Gods Word eſtabliſhed in theſe her Majeſties
Dominions, and the open demonſtration of that capital envy of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94124:44"/>
the man of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath ſet himſelf againſt God and all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
all good Princes and good Government, and againſt good
men. Wherefore, I pray you, for the ſatisfaction of this great
Multitude, let the whole matter appear, that every one may ſee
that the matter of it ſelf is as bad as the Indictment purporteth,
and as he hath Confeſſed. Whereto in reſpect that the Juſtice of
the Realm hath been of late very impudently ſlandered, all yielded
as a thing neceſſary to ſatisfie the world in particular, of that
which was but ſummarily compriſed in the Indictment, though in
the Law, his Confeſſion ſerved ſufficiently to have proceeded
thereupon unto Judgment. Whereupon the Lords and others
the Commiſſioners, her Majeſties learned Councel, and <hi>Parry</hi>
himſelf agreed, that <hi>Parry</hi>'s Confeſſion (taken the 11th and 13th
of <hi>February</hi> 1584. before the Lord of <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> Maſter Vice-chamberlain,
and Maſter Secretary,) and Cardinal <hi>de Como</hi> his
Letters, and <hi>Parry</hi>'s Letters to the Lord Treaſurer and Lord
Steward, ſhould be openly read.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Parry,</hi> for the better ſatisfying of the people and ſtanders
by, offered to read them himſelf: but being told that the Order
was, the Clerk of the Crown ſhould read them, it was ſo reſolved
of all parts. And then Maſter Vice-chamberlain cauſed to be
ſhewed to <hi>Parry</hi> his ſaid Confeſſion, the Cardinals Letter, and his
own Letter aforeſaid; which after he had particularly viewed
every leaf thereof, he confeſſed, and ſaid openly they were the
ſame.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid Maſter Vice-chamberlain, Before we proceed to ſhew
what he hath Confeſſed, what ſay you, ſaid he to <hi>Parry,</hi> is that
which you have Confeſſed here true, and did you Confeſs it freely
and willingly of your ſelf, or was then any extort means uſed to
draw it from you?</p>
               <p>Surely, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> I made that Confeſſion freely without any
conſtraint, and that is all true, and more too: for there is no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that hath been ſithens the firſt year of the Queen, any way
touching Religion, ſaving receipt of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and perſwading
of others, wherein I have not much dealt, but I have offended in
it. And I have alſo delivered mine opinion in writing, who
ought to be Succeſſor to the Crown, which he ſaid to be Treaſon
alſo.</p>
               <p>Then his Confeſſion of the eleventh and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>February,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry's</hi> Confeſſion of his Treaſons was read by his own aſſent.</note> all of his own hand writing,
and before particularly ſet down, was openly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94124:45"/>
and diſtinctly read by the Clerk of the Crown. And that done,
the Cardinal <hi>di Como</hi> his Letter in Italian was delivered unto <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
hand by the direction of Maſter Vicechamberlain, which
<hi>Parry</hi> there peruſed,<note place="margin">A Letter of Cardinal <hi>di Como</hi> to <hi>Parry,</hi> also read.</note> and openly affirmed to
be wholly of the Cardinals own hand writing,
and the Seal to be his own alſo, and to be with a Cardinals Hat
on it: And himſelf did openly read it in <hi>Italian,</hi> as before is ſet
down. And the words bearing ſence as it were written to a
Biſhop, or to a man of ſuch degree, it was demanded of him by
Maſter Vice-Chamberlain, Whether he had not taken the degree
of a Biſhop? He ſaid, No: But ſaid at firſt, thoſe terms were
proper to the Degree he had taken. And after ſaid, that the
Cardinal did vouchſafe, as of a favour, to write ſo to him. Then
the Copy of that Letter in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as before is alſo ſet down,
was in like manner openly read by the Clerk of the Crown;
which <hi>Parry</hi> then acknowledged to be truely tranſlated.</p>
               <p>And thereupon was ſhewed unto <hi>Parry</hi> his
Letter of the 18th of <hi>February,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry's</hi> Letter of the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> to the Lord Treaſurer and the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> read.</note> written to
the Lord Treaſurer, and the Lord Steward:
which he confeſſed to be all of his own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
and was as before is ſet down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe matters being read openly, for manifeſtation of the
matter,</hi> Parry <hi>prayed leave to ſpeak: Whereto Maſter Vice-chamberlain
ſaid,</hi> If you will ſay any thing for the better opening
to the world of thoſe your foul and horrible Facts, ſpeak on: but if
you mean to make any excuſe of that which you have confeſſed, which
elſe would have been and do ſtand proved againſt you, for my part,
I will not ſit to hear you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then her Majeſties Attourney-General ſtood up and ſaid,</hi> It
appeareth before you, my Lords, that this man hath been Indicted
and Arraigned of ſeveral moſt hainous and horrible Treaſons, and
hath confeſſed them, which is before you of Record; wherefore there
reſteth no more to be done, but for the Court to give Judgment
accordingly,<note place="margin">The Queens Atturny requires Judgment.</note> which here I require in the behalf of
the Queens Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Parry, I pray you hear me for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of my Conſcience. I will not go about to excuſe my ſelf, nor
to ſeek to ſave my Life, I care not for it; you have my Confeſſion of
record, that is enough for my Life. And I mean to utter more, for
which I were worthy to die. <hi>And ſaid,</hi> I pray you hear me, in that
I am to ſpeak to diſcharge my Conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94124:45"/>
Then ſaid Master Vice-Chamberlain, <hi>Parry,</hi> then do thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
according to Conſcience, and utter all that thou canſt ſay
concerning thoſe thy moſt wicked Facts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Parry, My cauſe is rare, ſingular and unnatural, conceived
at <hi>Venice,</hi> preſented in general words to the Pope, undertaken at <hi>Paris,</hi>
commended and allowed of by his Holineſs, and was to have been executed
in <hi>England,</hi> if it had not been prevented. Yea, I have committed many

                     <hi>Parry</hi> had for his credit aforetime ſaid very ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he had been ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited beyond the Seas to commit the fact, but he would not do it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he craftily abuſed both the Queens Majeſty, and thoſe tw<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

my Lord Treaſurers, and Maſter Secretaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then ſaid my L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

thou ſhouldeſt have thy judgment according to that which thou haſt
Confeſſed thy ſelf guilty of, doeſt thou go back again, and deny the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

               <p>Then ſaid Maſter Vice-chamberlain,<note place="margin">Maſter Vice-chamberlains Speeches, proving mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly <hi>Parry's</hi> Traiterous intentions.</note> This
is abſurd. Thou haſt not onely Confeſſed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
that thou wert guilty according to the
Indictment, which ſummarily, and yet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words doth contain that thou hadſt Traiterouſly compaſſed
and intended the death and deſtruction of her Majeſty; but thou
alſo ſaidſt particularly that thou wert guilty of every of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
contained therein, whereof the ſame was one, in plain and
expreſs letter ſet down, and read unto thee. Yea, thou ſaidſt
that thou wert guilty of more Treaſons too beſides theſe. And
didſt thou not upon thy examination voluntarily confeſs, how
thou waſt moved firſt thereunto by miſlike of thy ſtate after thy
departure out of the Realm, And that thou didſt miſlike her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
for that ſhe had done nothing for thee; How by wicked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and Popiſh Books, thou wert perſwaded that it was lawful
to kill her Majeſty; How thou wert by reconciliation become
one of that wicked ſort, that held her Majeſty for neither lawful
Queen nor Chriſtian, And that it was meritorious to kill her?
And didſt thou not ſignifie that thy purpoſe to the Pope by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersand,
receivedſt Letters from the Cardinal, how he allowed of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94124:46"/>
thine intent, and excited thee to perform it, and thereupon didſt
receive Abſolution? And didſt thou not conceive it, promiſe it,
vow it, ſwear it, and receive the Sacrament that thou wouldſt do
it? And didſt not thou thereupon affirm, that thy Vows were in
Heaven, and thy Letters and Promiſes on Earth to binde thee to
do it? And that whatſoever her Majeſty would have done for
thee, could not have removed thee from that intention or purpoſe,
unleſs ſhe would have deſiſted from dealing as ſhe hath done with
the Catholicks, as thou calleſt them? All this thou haſt plainly
Confeſſed: And I proteſt before this great Aſſembly, thou haſt
Confeſſed it more plainly and in better ſort, than my memory will
ſerve me to utter: And ſaiſt thou now, that thou never meant'ſt it?</p>
               <p>Ah, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> your Honours know, how my Confeſſion upon
mine Examination was extorted.</p>
               <p>The both the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> and Maſter Vice-Chamberlain
affirmed, that there was no Torture or threatning words offered
him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Parry</hi> then ſaid, that they told him, that if he would not
confeſs willingly, he ſhould have torture: whereunto their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
anſwered, that they uſed not any ſpeech or word of torture
to him.</p>
               <p>You ſaid, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> that you would proceed with rigour againſt
me, if I would not confeſs it of my ſelf.</p>
               <p>But their Honours expreſly affirmed, that they uſed no ſuch words.
But I will tell thee, ſaid Maſter Vice-chamberlain, what we ſaid. I
ſpake theſe words: If you will willingly utter the truth of your
ſelf, it may do you good, and I wiſh you to do ſo: If you will not,
we muſt then proceed in ordinary courſe to take your Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whereunto you anſwered, that you would tell the truth of
your ſelf.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry</hi> reproved of falſe Speeches, and ſo by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo confeſſed.</note> Was not this true? Which then he
yielded unto.</p>
               <p>And hereunto, her Majeſties Attourney-General
put <hi>Parry</hi> in remembrance what Speeches he uſed to the
Lieutenant of the Tower, the Queens Majeſties Serjeant at Law,
Maſter <hi>Gaudie,</hi> and the ſame Attourney, on Saturday the twentieth
of <hi>February</hi> laſt, at the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon that he was by them then
examined by Order from the Lords: which was, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
he was moſt mildly and favourably dealt with, in all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations:
which he alſo at the Bar then acknowledg'd to be true.</p>
               <p>Then Maſter Vice-chamberlain ſaid, that it was wonder to ſee
the magnanimity of her Majeſty, which after that thou hadſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94124:46"/>
opened thoſe Trayterous Practices in ſort as thou haſt laid it
down in thy Confeſſion, was nevertheleſs ſuch, and ſo far from
all fear, as that ſhe would not ſo much as acquaint any one of her
Highneſs Privy-Council with it, to his knowledge, no not until
after this thine Enterpriſe diſcovered and made manifeſt. And
beſides that which thou haſt ſet down under thine own hand,
thou didſt confeſs, that thou hadſt prepared two <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
fit for ſuch a purpoſe; and thoſe being diſpoſed away
by thee, thou didſt ſay, that another would ſerve thy turn.
And withal, <hi>Parry,</hi> didſt thou not alſo confeſs before us, how
wonderfully thou wert appaled and perplexed upon a ſudden,
at the preſence of her Majeſty at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> this laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
ſaying, that thou didſt think, thou then ſaweſt in her, the
very likeneſs and image of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh? And that
therewith, and upon ſome Speeches uſed by her Majeſty, thou
didſt turn about and weep bitterly to thy ſelf? And yet didſt
call to minde that thy Vows were in Heaven, thy Letters and
Promiſes on Earth; and that therefore thou didſt ſay with thy
ſelf, that there was no remedy but to do it? Didſt thou not
confeſs this? The which he acknowledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then ſaid the Lord</hi> Hunſdon,<note place="margin">The L. of <hi>Hunſdon's</hi> Speeches, convincing <hi>Parry</hi> manifeſtly of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Sayeſt thou
now, that thou didſt never mean to kill the
Queen? Didſt thou not confeſs, that when thou
didſt utter this practice of treachery to her Majeſty,
that thou didſt cover it with all the skill thou hadſt, and that it was
done by thee, rather to get credit and acceſs thereby, than for any
regard thou hadſt of her Perſon? But in truth thou didſt it, that
thereby thou mighteſt have better opportunity to perform thy wicked
Enterpriſe. And wouldeſt thou have run into ſuch fear as thou didſt
confeſs that thou wert in, when thou didſt utter it, if thou
hadſt never meant it? What reaſon canſt thou ſhew for thy ſelf?
<hi>With that he cryed out in a furious manner,</hi> I never meant to kill
her: I will lay my Blood upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and you, before God
and the World: <hi>And thereupon fell into a rage and evil words
with the Queens Majeſties Attourney-General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſaid the Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> This is but thy Popiſh Pride and
Oſtentation, which thou wouldſt have to be told to thy fellows
of that Faction, to make them believe that thou dieſt for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
when thou dieſt for moſt horrible and dangerous Treaſons
againſt her Majeſty, and thy whole Country. For thy laying
of thy Bloud, it muſt lye on thine own Head, as a juſt Reward
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94124:47"/>
of thy wickedneſs. The Laws of the Realm moſt juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thee to die, out of thine own mouth, for the conſpiring the
Deſtruction both of her Majeſty, and of us all: Therefore thy
Bloud be upon thee; neither her Majeſty nor we at any time
ſought it, thy ſelf haſt ſpilt it.</p>
               <p>Then he was asked, What he could ſay, why Judgment of
Death ought not to be awarded againſt him.</p>
               <p>Whereto he ſaid, he did ſee that he muſt die, becauſe he
was not ſettled.</p>
               <p>What meaneſt thou by that, ſaid Maſter Vice-Chamberlain?
Said he, Look into your Study, and into your new Books, and
you ſhall finde what I mean.</p>
               <p>I proteſt (ſaid his Honour) I know not what thou meaneſt:
thou doſt not well to uſe ſuch dark Speeches, unleſs thou wouldſt
plainly utter what thou meaneſt thereby. But he ſaid, he cared
not for Death, and that he would lay his Bloud amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Then ſpake the Lord Chief-Juſtice of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>

and what you mean by being ſettled, I know not; but I ſee
you are ſo ſettled in Popery, that you cannot ſettle your ſelf to
be a good Subject. But touching that you ſhould ſay, to ſtay
Judgment from being given againſt you, your Speeches muſt be
of one of theſe kinds, either to prove the Indictment (which
you have confeſſed to be true) to be inſufficient in Law; or elſe
to plead ſomewhat touching her Majeſties Mercy, why Juſtice
ſhould not be done of you. All other Speeches, wherein you
have uſed great Liberty, is more than by Law you can ask.
Theſe be the matters you muſt look to, what ſay you to them?
Whereto he ſaid nothing.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid the Lord Chief-Juſtice, <hi>Parry,</hi> thou haſt been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time Indicted of divers moſt horrible and hateful Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
committed againſt thy moſt gracious Soveraign and Native
Country: the matter moſt deteſtable, the manner moſt ſubtle
and dangerous, and the occaſions and means that led thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
moſt ungodly and villanous. That thou didſt intend it,
it is moſt evident by thy ſelf. The matter was the deſtruction
of a moſt Sacred and an Anointed Queen, thy Sovereign and
Miſtriſs, who hath ſhewed thee ſuch Favour, as ſome thy betters
have not obtained: Yea, the Overthrow of thy Country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou wert born, and of a moſt happy Commonwealth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94124:47"/>
of thou art a Member, and of ſuch a Queen, as hath beſtowed
on thee the Benefit of all benefits in this world, that is, thy Life,
heretofore granted thee by her Mercy, when thou hadſt loſt it by
Juſtice and Deſert. Yet thou her Servant, ſworn to defend her,
meant'ſt with thy bloudy hand to have taken away her Life, that
mercifully gave thee thine, when it was yielded into her hands:
This is the matter wherein thou haſt offended. The manner
was moſt ſubtle and dangerous, beyond all that before thee have
committed any Wickedneſs againſt her Majeſty. For thou,
making ſhew as if thou wouldeſt ſimply have uttered for her
ſafety the Evil that others had contrived, didſt but ſeek thereby
credit and acceſs, that thou mighteſt take the apter opportunity
for her Deſtruction. And for the occaſions and means that drew
thee on, they were moſt ungodly and villanous, as the perſwaſions
of the Pope, of Papiſts, and Popiſh Books. The Pope pretendeth
that he is a Paſtor, when as in truth, he is far from feeding of
the Flock of Chriſt; but rather as a Wolf, ſeeketh but to feed on
and to ſuck out the blood of true Chriſtians, and as it were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
after the bloud of our moſt Gracious and Chriſtian Queen.
And theſe Papiſts and Popiſh Books, while they pretend to ſet
forth Divinity, they do indeed moſt ungodly teach and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
that which is quite contrary both to God and his Word.
For the Word teaches Obedience of Subjects towards Princes,
and forbideth any private man to kill: But they teach Subjects to
diſobey Princes, and that a private wicked perſon may kill;
yea, and whom? A moſt godly Queen, and their own natural
and moſt gracious Soveraign. Let all men therefore take heed how
they receive any thing from him, hear or read any of their Books,
and how they confer with any Papiſts. God grant her Majeſty,
that ſhe may know by thee, how ever ſhe truſt ſuch like to come
ſo near her Perſon. But ſee the end, and why thou didſt it;
and it will appear to be a moſt miſerable, fearful, and fooliſh
thing: For thou didſt imagine, that it was to relieve thoſe, that
thou calleſt Catholicks, who were moſt likely amongſt all others
to have felt the worſt of it, if thy deviliſh practice had taken
effect. But ſith thou haſt been Indicted of the Treaſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in the Indictment,<note place="margin">The Form of the Judgment againſt the Traitor.</note> and thereupon Arraigned,
and haſt confeſſed thy ſelf Guilty of them, the

hence to the place whence thou didſt come, and ſo drawn through
the open City of <hi>London</hi> upon an Hurdle to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94124:48"/>
and there to be hanged and let down alive, and thy privy
parts cut off, and thy entrals taken out and burnt in thy ſight, then
thy Head to be cut off, and thy Body to be divided in four parts, and
to be diſpoſed at her Majeſties pleaſure: And God have mercy
on thy Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parry</hi> nevertheleſs perſiſted ſtill in his rage and fond Speech,
and ragingly there ſaid, he there ſummoned Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
to anſwer for his Blood before God: wherewith, the Lieutenant
of the <hi>Tower</hi> was commanded to take him from the Bar, and ſo
he did. And upon his departure, the people ſtricken as it were
at heart with the horror of his intended Enterpriſe, ceaſed not,
but purſued him with out-cryes, as, Away with the Traitor, away
with him, and ſuch like: whereupon he was conveyed to the
Barge, to paſs to the <hi>Tower</hi> again by water, and the Court was
adjorned.</p>
               <p>After which,<note place="margin">2. Martii. <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Traytor Executed.</note> upon the ſecond day of this
inſtant <hi>March, William Parry</hi> was by vertue of
proceſs in that behalf, awarded from the ſame Commiſſioners of
<hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> delivered by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the morning, unto the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
who received him at the <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and thereupon, according to
the judgment, cauſed him there to be forthwith ſet on the Hurdel.
From whence he was drawn thereupon threw the midſt of the City
of <hi>London,</hi> unto the place for his Execution in the <hi>Pallace</hi> at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi>
where, having long time of ſtay admitted unto him before his
Execution, he moſt maliciouſly and impudently, after ſome other
vain diſcourſes eftſoons and often delivered in Speech, that he
was never guilty of any intention to kill Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo
(without any requeſt made by him to the people to pray to God
for him, or prayer publickly uſed by himſelf for ought that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but ſuch as he uſed, if he uſed any, was private to himſelf)
he was executed according to the judgment. And now for his
intent, howſoever he pretended the contrary in words, yet by
theſe his own Writings, Confeſſions, Letters, and many other
proofs afore here expreſſed, it is moſt manifeſt to all perſons,
how horrible his intentions and Treaſons were, and how juſtly
he ſuffered for the ſame; and thereby greatly to be doubted,
that as he had lived a long time vainly and ungodly, and like an
Atheiſt and godleſs man, ſo he continued the ſame courſe till his
death to the outward ſight of men.</p>

               <p>FOr as much as <hi>Parry</hi> in the abundance of his proud and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant

pretended ſome great and grievous cauſes of diſcontentment againſt
her Majeſty, and the preſent State: It ſhall not be impertinent,
for better ſatisfaction of all perſons, to ſet forth ſimply and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the condition and quality of the man, what he was by Birth
and Education, and in what courſe of life he had lived.</p>
               <p>This vile and Traiterous Wretch was one of the younger Sons
of a poor man, called <hi>Harry ap David:</hi> he dwelled in <hi>North-Wales</hi>
in a little Village called <hi>Northoppe,</hi> in the County of <hi>Flint:</hi>
there he kept a common Ale-houſe, which was the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtay of his living. In that houſe was this Traitor Born, his
Mother was the reputed Daughter of one <hi>Conway</hi> a Prieſt, Parſon
of a poor Pariſh called <hi>Halkin,</hi> in the ſame County of <hi>Flint:</hi> his
his eldeſt Brother dwelleth at this preſent in the ſame Houſe, and
there keepeth an Ale-houſe as his Father did before him. This
Traitor in his Childhood, ſo ſoon as he had learned a little to Write
&amp; Read, was put to ſerve a poor man dwelling in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> named
<hi>John Fiſher,</hi> who profeſſed to have ſome ſmall skill and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in the Law. With him he continued divers years, and
ſerved as a Clerk, to write ſuch things, as in that Trade which his
maſter uſed, he was appointed. During this time, he learned
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and at ſuch times of leaſure, as the poor
man his Maſter had no occaſion otherwiſe to uſe him, he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to go to the Grammer-School, where he got ſome little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in the Latin Tongue. In this his Childhood he was
noted by ſuch as beſt knew him, to be of a moſt villanous and
dangerous nature and diſpoſition. He did often run away from
his Maſter, and was often taken and brought to him again. His
Maſter, to correct his perverſe and froward conditions, did many
times ſhut him as Priſoner in ſome cloſe place of his houſe, and
many times cauſed him to be chained, locked, and clogged, to
ſtay his running away. Yet all was in vain: For about the third
year of her Majeſties Reign, for his laſt farewel to his poor Maſter,
he ran away from him, and came to <hi>London</hi> to ſeek his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
He was then conſtrained to ſeek what Trade he could to
live by, and to get meat and drink for his belly, and cloaths for
his back. His good hap in the end was to be entertained in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94124:49"/>
place of Service above his Deſert; where he ſtaid not long, but
ſhifted himſelf divers times from Service to Service, and from one
Maſter to another. Now he began to forget his old Home, his
Birth, his Education, his Parents, his Friends, his own Name,
and what he was. He aſpired to greater matters, he challenged
the Name and Title of a great Gentleman, he vaunted himſelf
to be of Kin and allied to Noble and Worſhipful; he left his
old Name, which he did bear and was commonly called by in
his Childhood, and during all the time of his abode in the
Country, which was <hi>William ap Harry</hi> (as the manner in <hi>Wales</hi> is.)
And becauſe he would ſeem to be indeed the man which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
he took upon him the Name of <hi>Parry,</hi> being the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of divers Gentlemen of great Worſhip and Honour. And
becauſe his Mother Name by her Father (a Prieſt) was <hi>Conway,</hi>
he pretended Kindred to the Family of Sir <hi>John Conway,</hi> and
ſo thereby made himſelf of kin to <hi>Edmund Nevil.</hi> Being thus
ſet forth with his new Name and new Title of Gentleman, and
commended by ſome of his good Favourers, he matched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Marriage with a Widow in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> who brought him
ſome reaſonable Portion of Wealth. She lived with him but a
ſhort time, and the wealth he had with her laſted not long: it
was ſoon conſumed with his diſſolute and waſtful manner of life.
He was then driven to his wonted ſhifts, his Creditor were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the Debt which he owed great, he had nothing wherewith
to make Payment, he was continually purſued by Serjeants and
Officers to Arreſt him, he did often by ſlight and ſhifts eſcape
from them. In this his needy and poor eſtate, he ſought to repair
himſelf again by a new match in Marriage with another Widow,
which before was the Wife of one <hi>Richard Heywood;</hi> this matter
was ſo earneſtly followed by himſelf, and ſo effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by his Friends and Favourers, that the Woman yielded
to take him to Husband: a Match in every reſpect very unequal
and unfit; her Wealth and yearly Livelihood was very great,
his poor and baſe Eſtate worſe than nothing; he very young, ſhe
of ſuch age, as for years ſhe might have been his Mother. When
he had thus poſſeſſed himſelf of his new Wives wealth, he
omitted nothing that might ſerve for a prodigal, diſſolute, and
moſt ungodly courſe of Life. His Riot and Exceſs was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable;
he did moſt wickedly deflower his Wives own
Daughter, and ſundry ways pitifully abuſe the old Mother: He
carried himſelf for his outward port and countenance (ſo long as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94124:49"/>
his Old wives Bags laſted) in ſuch ſort, as might well have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for a man of very good haviour and degree. But this
laſted not long; his proud heart and waſtful hand had foon
poured out of <hi>Heywood</hi>'s Wealth. He then fell again to his
wonted ſhifts, borrowed where he could finde any to lend, and
engaged his Credit ſo far as any would truſt him. Amongſt
others, he became greatly indebted to <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
before-named; who after long forbearing of his Money,
ſought to recover it by ordinary means of Law. For this cauſe
<hi>Parry</hi> conceived great diſpleaſure againſt him, which he purſued
with all Malice, even to the ſeeking of his Life. In this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous
intent, he came in the night-time to Mr. <hi>Hares</hi> Chamber
in the <hi>Temple,</hi> broke open the door, aſſaulted him, and wounded
him grievouſly, and ſo left him in great danger of Life. For
this Offence he was Apprehended, Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
of Burglary, Arraigned, and found Guilty
by a very ſubſtantial Jury,<note place="margin">Parry Condemned for Burglary, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of the Queen.</note> 
                  <hi>and Condemned to be
Hanged, as the Law in that Caſe requireth</hi> He
ſtanding thus Convicted, her Majeſty, of
her moſt gracious Clemency, and pitiful Diſpoſition, took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
upon him, pardoned his Offence, and gave him his Life,
which by the Law and due courſe of Juſtice he ought then to
have loſt. After this he carried not long, but pretending ſome
cauſes of diſcontentment, departed the Realm, and travelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas. How he demeaned himſelf there from time to
time, and with whom he converſed, is partly in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
touched before. This is the man, this is his Race, which
he feared ſhould be ſpotted, if he miſcarried in the execution of
his Traiterous Enterpriſe; this hath been the courſe of his Life,
theſe are the great cauſes of his Diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>And whereas at his Arraignment and Execution he pretended
great care of the diſobedient Popiſh Subjects of this Realm,
whom he called Catholicks, and in very inſolent ſort ſeemed to
glory greatly in the Profeſſion of his pretenſed Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
The whole courſe and action of his Life ſheweth plainly,
how profanely and irreligiouſly he did always bear himſelf. He
vaunted, that for theſe two and twenty years paſt he had been
a Catholick, and during all that time never received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
Yet before he travelled beyond the Seas, at three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times within the compaſs of thoſe two and twenty years, he
did voluntarily take the Oath of Obedience to the Queens Majeſty,
ſet down in the Statute made in the firſt year of her Highneſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94124:50"/>
Reign; by which, amongſt other things, he did teſtifie and
declare in his Conſcience, that no Forreign Prince, Perſon, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
State, or Potentate, hath or ought to have any Juriſdiction,
Power, Preeminence, or Authority, Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Realm; and therefore did utterly renounce and forſake
all Forreign Juriſdictions, Powers, and Authorities; and did
promiſe to bear Faith and true Allegeance to the Queens High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
her Heirs and lawful Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>With what Conſcience or Religion he took that Oath ſo often,
if he were then a Papiſt indeed, as ſithence the diſcovery of his
Treaſons he pretended, let his beſt friends the Papiſts themſelves
judge. But perhaps it may be ſaid, that he repented thoſe his
Offences paſt; that ſince thoſe three Oaths ſo taken by him, he
was twice reconciled to the Pope, and ſo his Conſcience cleared,
and he become a new man; and (which is more) that in the
time to his laſt Travel, he caſt away all his former lewd manners:
that he changed his degree and habit, and bought or begged the
grave Title of a Doctor of Law, for which he was well qualified
with a little Grammar-School <hi>Latine;</hi> that he had Plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
and Remiſſion of all his Sins, in conſideration of his
undertaking of ſo holy an Enterpriſe as to kill Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
a ſacred anointed Queen, his Natural and Soveraign Lady: That
he promiſed to the Pope, and vowed to God to perform it: that
he confirmed the ſame by receiving the Sacrament at the Jeſuits,
at one Altar with his two <hi>Beaupeers,</hi> the Cardinals of <hi>Vendoſme</hi>
and <hi>Narbonne:</hi> And that ſince his laſt return into <hi>England,</hi> he did
take his Oath upon the Bible to execute it. Theſe Reaſons may
ſeem to bear ſome weight indeed amongſt his Friends the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
and other Papiſts of State, who have ſpecial Skill in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſuch importance.</p>
               <p>But now lately in the beginning of this Parliament in <hi>November</hi>
laſt, he did eftſoons ſolemnly in publick place take the Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, of obedience to her Majeſty. How that may
ſtand with his reconciliations to the Pope, and with his Promiſes,
Vows, and Oath to kill the Queen, it is a thing can hardly be
warranted, unleſs it be by ſome ſpecial priviledge of the Popes
omnipotency.</p>
               <p>But let him have the glory he deſired, to live and die a Papiſt.
He deſerved it, it is fit for him, his death was correſpondent to
the courſe of his life, which was diſloyal, perjured, and Traiterous
towards her Majeſty, and falſe and perfidious towards the Pope
himſelf, and his Catholicks, if they will believe his ſolemn proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94124:50"/>
which he made at his Arraignment and Execution, that he
never meant nor intended any hurt to her Highneſs Perſon. For
if that be true, where are then his Vows which he ſaid were in
Heaven, his Letter and Promiſe upon Earth? Why hath he ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out of the Popes ſhop ſo large an Indulgence and plenary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of all his Sins, and meant to perform nothing that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?
Why was his Devotion and Zeal ſo highly commended?
Why was he ſo ſpecially prayed for and remembred at the Altar?
All theſe great favours were then beſtowed upon him without
cauſe or deſert: for he deceived the Pope, he deceived the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
and Jeſuites, with a falſe ſemblance, and pretence to do
that thing which he never meant.</p>
               <p>But the matter is clear, the Conſpiracy, and his traiterous intent
is too plain and evident: it is the Lord that revealed it in time,
and prevented their malice: there lacked no will, or readineſs in
him to execute that horrible fact. It is the Lord that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
her Majeſty from all the wicked Practices and Conſpiracies
of that Helliſh Rabble: it is he that hath moſt gratiouſly deliver'd
her from the hands of this Traiterous miſcreant. The Lord is her
onely defence, in whom ſhe hath always truſted.</p>

known the time of our viſitation: we have deſerved utter deſtruction.
But thou, O Lord, art merciful, and ready to forgive; therefore we
come to thy Throne of Grace, confeſſing and acknowledging thee to
be our only refuge in all times of peril and danger: And by the means
of thy Son, we moſt heartily pray thee to forgive us our Vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
Diſobedience Hypocriſie, and all other our Sins; to turn
from us thy heavy wrath and diſpleaſure, which we have juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
and to turn our hearts truly unto thee, that daily we may
increaſe in all goodneſs, and continually more and more fear thy holy
Name: So ſhall be glorifie thy Name, and ſing unto thee in Pſalms,
and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs: And thy enemies and ours ſhall
know themſelves to be but men, and not able by any means to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
thee, nor to hurt thoſe whom thou haſt received into thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and defence. Grant theſe things, O Lord of Power, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Mercy, for thy Chriſt's ſake; to whom with thee and thy Holy
Spirit, be all Honour and Glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

which have ever of old ſeen thy Salvation, do fall down and proſtrate our ſelves with
Praiſe and Thankſgiving to thy glorious Name, who haſt in thy tender Mercies from
time to time ſaved and defended thy Servant ELIZABETH, our moſt gracious
Quéen, not only from the hands of ſtrange Children, but alſo of late revealed and made
fruſtrate his bloody and moſt barbarous Treaſon, who being her natural Subject, moſt
unnaturally violating thy Divine Ordinance, hath ſecretly ſought to ſhed her blood,
to the great diſquiet of thy Church, and utter diſcomfort of our Souls: his ſnare is
hewen in pieces, but upon thy Servant doth the Crown flouriſh. The wicked and
bloodthirſty men think to debour Iacob, and to lay waſte his dwelling place: But thou
(O God) which ruleſt in Iacob, and unto the ends of the world, doſt daily teach
us ſtill a truſt in thée for all thy great Mercies, and not to forget thy merciful Kindneſs
ſhewed to her, that feareth thy Name. O Lord, we confeſs to thy Glory and Praiſe,
that thou only haſt ſaved us from deſtruction, becauſe thou haſt not given her over for a
prey to the wicked: Her Soul is delivered, and we are eſcaped. Hear us now we pray
thée, (O moſt merciful Father) and continue forth thy loving Kindneſs towards thy
Servant, and evermore to thy Glory and our Comfort, kéep her in health, with long
Life, and Proſperity; whoſe reſt and only refuge is in thée, O God of her Salvation.
Preſerve her, as thou art wont, preſerve her from the ſnare of the Enemy, from the
gathering together of the froward, from the inſurrection of wicked Doers, and from
all the traiterous Conſpiracies of thoſe which privily lay wait for her life. Grant this,
O Heavenly Father, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, our only Mediator and Advocate, Amen.</p>
