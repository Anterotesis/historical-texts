         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
EPISTLE
To all ſuch as obſerve the Seventh-day of the Week for
A SABBATH
TO THE LORD.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN true love to your ſouls, and in the fear of the Lord I have a
few things to lay before you, that the ſimplicity in you may
not be deceived, and yee err from the way of life, while yee
may be eagerly ſeeking and preſſing towards it: For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that, if with the wrong eye yee be ſearching into
Scripture, ye muſt needs miſ-read, miſ-underſtand, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practice;
and ſo thereby will ſtill be running further and further
from God, even while yee think yee are drawing nigher towards
him. Be perſwaded therefore ſeriouſly to conſider (out of the
wiſdome from which God hides, in the Babiſh ſimplicity of his
begetting, where the true life ſprings) theſe few things following.</p>
            <p>1. That the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (the ten words, as well as the
inſtitutions about ſacrifices and worſhip) was added becauſe of
tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>2. That the whole Law (the ten words, as well as the ſacrifices)
were repreſentations, figures or ſhadows of ſomewhat relating to
Chriſt the ſeed, ſubſervient to the promiſe not making perfect,
but pointing to, and making way for the bringing in of the
better hope, <hi>Gal. 3. 21. Heb.</hi> 7. 19. The Law of Commandements,
or the ten words did no more make perfect, than the other ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
or ſacrifices did, but with them made way for the better
hope, towards which they were to lead their Schollar or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as a School-maſter.</p>
            <p>3. That the whole diſpenſation of the Law was given to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and not to the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 9. 4. and ſo not any thing there
written bindeth the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (as there written) but onely the <hi>Jews.</hi>
God had another way of making his mind known to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
Rom.</hi> 1. 19. and 2. 15. according to which he would judge
them, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and not by the <hi>Law</hi> written, which was given to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> which ſpake not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but to the <hi>Jews</hi> who
were under it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>4. That the duration of this diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in
the Letter, was till Chriſt, the ſeed ſhould come and fulfill it, <hi>Gal.
3.</hi> 19. and <hi>ver. 24, 25. Moſes</hi> his family with all the Laws thereof,
were to prepare for Chriſt the ſeed, and to give way to him
when he came: For when that diſpenſation which was figured
out, is come; then that diſpenſation which did figure it out, is
at an end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5, 6. Chriſt came to do the will, to keep and
fulfill the whole Law, and ſo to put an end to that diſpenſation
of it, <hi>Pſal. 40. Rom.</hi> 10. 4. And ſo he taketh away the firſt Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Law, which was in the letter, that he might
eſtabliſh the ſecond, which is in the Spirit, <hi>Heb. 10. 9. 2 Cor.
3.</hi> 7, 11.</p>
            <p>This then is the truth, as it is in <hi>Jeſus</hi> concerning this thing,
That <hi>Chriſt</hi> comming in the fleſh, and fulfilling all the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(as well of the ten Commandements, as of the ſacrifices)
puts an end to that diſpenſation wholly: So that henceforth
both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are to come to him, to hear his voice,
<hi>this is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> foretold, that when
that Prophet came, he was to be heard in all things; whoſe whole
Miniſtration was but to figure out what the Son was afterwards
to fulfill in ſpirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5. Who would be faithfull to give forth
the entire law and ſubſtance of life to his houſe or family of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful to give the entire ſhadow to his Houſe or
Family of that Nation of the <hi>Jews, ver.</hi> 6. So that here, in the
Goſpell, Chriſt being come, the new Covenant and Law in the Spirit
takes place, and not the old Covenant or Law in the letter. And this
Law is more inward, more full, more cloſe, more ſpirituall,
and more laſting, then the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to them of
old time was, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 25. &amp;c. And it is the miniſtration of this
Law of the Spirit which is not to paſſe away from the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt, untill all be fulfilled; but is to remain a Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
every luſt and deſire of the fleſh in them, untill they all
with the very root of them be thereby cut down, <hi>Mat. 3. 12. Heb.
4. 12. Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what were the ten Commandements a figure or ſhadow of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Tables of ſtone were a repreſentation or figure
of the fleſhly Tables of the heart, wherein the new Law of the
Covenant of life is written.</p>
            <p>The writing of the Law of Commandements in the Tables
of ſtone, was a figure of the writing of this new Law by the
finger of Gods Spirit in the heart. The outward writing in
the outward Tables, was a figure of the inward writing in the
inward Tables.</p>
            <p>The Law it ſelf of Commandements, which was written in
thoſe Tables, was a figure of the Law of life which is to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in theſe Tables.</p>
            <p>And this Law thus received, thus written, is eaſily fulfilled,
whereas the Law in the letter, becauſe of the weakneſſe of the fleſh
was very hard to be fulfilled, and generally proved an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
of Ordinances againſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> For he that was guilty
of one, was guilty of all, and ſo upon every tranſgreſſion
had the force and ſtrength of the whole Law againſt him.
And whoſoever now runs back to the Law in the letter, to take
up any command as held forth in it, and ſo making himſelf
a debter thereto, will be found a breaker thereof in Spirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
one that hath more Gods then the Lord, a maker of Images
or likneſſes of things in heaven, or things in earth, if not of
both, a taker of the Name in vain, a prophaner of the Sabbath,
&amp;c. For he that hath not received the Law of the Spirit of life
in Chriſt Jeſus, knoweth not the Lord of life to be the onely
true God, but maketh Images in his mind, and taketh his Name
in vain, not feeling the living power thereof, nor can keep his
Sabbath (ceaſing from ſin, forbearing his own works, his own
willing and running, and entring into the reſt of the Goſpell)
for there is but one day of reſt holy to the Lord; all the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
of the Law were but ſignes of it, having but a ſignificative
or repreſentative holyneſſe; but the day of redemption which
the Lord hath made, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24. (in which his redeemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and reſt to him) that hath the true holyneſſe. This
was it which came by Chriſt, the other came by <hi>Moſes, Joh. 1. 17.
Moſes</hi> his family or children were to keep that day (that was the
day for the ſervants, who were to be exerciſed under the ſhadows)
but the believers are to keep this day in the Spirit, to enter into
this reſt by the faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. And to worſhip the Father in it,
in the Spirit, and in the truth, on the Mountain of his holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23. Whereof the other Mountain, Temple, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and day was but a ſhadow.</p>
            <p>Now the ſum or ſubſtance of this Law of the Spirit, may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
be ſignified in divers ſhort words, as <hi>Love,</hi> that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the whole of it, ſo doth <hi>fear;</hi> there is the whole wiſdom
and courſe of the life comprehended alſo: or thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not luſt,</hi> (thus it was adminiſtred to <hi>Paul, Rom. 7.)</hi> or <hi>thou ſhalt
keep the Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>believe in the light, folow the light.</hi> The
obſerving of any one of theſe in the Spirit, is the keeping of
the Law; for every breach of the Law is out of the love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
out of the fear, a luſt of the fleſhly Spirit, a tranſgreſſion of
the Sabbath, or ſpirituall reſt to God, out of the light, and
out of the faith. But if ye will read this in the Spirit, and
come to the true righteouſneſſe of the faith, which is received
in the obedience of faith, to the Law of the Spirit, ye muſt come
to the word of faith, to which <hi>Paul</hi> directs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. by the
hearing whereof is the juſtification, and not by a bare believing
that Chriſts blood was ſhed: for it is the vertue of the blood
which ſaves, which vertue is in the living word, and is felt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in hearing, believing, and obeying that word, thereby
bringing into unity and conformity with him both in his death,
and in his reſurrection and life. This is the onely way to life,
be not deceived: there is not, nor ever was any other. O wait
on the Lord in his fear, that it may be opened to you, and that
ſlain in you which cannot bear the ſtraitneſſe thereof, and with
which there is no entring.</p>
