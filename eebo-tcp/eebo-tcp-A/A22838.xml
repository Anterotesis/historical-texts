            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But enough of the cauſes of dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
a word or two by your graces
leaue of the reaſons, why this worke
is tranſlated. Taking delight in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of thoſe heauenly conceipts of S.
Augustin, I purpoſed for the priuate
intertaineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that time, which obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
left vnto my choice, to put them
into English as carefully as I could,
and then exhibiting my labour to my
ſuperiours, as an account how I ſpent
my leaſure, they thought good to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
it, although it had before bene
tranſlated, which I neuer knew; for
the tranſlator M. Rogers, insteed of
giuing the deuout reader the true
works of S. Augustin, tooke vpon him
preſumptuouſly to mangle, and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
them in all ſuch places, as the holy
Doctor had writte directly contrary
to Protestanticall doctrine, forcing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1635:8"/>
him to ſpeake like an hereticke in all
points, of prayer vnto Saints, merits of
good workes, ſuffrages for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
departed, &amp; ſuch other, as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
do occurre in ſpirituall exerciſes:
in which S. Augustin most plainely,
and clearelye ſpeaking as a true Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
catholike, this ſaucie controller
M. Rogers, either peruerteth his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to Puritaniſme, or els leaueth them
out, euen whole chapters, as if he were
more illuminated with the grace of
God, and knowledge of truth, then
that glorious Doctor, eſteemed, euen
by our aduerſaries, the learnedst mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
that euer the Church had ſince
the Apoſtles. And where S. Auguſtin,
in the feruour of his deuotion, with
moſt eloquent, and wary tearmes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth
vnto his ſoule, and the
readers thoughts, the dolefull ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of our Sauiours paſsion this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
hereticke leaueth all that out,
or els wickedlie transformeth it,
cenſuring it as eſcapes, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights,

when it is most euident that

yet is the man to be commended, that
he doth not this by stelth, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
as most of that faction doe,
but openly, and plainely profeſsing
his fact in his prefaces, and yeelding
particular accompt thereof; but no
other reaſon ſauing the credit of his

of knights errants, as Amadis,
Palmerin, and the like, as if they had
beene published by crafty papists, as
he calls them, to peruert Proteſtants,
whom they could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſute with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations:

both Rogers, and Aſcam his authour
whom he cites, were not of ſo little
reading, but in their conſcience they
knew, that all ſuch bookes are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
very ſtrictly to be read in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
church by any of her faithfull
children, and condemned by the rules
of the expurgatorie Index, appointed
by order of the great Councell of
Trent, and drawne out by most indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,

how to auoid the venini, and

Index, it is a wonder how theſe men
dare preſume to find fault with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

words, and doctrines in late Authors,
where as they preſume, by their owne

confeſsion, to blott out all words, and
doctrines contrarie to their falſe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,

All which I haue preſumed to
ſay in this ſpeech vnto your Lordship,
for the better instruction of all
Catholicke readers, who in reading
this preface, I doubt not but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
with me, &amp; glorifie God for the
great honour, and bleſsings both tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
and ſpirituall powred forth
abondantly vpon your grace, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the reſistance made by
enuie, and emulation; and that in your
bannishment in a strange countrey;
though indeed France is not a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
countrey vnto the Giffords, whoſe
noble family hath its originall ſtock,
and florisheth yet at this day in little
Britanie, and other parts of France,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1635:10"/>
and from thence ſent forth its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
into the greater Britany, with
ſuch proſperous ſucceſſe, that it gaue
to England the Dukes of Buckingam,
and remaineth as yet a principall
branch of that houſe; ſo that it may
ſeeme France hath made estimation of
your grace, not onely prouoked ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
by your learning, and vertues,
but euen by the ſecret instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
gladly embracing the good which
ſprung first from its owne ſoyle.</p>
            <p>I haue added certaine verſes, and
a deuout conſideration of Bleſſed S.
Peter Damian Cardinall of Ostia, &amp;
monke of our order, a man in thoſe
dayes ſo profitablie, and feruently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
by the churches commaundment
for his admirable zeale, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
eloquence in reducing Schiſmatic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and Sectaries of Italie, that your
grace may ſeeme to haue placed him
before your eies, as a patterne of your
actions, and the gouernement of your
Dioceſe. The verſes were heretofore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1635:10"/>
nameleſſe in many Latin editions of
theſe works, but now adiudged by the
learned to be S. Peter Damians. The
conſideration alſo, taken out of the
ſame Saints works, ſeemed to me, for
the profit therof, to be a fitt end, and
concluſion of this my tranſlation, as
a point most neceſſarie to remaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
in the memorie of the faithfull
reader.</p>
            <p>All this I offer vnto your grace, by
the commaundment of my Superiours,
and myne owne deſire, in the name of
all English Benedictins, whoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
vnto almighty God shall neuer be
wanting for the long life, health,
and proſperous direction of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lordshippe in all vertue, and
happineſse. From my Cell in Dieule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart,
your Lordshipps beloued mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,

that wiſedome, which was created ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
(to witt Nature) by contemplation

wiſedome likewiſe (albeit created) is
termed wiſedome. Neuertheles there is as

which is created, as is betweene the light,

For we likewiſe (accordinge to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie

                     <p>Sithence therefore a certaine kinde of

we doe not find any time before this

of it ſelfe ſubiect to mutabilitie, by

were it not that beinge by greate loue

For as the Father is referred to the ſonne,

doe equallie agree to all three perſonnes;

We ſay o Father) that thou art naturallie

God, and the holy Ghoſt is naturallie God:
and yett there are not three Gods, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie

                     <p>Thou therefore (o ſacred Trinitie) are

And indeede this is a plaine proofe
that the perſonnes in the ſacred Trinitie

                     <p>O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, my redemption,

and giue thee thankes, albeit farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

ſoe muche as I knowe is due, yet at leaſt I
deſire to loue thee, ſoe muche as I ought

                     <p>Thou ſeeſt my conſcience o my light,

Lord of heauen and earthe. Becauſe I am
become wretched, and as one turned to
nothing, and I knewe it not: becauſe I
wanted thee, who art the truth. My ſinnes
wounded me, and I felt it not, becauſe I
wanted thee, that art my life. They
brought me to nothing, becauſe I wanted
thee, who art the Worde, by whom all
thinges are made, without whom nothing
is made; Being therfore without thee, I
became nothing, becauſe that is nothing,
that bringeth vs to nothing. All thinges
that were made, were made by thy
Worde: But how were they made? God
behelde all thinges he had made, and they
were exceeding good. All thinges ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that are made, are made by the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
and all thinges that are made by the
Worde, are exceeding good. Whie are
they good? Becauſe all thinges are made
by the Worde, and without it is made
nothing, for that there is nothing good,
which proceedeth not from God the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
good.</p>
                     <p>Contrarie wiſe, that is euill, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
in it ſelfe noe good, and this euill
is a meere nothing, for that euill is nothing
els, but the want of good, euen as blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denes
is nothing els, but the want of
ſight Euill therefore is a meere nothing,
becauſe it is made without the Worde,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1635:104"/>
without which, there is made nothinge.
And that is to be accompted euill, which
wanteth that good, by which all thinges
whaſoeuer are made. But thoſe thinges
that are not, are not made by him, and
conſequentlie they are nothing. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the cauſe, why thoſe thinges are
euill, which are not made, becauſe all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whatſoeuer are made, are made by
the Worde, and all thinges that are made
by the Worde, are good. And ſithence all
thinges that are made, are made by the
Worde, thoſe thinges, that are euill, are
not made by him.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth therefore, that all thinges,
that are not made, are not good, becauſe
all thinges, that are made, are good: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
it followeth, that thoſe thinges are euill,
which are not made, and conſequentlie
are nothing, becauſe without the Worde
there is made nothing. Euill therfore is
nothing, becauſe it is not made. What is
it then, if it be not made? Surelie nothing
els but the priuation, and want of that
good, by which good is made. Wherfore
to be without the Worde is euill, which
cannot properly be fared to be, becauſe
without the Worde there is nothing.</p>
                     <p>But what is it to be ſeparated from the
Worde? If you deſire to knowe this, heare
firſt what the Worde is. The diuine worde
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1635:105"/>
ſaieth of himſelfe, I am the way, the truth,

the Worde, is to be without the way, the
truth, and the life, &amp; therfore to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, is to be nothing, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
euill, becauſe it is ſeparated from the
Worde, by which all thinges were made
exceeding good. To be ſeparated therfore
from the Worde, by which all thinges
were made, is nothing els, but to ceaſe to
be, and returne to nothing, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the worde there is nothing; wherfore
as often as thou doſt ſwarue from that
which is good, thou doſt ſeperate thy ſelfe
from the Worde (which is the true good)
and ſoe thou becommeſt nothing, becauſe
thou art without the Worde, without
which there is made nothing.</p>
                     <p>Beholde (o Lord) thou haſt enlightned
me, to the end, I might beholde thee, by
which meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I haue ſeene and knowen
my ſelfe: being now aſſured, that as often
as I haue been ſeperated from thee, I haue

thee the onely true good, and ſoe by
that meanes haue become euill. Poore
wretche that I am, how came it to paſſe,
that I did not knowe eare this time, that
forſaking thee, I became nothing? But
why doe I demaunde that queſtion? For
how coulde I deſire to knowe thee, if I

was nothing? We knowe full well, that
euill is nothing, and that which is nothing
hath noe being, that likewiſe which is not
good, hath noe being, becauſe it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
If therfore I was nothing, when I

What will then hinder vs to
be almoſt equall to the Angells? whom
thou (o Lord) at that time wilt crowne
with a crowne of hope, which is adorned
with glorie and renowne: whom thou

They are equall to the Angells, and are

I haue heretofore vaunted that I was riche

ſaied with my ſelfe, I ſhall become a wiſe

that I might knowe my ſelfe, becauſe (as

all the good we haue, be it little or greate,

                     <p>Whereof then ſhall any mortall man
glorie? ſhall he glorie of his iniquitie? This
is not glorie, but meere miſerie. Shall he

glorie of that which is an others? becauſe
all goodnes and glorie is thine (o Lord)
and belongeth to thee. He therfore, that
vſurpeth that glorie to himſelfe that is due
to thee, is a theefe and a robber, and like
vnto the diuell, who deſired to bereaue
thee of thy glorie. For he that deſireth to
be prayſed in reſpect of the guift which
thou haſt giuen him, and doth not ſeeke
thy glorie therein, but his owne; albeit in

yet by thee he is thought worthy of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
for that with that guift which thou
haſt giuen him, he hath not ſought thy
glory, but his owne. But he that is praiſed
of men, being by thee thought worthy of
blame, will not be defended by men,
when thou ſhalt judge him, nor freede by
them, when thou ſhalt condemne him.</p>
                     <p>Thou therfore (o Lord) who didſt

                     <p>When I haue ſtoode vpright, it hath
been by thy aſſiſtance: when I haue fallen,

for euer haue remained in the mire, if

I ſhoulde for euer, haue beene blind, if

was fallen I ſhould neuer haue riſen, if
thou hadſt not with thy hand rayſed me;
yea after thou haſt rayſed me, I ſhoulde
haue fallen againe immediately, if thou

                     <p>Thus (o Lord) and in this manner hath
thy grace and mercy preuented me from

I knowe (o Lord) that there is noe

me to abſtaine from iniquity,
giuing me thy grace, that I might belieue

Becauſe whoſoeuer walketh in the day

which is a thing, that aboue others

that knoweth not that he is fallen, is by

art the light of my minde, enlighten mine

I may not fall in the ſight of mine aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
For our aduerſarie the Diuell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth

                     <p>Becauſe he (o Lord) is the firſt and laſt

And now (o Lord my God, and my life)

confeſſe vnto thee (o Lord my deliuerer)
and call to minde all the benefits, which

I knowe that ingratitude doth very

hindering the fountaine of thy diuine

whereof our euill actions that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen

                     <p>Wherefore o Lord my deliuerer, I will
giue thee thankes, leaſt I be founde to be
vngratefull vnto thee, for that thou haſt
deliuered me. As often as that infernall
Dragon hath ſwallowed me downe, thou
(o Lord) haſt drawen me violently out of
his mouth. As often as I haue ſinned, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1635:128"/>
he was ready to deuoure me, thou (o Lord
my God) haſt preſerued me. When I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
thee by breaking thy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
he ſtoode readie to hale me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to hell, if thou hadſt not hindered
him. I did offend thee, and thou didſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
me. I did not reſpect thee, yet thou
didſt protect me. I departed from thee,
ſeeking to ioyne my ſelfe to mine aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,
and thou didſt affright him, to the
end he ſhoulde not entertaine me.</p>
                     <p>Theſe benefits (o Lord my God) thou
didſt beſtowe vpon me, and I knew it not.
Truly thou haſt diuers times dealt in this
mercifull manner with me, deliueringe
me out of the iawes of the Diuell, ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
me out of the mouthe of the Lion,
yea thou haſt often times ſaued me, from
fallinge into the pitt of eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I little thinking whither I was going.
Verily I haue deſcended to the very gates,
and thou haſt kept me from entring in. I
drewe nigh to the dores of death, and by
meanes of thee, they haue not beene ſhutt
vpon me.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt deliuered me many times (o

the like manner. When greuious ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
did afflict me, when diuers dangers
did affright me, thou (o Lord) didſt ſtill
aſſiſt, and mercifullie ſaue me, deliuering
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1635:128"/>

                        </gap>ruly (o Lord) didſt knowe full
well, that if then I had chanced to dye,
my ſoule had gone to hell, and I ſhoulde
haue beene damned euerlaſtinglie. But thy
mercy and grace (o Lord my God) hath
preuented me, ſauing me from the death
both of ſoule and body. Theſe and many
other benefits thou haſt beſtowed vpon
me, and I was blinde &amp; did not perceiue
it, vntill thou didſt enlighten me.</p>

for which I doe hartely thanke thee, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

thee. Becauſe thou art my onely God, my
kinde creator, who loueſt our ſoules, and
hateſt nothing that thou haſt made.</p>
                     <p>Beholde I (o Lord the cheife of al thoſe
ſinners, that thou haſt ſaued, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
and acknowledge the manifolde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
which I haue receiued from thee,

from the loweſt hell, not once, or twice,
or thrice onely, but an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, yea a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
times. I alwaies went on towardes
hell, and thou didſt bring me back againe
continuallie, ſoe that, if thou wouldeſt,
thou mighteſt a thouſand times haue
iuſtly damned me. Yet thou wouldeſt,
not, becauſe thou doſt loue our ſoules,
and in hope that we will amend and doe
pennance, thou doſt as it were winke at
our wickednes, o Lord our God of much
mercy in all thy wayes.</p>
                     <p>Now therfore (o Lord my God) I doe
ſee and perceiue theſe thinges, by meanes
of the light, which thou haſt giuen me,
and my ſoule doth as it were faint by
thinking of thy maruailous greate mercy
towardes me; for that thou haſt deliuered
my ſoule from the deepeſt hell, and haſt
reſtored me to life. I was wholie deade, &amp;
thou haſt wholie rayſed me.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore ſithence that my whole life

                     <p>I haue alreadie acknowledged vnto thee
o Lord my God (who art the prayſe of
my life, and the force of my ſaluation)
that I did heeretofore truſt in my owne

not ſtrength, but rather preſumption. For
as long as I did runne on after that faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
I alwaies founde my ſelfe there moſt

my ſelfe moſt firme, ſoe that (by running

whatſoeuer I thought my ſelfe beſt able
to doe, I haue alwaies been leaſt able to
performe. I oftentimes ſaied, I will doe
this, or that, and yet in fine I did neither
of them. When I was willing to doe
any thing, I founde my ſelfe vnable,

vnwilling, becauſe I did preſume of mine

(not ſeeing thee then as we doe now obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely

be fullie contented and ſatisfied, for that
there will be noe other externall thinge

thee (o Lord) the ſupreame and chiefeſt

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1635:162"/>
bleſſed, the crowne or diademe of theire

ſhall enuiron theire heades, giuing them
peace both without and within, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of thy peace, which paſſeth all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
There we ſhall ſee thee, loue
thee, and pray ſe thee.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall ſee light in thy light, for that
with thee is the fountaine of life, and in
thy light we ſhall ſee light. But what
light? Surely, ſurpaſſing greate light, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
light, inccorruptible and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
light, infaileable and vnquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheable
light, a light vnto which noe man
can approache or attaine, light vncreated,
true, and diuine, which enlightneth the
eies of the Angells, which maketh the
youth of the Saincts for to reioyce and
be gladde, which is the light of lights,
and fountaine of life, euen thou thy ſelfe
o Lord my God. For thou art the light, in
whoſe light we ſhal ſee light; that is to ſay,
we ſhall ſee thee in thy ſelfe, in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of thy countenance, when we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
thee face to face.</p>
                     <p>Now what other thinge is it, to beholde
thee face to face, but (according as the
Apoſtle ſayeth) to knowe thee, euen as I
am knowen, to knowe thy truthe, and
thy glorie? To knowe thy face therfore
is nothinge elſe, but to knowe the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1635:163"/>
power of the Father, the wiſedome of the
Sonne, the mercie of the holie Ghoſt, the
eſſence of the moſt highe Trinitie, being
vndiuided, and one onely. Wherfore to
beholde the face of the liuing God, is the
chiefeſt good, the ioy of the Angells, and
of all the Saincts, the recompence of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, the glorie of the bleſſed ſpirits
the euerlaſtinge gladnes, the crowne of

of God, the celeſtiall Hieruſalem,
the happie life, the fulnes of felicitie, the
delight of eternitie, the peace of God,
which paſſeth all vnderſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Mans whole bliſſe therefore, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
doth conſiſt in beholding the face
of his God, to ſee him that hath made
heauen and earthe, to ſee him that hath
made him, that hath ſaued him, that hath
glorified him. He ſhall ſee him by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him. For he ſhall be the inheritance of his
people, of his people the Saincts and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
of his people whom he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
He ſhall be the poſſeſſion of theire

of that, which they haue ſoe
longe expected. Euen as he promiſed,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1635:163"/>
when he ſaied; I will be thy ſurpaſſinge
great rewarde. For that it is meete, that
ſoe great a rewarde, ſhoulde be giuen by
ſoe great a Lord.</p>
                     <p>Truly (o Lord my God) thou art ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
great aboue all the Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thy
rewarde likewiſe is ſurpaſſing great. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
art thou great, and thy rewarde little,
but as thou art great, ſoe in like manner
is thy recompenſe, for that betwixt thee
and it, there is noe difference.</p>
                     <p>Thou thy ſelfe art ſurpaſſing great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deade,
thou thy ſelfe art a rewarde ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

and the crowne, the promiſſer and the

and the rewarde of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.
Thou therfore (o my God) art the
crowner and the crowne, the diademe of
my hope, which is adorned with glorie;
thou art the light that gladdeth, the light
that reneweth, the brightnes that beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
thou art my great hope, the internall
loue and delight of the bleſſed, euen he,
whom they haue ſtill ſoe much deſired.</p>
                     <p>Thy ſight therfore (o Lord) is our whole

away with it all the other affections, and
as a conqueroure maketh them captiue.
Loue is ſufficient of it ſelfe, it is pleaſing
of it ſelfe and for it ſelfe. It is the merit,
the rewarde, the cauſe, the fruite and the
helpe of it ſelfe, for by loue we are vnited
to God. Loue cauſeth two ſpirits to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

                        <p>IT is impoſſible that the harte of man
ſhould remaine conſtant and ſtable, if
it be not ſetled in the deſire of thinges
eternall, but being more mutable then
mutabilitie it ſelfe, it paſſeth from one
thing to an other, ſeeking repoſe where
it is not: for in theſe fraile and tranſitorie
thinges (in which the affections thereof
are held captiue) it cannot content it ſelfe
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1635:192"/>
and liue at quiet, becauſe it is of ſoe great
dignitie, as that nothinge but the chiefe
good is able to ſuffice it: it is likewiſe of
that freedome, as that it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to commit any ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Wherfore the proper will of euery
man, is the cauſe of his damnation, or
ſaluation: neither can any thing be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more gratefull, then a good will vnto
almightie God. A good will doth drawe
downe God vnto vs, and direct vs vp vnto
him. By a good will we loue God, and
chooſe God, we runne to God, and come
to God, and enioy God. O howe good a

and made like vnto the image and

                        <p>Soe pleaſinge is a good will vnto him,
that he will not dwell in that harte, in
which a good will is wantinge: A good
will doth cauſe the bleſſed Trinitie (being
of vnſpeakeable Maieſtie) to come vnto

The holy Ghoſt doth enflame it, with the

CHAPT. XXVI.</head>
                        <p>BVt what is the knowledge of verity?
Firſt of all, it is to knowe thy ſelfe, &amp;
that thou ſtudy to be ſuch an one as thou
oughteſt to be, correcting and amending
in thy ſelfe, whatſoeuer thou ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
to be blame worthy. Secondly to
know &amp; loue God, that hath created thee,
for in this conſiſteth mans whole felicitie.</p>
                        <p>Beholde therefore the vnſpeakeable
greatnes of Gods charitie towardes vs. He
hath created vs of nothing, and giuen vs
whatſoeuer we haue. But becauſe we
haue loued the guift more then the giuer,
the creature more then the Creator, we
haue fallen into the ſnare of the diuell by
ſinne, and ſo haue beene made ſlaues vnto
him. Neuertheleſſe God beinge moued
with mercy, hath ſent his ſonne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
his ſeruants, he hath likewiſe ſent
the holy Ghoſt to adopt thoſe that were
ſlaues and bond-men, to be his children.
He hath giuen vs his ſonne as the price of
our redemption, he hath giuen vs the
holy Ghoſt as a priuiledge of his loue and
affection; finally he reſerueth himſelfe, as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1635:193"/>
the inheritance of our adoption.</p>
                        <p>Thus God (as one moſt louing and full
of compaſſion) throughe the affection and
loue which he did beare to man, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto him, not onely his riches, but
himſelfe likewiſe, to the end he might
recouer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not for any benefit he hoped
to reape therby, but for mans good, and
commoditie: in ſoe much that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
was borne of men, that men might
be borne of him againe.</p>
                        <p>What man is there, (albeit his harte
were as harde as a ſtone) whom the loue
of God thus preuenting him doth not
mollifie and ſoften? eſpeciallie ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
loue, that for mans ſake he hath
vouchſafed to become a man? Who can
poſſiblie thinke man worthy of hatred,
whoſe nature and ſimilitude he ſeeth in
the humanitie of God? Verily he hateth
God, that hateth man, and ſoe whatſoeuer
he doth, he doth but in vaine. For God
became man for the loue of man, that he
that is our Creator, might be likewiſe our
redeemer, to the end, man might be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by one of his owne nature</p>
                        <p>God likewiſe hath appeared in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of man, that he might the more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarlie
be beloued of man, and that both
the ſenſes of man might be made bleſſed
and delighted in him; that is, the eie of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:1635:193"/>

mens hartes might be made cleane, that
the wine might not be ſpilt and corrupted
