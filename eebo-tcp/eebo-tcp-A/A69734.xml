            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not unknown to all conſidering and judicious Perſons in this Kingdom, that, upon the happy Diſcovery of the late horrid Popiſh Plot againſt his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Perſon and Government, and the Eſtabliſht <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> and upon the Apprehenſion, Arraignment, Trial, and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſeveral of the Conſpirators, many Artifices have been uſed by Perſons of the ſame Perſuaſion, to defame the Witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the King, and to invalidate their Teſtimonies; in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſeveral Witneſſes have been procured, firſt at the Trial of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and after at the Trial of <hi>White</hi> alias <hi>Whitebread, &amp;c.</hi> (many of them Scholars belonging to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seminary at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> inſtructed no doubt, and ſent over to act <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> for the preſervation of their Conducters and Leaders) to teſtifie that Dr. <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Witneſſes for his Majeſty, was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> at the ſame time when he upon his Oath affirms himſelf to have been in <hi>London;</hi> other Witneſſes have been alſo produced, to prove that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> (lately Executed) was in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> at thoſe days and times when Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and one <hi>Sarah Pain,</hi> atteſt upon their Oaths, that they ſaw him in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as by the Printed Trials of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Whitebread, &amp;c.</hi> does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſuch a failure in Circumſtance of time and place, is of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in this caſe that if made out, it would render the ſaid Perſons unworthy, the names of juſt and lawful Witneſſes; and for that reaſon their Adverſaries put ſo much ſtreſs upon it, that (not contented with the determination of the matter, at the Trial and Condemnation of <hi>Ireland)</hi> they again reſume it at the Trial of <hi>Whitebread, &amp;c.</hi> and by their St. <hi>Omers</hi> Youths, endeavour to faſten falſehood on Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to impeach the credit of his Teſtimony, and the juſtice of their Condemnation. As to the firſt particular concerning Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> his Teſtimony is juſtly ſecured, and he himſelf indubitably proved to have been in <hi>London,</hi> at the times by him mentioned and depoſed, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current evidence of divers creditable Perſons, given in upon Oath at the Trial of <hi>Whitebread;</hi> ſo that the Stratagem which his Antagoniſts did uſe, to deſtroy or at leaſt depretiate his Teſtimony, hath by a gracious emergency of Divine Providence, turned to a ſtrong confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and for ever ſet him, as to this point, <hi>Rectus in curia,</hi> a good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs, in reference to all the Evidence already given, and which hereafter may be given by him in any future Trials. Their deſign failing herein, their next attempt was to entrap him and the reſt, in relation to Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> whom the Witneſſes they produce, affirm to have been in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and other places out of <hi>London,</hi> all the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> from the fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the fourteenth of <hi>September;</hi> whereas Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and <hi>Sarah Pain,</hi> depoſe, that they ſaw him in <hi>London</hi> within that time. To clear the Truth of this Particular, and to juſtifie the Evidence of Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and the reſt, the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50678:3"/>
is a pregnant demonſtration, which I thought truly to deſerve my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dilligence to bring to light; and in order thereunto, communicated the ſame to the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl of Shaftsbury,</hi> and by his appointment to Juſtice <hi>Warcup;</hi> before whom Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> Depoſitions, and the Atteſtations of the worthy <hi>Gentlemen</hi> hereafter mentioned, were taken; and in whoſe hands, if not tranſmitted by him to the Clerk of his Majeſties Council, the Originals of the enſuing Papers are to be ſeen, and whoſe joint endeavours for the Diſcovery of the Truth in this, as well as other particulars relating to the Plot, deſerve an honourable mention.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had occaſionally ſome diſcourſe with a Gentleman till then unknown to him; to wit, Mr. <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith</hi> of <hi>Grayes-Inn,</hi> Barriſter at Law, concerning the five Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that had been condemned the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, and their attempt to prove Mr. <hi>William Ireland,</hi> alias <hi>Ironmonger,</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed for High-Treaſon to have been in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and on his Journey thither from the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678 till the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following, and not to have been within that time in <hi>London,</hi> which as Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and others, had upon his Tryal affirmed him to be there, about the <hi>12th.</hi> of that Month, and to be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither again about the beginning of <hi>September:</hi> whereupon the ſaid Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> told Mr. <hi>Chetwind,</hi> that Sir <hi>Michael Warton</hi> of <hi>Beverly</hi> in the County of <hi>York</hi> Knight, a Worthy Member of the Honourable Houſe of Commons in the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament told him, that ſince the execution of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> (a Gentleman of very good Quality, and a Student in <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> who was a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> till about <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> laſt) affirmed, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and that he was with him then at a Scriveners at the Sign of the <hi>White-hart</hi> in <hi>Ruſſel-Street</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> which relation he confirm'd with ſeveral other notable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Mr. <hi>Chetwind,</hi> having heard this, went to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Right Honourable the <hi>Earl of Shaftsbury,</hi> Lord Preſident of his Majeſties Privy Council, acquainted his Lordſhip with what Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> had told him; upon which, the ſaid <hi>Earl of Shaftsbury</hi> told Mr. <hi>Chetwind,</hi> that it would be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, if it could be made out. Mr. <hi>Chettwind</hi> thus encouraged by the ſaid <hi>Earl,</hi> did by his order, make it his buſineſs the next morning, being <hi>Tueſday June</hi> the <hi>16th.</hi> to find out Sir <hi>Michael Warton,</hi> and coming to the Coffee Houſe in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> where Sir <hi>Michael</hi> uſed to be when in Town, Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> met there with Mr. <hi>Ralph Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Craven,</hi> who upon diſcourſe told Mr <hi>Chetwind</hi> that Sir <hi>Michael</hi> lived at <hi>Hampſtead</hi> this Summer. Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> underſtanding ſomething of the buſineſs for which Mr. <hi>Chettwind</hi> enquired after Sir <hi>Michael,</hi> ſaid, that Sir <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> had often related to him, and he was ſure he would juſtifie it, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> (who was lately come over to the Proteſtant Religion, a perſon of conſiderable quality, and Heir to a good Eſtate, his elder Brother being a prieſt, and in <hi>Newgate)</hi> told him, the ſaid Sir <hi>Michael,</hi> in the preſence of ſeveral other Gentlemen of Quality preſently after the execution of <hi>Ireland</hi> the ſeverall following particulars which they had hitherto taken no care to diſcover, becauſe they expected not that the evidence given in the Triall againſt him the ſaid <hi>Ireland,</hi> would after his execution come into queſtion or debate.</p>
               <p>The Particulars were theſe.</p>
               <p>That in the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678. when His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi> going to <hi>Windſor</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and returning the <hi>19th,</hi> immediately upon his return that night, he went to give Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> (the ſame perſon who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards executed) a viſit, and found him at the Sign of the <hi>Hart</hi> in <hi>Ruſſel-Street</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and after a Salute, Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> asked him ſeveral Queſtions, as, <hi>What newes from Windſor? how his Majeſty ſpent his time? and what recreations he followed? and whither he walked abroad much, and how guarded?</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> anſwered that his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> delighted much in Hawking and Fiſhing, but moſt in the latter, which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> followed early in the morning with ſome few perſons attending him; upon which Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> replyed, <hi>I wonder his Majeſty is no better guarded, he were eaſily taken off,</hi> whereupon Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> ſaid God forbid, or words to that effect, which made Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> ſtop his diſcourſe. Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> reporting this to Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spicer,</hi> two perſons of unqueſtionable reputation; Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> replied, that he was laſt night in company with Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> Son
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50678:4"/>
to my Lord <hi>De la More,</hi> where he heard them diſcourſe of this very Buſineſs; Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> ſaying that he heard Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> ſpeak the ſame things, whereupon Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> undertook to go that very Day to <hi>Hampſtead</hi> to Sir <hi>Michael Warton,</hi> and give Mr. <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> an account of it the next Morning. Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spicer</hi> alſo, before Mr. <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> and they parted, having promiſed to go to Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> met him, who juſtified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſyllable of what he had ſaid, and withall, remembred very well that when Sir <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Warton</hi> took ſome particular Notice of it, Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> ſeemed to be ſurpriſed, and was ſorry he had uttered thoſe Words, and began to recall them, as to the time only of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in Town: But ſays Mr. <hi>Bowes,</hi> (who was there preſent, a Perſon of Quality of <hi>Grayes-Inn,</hi> and well eſteemed in your Houſe) <hi>Jeniſon</hi> you cannot retract your Words, for I have a Letter under your own Hand which will put you in mind of the Time, and repeats the very ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The Fryday following being the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> met with Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> and diſcourſed the matter with him, who then owned all the Queſtions which <hi>Ireland</hi> asked him, namely, <hi>What News at Windſor? how his Majeſty ſpent his time?</hi> &amp;c. But, ſays he, I deſire a days time to conſider, that I may be exact as to the Day when they were ſpoken; for ſeveral Perſons have told me of a great many out of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> who upon the Tryal of the 5 Traitors, <hi>Whitebread,</hi> &amp;c. had proved Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> to be in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> from the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> and therefore I muſt ſeriouſly conſider what time it was that I ſaw him in <hi>London;</hi> upon which they appointed to dine together on Saturday following, being the 21 of <hi>June.</hi> Which Day being come, there met Sir. <hi>Michael Warton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bowes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and there they ſhewed Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> his Letter, which he acknowledged to be writ by his own Hand; and further told them, that upon the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he came to <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> that upon the <hi>17th</hi> he went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and upon the <hi>19th</hi> he returned to <hi>London</hi> again, and either that Night or the next Day, he had this Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> at the Sign of the <hi>Hart</hi> in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Covent Garden;</hi> further he related that on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following he went from <hi>London</hi> into the North, returning back to <hi>London</hi> in the enſuing <hi>November,</hi> and ſo preſently after removed to <hi>Reading,</hi> from whence he writ the forementioned Letter of Mr. <hi>Bowes.</hi> This Confeſſion of his Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> took in Writing at that very Time (when they dined together) all of them being preſent, as alſo a true Copy of his Letter writ from <hi>Reading,</hi> both which he brought to Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> the ſame Night; immediately upon which Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> and he carried them to my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> his Lordſhip the next Day (being the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>June)</hi> communicating them to my Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> and ſeveral others of his Majeſties Privy Council. The following Day <hi>(viz. June23d.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> brought Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> with the Original Letter to the <hi>Earl of Shaftsbury,</hi> before whom Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> acknowledged the Letter to be his own, with the circumſtances thereunto referring concerning Time and Place.</p>
               <p>Theſe things will receive a ſufficient Confirmation if we do but ſeriouſly peruſe all the enſuing Informations taken before one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Middleſex;</hi> as you will ſee by his Subſcription at the Cloſe, as alſo the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of thoſe that gave the Informations.</p>

                        <hi>Being come from</hi> Windſor, <hi>where I promiſed my ſelf the happineſs and ſatisfaction of ſeeing you, that I might take my leave before my journey for the</hi> North, <hi>(which to the beſt of my Memory was about the latter end of</hi> Auguſt,) <hi>I went to do the ſame to</hi> Mr. Ireland, <hi>whom then, (with all the reſt,) I did believe to be a man of the beſt Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Life in the world, (for you know the Law does preſume every man good until it be proved otherwiſe.) After my ſalute, and I had told him I had been at</hi> Windſor, <hi>his Interrogatory, or Queſtion was,</hi> what News? <hi>My teturn was the uſual no News,</hi> but good; <hi>then he proceeds to ask me to the beſt of my memory,</hi> how his Sacred Majeſty and the Court were diverted? <hi>I replied, that I heard, his</hi> Majeſty <hi>took much delight in Hawking and Fiſhing, but chiefly in the latter, which his</hi> Majeſty <hi>followed early in the morning, as I heard, accompanied only with Two or Three Lords, or other Attendants:</hi> I wonder, <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. Ireland, why his Majeſty ſhould be ſo thin Guarded, he were eaſily taken off or removed, <hi>or ſome words to that purpoſe, ſo ſounding; God forbid, I returned;</hi> No, <hi>ſubjoyns he,</hi> I do not ſay it is Lawful, <hi>and ſomething elſe I cannot call to mind that did qualifie the former words, that I did then think his meaning was, he was then ſorry his Sacred</hi> Majeſty <hi>ſhould go ſo weakly guarded; I then took it by that handle, having no other Reaſon; for I did believe him a Saint, never hearing him, nor any of them, as I hope for everlaſting life, Defend or Maintain in the leaſt,</hi> That damnable Doctrine of depoſing Kings; <hi>But now I know that paſſage may be taken by the other handle; and I am not fit to judg how far, yet you know words are to be taken in the milder ſenſe unleſs they be poſitive, which theſe, with their qualifications as they were ſpoken, are not. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is clearer Evidence from</hi> Mr. Oates, <hi>that better know it than I. There is only another thing (and I have cleared my Soul,) has run in my fancy ever ſince this, ever to be deteſted Immergency happened, which applyed to theſe times has an ill ſound with it; you know whom I accuſe now,</hi> Tho. Je. <hi>but in other times is capable of a good Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> viz. <hi>He had ſome buſineſs to acquaint me with, and this for two or three times at our parting; for I did not ſee him above Four or five times, as I remember the while I was in</hi> London. <hi>Once I urg'd him to tell me the buſineſs, he replied, he would take ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion; now I did believe he meant ſomewhat about my ſetling in the world as a Match, having propounded one to me of a</hi> Knights <hi>Daughter half a Year before, or of that ſort of buſineſs; and 'tis capable of that Conſtruction ſtill, if there be no clearer Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to give a Luſter and a great Light on the other ſide. We have a good Author that commands us to give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>what is</hi> Caeſars, <hi>and to</hi> God, <hi>who is</hi> Truth it ſelf, <hi>what belongs to him, which I would do to the dividing the minuteſt Atom in the preſence of that</hi> Truth <hi>which made me. But I can now remember no more if I were to gain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unleſs my Cozin</hi> Smith <hi>put me in mind of a word or two more relating to one of theſe two paſſages, that now I don't remember, which I will own if I ſaid it, otherwiſe not; for I will have nothing to do with their blood, further then what I can with a clear and ſafe Conſcience ſwear, which I am ready to do, if ſent for, as far as I have declared; I am in the mean while, Sir,</hi>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Mid. ſſ.</hi> This Informant ſaith, that he being returned from <hi>Windſor</hi> upon the 19th. day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, went to Mr. <hi>William Ireland</hi>'s Lodging in <hi>Ruſſel-Street</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> to viſit him; and paſſing through the Entry, went directly two pair of Stairs to the ſaid Mr. <hi>William Ireland</hi>'s Chamber, the Door whereof being ſomewhat open, he entred, and there found the ſaid <hi>William Ireland,</hi> whom this Informant having told, that he came juſt then from <hi>Windſor</hi> upon a Hackney Horſe, hired at <hi>3s. per diem,</hi> which had much tired him; the ſaid <hi>William Ireland</hi> replied, that he was then newly arrived from <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> by Poſt, and was not weary; Upon which this Informant replied, that he thought that Scholars, as he was, had rather chooſe to ride ambling Horſes, than to ride Poſt.</p>
                           <p>And this Informant further ſaith, that he very well remembers, that about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>October</hi> laſt paſt, Sir <hi>Edward Smith</hi> came to <hi>Walworth</hi> in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> and then read a Letter newly come from <hi>London,</hi> purporting the diſcovery of the Plot, and that the <hi>King</hi> was to have been killed at <hi>Windſor;</hi> which made this Informant call to mind the expreſſions of the ſaid <hi>William Ireland,</hi> on the ſaid 19th. day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> viz. <hi>Why his Majeſty ſhould be ſo thin guarded, he was eaſily taken off or removed,</hi> or words of that ſounding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thereupon this Informant did the next day after the reading of the ſaid Letter, relate all the paſſages between this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> to this Informants <hi>Father,</hi> and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> as they are contained in this Informants Letter to Mr. <hi>Bowes,</hi> dated on the 19th. day of <hi>December</hi> laſt; and ſo the ſaid Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> hath lately by Letter ſignified to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bowes.</hi> And this Informant further ſaith, that in the year 1678. ſeveral Papiſts have in this Informants hearing declared, that they doubted not, but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would ſhortly be uppermoſt, or to that effect; And further at preſent he ſaith not.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is a remarkable inſtance of Divine providence, that this latent evidence caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcovered to Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> (when he had not known or heard of Mr. <hi>Jeniſon)</hi> ſhould be thus recovered by him; and that in his purſuit thereof, ſo many worthy Perſons likewiſe unknown, ſhould accidentally occur to him, and contribute their great aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 'foreſaid Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> at the writing of his Letter to Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> was of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> and in obedience to the Kings Proclamation for Baniſhing Papiſts out of <hi>London,</hi> had retired from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Reading,</hi> ſo that the Diſcovery made by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot rationally be imputed to any other inducement, or incitement, ſave only the Power of Truth; eſpecially conſidering that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was related to him.</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50678:6"/>
3. The main Plot is evidently confirmed, not only by the Papiſts expecting ſome great Change and Alteration, mentioned in one of Mr <hi>Jeniſons</hi> Informations, given in upon his Oath, but alſo by thoſe ſuſpicious Queſtions propoſed by the ſaid <hi>Ireland</hi> to Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> after his return from <hi>Windſor</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> as, <hi>What news from Windſor? How is the King guarded?</hi> And eſpecially thoſe Dangerous Words of his, <hi>Then he may eaſily be taken off,</hi> or to that effect; which do ſufficiently argue, not only his being Privy to the Deſign, but go far to prove his being an Inſtrument therein.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the Readers fuller ſatisfaction concerning this Subject, theſe Particulars are to be noted, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the King went to <hi>Windſor</hi> about the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678. as appears by Sir <hi>Tho. Dolemans</hi> Teſtimony at the Tryals.</p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> came from <hi>Windſor</hi> the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and went into the <hi>North</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following.</p>
               <p>As to the Latter, his going into the <hi>North,</hi> the Books of Entries of Paſſengers in the <hi>Northern</hi> Coach have been examined, and the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> is found to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day he took Coach for the <hi>North</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> his going to <hi>Windſor</hi> is proved by Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who met him the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> as he came from <hi>Dochets</hi> Horſe-race, which was on that day.</p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> in his Letter writes thus, <hi>Being come from Windſor, I went to take my leave of Mr. Ireland before I took my journy into the North, and Mr. Ireland asked me what News from Windſor? How does the King paſs his time?</hi> &amp;c. Which notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly proves, that his Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> was when the King was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and alſo that it was after Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> came from <hi>Windſor,</hi> and before he went into the <hi>North, viz.</hi> betwixt the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and it implies that it was immediately after his coming from <hi>Windſor,</hi> by the queſtion, <hi>What news from Windſor?</hi> and ſeems alſo to intimate, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> had not long been in <hi>London,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eager of News from <hi>Windſor,</hi> which at that time he might if reſident in <hi>London</hi> have had every <hi>2d</hi> Day by <hi>Bedingfield</hi>'s, and other Letters. That this time does nearly agree with <hi>Sarah Pain</hi>'s Evidence at <hi>Irelands</hi> Trial, who ſwears that ſhe ſaw <hi>Ireland</hi> here in <hi>London</hi> about the Time the King went to <hi>Windſor;</hi> and there is not above 5 or 6 Days difference, ſee <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Trial, <hi>Fol.</hi> 87. There as <hi>Gavan</hi> repeats their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Sir <hi>Jo. Southcot</hi> and his Family ſtaid with <hi>Ireland</hi> till the <hi>19th.</hi> which <hi>19th</hi> was the very day he came Poſt from <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and was ſeen by Mr. <hi>Jeniſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Ireland</hi> was tryed the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> Letter was writ from <hi>Reading</hi> the <hi>19th</hi> following; and it is clear by the Letter, that Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> had then no notice of <hi>Irelands</hi> being tryed.</p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (a Prieſt) hath ſince by his Letter to Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> confirmed the Truth of what Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> relates, <hi>viz.</hi> That he told his Father and Him at his Fathers Houſe at <hi>Walworth,</hi> immediately upon the firſt Diſcovery of the Plot thoſe very Words Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> had ſpoken to him; then certainly it remains ſcarcely poſſible to imagin that unleſs the matter were exactly true, Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> a Gentleman of a very fair Temper and Sober life, ſhould report ſuch Words as delivered by Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Kinſman, and a Kinſman very dear in his eſteem, and report them to his own <hi>Father</hi> old Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and that at that time when they were all <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> highly valued by them all; nor is it leſs abſurd to conceive, that Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> as is ſaid, a Prieſt as <hi>Ireland</hi> was, ſhould confirm the Words of Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> ſo long after ſpoken, and that when to witneſs to them, was even to cut the throat of <hi>Irelands</hi> Reputation and Truth, and give a very ſevere ſtab to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Cauſe. Certainly the thing ſeems to look as it writ with a <hi>Sun-beam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It appears then an undeniable Truth, that Mr <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> or <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678. and thence taking a journey into <hi>Staffordſhire;</hi> he returned and was ſeen in <hi>London</hi> and diſcourſed by Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> the <hi>19th</hi> of the ſame Month, from whence 'tis probable, having tranſacted ſomething of <hi>the Matter in Hand,</hi> he might immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately return.</p>
               <p>Neither do I know any rational Objection againſt the clearneſs of the truth evidenced thereby, unleſs the three following Objections weigh with ſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. The credit and quality of ſome of the Witneſſes, who teſtifie, they ſaw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> on thoſe Days, wherein he is affirmed to have been in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this I ſhall only anſwer, that the Credit of the Witneſſes, of both ſides may be ſo far ſalved, as tis poſſible to affirm, one and the ſame perſon may be in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Stafforſhire</hi> ſome part of the ſame Day; the diſtance being not ſo great betwixt both
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50678:6"/>
Places, but the journy (eſpecially by Poſt) may be eaſily performed; neither is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was ſo actively concerned in the Plot, and in the nature of a Treaſurer therein, ſhould have frequent occaſion to travel by Day and by Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> his Preſence being equally neceſſary to both places, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch a critical time of Expectancy, as that of the Kings <hi>being</hi> at <hi>Windſor</hi> then wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Add hereunto, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> himſelf confeſſed in his Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> that he had rode poſt from <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> to <hi>London</hi> that day, yet was not weary: a journey, which many other Perſons have performed in leſs then the ſpace of one Day, part of the Night being alſo, in that uſually very hot month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> more convenient for travelling then the Day; now If ſuch a Journey were undertaken by <hi>Ireland</hi> one day? why not another? why not many days, according as the Urgency of his grand Affairs, and the teeming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy of them might require?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If this Evidence be true, why was it not produced before, or at the Tryal of <hi>Whitebread,</hi> &amp;c. being ſo material for the clearing of the Truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The matter was a long time kept ſecret in the Breaſts of young Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> and his Father, being both <hi>(then)</hi> Romaniſts, and <hi>Smith</hi> a Prieſt, and ſecured from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any Proteſtant; neither did Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> receive Mr. <hi>Jeniſons</hi> letter of Diſcovery (though often preſſed by him to declare his Knowledge, upon the Kings Proclamation of Pardon) till <hi>December 19th</hi> 1678. which was two days after the Tryal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Now the matter having received it's Determination in the Arraignment and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſaid <hi>Ireland,</hi> no probability appearing, that it would be again reſumed and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, no further Divulgation was made thereof; And unleſs new provocation had been given by reviving the matter at <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Tryal, it had poſſibly lain aſleep for ever; ſo that what of Indecency may be imputed in combating the Ghoſt of the deceaſed is more properly referrable to the importunate arguings or inſtances of his ſurviving Friends, then then even to the juſt Vindication of the Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The confident aſſeveration of the ſaid <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the ſolemn proteſtation of his innocency, and of his continuing in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> the days he was alledged to be here in <hi>London,</hi> ſhall have the room of the third and laſt objection.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ. 1ſt.</hi> I confeſs this had not a little influence upon me; for I acknowledge my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf ſubject to the compaſſionate ſentiments of humane nature; but the ſame evidence above mentioned which convinced me, will I doubt not, baniſh all heſitation as to this matter from the minds of others, except of thoſe, who out of guilt or intereſt are reſolved to ſhut the door againſt all kind of ſatisfaction whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2 How far equivocations, falſities, mental reſerves, and other <hi>Salvoes</hi> may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, even to dying perſons, in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> provided they contribute to the advancement of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Cauſe, as they phraſe it, would require a large field of diſcourſe; but the clearneſs of the Evidence juſtifying Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>his</hi> and his witneſſes affirmations to the contrary, doth give juſt ground of ſcruple, that a large freedom is allowed to them on that account; but it would be too tedious to turn over the Popiſh Caſuiſts, for the deciding of that controverſie; leaving therefore the Scholaſtical and skirmiſhing part to abler pens, I ſhall content my ſelf to exhibit one paſſage (relating to the matter in hand) mentioned in a Book called the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Catechiſm, compoſed (almoſt 60 years ſince) by a Member of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> but not of the <hi>Ignatian</hi> Order. His words mentioned, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. at the end of that Chapter are there. <hi>They</hi> (ſays he, ſpeaking of the <hi>Jeſuits) have a rule in practice, that men are bound to accuſe themſelves to their Confeſſors, and not themſelves only, but all their Confederates alſo; and (for the Magiſtrate) the Malefactor being condemned to die, after he hath once made Confeſſion of his ſins to his Ghoſtly Father, he is not tied to reveal it to his Judge, nay it is lawful for him to ſtand in ſtiff denial thereof at the time of his Execution, as being clear before God, though he perſiſt in a lie, after he hath once diſcharged the depth of his conſcience to his Confeſſor. A thing (that the ſame Author ſubjoyns) that breedeth much ſcruple in the mind of a Judge, who otherwiſe is greatly quieted in conſcience, when an offender adjudged to die, howſoever he have beforetime ſtood in denial of the Fact, yet at the time of his death confeſſeth the Truth.</hi>

                  <hi>Sarah Pain</hi> being again asked, if ſhe was ſure that ſhe ſaw him in the Place ſhe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and about the time? She anſwered, yes, I am ſure I ſaw him at that very Place and at that time; but Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> then confidently profeſſed he never knew her, although ſhe was Mr. <hi>Groves Servant,</hi> and uſed to carry him Letters from her Maſter's; his words are, <hi>I profeſs I do not know her,</hi> 20 <hi>people may come to me, and yet I not know them, and ſhe having been</hi> Mr. Groves <hi>ſervant might have brought me Letters, and yet I not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber her.</hi> p. 58, 59.</p>
               <p>But my <hi>L. C.

She does it by Circumſtance, by which we muſt calculate ſhe ſaw you about the <hi>12th</hi> or <hi>13th</hi> day; ſhe went to my Lord <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtons</hi> at ſuch a day, a week after the <hi>King</hi> went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and that was about the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50678:7"/>
                  <hi>13th,</hi> and ſhe ſaw you a week before ſhe went to my Lord <hi>Arlingtons,</hi> which muſt be the <hi>12th</hi> or <hi>13th.</hi> You ſay you went out of Town the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> who can Swear you did not come back again? To which <hi>Ireland</hi> ſays, all the houſe can teſtify I did not come to my Lodging; his Mother alſo affirmed it, but they were Parties. <hi>p.</hi> 59.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> here comes in with his Information, and reports it to my Lord <hi>C. Juſtice</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>My Lord, whenever we had a mind to come to Town, we commonly writ our Letters, and let them come to Town two days after us; ſo that we might prove by the Writing of ſuch Letters, if any Queſtion did ariſe; that we could not be at ſuch a Place at a ſuch time; And when we pretended to go into the Country, we have gon and taken a Chamber in the City, and have had frequent Cabals at our Chambers. There Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> writ a Letter as Dated at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> when I took my leave of him at his own Chamber, which was betwixt the <hi>12th</hi> and <hi>24th</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> he was there; and afterwards when I went to <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Chamber he came thither, a Fortnight or Ten Days at leaſt, I am ſure it was in <hi>August.—p.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>Upon which, and what went before my Lord <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> Reflects as follows.</p>
               <p>Here are 3 Witneſſes upon Oath about this one thing: Here is Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> that Swears the Fact upon which the Queſtion ariſes to be in <hi>Auguſt;</hi> that you deny, and ſay you were out of Town then; he produces a Maid here, and ſhe Swears that about that time, which by Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt be about the <hi>12th</hi> or <hi>13th,</hi> ſhe ſaw you going into your own houſe. And here is a <hi>3d</hi> Witneſs, who Swears he knows nothing of the matter of Fact, but he knows you were in Town then, and that he took his leave of you as going to St. <hi>Omers. p.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>In the next place <hi>Ireland</hi> produceth one <hi>Harriſon,</hi> a Coachman, to teſtifie that he was in his Company from the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the <hi>16th,</hi> and at that time he was with him 3 or 4 days at my Lord <hi>Aſtons</hi> Houſe at <hi>Tixall</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire, p,</hi> 62. [In which time Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſteal a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and return without notice being taken of it; and this might be the time in which <hi>Sarah Pain</hi> ſaw him.] Alſo <hi>Harriſon</hi> affirmed that he was with Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> at <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> and that there he left him; [And here let it be remembred that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently averred himſelf to be in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> all <hi>Auguſt, p.</hi> 56. and one of his own Witneſſes declared him to be even in another County, which he granted to be true, but came off with this Evaſion, in <hi>Staffordſhire or thereabout. P.</hi> 61, 62.]</p>

                  <p>Look you. I muſt break in upon you; you have been told ſo often, all of you have been told it, and yet you are upon the former Trials again. You are now upon your tryal for your Life, if you could have diſproved any thing that he ſaid at a former Tryal, you ſhould have taken a legal way and convicted him of Perjury; but now to charge him with a Printed paper is not fair.

                  <p>He ſays the ſame now. But all that I ſay is this, if he be not honeſt, he can be witneſs in no caſe. I ſuppoſe if any one can prove him not <hi>Probus Teſtis,</hi> his Teſtimony is not to be received in any caſe.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the Priſoners, and they have had a great deal of time to make their defence; but the greateſt part of their defence hath been to invalidate the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Oates;</hi> and what is the Evidence they have brought againſt him? they tell you firſt, that he did not come over in this Company that he ſays he came over with. And whereas he hath ſworn he was here the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> they have taken a great deal of pains by fifteen or ſixteen Witneſſes, to prove that he was all the time at St. <hi>Omers.—</hi>P. 76.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir <hi>C. Levins.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>—Now as for Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> Teſtimony, and what they have to ſay to him; in the firſt place, they have brought a young Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Hilsley,</hi> and he ſays he did not come over with him, and there 'tis one againſt one, but Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath Sworn it, and hath given you ſuch convincing Circumſtances how he loſt his money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that I leave it to you, which of the two is in the right, and ought to be believed. But then, my Lord, as to the reſt of the Witneſſes, here are a great many brought over to prove that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was all the while at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> but I ſhall bring you a conſiderable number of Witneſſes, to prove that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was then in <hi>London,</hi> and that all theſe Perſons are miſtaken: They do all pitch upon the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> to ſix it upon a time, wherein he ſays he was here in Town: But Gentlemen, I hope you did obſerve, that as to other things and time that were not ſo neceſſary as to this matter, there they were pleaſed to miſtake, and to differ one from another, to contradict one another; for ſome of them ſaid he went away and left St. <hi>Omers</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> others the <hi>23d</hi> others, which was the ſame <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Gardiner, that he ſtay'd till <hi>July:</hi> Truly half that variance in the time which is neceſſary, would ſerve our turn, we are but for eight days time, that is, he was not above eight or ten days here; truly theſe Gentlemen will be ſure to ſpeak punctually to all thoſe eight days that hurt the Priſoners, but they will vary thirty days at another time, that hurts them not: Why may they not be miſtaken as well with that portion of time, as they were in the other, wherein they ſo much differed one from another? But I ſhall give you moſt infallable proof by and by, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was in <hi>England</hi> at that time, that he ſaid he was in <hi>England:</hi> This he does in the Trials of <hi>Whitebread, &amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Pag.</hi> 79. to <hi>Pag.</hi> 85. to which the Reader is referred. <hi>Pag.</hi> 77.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>—Then truly, my Lord, they are fixed upon another great matter to blemiſh Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> as to Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Ireland,</hi> a perſon that is dead and out of the way. Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> hath been hanged upon that Evidence, ſo far it was believed, but now after all this will theſe Gentlemen come to queſtion the Evidence that was given againſt Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> They have likewiſe, my Lord, brought my Lady <hi>Southcot,</hi> and ſome other perſons who give you an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence concerning Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he ſhould not be here at this time; but Gentlemen under favour, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> hath ſworn before, and he hath now ſworn it again, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was at that time in <hi>London,</hi> and Gentlemen, I will confirm him in that by another Witneſs that did ſee him here in Town at that time. And when you have two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the King upon their Oaths come and teſtifie it, I hope you will beleive them, rather then other perſons that teſtifie only by Hear-ſay. It was the matter then in Iſſue, and had ſaved his Life if it had been true, but though it be now ſetled, and none could think it would be again ſtarted, they would make that an Objection, but by chance we have a Witneſs ſtill to give you ſatisfaction, that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> at that time that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did ſwear him to be. We will begin with that Witneſs about <hi>Ireland.</hi> And then we will call our Witneſſes to prove that Mr <hi>Oates</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> and did come over when he ſaid he did. Call <hi>Sarah Pain</hi> (who was ſworn)</p>

                  <p>I ſaw him ſeven or eight days before I went to my Lord <hi>Chamberlains,</hi> which was before my Lord went to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and that was a week after the King went thither.</p>

                  <p>Now I'le tell you what ſhe ſays; ſhe ſays ſhe ſaw <hi>Ireland</hi> a week before ſhe went to my Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi>'s, and ſhe ſaw him go into <hi>Grove</hi>'s Houſe, where he did uſually go for Letters. She ſays ſhe ſaw his face, and made him a Courteſie; and that this was a week before ſhe went to my Lord <hi>Chamberlains,</hi> and that was a week after the King went to <hi>Windſor.</hi> Now the time that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> pitches upon, is between the eighth and the twelfth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which by computation is the time ſhe ſpeaks of. <hi>P.</hi> 79.</p>

                  <p>No, my Lord, I have not. And this is it, I anſwer to it; ſhe is a witneſs that only ſays, ſhe juſt ſaw him, but did not ſpeak to him.</p>

                  <p>We were talking now of ſeeing <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and we prove by Sir. Jo. <hi>Southcot</hi> and all his Family, who ſay they began their journey with him the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and ſtaid with him till the <hi>19th,</hi> after the particular Day that ſhe ſpeaks of, you find 7 or 8 of them ſwear that they ſaw him all the time. <hi>P.</hi> 87.</p>
                  <p>I will cloſe up the Whole with a little of my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtices</hi> Speech, at the end of the Tryals of <hi>Whitebread, &amp;c. p.</hi> 92, 93. Which though it may not at firſt ſeem to anſwer our particular deſign, the demonſtrating <hi>Ireland</hi>'s

                     </gap> the reality of the Plot, and in order thereunto it is a moſt noble Argument, and really merits not only the tranſcribing into this Tract to fill up an empty ſpace, but even into the memories of all true Proteſtants.</p>

                  <p>I will challenge all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to ſatisfie any man that hears me this day of one piece of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which will turn every Proteſtants heart againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> If ſo be, they murdered Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey,</hi> the Plot even by that is in a great meaſure proved upon them, by that baſe murther. And what can be a plainer proof of it, than the evidence of this Day, which Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> produces? Who had notice (ſaith he) on <hi>Monday</hi> night, that on the <hi>Saturday</hi> before it, Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> was kill'd (which falls out to be that very <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> he was firſt miſſing) which notice was given in a Letter writ by <hi>Harcourt</hi> to <hi>Ewers'</hi> another Prieſt, that ſame <hi>Saturday</hi> night, wherein were theſe words, <hi>This night Sir Edmund-bury Godfrey is diſpatched;</hi> and I am ſure if this be true, then no man can ſay but they murdered Him. Now the queſtion is, whether it be true or no? To make it out, he produces Mr. <hi>Chetwind,</hi> whom I hope you will not deny to be a Gentleman of one of the beſt Families of his Country, and of honeſt Reputation, who ſays; that on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following that <hi>Saturday</hi> Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund-bury Godfrey</hi> was miſs't, he and another were walking together in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and that the other Perſon asked him if he knew of the Death of any Juſtice of the Peace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and when he told him, he had heard of no ſuch thing; No, ſaid he, that is ſtrange, you living ſometimes about <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> for ſaid he, the Wench at the Ale-houſe ſays, That this morning Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid to two other Gentlemen, there was a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> killed; and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears, That was Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey;</hi> now if <hi>Dugdale</hi> be fit to be believed, that he ſaw ſuch a Letter, as he muſt be if he be not a very great Prophet, to be able to foretell this: or if the Maid that ſaid this, did not invent it (a thing then impoſſible to be done:) or Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he heard the Man make his report from the Maid; this thing could not come to paſs, but by theſe men. Nay, if Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> could not do as great a Miracle as any are in the <hi>Popiſh Legends,</hi> how could he tell that it was done on the ſame Night when it was done at <hi>London?</hi> or ſpeak of it on the <hi>Monday</hi> night after, when it was not known in <hi>London</hi> till the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following? This will ſtick, I aſſure you (Sirs) upon all your Party.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, this evidence of Mr. <hi>Dugdals,</hi> gives me the greateſt ſatisfaction of any thing in the World, in this matter, and whilſt we reſt ſatisfied in the Murder of that Man, and are morally certain you muſt do it, knowing of what Principles you are, you cannot blame us, if upon ſuch manifeſt reaſons we lay it upon you.</p>
                  <p>And this is occaſional Evidence, which I for my part never heard before this day; nor can I ever be more or better ſatisfied, then I am upon this point, <hi>viz.</hi> The Teſtimony that I have received this afternoon, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the murder of Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey:</hi> As to the defences they have made, they are exceptions in point of time, but do not effect Mr. <hi>Dugdale;</hi> for they have hardly the confidence to deny the things he ſays to be true againſt them.</p>
                  <p>They fall foul indeed upon Mr. <hi>Oates:</hi> He appears to have been their Agent; and whilſt ſo, bad enough; but if he had not had a mind to have become a good man, he would not likely have done us that good that he hath done, in diſcovering the Deſign you had engaged him in: let any man judge by your Principles and Practices, what you will not do for the promoting of the ſame.</p>
