            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>GYfford</hi> the <hi>Preacher</hi>'s dead, one who might claim,</l>
               <l>Above all others, that Renowned Name;</l>
               <l>Who 'mongſt thoſe Reverend Bards the Pulpit grace,</l>
               <l>Might juſtly challenge chief and higheſt Place:</l>
               <l>Amongſt the Church's Stars he alwayes ſtood</l>
               <l>One of the firſt and greateſt Magnitude;</l>
               <l>Fix'd to his Orb, he ſhined ſtill more bright,</l>
               <l>And not like Planets, with a borrow'd Light:</l>
               <l>The Sun was not more conſtant to its way,</l>
               <l>Than he to's Pulpit every Sabbath Day;</l>
               <l>And there he did both Light and Heat diſpenſe;</l>
               <l>With gentle Warmth he mixt the cleareſt Senſe:</l>
               <l>His numerous Hearers who in Flocks did crowd,</l>
               <l>He fed with wholſom and with ſolid Food:</l>
               <l>He gave them Bread, and not a Stone to eat,</l>
               <l>Not painted Dainties, but ſubſtantial Meat:</l>
               <l>His Sermons were not like a ſtanding Pool,</l>
               <l>Without all Motion, only dull and cool;</l>
               <l>Nor like a raging, and a ſtorming Sea,</l>
               <l>All Noiſe and Froth, as ſome are us'd to be;</l>
               <l>But, like a River, ſtrong and pure he flow'd,</l>
               <l>Which Natural, not Artificial ſhow'd:</l>
               <l>The Spring was from his own Religious Head,</l>
               <l>Roſe from himſelf, and not from Ciſterns fed.</l>
               <l>Like to himſelf they were as to the main,</l>
               <l>Wiſe, Learned, Pious, but yet very plain.</l>
               <l>His Learning equall'd any of the Age,</l>
               <l>Although he would not bring it on the Stage,</l>
               <l>Nor publiſh it in Books; his Wealth was ſo;</l>
               <l>Greater than others, tho' it made leſs ſhow.</l>
               <l>His Life ſo perfect, and without a Spot,</l>
               <l>That Envy could not ſtain him with a Blot:</l>
               <l>The Vices which he alwayes Preached down,</l>
               <l>Had he not heard of them, he had not known;</l>
               <l>His Vertues, if in any thing they were</l>
               <l>To blame, it was, that they were too ſevere:</l>
               <l>Not greater ever did in Cloyſters dwell,</l>
               <l>The Hermit was not ſtricter in his Cell;</l>
               <l>Sober, Devout, Grave, Humble, Chaſt was he,</l>
               <l>Equal to th' Angels Virgin Purity:</l>
               <l>The only fault ſuſpected in him, was</l>
               <l>Not common to the Holy Tribe, alas!</l>
               <l>That he was Rich, but this he did take Care,</l>
               <l>To mend by Charity as Great as Rare;</l>
               <l>He ever laid apart out of his Store,</l>
               <l>A certain Portion due of Right to th' Poor:</l>
               <l>And had not Death ſurpriz'd him, he had given,</l>
               <l>Where he had vow'd it, all again to Heaven.</l>
               <l>His time the Church, or elſe his Books did ſpend,</l>
               <l>Religion and Learning were his End;</l>
               <l>'Tis this in ſhort may of his Life be ſaid,</l>
               <l>He alwayes either Studied, Preach'd or Pray'd.</l>
               <l>He ne're was ſilent in this place before,</l>
               <l>But when h' had laboured Thirty Years and more;</l>
               <l>And in the Vineyard painfully had Sweat,</l>
               <l>And tir'd himſelf with Working in the Heat:</l>
               <l>God call'd his Faint and Weary Soul to Reſt,</l>
               <l>To take the Wages and Reward o'th' Bleſt;</l>
               <l>And if in Heaven a brighter Crown there be</l>
               <l>For Preachers, this is due, <hi>Bleſt Soul,</hi> to Thee:</l>
               <l>If they ſhall ſhine as Stars who Souls have won,</l>
               <l>Thou ſhalt be there a Conſtellation.</l>
               <l>Thou'ſt ſav'd more Souls ('tis thus the Scripture ſpeaks,)</l>
               <l>And Preach'd more Sermons than thou'ſt lived Weeks:</l>
               <l>But thou who ne're knew'ſt when to leave before,</l>
               <l>Thy Glaſs is run, and thou muſt now give o're;</l>
               <l>For now this Burning and this Shining Light,</l>
               <l>Is darkned and put out by fatal Night.</l>
               <l>When with Aſſiduous and double Toil</l>
               <l>To faſt, he waſted his moſt precious Oil:</l>
               <l>Tired with too much Pains, and weary quite</l>
               <l>With Godly Labour, his moſt vigorous Sp'rit</l>
               <l>Grew Faint, and a ſoft Drowſineſs did creep</l>
               <l>Upon his Nerves, and ſo he fell <hi>aſleep.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Such gentle ſlumbers which on Prophets fell,</l>
               <l>When God vouchſaf'd to them his Mind to tell;</l>
               <l>In ſuch his eaſie Soul did paſs away,</l>
               <l>Which in a Heavenly Trance a while had lay:</l>
               <l>In Heaven he waked, and there in Extaſie</l>
               <l>The Glorious Viſion ſhall for ever ſee.</l>
