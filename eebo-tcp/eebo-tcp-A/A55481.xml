            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PANEGYRICK TO HIS EXCELLENCY General MONCK <hi>March</hi> 28. 1660.</head>
            <l>NOW almost twenty years have roul'd about</l>
            <l>Since first the flames of our late Wars broke out;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Brittain</hi> fainting with the losse of blood</l>
            <l>Under a lawlesse Yoke subjected stood,</l>
            <l>When now at last her groanes by Heav'n are heard</l>
            <l>Her fainting <hi>Soul</hi> and dying <hi>Hopes</hi> uprear'd;</l>
            <l>Her sable night of sorrow done away</l>
            <l>By the new dawning of a <hi>Royall</hi> day.</l>
            <l>As from the <hi>North</hi> her first distemper grew,</l>
            <l>Thence slowes the <hi>Soveraign Med'cine,</hi> to renew</l>
            <l>Her joyes again: She hopes secure to stand</l>
            <l>Upheld by her brave <hi>Generall's</hi> Warlike hand.</l>
            <l>Over the <hi>Brittish</hi> Seas flyes his great Name</l>
            <l>Born on the swift wings of no common fame,</l>
            <l>Our Enemies tremble, and our friends are glad,</l>
            <l>To these 'tis joyfull newes, to those 'tis sad</l>
            <l>The mighty shouts, and the <hi>Stentorian</hi> voice</l>
            <l>Of the glad multitude that now rejoyce</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:108879:3"/>
Awak's the drowsie <hi>Genius</hi> of this I'le,</l>
            <l>Who wept so long or'e <hi>Charles's</hi> Funerall pyle</l>
            <l>Till his swolne eyes with a <hi>Lethargick</hi> sleep</l>
            <l>Were seal'd up, having no more tears to weep.</l>
            <l>He understands the cause of <hi>Englands</hi> joy</l>
            <l>And least <hi>Ambition</hi> should their hopes destroy</l>
            <l>He boldly doth his mind to <hi>Monck</hi> expresse</l>
            <l>And shewes how he may <hi>Brittains ills</hi> redresse.</l>

            <l>The Royall <hi>Phaebus</hi> ushered in by you:</l>

            <l>Thy hands the <hi>Gordian</hi> knots of Tyranny</l>

            <l>Now drooping <hi>Brittain</hi> raises up her head,</l>

            <l>Grown mad through Envie, in their rage expire.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Phoebus</hi> ushers in the happy day,</l>

               <hi>Charles</hi> o're three Kingdoms doth tryumph to day:</l>
            <l>Which conquest got by vertues has more charms</l>

            <l>And him to reign; now they their folly see</l>
            <l>Converted by one look of Majesty.</l>

               <head>The Protestation.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>Before bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> had his beams display'd,</l>
                  <l>Whilst yet <hi>Aurora</hi> usher'd in the Day,</l>
                  <l>The prat'ling Eccho to my ears betray'd,</l>
                  <l>As I among the trees in ambush lay,</l>
                  <l>The amorous whispers of <hi>Amintas,</hi> who</l>
                  <l>With protestation did his <hi>Cloris</hi> wooe.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What went before I cannot tell, but she</l>
                  <l>Reply'd to something that <hi>Amintas</hi> say'd,</l>
                  <l>The murm'ring Eccho by the Air to me</l>
                  <l>These gentle sounds in whispering notes convey'd.</l>
                  <l>Alas! <hi>Amintas</hi> would that you could prove</l>
                  <l>To my distrustfull Heart that men can love.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>How oft are wee poor sily maids beguil'd</l>
                  <l>By charmes of flattering words? when wee beleive</l>
                  <l>To break their oaths men will not be so vild,</l>
                  <l>Being so poor a conquest to deceive</l>
                  <l>Disarmed virgins? when wee them reward</l>
                  <l>With Love, they'r cold, and us with scorn regard.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Tis best to keep our own, for when wee yeild</l>
                  <l>Our Hearts, men supplyants soon forget to be,</l>
                  <l>And our affections caught, with scorn repell'd</l>
                  <l>We are subjected to their tyranny:</l>
                  <l>That maid is more then mad who will be kind,</l>
                  <l>To men, who waver oftner than the Wind.</l>

                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108879:10"/>
Blame not our Natures, but your follies blame,</l>
                  <l>For we should sooner yeild were Men more true,</l>
                  <l>But since weak virgins to deceive no shame</l>
                  <l>They think; denialls Cruelty is due.</l>
                  <l>But yet <hi>Amintas</hi> would that you could prove</l>
                  <l>To my distrustfull Heart your constant love.</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Amintas</hi> with a sigh reply'd. 'Tis true,</l>
                  <l>Some men are faulty in what you accuse them,</l>
                  <l>But let not all be blamed for a few,</l>
                  <l>Nor Woemen men despise, 'cause some abuse them.</l>
                  <l>For if I went about it, I could prove,</l>
                  <l>Men equal Woomen in a constant Love.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Our sexe's cause I will not plead; my own</l>

                  <l>My constant Love must by Obedience shown</l>
                  <l>Be; else I cann't be truly scann'd till dead:</l>
                  <l>Constant obedience 'tis doth rightly prove,</l>
                  <l>A Heart's possessor of a constant Love.</l>

               <l>VVith sighs; which will at last bring judgement down,</l>
               <l>And 'wake th' Almightie's Justice for his own.</l>
               <l>Rebells think not 'twas his o're. weight of sin</l>
               <l>That press'd him down, alive he still had been,</l>
               <l>But for the Nations crimes; we first his life</l>
               <l>Took from him by our sins, then with the knife.</l>
               <l>God for a Notion's sins oft dealeth so,</l>
               <l>Takes off the Righteous, lets the wicked go,</l>
               <l>In mercy to the first, to set them free</l>
               <l>From following plagues, and suddain jeopardie.</l>
               <l>So our yet bleeding Monarch was a gem</l>
               <l>Too good for us, and we too bad for him.</l>
               <l>Although the murtherers grant no monument</l>
               <l>Crown'd Heroe! Fame his hasty missives sent</l>
               <l>To all Earth's Monarchs! who allready have,</l>
               <l>Counting the VVorld two little for thy grave,</l>
               <l>Rear'd up a pyramis of high renown,</l>
               <l>VVhich shall out-last the longest Monarchs crown,</l>
               <l>VVhere long-live'd Fame upon its summit sings</l>
               <l>The fatal trag'die of the best of Kings:</l>
               <l>In vaulting thee so close, think let them not</l>
               <l>That e're their Regicede shall be forgot,</l>
               <l>For though thou hidden under ground dost lye,</l>
               <l>Their Names above ground rot, and ne'r shall dye.</l>
               <l>God turns Hells spiteful Arrows on his head,</l>
               <l>The world Salvation gain'd, Christ Crucified,</l>
               <l>And murther'd <hi>Charles</hi> the Name of Martyr gains:</l>
               <l>Tho' Life and three Crowns lost: more now remains</l>
               <l>For him a Life immortal, and a Crown,</l>
               <l>Of Shining Glory, and of high Renown.</l>
               <l>Which spight of Rebels Acts, though he be Dead,</l>
               <l>Shall now for ever Crown His Royal Head.</l>
