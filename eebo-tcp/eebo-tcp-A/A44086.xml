            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Two Pamphlets
Lately Published by
Mr. COLLIER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to your Desire, I have sent you
here my Thoughts concerning the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the three Absolving Clergymen, at
Sir <hi>J. Friend's</hi> and Sir <hi>W. Parkins's</hi> Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
together with some short Remarks on Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62952:3"/>
two Papers in which he has endeavour'd to
justify those Proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall consider 'em, First,</hi> With Relation to the
Church; <hi>and Secondly,</hi> With relation to the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As they are</hi> considered with Relation to the Church;
<hi>I take 'em to be</hi> irregular <hi>and</hi> unwarrantable <hi>on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
accounts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 1st. Such an <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> as those Clergy-men
made use of in the <hi>Absolution,</hi> is by no means
warrantable. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> endeavours to shew that the
giving of Absolution, with imposition of Hands,
was the general Practise of the Antient Churches,
particularly in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Age, and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this Ceremony was allow'd to Priests,
and sometimes to Deacons as well as Bishops.</p>
            <p>Suppose all this, Yet this Practice of those Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
does not at all justify Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s Proceedings
in this Point, and that for these two Reasons.</p>
            <p>1st. The Absolution in which those Antients
made use of <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> was not such an
<hi>Absolution</hi> as that in which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> was concern'd;
but an Absolution of Persons <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> or
such as had deserted the Communion of the Church.
It was customary in the Antient Church to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
such as had committed any very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and notorious Crime, and after they had given
the Church Satisfaction, and were again to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62952:3"/>
to it; they were Absolv'd from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Church by the <hi>Imposition of Hands.</hi>
What they meant in this Case by the <hi>Laying on of
Hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 74. p 213.</note> we may learn from S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> They
look't upon those that were out of the Church, to
be depriv'd of <hi>the Holy Ghost,</hi> and (as he saith) not to
be <hi>truly Christians.</hi> And, as now in our <hi>Ordinations,</hi> we
make use of <hi>the Imposition of Hands;</hi> so the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
frequently made use of the same Ceremony for
restoring to the Communion of the Church, such
as before were <hi>Excommunicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the same cause it was that they that were Baptiz'd
either by <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schismaticks</hi> were not among
them receiv'd into the Church, but by <hi>Imposition of
Hands;</hi> for tho they own'd the Baptism of <hi>Hereticks</hi>
and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> to be valid, yet they did not believe
that any so Baptised, could be endued with the
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> till the Church had laid their Hands
on 'em. For the same reason the <hi>Imposition of hands</hi>
was made use of when any one that had turn'd <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi>
or <hi>Schismatick,</hi> was again reconcil'd to the
Church; as also in the Absolution of the <hi>Lapsi,</hi> that
is, such as in the times of <hi>Persecution,</hi> had <hi>Sacrificed</hi>
to the <hi>Heathen Gods;</hi> and by doing so, had thrown
themselves out of the Communion of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Examples and Authorities produced by Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
are all of this kind; neither can he (if I am not
much mistaken) produce any one instance of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Hands</hi> in <hi>Absolution,</hi> except in the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62952:4"/>
of Offenders to the Church. His <hi>Albaspinae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
will hardly be able to supply him with any that
are pertinent to his purpose. But,</p>
            <p>2dly. Could he shew that in the Antient Church,
this <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> was made use of
in <hi>Absolution,</hi> in other cases besides that mention'd;
yet his Proceedings, (who professes himself to be a
Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to Govern
himself by the Orders of it) could not be Justified by
any such Instances of those times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is</hi> Tertullian's <hi>Observation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lege fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei manente caetera jam disciplinae &amp; conversationis admittunt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionis. <hi>De Virg. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, c.</hi> 1.</note> That the Law of
Faith remaining intire, other things belonging to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and Conversation, admit alteration according as
circumstances require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And accordingly our Church hath declared,</hi> That
every particular, or National Church hath Authority
to Ordain, Change, and Abolish Ceremonies or Rites of
the Church,<note place="margin">Art. 34.</note> Ordained only by Man's Authority, so that
all things be done to Edifying.</p>
            <p>Now since the <hi>laying on of Hands</hi> in Absolution, is
acknowledged to be only a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and not to be
necessary to it; it must be in its own Nature change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and so may be used or laid aside as the Church
shall see meet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62952:4"/>
And since it is a Ceremony not <hi>retained</hi> in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> it's being in use heretofore in
another Church or Age, cannot warrant the use of
it in any particular Officer of this Church, no more
than it will the standing on the Lord's Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> the <hi>Trine Immersion,</hi>
and several other Rites, too many to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> has as much Power
and Authority, as to the Institution or Abolition,
the Use or Disuse of any particular Ceremonies, as
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s own Church had; and a Minister of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not to govern himself herein
by the usage of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but by his
own. And therefore it is not sufficient for Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to
shew <hi>Imposition of Hands</hi> in Absolution to be a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
used in the <hi>African</hi> Church that will justify
his Practice; for then by the same Reason all
Ceremonies of those Churches, and of all other
Orthodox Churches in that time, or before, would
become obligatory; But, (as a Member of the
Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> would then) he must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to prove it to be the Injunction or practice
of his own Church. What say the Articles, or
Rubricks, or Canons, or Offices of the Church
where he Officiates? What they injoyn,
he must use; what that uses he may Practice: But
he cannot be a Rule to himself. He is no more to
add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than he is to injoyn or alter, for they all belong
to the same Authority. So impertinent is that which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62952:5"/>
he alledges in his own defence, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of <hi>Laying on of Hands</hi> is not prescribed in the
<hi>Rubrick</hi> of <hi>Absolution;</hi> so neither is it <hi>Prohibited.</hi>
               </q>
For if the not being Prohibited, could be a sufficient
warrant for a particular Person's Practice, we might
return to the condition the Church was in, in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>'s
Time, which he complains of; nay, to the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniale</hi>
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and so the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of our Church concerning ceremonies, <hi>why some
are abolished, and some retained,</hi> be altogether in vain.
Good Order, Uniformity and Decency require, that,
as those Ceremonies which the Church Ordains,
should not be omitted at pleasure by particular Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;
so They should not make use of any but what
the Church and Law amongst us do Prescribe; of
which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> may be convinced, if he peruse the Act
of Uniformity, XIV. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. or the Rubrick of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<hi>why some be abolished, and some retained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is contrary to the Practise of the
Church of Christ in general, and against the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our <hi>Rubrick</hi> in particular, to Absolve a Person,
or to assist in the Absolution of a Person, whose Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Repentance are known no otherwise than by
the Testimony of others; as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> assisted in the
Absolution of Sir <hi>I. Friend;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Snatt,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in that of Sir <hi>W. Parkins.</hi> 'Tis requir'd by
the <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the <hi>Visitation of the Sick,</hi> that before
the <hi>Absolution</hi> there shall be a <hi>Confession</hi> of Sins to the
<hi>Minister that Absolves,</hi> and that after the <hi>Confession,</hi>
the Penitent shall desire <hi>Absolution</hi> from <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62952:5"/>
It runs thus: <hi>Here shall the sick Person be mov'd to
make a special Confession of his Sins, if he feel his
Conscience troubled with any weighty Matter. After
which Confession, the Priest shall Absolve him (if he
humbly and heartily desire it) after this sort,</hi> &amp;c.
The Instances brought by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to justifie
his Practice, from the Custom of the Ancient
Church, of admitting Strangers to Communion,
by Virtue of a <hi>Certificate</hi> given by the Bishop
under whom they formerly lived; and from the
Custom of our Church of conferring <hi>Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
on such as are not personally known, upon
the Recommendation of others, is by no means
sufficient. For as to the <hi>former,</hi> he passes by
the main point, and doth not so much as venture
to give one Instance of Persons Absolved after
that Manner, by a joint Act of several Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and by the Major part of such as had no
Personal knowledge of the State of the professed
Penitent. And the Instances he gives, are not at
all parallel; since those Ancients never gave those
<hi>Certificates</hi> to such as were not Personally known
to them, or whose Case they were not privy to; and
much less to such as stood Condemn'd for Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Crimes. As to the <hi>latter,</hi> [the Practice of our
Church,] he is guilty of a gross mistake; for Orders
amongst us are never Conferr'd upon such as are
not Personally known. The Law and Canons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
require, That the Person to be Ordained should
be recommended by some approv'd Presbyters, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62952:6"/>
give him Credit as to his Behaviour and other
Qualifications by a Certificate. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
he is further to be particularly
Examined by the Arch-Deacon, the proper
Offsicer deputed by the Law and the Church
for that Service;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Office for Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> who is to Enquire of him, and
Examine him, and is to give an Account of the
Candidate's Qualifications, and to declare Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Solemnly to the Bishop before his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
that the Person whom he presents, is
<hi>apt</hi> and <hi>meet</hi> for the Ministry. But were it so,
that Orders are Conferred upon others Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
yet it is supposed to be what the
Law and the Canons of the Church allow and
appoint. But to absolve or to assist in the Absolution
of a Person, whose <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> we are
not immediately acquainted with, is contrary to
the Directions of the Church; neither is there
any Necessity that can justifie it, or if it could, it
had no place here. For it had been <hi>sufficient</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
also, if He that receiv'd the <hi>Confession</hi> had
given the <hi>Absolution</hi> without any Assistant.</p>
            <p>3. Another thing that I look upon to be <hi>Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
is, their pronouncing Absolution in Publick,
when there was not any publick <hi>Confession.</hi> What
Example of this kind does Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> meet with
in the <hi>Antient Church?</hi> In a Case where the
Crime had been Publick and Notorious, and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62952:6"/>
               <hi>Penitents</hi> were reconciled to the Church and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Communion, the Absolution indeed was
publick, but so was also their Repentance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
But in such a case to give a Publick Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
upon a secret Confession and private Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
is peculiar to these Persons, and what they
have the Honour to be the first Inventers of. But
this I shall have farther occasion to touch again
on by and by, when I come to consider their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
with relation to the Civil Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither <hi>4thly,</hi> can their concurring all <hi>Three</hi>
together in the Absolution, be sufficiently excus'd.
For tho' perhaps in it self it carries nothing of ill
with it, yet 'tis no small Presumption in the
Clergy, to pretend to do a thing so unusual in
the Church, without any Church-Rule, or any
former President in the Church, especially, in that
which they stand related to.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> would perswade us, that such things
as these which I have condemn'd as <hi>Irregularities,</hi>
are left by the Church to the Prudence and
Discretion of those that Officiate, tho' they are
but of the inferiour Clergy. No such matter.
It is not the Inferiour Clergy to whose Prudence
and Discretion such things as these are left.
There are many things left to the Prudence and
Discretion of the Bishops, the Fathers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62952:7"/>
of the Church: But the Inferiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
are to act according to the receiv'd Rules and
Directions; they are not to Innovate in any
thing without the permission and leave of their
Superiours. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> might have learnt from
St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (to whom, as he acknowledges, <hi>we
are principally obliged for the Remains we have of the
Discipline and Government of the Primitive Church,</hi>)
a better and truer Notion, concerning the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Subjection of the Inferiour Clergy to
their <hi>Diocesans,</hi> and the Honour that is due to
the <hi>Episcopal Order.</hi> There never was any Bishop
that paid greater deference to his Inferiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
than that Great Man did: Yet would he
have suffered his Clergy to alter the Rules and
Customs of the Church without his Consent?
Would he have thought well of such forward and
presuming Presbyters? It was usual with him to
consult with his Clergy, for the Government and
good Order of his Church; but he knew better
things, than to suffer them to make use of their
Prudence and Discretion, in opposiion to, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
from the Customs and Rules of his Church.
He expresses in many of his <hi>Epistles,</hi> a very great
dislike of the Proceedings of some of his Clergy,
in using their own Discretion, in admitting
the <hi>Lapsi</hi> to Communion without his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Consent. He asserts his Episcopal
Authority, and he strictly charges them not
to take upon them after that manner, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62952:7"/>
not to <hi>Absolve</hi> for the future, till he himself
should return and judge of the sufficiency of
the Confession and Repentance of those that
were to be <hi>Reconciled,</hi> and together with the
Clergy lay his Hands upon them. He tells
them roundly, that in the Time of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
no Presbyters durst do such things,
that<note n="*" place="margin">Quod enim non periculum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere debemus de offensâ domini; quando aliqui de Presbyteris, nec Evangelii, nec loci sui memores, sed neque futurum domini judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, neque nunc sibi praepositum Episcopum cogitantes, quod nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam omnino sub antecessoribus factum est, cum contumeliâ &amp; contemptu Praepositi, totum sibi vindicent? <hi>Ep.</hi> 16.</note> their Proceedings
were an Affront to his
Authority; and<note n="†" place="margin">Inde per temporum &amp; succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionum vices, Episcoporum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatio, &amp; Ecclesiae ratio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currit, ut Ecclesia super Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos constituatur: <hi>Et omnis actus Ecclesiae per eosdem Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positos gubernetur.</hi> Ep. 33.</note> 
               <hi>that
all the Acts of the Church
ought to be governed and
directed by the Bishops of
the Church.</hi> And it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears from his Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<hi>Epistle,</hi> that his
Regular Clergy did not
dare in his absence to
Absolve the <hi>Lapsi,</hi> even
in a Case of Necessity,
when they lay on their
<hi>Death-beds,</hi> till he himself had Writ to them,
and given them a Commission to do it without
him.</p>
            <p>I shall say no more of these matters, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take notice how briskly and triumphantly
Mr. <hi>C.</hi> lays about him sometimes in the open
Air without any Adversary to oppose him. You
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62952:8"/>
would think the Bishops, according to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,
(if you had not read their <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)
were to be very easily refuted, and guilty
of strange mistakes. But when you compare
the <hi>Declaration</hi> and the <hi>Answer</hi> together, you
will have occasion to wonder, who it is Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
is pleased to write against. The Bishops never
denied that the <hi>laying on of Hands</hi> was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
used by the Antients in <hi>Absolution:</hi> But
they understood (I presume) that it was not
made use of in such an <hi>Absolution</hi> as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> was
concerned in. They never denied but that in
reconciling to the Church a Person that was
out of its Communion, even <hi>Presbyters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did sometimes Officiate alone with that
Ceremony. But they do not allow that they
should take upon themselves to alter the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Rules and Customs of the Church, or to
add any to them which are not already Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
They do not deny, but that a Malefactor
condemn'd to die, if he appears to be truly Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
for all his Sins in general, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that for which he stands condemned, and
does humbly and earnestly desire Absolution,
may be allow'd that Benefit and Comfort; but
they do not approve of its being perform'd in
Publick without as publick a Confession, much
less by such <hi>Imposition of Hands;</hi> neither do they
allow that any such Clergy-man should <hi>Absolve,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62952:8"/>
who is not immediately and particularly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Condition of the Person.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more which ought not to
be passed by without an Animadversion, and
that is Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s disingenuity in laying to the
Charge of the Bishops, that they blame the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
Clergy-men for pronouncing a Form of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
With</hi> submission (says Mr. <hi>C.) a Form
is better than no Form.</hi> He adds, that he <hi>is
sorry to see the solemn Offices of Religion mention'd,
with such seeming Coldness and Abatements of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</hi>
I hope Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will, on second Thoughts,
be <hi>sorry</hi> for so false an Accusation, and think
himself oblig'd to ask pardon of the Bishops for
Expressions so unbecoming towards Persons of
their Character and Station. And that you may
be able to judge what reason he has to do so,
I shall here produce their Words.</p>
            <p>Lastly, For those Clergy-men that took
upon them to Absolve these Criminals at the
place of Execution, by laying all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Hands upon their Heads, and
publickly pronouncing a Form of Absolution:
As their manner of doing this was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62952:9"/>
Insolent, and without Precedent, either
in our Church or any other that we know
of; so the thing it self was altogether ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular.
<hi>By which it appears, that They
do not disapprove of their using a</hi> Form
<hi>of Absolution, but of their using it
with such Circumstances, and on such
an Occasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to consider the Proceedings
of the <hi>Absolvers with relation to the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this matter is considered <hi>with relation to the
State,</hi> I cannot call it by a softer Name than that of
a daring—I do not love to use hard
Words; I hate it in others, and I would
not do it my self; yet I cannot but call it
a daring piece of Insolence. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is pleased
to tell us, That if he had been permitted to
wait upon Sir <hi>W. Parkins</hi> in Prison the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was Executed, he had given him
<hi>Absolution,</hi> not in publick, but in private.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62952:9"/>
In Answer to which, I must beg your leave to
observe Three Things. 1. That Mr. <hi>Snatt</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> were permitted to be with Sir <hi>John
Friend</hi> so long, that they might have Absolv'd
him in <hi>private,</hi> if they had not chosen to do it
in <hi>publick.</hi> 2. That after Mr. <hi>C.</hi> was prohibited,
there was another <hi>Non-jurant</hi> Minister, one Mr.
<hi>Bell,</hi> allow'd to wait upon Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> by
Sir <hi>William</hi>'s own desire: Now, why did not that
Gentleman Absolve him there in private? What
reason can be given for that, except it be that
the Absolution was intended to be <hi>publick?</hi> Was
it because Sir <hi>William</hi> desired to be <hi>Absolv'd</hi> by Mr.
<hi>Collier?</hi> Why would not the <hi>Other</hi>'s Absolution sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him; especially considering that he was of
his own choosing? 3. It is to be observ'd, that
(as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> himself informs us) upon the same oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
at the Execution of Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> 1690. the
<hi>Absolution</hi> was pronounced by a <hi>Non-jurant</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in Publick, at the same place, and in the same
manner. Would not this alone (were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to be said) give us too much reason
to suspect, that it was not Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of pronouncing the Absolution in Private,
that made him do it in Publick, but that he had
all along intended to perform it in Publick. He
that seriously considers that the same was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s Execution, and with the same
Circumstances, and what I before observ'd, will be
very apt to believe, that it was the Resolution
of those of the <hi>Non-jurant</hi> Clergy who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
our Assemblies, to Absolve their Friends af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner. I might add, that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>'s
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62952:10"/>
Inclination to perform the Absolution in <hi>Publick,</hi>
does sufficiently appear from his forwardness in
joining with the other two Gentlemen in the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> with whom he had not
been at all concern'd.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is a Gentleman whom I know not, and
I'm sure I do not hate: And I would rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him if I saw any way to do it, than aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
his Crime. I will for the present force my
self even against my reason to yield to what he says.
Let the matter therefore stand thus, as to him:
Yet it cannot be denied, but that the Resentment
which the Government has express'd on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is highly reasonable and just.</p>
            <p>For <hi>First</hi> it ought to be consider'd, that to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
a Person condemn'd for High-Treason, if he
owns the Fact, and does not shew himself sorry
for it, is plainly to declare that we look on that
Fact as no Crime. And therefore though the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
be pronounced in private, yet if it be
known that there was such an Absolution, the
Government has reason to look upon the Absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
as an Enemy, and accordingly to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; how much more when the Party Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
is not only condemn'd for High-Treason,
but for the horridest part of it, a Design to <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate</hi>
a King! When I first lookt into Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s
Papers, I was in hopes he would have given
the World an Assurance, that he thought Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Parkins,</hi> whom he had Absolv'd, truly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62952:10"/>
for the Crime for which he was condemn'd,
and that he was surpriz'd to find afterwards by
the Speech, which he left behind him, that he
was not really so. If he had said this, he had
said something material. But instead of that, you
will meet with nothing but what will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convince you, that when he Absolv'd him, he
did not look upon him to be sorry for that Fact
in particular: And therefore since he Absolv'd
him, he justified the Fact. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> tells us, that
he did not see Sir <hi>William Parkins</hi>'s Paper till after
the Execution. But did he not know by his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
how far he was engaged in the Crimes he
was condemn'd for, and how little sorry for it?
He says he is not obliged to <hi>reveal any part of his
Confession.</hi> But why will he not? One Reason
may be, because it will make, not for him, but
against him. If Sir <hi>William</hi> denied, that he was
any ways concern'd in that of which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd,
and for which he was condemn'd, or if he
repented of it; why will not Mr. <hi>C.</hi> tell us so?
To say the Truth on't, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> seems here to be at
a loss; whilst at one time, he saith, Sir <hi>William</hi>
gave him <hi>the State of his Conscience,</hi> and upon
which he judged him fit for the most <hi>solemn A<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the Church;</hi> and yet another while, he
would have his Reader believe, that Sir <hi>William</hi>
did <hi>not acquaint him with the intended Assassination.</hi>
But because this was a little too gross to impose
upon his Reader in, he shuffles it off again; and
would have it understood, that if he was <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
with it, it was in <hi>Confession;</hi> and then he is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62952:11"/>
               <hi>obliged to conceal it. What else can be the
meaning of what he saith?</hi> Pray did he confess it
to me, and have I revealed any part of his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
Then I had been guilty of High Misdemeanour
indeed. I had broke the 13th Canon, and been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
irregular by the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> must have been in some distress, or else
one of his capacity could not but have seen into
the inconsistency of this. For</p>
            <p>1. If Sir <hi>William</hi> gave him a <hi>State of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
he must give him an account of his <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the intended Assassination.</hi> For that
was a Crime could not escape his Penitent's cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance;
and being of such an heinous nature in common
estimation, the least that can be supposed of Sir <hi>William</hi>
is, that he would know his Casuist's Judgment of it;
whether it was a Crime or no Crime.</p>
            <p>2. If Sir <hi>William</hi> did not <hi>acquaint</hi> him with it;
yet the Confessary was bound to lay it home to
his Conscience, if he himself knew it, and judged
it to be a Crime; and for which the Confessary had a
great advantage and a fair opportunity offer'd to
him; because, he saith, Sir <hi>William seem'd very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of absolution at his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Confessary was bound not to be ignorant
of this; for who would go to a Criminal, and be
prepared to give him Absolution, and yet know
nothing of the Crime he stood condemned for?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62952:11"/>
This is contrary to common Sense, and to the
whole Form of proceeding according to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
in the <hi>Office;</hi> and what no Man in his Wits
can believe of Mr. <hi>C.</hi> Nor indeed could he be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ignorant, unless he had led the Life of an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
and been carried directly from his Cell to
<hi>Newgate,</hi> to hear his Confession.</p>
            <p>And yet when he talks of <hi>the Committee,</hi> and
the <hi>Votes,</hi> &amp;c. its after as loose a way; and what
none that know the circumstances of the Confessary
can imagine.</p>
            <p>4. However there remains a terrible Cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
for he suggests that he should be chargeable
with no less a Crime than betraying <hi>Confession,</hi> if he
should discover it; and if he had owned that Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
acquainted him with the Intended Assassination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I own would be the best Argument if it
were true, or had any thing to support it. But
how sacred and inviolable soever, the Seal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is; and which our Church has obliged all
Guides of Souls to preserve in cases secret, and that
concern the private State of a Man's Soul: Yet
there is an exempted case, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> acknowledges,
in which the obligation doth not hold; and that
is, when <hi>the Crimes are such as by the Laws of
this Realm, the Minister's own Life may be called
in question, for concealing the same.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 113.</note> And what
Crime is there that more apparently falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this exception, than Treason, and the Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62952:12"/>
of a Prince? A Crime which indeed had
at the time of making this Canon, some Patrons
in the World; but none till now in our Church.
And now I leave it to every Impartial Person's
Judgment (but amongst them in this Argument,
I am afraid I cannot promise Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will be one)
to observe, whether <hi>the Exception in the Canon doth
not reach the case in hand, even upon the largest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> affirms.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole I know not by what Principles
these New-fashioned Guides proceed; nor to what
Church they are so near a kin, as that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side the four Seas: Such Principles are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible
to me, as the <hi>Methods of Murder</hi> he
talks of. And if after all, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> can Absolve
without knowing the Case of the Penitent (as, he
did not know it, if he was not acquainted with
Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Concernment, or Charge at least, in
the Assassination) or can <hi>judge him to have aright
to all the Privileges of Communion,</hi> that as far as
he seems to know, died Impenitent as to the highest
Charge; then such a Confession and such an Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and I may add such Confessaries too, are the first, for
ought I know of that sort and, I pray, God they may
be the last that shall trouble the World in this kind.</p>
            <p>The Government is throughly perswaded, that
Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and his Absolving Brethren did believe the
Persons Absolv'd were concern'd in those things for
which they were condemn'd, and that they did
not repent of 'em. Is the Government mistaken
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62952:12"/>
in this Opinion, or not? I would ask Mr. <hi>C. &amp;c.</hi>
that one Question. They dare not say that it is:
They must therefore excuse it, if it look a little
hard upon them and express a Resentment suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Faults.</p>
            <p>But 2dly. Should we grant that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to pronounce the Absolution in <hi>private,</hi> if he
could have been admitted to the Prisoner the last
day, yet when he came to give it at the Place of
Execution, he did it (as well as Mr. <hi>Snatt</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Cook</hi>) in such a manner and with such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
as shew, that he design'd to make it
as publick and notorious as possibly he could.
It plainly appears that they all three had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
and agree'd that Matter before-hand. If they
needs would Absolve them, why did they not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to conceal it from the People? No,
that would not serve their turn. They were not
content to pronounce the <hi>Absolution,</hi> unless it were
known to all the Hearers and By-standers that it
was an <hi>Absolution.</hi> And because there were many
<hi>Spectators,</hi> who were not also <hi>Hearers,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
by using an unusual Ceremony to make it
be <hi>seen</hi> where it could not be <hi>heard,</hi> and to make
it as more notorious, so also more memorable.
And lest it should be suspected that they were not
all of the same mind, they all join their Hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the Absolution of both Persons. As they
shew by pronouncing the Absolution, that they
look upon the Fact as no Sin, so by doing it after
that manner, with such unusual Circumstances,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62952:13"/>
they bid the World take notice that they do not
think it a Sin.</p>
            <p>And after all this, can they think the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so stupid as not a little to rouse itself up at
so publick and daring a Defiance? They may call
these Proceedings, if they please, <hi>an innocent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;</hi>
they may think of the Government as they
please; they cannot but know, that whatever they
think of the Government, It thinks (upon good
grounds) very well of itself; and of consequence
they must acknowledge, that it had Reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their Carriage and Behaviour as extremely <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent,</hi>
and to endeavour, by shewing itself sensible
of this Affront, to secure itself from the like for the
time to come.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> tells us, that <hi>when at Mr.</hi> Ashton<hi>'s Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
Absolution was given in the same manner with
Imposition of Hands, at the same place, and upon the
same occasion, and a justifying Paper left by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that suffer'd; at that time there was no Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made either to Manner or Thing. The Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
was so far from displeasing, that the</hi> Sheriff
<hi>gave his Thanks for the Solemnity of the Office. There
was no Complaints either at</hi> Lambeth, <hi>or</hi> Whitehall,
<hi>no publick Invective, no seizing of Body and Goods;
in short, no Signs of the least dissatisfaction. And
who</hi> (says he) <hi>could imagine, that the bare repeating
of an Action, should raise such a Storm upon us now,
which was perfectly inoffensive before? To punish in
this manner without Warning, or Precedent, without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62952:13"/>
Canon, or Law, is (with submission) somewhat unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</hi>
I have Reason to believe that what was
done of this nature at Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s Execution,
was never made known to the Governours either
of the Church or State: And how could they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
a Person for that which they never heard of?
If a single Example of this kind be made use of as
a <hi>Precedent,</hi> it is fit the Government should take
care that there may be no more such <hi>Precedents.</hi>
But saith he <hi>the performance was so far from displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that the Sheriff gave his thanks for the Solemnity
of the Office?</hi> What for the <hi>Office</hi> of Absolution,
without declaring his Repentance for the Crime
he was condemn'd for? He might as well have
said, that the Sheriff <hi>thought well</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s
<hi>justifying Paper,</hi> because he was so civil as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it; and well of the Cause he died in; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not interrupt him in his last Hours.
Both alike probable, and both alike true. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some Men Civility will pass for approbation;
and every Man that is not rude shall be of their
Party, or a well-wisher to it. The Worthy Person
that at that time bore that Character is alive, and
the best Relater of his own Actions: But he knows
nothing of this matter; and saith it is no other than
a Fiction; or at best a gross mistake.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> thinks it <hi>somewhat unintelligible to punish
in this manner without Warning, or Precedent,
without Canon, or Law.</hi> To me it is not only
<hi>somewhat</hi> but <hi>very unintelligible,</hi> that to punish for
such a Proceeding is <hi>to punish without Warning, or
Precedent, or Canon, or Law.</hi> Are not Men suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62952:14"/>
               <hi>warn'd</hi> not to do any thing that may
reasonably be construed to be a Defiance to the
Government? Is there no <hi>Law or Canon</hi> of the
Church to <hi>Admonish</hi> such <hi>Presbyters</hi> as presume
of themselves to act contrary to the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and
openly to use such Ceremonies as are not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary?
Is there no <hi>Law</hi> to punish and chastise
such Persons as declare, by their Actions, in the
face of the whole World, that they think it no
Crime to bring in a Foreign Power; (whose busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it has been to extirpate the Protestant Religion
in his own Country, as well as to trample under his
Imperious Foot the native Privileges of his People?)
Is there no Law to call such Persons to account;
that violate the Laws of Nations, and that combine
to assassinate one whom the Nation after the most
solemn manner has owned to be their King; and who
enjoys the Crown by the surest of Tenures, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his People, as well as the Consent of the
Estates of the Realm? Is there no Law, nor
Canon to punish such Confessaries, as Absolve those
that imbrue their hands in the Blood of Princes,
and that dye without declaring any particular
Repentance for what they stand condemned for, and
a Repentance as open and notorious as their Crime?
By this new sort of Casuistical Divinity, They may
dye <hi>as innocent as the Child unborn,</hi> who combine to
call in and join with a Foreign Force; that should
they have had Success answerable to the design,
would have laid the whole Nation desolate, and
made it a Field of Blood. These are the Persons that
are absolv'd. But how are they absolv'd? Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62952:14"/>
peaks for the rest, <hi>I,</hi> saith he, <hi>absolv'd Sir William as
a Penitent.</hi> Thus indeed it should have been, if the
nature of Absolution had been heeded; for that (as
Mr. <hi>C.</hi> rightly observes) <hi>supposes both sin and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the notion of it.</hi> And if Sir <hi>William</hi> died <hi>as a
Penitent,</hi> and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> absolv'd him <hi>as a Penitent;</hi> then
surely Sir <hi>William</hi> did express his Repentance, and his
Repentance, especially, for being concerned <hi>in the
intended Assassination.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>C.</hi> cautiously slips
this over (as he always doth, when it comes in his
way) For, saith he, <hi>as to the matter of Sir</hi> William<hi>'s
Repentance, that is never likely to be known from me.</hi>
A caution that is indeed fit to be observ'd (as has been
before said) in cases secret and that belong to the
Closet. But what's this to Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Case, who
was condemned for a Crime as notorious as heinous;
and what he confess'd himself to have been guilty of?
Now can Mr. <hi>C.</hi> be supposed to <hi>receive his Confession,</hi>
and that this should not be a branch of it? Then it
would have been <hi>a defective Confession</hi> indeed. But,
saith he, <hi>supposing I received a defective Confession, am I
accountable for it?</hi> Yes surely, accountable to God
for suffering him <hi>that was ready to receive the fatal
stroke,</hi> to dye Impenitent; for so Sir <hi>William</hi> did, if he
neither charged himself with it, nor was charged with
it by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> And accountable he is to the State,
nay to all Mankind for absolving him <hi>as a Penitent,</hi>
that died guilty in design, of an execrable Assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which is in Mr. <hi>C.</hi> a fair step to the justifying
of it. So that as to the World Sir <hi>William</hi> is thought
to dye <hi>Impenitent;</hi> and if not so to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> he must
dye as to him a <hi>Martyr.</hi>

I shall add but a word or two more, and that is to

to consent to their Irregularities, and to
make their mere <hi>being of the Party,</hi> a sufficient Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
how uncanonical soever they were in
giving Absolution to others, to obtain from them
their <hi>Own.</hi>
