         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:47076:3"/>
Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> which may enable us to ſurmount the Difficulty of the Work, <hi>and through the Tribulations of our Day, bring us to the Recompence of that Peace which is Eternal.</hi> And indeed, this is our Joy above all worldly things, <hi>that the Lord is our Light, and our Salvation,</hi> we know it, we experience it; <hi>therefore whom ſhould we fear?</hi> Though all <hi>Sects</hi> ſeem met in one, <hi>as a mighty Man of War, to our Overthrow,</hi> the deſpiſed <hi>Stripling</hi> (by this great <hi>Goliah)</hi> has a <hi>Sling and a Stone,</hi> that (however contemptible, yet) coming in the Name of the Lord, will give this <hi>Giant</hi>'s <hi>Head a Victim to his Faith.</hi> We know in whom we have believed, and cannot be <hi>Cudgell'd, Jeer'd, Rail'd or Smooth'd out of</hi> our moſt Holy Faith, who has God for its Father, and Victory for its Off-ſpring. A Birth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Bawling <hi>Phariſees</hi> of the Age; nor can any but a Conquerour inherit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> their Cries for <hi>Scripture, Chriſt, Fundamentals,</hi> and the like, are meer Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences that make but up a Cloak to cover the <hi>Avaricious,</hi> and <hi>Ambitious</hi> Ends of thoſe lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men in every Party, that as deeply and vigorouſly proſecute our Ruin, as a <hi>Jew doth Riches;</hi> but the Reaſon is known to Almighty God. Becauſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> having been taught that Inward, Heavenly, Straight and Narrow Way to Life by an Internal Living Teacher;
<pb facs="tcp:47076:3"/>
they would, <hi>ſay they,</hi> ſruſtrate all Hope of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advantage, <hi>the Ignorance of People in the things of God has hitherto benefited us withal,</hi> by their moſt vehement Declaration to the World, that <hi>no Man can be a Child of God, who is not begotten of God; and that no Man can be ſo begotten, but by the Internal Operation of his Spirit to Waſh, Cleanſe and Inliven the Mind to God-ward; that this is the Deepeſt and moſt Excellent End for which Man was made, the Law was given, Prophets raiſed, and Chriſt Came, Lived, Died, Roſe and Aſcended: That who know him not thus let into the Conſcience, in order to Purge it from Dead Works, by the Deſtruction of that Power which product them, to lead Captivity Captive, and Raign as King, Lord, Judge and Law-giver, are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Croſs of Chriſt, and are at beſt but Carnal, Hiſtorical, and meerly Out-ſide Chriſtians.</hi> And this we ſtanding by, and they knowing full well, with the fatal Conſequence to their Deſigns that would attend the Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this kind of Doctrine, they ſeek to divert the Minds of tender and enquiring People by all the <hi>Hideous, Deviliſh Falſities Satan's utmoſt Intereſt can furniſh them withall;</hi> deforming us with what Mire they can either borrow or invent, hoping by ſuch <hi>Beſmeerings</hi> to make the <hi>Dogs faſten us</hi> for ſome Monſtrous Beaſts, and chuſing rather to Solemnize our
<pb facs="tcp:47076:4"/>
Funeral, with the Merriment of the Vulgar, then suffer them to know us truly as we are, leſt their ſober Conſcience ſhould enquire or be toucht with any the leaſt Pitty for our ſo hard Dealing at their Cruel Hands.</p>
            <p>Well! but for Your ſakes, <hi>O Impartial People!</hi> am I this time engaged in Spirit to concern my ſelf, otherwiſe againſt my Will, to take an Angry, Scoffing <hi>Independent</hi> Prieſt in hand; a Man I know not, but by his Book, and certainly an Ignorant, Malicious and Scurrilous one too. I perceive how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſoever he is to me, I am not to him, <hi>and he has taken great Care to tell me ſo:</hi> but mine own Concern would have ſuggeſted Silence to me for an Anſwer to his Uncivil Reflections (for Arguments I cannot call them) had not my earneſt Deſires been for the Vindication of that Truth <hi>Living,</hi> upon all Occaſions offer'd, which the <hi>Grave</hi> will prevent me doing. It is my Satisfaction God has made it my Lot; and that of ſuffering from Detractors, I eſteem not the leaſt part of my Crown: for whoſe Holy Service, he is my Witneſs, I have long ſince chearfully ſacrific'd my All of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this World; and yet am not without a ſhare from his peculiar Providence.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee if the <hi>Quakers</hi> are thoſe Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably Deluded Wretches, this <hi>Taunting Prieſt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47076:4"/>

If we are what he aſſerts, we are the worſt of Men, by how much we pretend to greater things; but if it ſhall appear, we are Scripturally <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> in ſome of thoſe very Points for which he repreſents us <hi>Heterodox,</hi> and miſtaken by him in the reſt; I hope it will not be without Good Reaſon, that I have entituld this ſhort Diſcourſe <hi>Quakeriſm a New</hi> Nick-Name <hi>for Old Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> the whole of what I have to deſire from thee is an <hi>Impartial Mind</hi> in the Peruſal of this Defence and Iuſt Explanation of our ſo much miſ-repreſented <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine;</hi> with that we dare adventure our Cauſe, and without it there is no Truth ſo clear, that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> may not queſtion it.

That the Diſtinct Times of their Appearance is no Argument againſt their Harmony, or being but Two Words for the ſame Thing, ſince the ſame Truth may appear at Two diſtinct Ages of the World. It would ſtrike out <hi>J. Faldo</hi> as well as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> if the Contrary were admitted. That he groſly Contradicts himſelf as to Time. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has more or leſs been in the World where Godly Men and Women have been, as well before as ſince that Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. We intend no New Diſpenſation, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Revelation of the ſame Power, which is the True Goſpel. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</item>

That the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> being Obligatory, does not conclude it the General Rule under the Goſpel. The Diſ-ingenuity of our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,</hi> in citing the Apoſtle's Words, Reprehended: The <hi>Scriptures</hi> no Judge in that ſenſe wherein they are not the General Rule.

§. 2. I am truly Sorry to ſee, that among the ſeveral Arguments, ſome Men's Prudence render'd for Toleration, <hi>that of giving Diſſenters Liberty, and they would War within themſelves,</hi> ſhould be ſo amply verified by their Unchriſtian Irruption upon us (diſturbing thoſe by Slanderous Pamphlets, who would not be concern'd in their Heats.) But this Folly and Uncharitableneſs, I am to tell the World, lies not at the <hi>Quakers Door,</hi> who ſeek Peace with all Men; but ſome Reſtleſs Spirits among other Perſwaſions, <hi>whoſe whole Food ſeems to turn into Conteſt,</hi> and ſhew they can no more live without it, then the Air they breath in. <hi>What ſhall we do then? Suffer their Slanders, Detractions, Additions, and Down-right Abuſes of us to paſs Unanſwer'd?</hi> No: for then we ſhall be concluded, either <hi>Guilty</hi> or <hi>Vanquiſht.</hi> What then? Why we will defend our ſelves with <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> and that I hope, with God's Aſſiſtance, to do in this ſhort Treatiſe, to the Confuſion of our Enemies, and Renowning the Truth, and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Innocence to the World.</p>

This then does not make <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> a Diſtinct Thing in kind, from what was <hi>Worthy,</hi> as he calls it, that is, <hi>Godly</hi> among either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathen:</hi> but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did by his Viſible Appearance benefit the World with a more glorious Manifeſtation of the ſame Divine Power, Purity, Truth, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, then former Ages were either capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, or attended with. To exclude then all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Times from any ſhare in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is both Weak, and Cruel; ſince it plainly ſhuts them out of all hopes of Eternal Salvation: for if no Name be given but the Name of Chriſt, under the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by which Men can be ſaved; then, <hi>either Chriſt was alwayes in ſome meaſure or other a Saviour, and ſuch as were ſaved, in ſome degree or other, Chriſtians; or there was one Saviour before Chriſt's outward coming, and another ſince;</hi> or laſtly, <hi>all that were antecedent to that Appearance, were damn'd.</hi>

§. 6. I appeal then to the Conſciences and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of all impartial People, if our Belief be not the moſt Juſt, Merciful and True; that however it pleaſed God to ſend his Son a Light into the World at that time more eminently then before, yet that he was ſo far Spiritually manifeſted in all Ages, <hi>as the Word of God nigh in the Heart, and great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Conſciences of Men,</hi> as who believed and obey'd, obtain'd Remiſſion of Sins and Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This is clear; for if no man could ever ſee, or know the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him, then becauſe many of the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients both ſpiritually ſaw and knew God (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could never be ſaved) it follows, <hi>that Chriſt did in all Ages reveal God,</hi> who being Light, and that it is Light alone which can Reveal or Manifeſt; it was as a Light within, that he communicated unto the Soul of Man, which is within Man, the Knowledge of the Pure God: <hi>Whatever may be known of God is manifeſt within Man, for God hath ſhewed it unto him:</hi> ſo that the Contradiction and Error of the Man's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is evident.</p>
               <p>§. 7. But yet a little further: He plainly <hi>Heathenizes</hi> that notable <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Paſſage of the refuſing it all Priviledge within the bounds of <note place="margin">Apoſtle,</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> viz. <hi>Whatſoever things are True, Honeſt, Juſt, Pure, Lovely, of Good Report;</hi>

and therefore ends with a <hi>Finally, my Brethren)</hi> tell me, O <hi>ſober Reader,</hi> what a kind of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> there would be in the World? O Monſtruous Impiety! Is this Man fit to write of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> that places it beneath the loweſt ſtep of Purity; making manifeſt Difference betwixt being <hi>a Child of God, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?</hi> True, the outward Hiſtory of Chriſt's exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love to Man-kind, deſerves all humble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Credit as a Godly Tradition, and it ſhould forever bind Men to receive and fear and worſhip him: yet I boldly affirm, that though the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was clearer; <hi>yet Salvation was Salvation, and a Child of God, a Child of God in all Ages.</hi> For what is it but to ſay, <hi>that Pure Religion and Undefiled, which is to keep our ſelves unſpotted from the World, belongs not ſtricktly to the Chriſtian, but Jewiſh or Pagan Religion; and that</hi> James <hi>was but a moral Man in the Matter, and not writing on a Chriſtian Subject.</hi> What an empty Trunk, <hi>a Vox, &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> a ſounding Braſs and Tinckling Cymbal would this Man make of true <hi>Chriſtianity!</hi> Yet thus far we may force him to ſpeak Truth, though in double Contradiction to himſelf, that ſince <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> takes in all that was worthy in all Ages (not as Alien then, but related to her ſelf) <hi>ſomething of the Nature of true Chriſtianity was in the World before that more Viſible and Glorious Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; unleſs Chriſtianity be ſuppoſed to take into it ſelf what is not of its own Nature:</hi> thus was Chriſt the <hi>Rock</hi> the Ancients built on, before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, whoſe Day he had a Sight and Sence of, and from it exulted greatly.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> then is not an <hi>Hiſtorical Belief of the exteriour Acts,</hi> the true Chriſt did in that bodily
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47076:12"/>
Appearance, <hi>which is but Hiſtorical Chriſtianity,</hi> as our Adverſary weakly argues; for that was the leaſt part of it, ſince <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is that which <note place="margin">pag. 4.</note> brings to God, which thouſands that believe the other will never arrive at: but a <hi>firm belief in him that ſo Appeared, Lived, Died, Roſe and Aſcended, both as teſtified of in the Scriptures of Truth, and more eſpecially as he breaks in upon the Soul by his Divine Diſcoveries, as the true Light inlightning every Man,</hi> this I call <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and <hi>that Man is a Child of Light, who obeys that Light; a true Chriſtian, who is Chriſt-like; a Child of God, and Heir of the Promiſe, who is inwardly renewed and begot anew of the Incorruptible Seed, and Word of God:</hi> For thoſe who were Chriſtians of old, were ſuch as came to know Chriſt, <hi>no more after the Fleſh, but as the ſecond</hi> Adam, <hi>the Lord from Heaven, the Quickning Spirit,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the Life;</hi> really witneſſing him to be that in themſelves, wherefore they <hi>Believed,</hi> and upon Repentance, received Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins and Eternal Salvation. And I do affirm, that Chriſtianity ſtands in the Manifeſtation of a Meaſure of that Righteous <hi>Power, Wiſdom, Truth and Life</hi> in the Soul, which appear'd ſo largely and gloriouſly in that Body at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to work Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then give Remiſſion, ſo Renew, Redeem, and finally Save: and who came to be made ſenſible of that Heavenly Treaſure in their mortal Bodies, and to improve it as good Stewards, were Poſſeſſors of true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and therefore <hi>Right Chriſtians.</hi> The Diſtinction betwixt Moral and Chriſtian, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king holy Life <hi>Legal,</hi> and Faith in the Hiſtory of Chriſt's outward <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> Manifeſtation, <hi>has been a deadly Poyſon theſe latter Ages have been infected with,</hi> to the Deſtruction of Godly Living, and <hi>Apoſtatizing</hi>

of thoſe Churches, in whom there might once have been begotten, ſome <hi>Earneſt, Living Thriſt</hi> after the Inward Life of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>§. 9. By this, I think it may be pretty well known, what we mean by <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and a <hi>True Chriſtian:</hi> How far this will agree with his Definition of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm,</hi> and a <hi>Quaker,</hi> I will proceed to examine.</p>
               <p>Quakeriſm <hi>is a heap of Tenets, with the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 6. Sect. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>uſurped Names of true Chriſtian Principles, which are yet really no ſuch thing, but ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Foundation and Fabrick of true Chriſtianity; And I call him a</hi> Quaker <hi>that profeſſes the Light within every Man to be the Lord, and Saviour, and very God: So that then I ſay</hi> Quakeriſm <hi>is no Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. Indeed, if <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> reſpecting us, were this, I would ſay ſo too: but becauſe it is juſtly a Stranger to any ſuch Imputation, I rightly faſten that of Ignorance or great Malice upon our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</hi> I have already expreſt our Judgment of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which I ſuppoſe to be the <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> ſtruck at, what ever may be pretended, at leaſt, what is our <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtianity rather:</hi> and we leave our Belief with that God who made it ſo, to juſtifie it, and us, who thus ſted faſtly hold, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet patiently ſuffer for it, by his own Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in the Conſciences of Men. But this I will add, That ſince he has rendred us to be one thing in Shew, and another in Reality, our Appeal is to the God that made Heaven and Earth, to right us in the Minds of all.</p>
               <p>§. 11. We dare not Believe or Practiſe what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47076:13"/>
comes not in by True Conviction (things meerly Hiſtorical excepted, and yet there is a Conviction for them to) The <hi>Devils</hi> who knew Chriſt and trembled, were more ſenſible then thoſe who know him only by Hear-ſay, and make a Mock of that Trembling, which ſeizeth the Contrite Souls of Men for Sin. We declare in the Preſence of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, that it was the Striving of the holy Spirit in us, that firſt moved us to ſolid Repentance, and as we came to be judged byit, and reconciled unto God in our Minds, ſo have we appear'd before all Men; <hi>therefore it is utterly Falſe, that We cover our Tenets with the Names of Chriſtian Principles,</hi> ſince theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which are ours, are truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Scriptural</hi> (1.) <hi>God created Man Innocent, in his own Image created he him.</hi> (2.) <hi>That Man or all Mankind has faln ſhort of the Glory of God through Diſobedience.</hi> (3.) <hi>That in the Seed promiſed Redemption can only be had.</hi> (4.) <hi>That this Seed is He that in time was call'd</hi> Chriſt. (5.) <hi>That by this Holy Seed, both before and ſince that Coming, the Serpent's Head hath been parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly bruiſed in all who have been redeemed or ſaved, as the Holy Men and Women of Old, and ſuch in every Age as have known a Sanctification.</hi> (6.) <hi>That this Seed appeared in the Fulneſs and Stature of a Man in that Outward Body prepared of God above 1600. Years ſince, and in it encounter'd, and conquer'd Satan, and trod him under his Feet.</hi> (7.) <hi>That he bore the Sin of the World.</hi> (8.) <hi>That he laid down his Life a Ranſom for all.</hi> (9.) <hi>That ſuch as Believ'd and Follow'd him as he then appear'd, receiv'd Remiſſion of Sins, and Eternal Life.</hi> (10.) <hi>That what was then outwardly done, did ſtill refer and had relation to an Inward Work in the Souls of Men: the Holy Life put forth it ſelf to work Inward Conviction, and drive
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47076:13"/>
the Mind into a Meaſure of the ſame in it ſelf; for the whole End of it was, to draw the Minds of Men more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to a Manifeſtation of that ſame Life, Vertue, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs in each Particular, which appeared in that Body in General, and qualified it to that great Work, and ſuſtain'd it under all its Sufferings, and put that great Value upon them, which really was in them;</hi> Wherefore, <hi>to the Divine Power firſt, and to the Holy Manhood next, do we aſcribe that Great and Wonderful Benefit that thereby came unto the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 12. But next, we muſt deny his <hi>Quaker</hi> as well as his <hi>Quakeriſm:</hi> indeed, they go together; who miſſeth one, it is unlikely he ſhould hit the other. We never ſaid, <hi>that the Light in every Man was the only Lord, and Saviour, and very God.</hi> Let him but ſhow us any paſſage of any one acknowledg'd to be a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and he will ſay ſomething: But me-thinks, he that has quoted ſo many paſſages out of our Friends Books, to ſo little purpoſe, ſhould not have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſtance in ſome one of us, that hath ſo expreſt our ſelves; it ſhows, that either he thinks to be believ'd Hand over Head, or really there is no ſuch Doctrine by us aſſerted, and conſequently he knew no ſuch place to cite. But for the Upright-hearted in all Forms, who are deſirous of the Subſtance, that will give Life to the Soul; and who ſtand only at a diſtance from us, on the account of the many <hi>frightful Characters</hi> their <hi>Teachers</hi> give of us, I ſhall briefly open our Faith in this Matter.</p>
               <p>§. 13. <hi>Firſt,</hi> We aſſert, <hi>that all Men are enlightned,</hi> (let it be <hi>Lighted</hi> in their Souls or Underſtandings, if our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> will) This is prov'd from <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. alſo,

                  <hi>whatever may be known of God is manifeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for God has ſhewn it unto them.</hi> Again, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi>

               <p>§. 14. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Light is Divine, <hi>becauſe it is the very Life of the Word, which is God;</hi> not an Effect of its Power, as a Created Light, which ſome vainly fancy; but in <hi>Him,</hi> or <hi>It,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> was <hi>Life,</hi> and that <hi>Life</hi> (Numerical) was the <hi>Light</hi> of Men: what is <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Word,</hi> is <hi>Light</hi> in Men, and <hi>who follow that Light as A Reprover of the Deeds of Darkneſs, ſhall be made Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light,</hi> and have the <hi>Light of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 15. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though we ſay that <hi>all are enlightned by it,</hi> or receive Light from it, yet far be it from us to aſſert, every ſuch Illumination is the only <hi>Lord, and Saviour, and very God.</hi> By no means, but rather thus, <hi>that the only Lord, and Saviour, and very God is the great Sun and Light of Righteouſneſs to the Inviſible World of Souls and Spirits</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) who manifeſts unto every particular that which concerns the State of every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; but not that every ſuch Inlightning ſhould be the Intire <hi>Lord, Saviour, God:</hi> ſo that this <hi>Prieſt</hi> is already found deficient in his Work: he ſhould better have underſtood us before he had given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of us, and diſcovered his Oppoſition to us. What <hi>Superſtructure</hi> can we expect from ſo infirm a Foundation; how ſhall <hi>J. Faldo</hi> prove <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> no <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who is defective in his Definition of both? Certainly the <hi>Quaker</hi> may be the beſt of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> for ought he has groundedly oppoſed to him:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47076:14"/>
I am ſure he would have thought ſuch a Miſtake in us moſt hainous; to ſay nothing of that Advantage he would have taken to ſhow his little Wit, and great Prejudice in aggravating our Ignorance to the World.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that this is nothing injurious to the <hi>Quakers</hi> at all, but highly on their ſide: for had they preacht a Chriſt now coming in the Fleſh, <hi>they had deny'd his true and only great Viſible Appearance, at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which all true Quakers own.</hi> Since then they believe that Appearance, and therefore need not preach what is not to be again; and that the whole <hi>Chriſtian-</hi>World beſides, have ſo long and lazyly depended on it, without their Thirſting after his Inward Holy Appearance in the Conſcience, to Bind the Strong Man, Spoyl his Goods, and Caſt him out; in ſhort, to Diſcover Sin, Wound for it, and make an End of it by the Brightneſs of his Spiritual Coming into the Soul, of all ſuch as wait for him, and will receive him (in which Senſe he was reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch, and became in the Saints of old the Hope of their Glory) I ſay, ſince he has <note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> been ſo much talkt of, and depended on, as to his then Viſible Manifeſtation of himſelf, and ſo little, if at all deſired after, as to his Spiritual and Inviſible Coming into the Hearts of Men, to finiſh Tranſgreſſion, and bring in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs: Therefore God raiſed us up, and we are now gone forth into the World to declare, <hi>That he is Spiritually Manifeſted; as then fully in that Body, ſo now meaſurably in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all People, a Divine Light, Reproving every Unfruitful Work of Darkneſs:</hi> So that here is the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47076:15"/>
Miſchief, the Malice and Ignorance of our Enemies do us in this World, that becauſe we Speak ſo much of, and Preach up, and Write for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Inward</hi> and Spiritual Appearance as a <hi>Light</hi> to Mankind; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> they conclude with a mighty Confidence <hi>that we Deny his Outward Coming, Life, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, and the Benefits thereof.</hi> O Darkneſs it ſelf! We have our Witneſs with the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that we own <hi>Him</hi> to be the <hi>Saviour General</hi> of the whole World, as to <hi>that Appearance, and that he obtained precious Gifts for Men;</hi> but we ſay (and our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> have not wherewith rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to unſay it) that <hi>firſt the Divine Light, Life, or Power that ſhined through that Bleſſed Manhood, was Excellently the Saviour, and the Manhood but Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally:</hi> Thus the Scripture, <hi>There is no Saviour beſides me, ſaith God; a Body haſt thou prepared me: He</hi> then was greater then <hi>his Body,</hi> for it is call'd a <hi>Vail,</hi> and very properly, <hi>for it vail'd much of that Divine Life, which when it was withdrawn</hi> (as he himſelf ſaid, it was expedient) <hi>the Saints did witneſs inwardly Reveal'd, Chriſt in them, their Hope of Glory.</hi> And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> No Man or Woman in the World is ſavingly benefitted by his then Appearing as a Saviour, and obtaining precious Gifts for Men, but as every ſuch Individual Perſon comes to experience his Internal Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to <hi>Convince, Condemn, Wound, Heal, Break, Bind up, Slay, make Alive in the Newneſs of the Spirit:</hi> This is the State of Right Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thus is he particularly a Saviour, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch one is greatly benefitted by him, as he was in that former Appearance the general Saviour of Mankind.

               </p>
               <p>The Conſequence of this Aſſertion is thus much, <hi>That Chriſt taught not Chriſtianity; That his Diſciples who believed in him, were but better kind of Carnal</hi> Jews; <hi>That Chriſt's Life, Doctrine and Miracles were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd under a State of</hi> Chriſtianity; <hi>That he had not all Power before his Reſurrection,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Scripture;</hi> In ſhort, <hi>That</hi> Chriſt <hi>and</hi> Chriſtianity <hi>did not go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and if you will, <hi>that Chriſt was not Chriſt, but a good extraordinary</hi> Jew, <hi>before his Reſurrection;</hi> for I am ſure, his Notion of the Beginning of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> warrants the Conſequence.

               <p>§. 10. Well, But when came this <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> into the world? he tells us, about the year 1651. quoting, <hi>E. B's Epiſtle</hi> before <note place="margin">Pag. 15. 16, 17.</note>

If So? Conſequently the <hi>Reſurrection of Truth</hi> is no more a New Diſpenſation, or not that of Chriſtianity, <hi>then a Man that is exiled his Country, is not eſſentially the ſame Man, when he returns, that he was before.</hi> And ſo far is my Argument for thoſe <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> that though I take them to be ſhort of the True Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Faith and Righteouſneſs; yet I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg them to have a Reformation unknown in that thick <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> which has couer'd the World, and Ecclipſt the bleſſed Light of the Glorious Goſpel that ſhin'd in the firſt Ages after Chriſt: But ſince
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47076:20"/>
we are of another <hi>Religion</hi> by his Account, then the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe we cannot ſay that we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſucceſſively from the Apoſtles Time, I will argue, that the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> are <hi>not Chriſtians,</hi> nor is what they profeſs, to be eſteem'd <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe they cannot prove a Regular Succeſſion from the Apoſtles Times, their Date alſo being of later years. What will they ſay then? The <hi>Church</hi> was fled into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: <hi>Truth</hi> exil'd; <hi>God</hi> as a ſtranger in the Earth; yet <hi>Truth</hi> ſtill the ſame in it ſelf. Very well, ſo ſay we: God was pleas'd to Renew the Right Chriſtian Diſpenſation to us, and by us according to <hi>John's</hi> Viſion, that the Everlaſting Goſpel was preacht again, intimating, <hi>that their had been a Time wherein it was not preacht.</hi> If this be not a New Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe anew or again preacht; neither is that which <hi>J. Faldo</hi> calls <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> a New Diſpenſation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>Preaching anew the Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> to the Sons of Men; which is God's Power inwardly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted for the Conviction, Converſion, Redemption, and Salvation of the Souls of ſuch as believe in it.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And though he particularly ſeems to Triumph over <hi>Iſaac Pennington's</hi> Diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes, Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and THIS of our Day, as if they had been three ſeveral Diſpenſations, and conſequently, if Chriſt's was not that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe it ſwallow'd it up; neither this the Diſpenſation of Chriſt, which <hi>J. Pennington</hi> ſaith, it ſwallows up: yet to me it ſeems a pittiful Catch; and ſhows, he knows not how to take things with that Candor they are writ. <hi>J. P.</hi> means not a Diſtinct Adminiſtration in Kind,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47076:20"/>
but Diſpenſation of one and the ſame Light, Life, and Power by Nature, at ſeveral Times, and ſundry Manners to the World: <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>before</hi> the Law, <hi>under</hi> the Law, <hi>with</hi> the Prophets, but never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed as <hi>in</hi> that Holy Manhood; will it therefore follow, he was not Antecedent to that Appearance, or He, that appeared then more gloriouſly, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhown himſelf before? Or becauſe of a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Manifeſtation, therefore <hi>not</hi> the ſame HE (through all thoſe ſeveral Manifeſtations) in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Certainly, this Man is very Unjuſt to <hi>J. P.</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when the Words above quoted, that ſpeak of a Diſpenſation he experienced a little before God broke forth by us called <hi>Quakers,</hi> could have infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, that he meant the Divers Breakings forth of God's Light and Truth, in order to the full Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Recovery of Loſt Primitive <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> So that this preſent Appearance ſwallowing up all going before it (had ſo term'd it, as he doth not, and therefore wrong'd) is no more then <hi>God's Retriving to us the Ancient Goſpel, with additional Bleſſings and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> giving us the ſame <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> they had, and what elſe he pleaſed by way of Improvement; which alters not the Nature, no more then a Child in Chriſt is not that Numerical Creature, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtinct Being, when a Man. And if this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Things will not ſatisfie him, he may chuſe: I have thus far cleared the Truth, and thoſe who ſincerely profeſs it, and therein my own Conſcience both to God, and the World.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Charge. That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are not the Word of God, Reaſons for it. The Scriptures by him urg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, clear'd, and prov'd to be for us They are the Words of the Word, a Declaration of the great Law, Word, or Commandment, but not that Law, Word, or Commandment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THis Chapter will concern the Scriptures more directly, in which we hope to prove, that not We, but our <hi>Adverſary</hi> is miſtaken with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to what he chargeth upon us.</p>
               <p>§. 2. He intitles his Chapter thus, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>Deny the Scriptures.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 18, 19, 20.</note> I was almoſt aſtoniſht at it, becauſe he pretended to prove all out of our own Books, and none ſuch had ever yet come to my hand, But upon my ſober Peruſal of the Matter, I found this to be the Upſhot, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>Deny them to be the Word of God;</hi> therefore they deny them altogether: Whence I take good Heart to ſhow his Ignorance, or great Diſhoneſty.</p>
               <p>§. 3. I will allow to him, without going any farther, that the People called <hi>Quakers, do deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God,</hi> and therefore ſhall take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what he quotes out of <hi>J. N. F. Howgil, J. Parnel,</hi> and <hi>W. Smith.</hi> But that we do conſequently Deny the Scriptures, we ſhall oppoſe, we hope, to the Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47076:21"/>
§. 4. I do declare to the whole World, that <hi>We believe the</hi> Scriptures <hi>to contain a Declaration of the Mind and Will of God,</hi> in and to thoſe Ages, in which they were written, being given forth by the Holy Ghoſt, moving in the Hearts of holy Men of God; That they ought alſo to be Believed, Read, and Fulfill'd in our Day, being Uſeful for Reproof and Inſtruction, that the Man of God may be perfect; And that they have been, and are Inſtrumental to great Good upon the Spirits of People, by the ſecret Power of God, which often ſtrikes, and preſſeth home to the very Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the weighty Truths declar'd therein; yet <hi>We do Deny them to be the Word of God, aſcribing that alone to</hi> Chriſt <hi>himſelf, and that not without Scripture and Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is granted on all hands, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is expreſly called in Scripture <hi>the Word of God,</hi> but no where, that the Scriptures are ſo ſtyled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though I ſhould allow it to be a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Expreſſion, and therefore ſays our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, <hi>Improper;</hi> yet becauſe a Word among Men, conveyes the Mind of one unto another, and that Chriſt is the great <hi>Word</hi> of God, that in all Ages hath convey'd, or ſpoken the Mind of God unto Mankind (and ſo the Author of all good Words) he only may by way of Right and <hi>Excellency</hi> be ſo ſtyl'd of Us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall eaſily grant to him, that one Word may ſtand repreſentative of many; and that the Ten Words were not Ten Numerical Words, becauſe each Word contained many: yet, this I will ſay, that <hi>Word</hi> in Scripture is taken for <hi>Commandment,</hi> and they have an equivalent Signification, as in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> may be ſeen. And ſince that was the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47076:22"/>
Import of the Ten Words, <hi>to wit</hi> Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, each Word has its own Commandment; Therefore it is no more againſt us, to allow thoſe Ten Words, to be more then Ten Words, then Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, to have more then Ten Words.</p>
               <p>And whatever our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> may ſay, or think of us, We therefore Decline to call the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Word of God, becauſe <hi>we believe It to be a Title only due to that Living, Quickning Word, by which God vouchſafes to diſcloſe his Mind and Will unto Man-kind,</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Way to the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. But ſayes our <hi>Adverſary</hi> to this <hi>Argument,</hi> The Word was God, therefore the Scriptures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Word, becauſe they are not God; <hi>Let me tell you, that the Scripture</hi>

               <p>§. 8. But here <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſteps in, and ſeems to offer an Expedient in this Streight; Says he, <hi>Though you ſay they are not the</hi> Word of God <hi>eminently, and I</hi>

               <p>Truly, this ſeems pretty modeſt, though here we muſt part too, unleſs he will come a little near<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er; For neither can the <hi>Word of God</hi> properly be ſaid to be written: The Words by which the Mind or Will of the Word is expreſt, may be recorded,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47076:24"/>
and, as ſuch, a True Declaration; but it is as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Word of God to be written, as it would be for a <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Senate</hi> to be <hi>written,</hi> or contained in Letters, though their Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may be largely declared by a Writing; becauſe it would be to ſay, that the <hi>Word of God could grow Old, Decay, be Loſt, miſ-Rendred, Corrupted, Tranſcribed, Reprinted, Corrected, and be Subjected to Fire, Water, Vermin,</hi> &amp;c. which were impoſſible. So would it be an abſolute Derogation from the Dignity peculiarly Due to the Living Word of God, to give that which is its proper Title to any thing beneath its Living, Powerful, Quickning Self.

                  <hi>againſt the Written Word of God,</hi> but I don't ſee it for my ſhare. The great Things of the Law, Word, or Commandment, which are required may be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but that doth not follow, that the Eternal Law, Word or Commandment Requiring, is a written Law, Word or Commandment, but the Contrary; And for <hi>Moſes Writings,</hi> of which Chriſt ſpoke, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, they were not call'd the Word of God, but <hi>the Word of God himſelf call'd them Writings.</hi>

                  <hi>they have been generally Known by, Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from, and Lifted up above all other Writings, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47076:24"/>
that Appellation, on which is grounded their Authority, and which puts an Awe upon the Conſciences of Men.</hi> How Weak and Vain this is, I could freely leave to the <hi>Reader,</hi> without any further Conſideration; But that it might not be thought by any therefore Unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, I will ſay, <hi>That to call them the Words of God, and declared Mind and Will of God to Mankind, is no ſuch Diminutive Title,</hi> but altogether Worthy of them.</p>
               <p>§. 10. If we do Deny to them what has been wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attributed, that no ways Leſſens their Authority, but Corrects the Miſtake of thoſe who thought of them beyond what they really are; It is a poor Begging of the Queſtion, to ſay, We Deny them, that which many have Aſcrib'd to them. Their Authority is grounded upon the Living Word of God, and who comes to that, Honours the Scripture aright; and who Err from the Holy Conduct of it, their Verbal Praiſes of the Scripture, are but like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Painting the Prophets Sepulchres, whilſt they were Perſecutors of One greater then the Prophets: And who knows not, how much the Shell hath had aſcrib'd unto it the Honour, only due to its Subſtance, by thoſe <hi>Watchmen</hi> of the Night, whoſe Dark Minds could ſee no farther?</p>
               <p>§. 11. And for the <hi>Awe</hi> they have upon Men, this is my Judgment, and I am not aſham'd of it, that Attributing ſo much to the Letter of the Scriptures, and Declining that Regard Men ought to have had unto the Holy Living <hi>Word of God,</hi> that alone creates all things New, and was the Author of, and Rule to thoſe ſound Words themſelves, <hi>hath Rob'd

the Living Word of God of its True and Rightfull Honour, and rendred Mens Hearts more Formal, and leſs Aweful then they would otherwiſe have been;</hi> So that the only Way for People to come to a True Sight of, Sincere Reſpect for, and Grounded Belief in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is, <hi>to be turned to the Voice of the Living, Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word of God, from whom they came, which is nigh unto every one, to Direct, and Order, and Diſcipline to, and in that Way of Holineſs,</hi> they teſtifie of, and <hi>which Leads to Eternal Happineſs.</hi>

§. 2.

               <p>Now what to ſay here in their Defence, when he lays nothing to their Charge, but what hath been generally expreſt, I know not; Certain it is, that <hi>No Man knows the Father but the Son, and Him to whom the Son</hi> REVEALS <hi>him. The Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth Underſtanding; and, No Man can know the Things of God but by the Spirit of God.</hi> Well may we conclude then, that <hi>J.

               <p>What Offence, or Undervalue, I would fain know, can it be to the Scriptures, that Men ſhould know God that only Way, by which they teſtifie, God can be known of Men? Or, Why ſhould he be Angry at his Author, for Confeſſing to have known God that very Way, by which the Scriptures declare him only to be known?

               <p>§. 6. For <hi>Inſpiration</hi> the Scriptures are not more expreſs in any one thing.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47076:27"/>
Chriſtian?</hi> Can they beat down <hi>Self-Will?</hi> They may talk of it, or exalt the <hi>Living Truth,</hi> that came not from it. This is the Scope of <hi>J.

The <hi>Scriptures</hi> are a Sealed Book to all, but thoſe who know them by the ſame Hand, which Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally gave them. So that however <hi>Common</hi> they may be in the World, they are <hi>Strangers</hi> to them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them not: And though <hi>Old,</hi> reſpecting the Time, when they were revealed to the Saints, yet <hi>New</hi> to every Age; ſo that we aſſert not a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of New Things, but renewed Revelation of thoſe Things God made former Ages Witneſſes of: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Men are no more benefited by them; And to be benefited, they muſt be made ours by the Spirit, which made them the Holy Ancients.</p>
               <p>§. 7. In ſhort, No Man can underſtand Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Things, but the Spiritually Diſcerning; None can ſo be without the Inſpiration of the Almighty, or Spirit of God. This is Scripture.

And, for <hi>Equaling our Writings</hi> with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> becauſe we aſſert <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and that what we have received, and do declare of the Things of God, is from the Revelation of his Spirit in our Hearts, it is a Fooliſh Inference; <hi>Truth</hi> was and is <hi>Truth</hi> all the World over, and there was and is but <hi>One Way</hi> to come to it in all Ages, I mean <hi>Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The Scriptures are True, and our <hi>Writings</hi> are True; but will it therefore follow, that we bring them upon a Vie? Is this your Diſputant? But to determine this Caſe, He ſhould firſt have prov'd if he could, what <hi>Power</hi> God gave to the Ancients, and what to Us. How much of his <hi>Spirit</hi> to thoſe Ages, and what to This; or elſe he loſeth himſelf. If he can Experimentally tell, what were their Diſcoveries and Experiences, and what are Ours, he would be a Proper Judge: But to think to run us down by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting them, or to leſſen what we are, by Increaſing their Praiſe, is an old <hi>Artifice</hi> of the Devil; and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men will be more True to Themſelves, and Juſt to the Matter, then ſo to cenſure us. <hi>Cannot one Man be another Man's Brother, and not the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> Doth it follow, that becauſe God has made what we know our own, by his Holy Inſpirations and Operations, that therefore we put our ſelves <hi>upon the Compariſon with the Ancients?</hi> If true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> fill up, or add to Chriſt's Sufferings, yet behind, why ſhould their <hi>Writings be ſhuffled out of all Relation to the Scriptures?</hi> There may be a Relation, <hi>where

there is not an Equality, much leſs a Preference,</hi> and that we do aſſert againſt all Oppoſers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Scriptures both are, and ever were Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; for, the Light within (as they pretend) was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fitted to Inſpire every Man and Woman in the ſame Manner, and to all Intents and Purpoſes, as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and written.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which, how juſt and true it is, we do reſerve the Examination of it to God's Witneſs in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the <hi>Reader.</hi> Only, this much I will ſay;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47076:31"/>
that though all Ability was, and is in <hi>Him,</hi> whom we declare to be the Light of all Mankind, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the whole Mind of God, yet, in as much as very few in all Ages were ſo reſigned up to the Holy Conduct of it, as they ought to have been, the Lord hath put it into the Hearts of Many, to ſtir up the Negligent and Sloathful, by a Reminding them with that Counſel, in outward Writings or other Verbal Teſtimonies, which they had long ſlighted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that it might Inſtrumentally work upon them unfeigned Repentance and Converſion to God. Therefore went God's Meſſengers forth, Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept; here a little, and there a little; But this I affirm, and that in the Name of the Lord, againſt the uttermoſt Strength of this Buſie <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that, had thoſe <hi>Prodigal<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> in all Ages lived up to that Meaſure of Divine Light (the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent God gave to every Individual) there had not been any ſuch need for thoſe Meſſages: Wherefore the Occaſion of them was not for want of any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Gift from God, but becauſe of their own Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Nay, they were the <hi>Teſtimonies of the very Light of Chriſt</hi> (in the Prophets and Apoſtles, who were Heirs and Children of Light) which they gave forth at divers Times in their ſeveral Ages, as God pleaſed to move upon their Spirits with reſpect to Mankind; ſo that ſtill it was the Light within, which ſo reprov'd and exhorted. But, ſuppoſe that the World had not been ſo Rebellious, neither will it follow, but that a ſlow Improvement of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gift, might have occaſioned many Divine Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; yea, the Exerciſes of Mens Spirits, as <hi>Davids</hi> for Inſtance, in reference to the Spiritual Travel, might for the Benefit of others have been written.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47076:31"/>
Let us ſuppoſe the higheſt State of Deliverance, and Praiſe, Men are capable of arriving at in this World; yet Epiſtles of divine Love, Experience, heavenly Praiſes, &amp;c. might have been tranſmitted from Church to Church, as of the Flock and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God. Therefore I utterly deny, that the Perfection of the Light's Teachings makes the Scriptures ſuperfluous, much leſs the general beſt Attainments that have been, and now are in the World.</p>
               <p>§. 12. But that any Man, ſo conceited of his Abilities, as <hi>J.

The Scripture don't ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the Inſufficiency of the Light, ſince ſo, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument would riſe againſt its Principal; but the Inſufficiency of the Creature, in which condition Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept may, by the Light within good Men, be given forth <hi>to invite and encourage Man to yield Obedience to the Conviction of the Light within every ſuch Rebellious Perſon;</hi> in which the Love of God is marvelouſly expreſſed, who by his holy Light within, and its Teſtimonies without, endeavours the Conviction and Reformation of the Children of Men.</p>
               <p>§. 13. But hear him in his ſecond and laſt Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; <hi>upon the ſame Ground, the Tenets and Aſſertions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47076:32"/>
of all the</hi> Heathens <hi>are to be received as of equal Authority with the Scriptures; for they reſulted from their Light Within, improved much more orderly and to Purpoſe then the</hi> Quakers <hi>do theirs. Yea, the bitter Scoffs of</hi> Lucian, <hi>and</hi> Julian <hi>the Apoſtate muſt be admitted into the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for if it be admitted, they did not Vilifie and Scorn and Deride the Scripture and</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>according to the Dictates of their Conſciences; it cannot be denyed, that they therein acted from the Power within, which whether it were the Power of Darkneſs or not, the</hi> Quakers <hi>having no Rule to judge it by, but their own Sentiments, it is left by them undetermined; And I know not hardly any Worſe they ſaid of</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>the</hi> Scripture, <hi>and</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, <hi>then the</hi> Quakers <hi>have done under other Names.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> Light was one in Nature with that, which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>inlightneth all Men</hi> (a Text, whoſe Plainneſs &amp; Expreſſneſs yields that Advantage to us, againſt the utmoſt Force of all our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> which they are Angry at, but can never Invalid) I ſay, one in Nature with that Divine Being; and as ſuch, tranſcending all Writings whatever: yet that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had that Light in a more excellent Degree, then that in which the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> enjoyed it, whence came thoſe excellent Writings, I utterly deny, and that in the Name of all true <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> I ſay again, that, though the leaſt meaſure of Pure <hi>Light it ſelf,</hi> is to be preferred before all the Writings in the World, <hi>as meer Writings;</hi> yet that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47076:32"/>
it may not be comparable to that Degree and further Diſcovery of Light, which was witneſſed by thoſe who gave forth thoſe Writings, I gr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t: ſo that to bring the Sayings and the Aſſertions of the <hi>Heathens</hi> upon an Equality with the Writings of the holy <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> we dare not aſſent to; but vehemently oppoſe any ſuch Inference made to be the Product of our Belief. For, though as I ſaid before, any meaſure of <hi>Light it ſelf</hi> is beyond the moſt excellent <hi>meer Writings</hi> of a far greater; yet the Writings or Sayings given forth by that leſſer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, are not to be brought into Compariſon with thoſe of a greater Diſcovery, <hi>no more then the Degrees of Diſcovery, or Manifeſtation of the Light it ſelf.</hi> This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed; who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he rightly knew that Adminiſtration to ſupercede, and tranſcend what want before, ſtuck not to remind the <hi>Heathens</hi> of their own <hi>Authors,</hi> as <hi>Aratus, Menander,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by an apt Application of them to this Purpoſe, in Defence of his Doctrine.</hi> And if Thoſe who became a Law unto themſelves, Doing the things contained in the Law, were to be preferred before the Circumciſion, who kept not the Law, and that, who lived without Law outward—yet according to Law inward, ſhould be judged by Law inward, which was ſubſtantially the ſame (as teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Apoſtle) with what was required by the Law outward; <hi>Then their Law within Subſtantially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, did not fall ſhort of that Law without, nor they who kept it of the Circumciſion themſelves;</hi> which moſt clearly overturns that Ignorant or Malicious Cavil, to wit, <hi>that the</hi> Quakers <hi>have no Mean by which to judge of the Ground of Wrong and Right Actions;</hi> For if the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be that only Judge, then there could have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47076:33"/>
been no Knowledg of right or wrong Actions, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or Powers, before they were given forth: which becauſe the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> had an evident Sight and true Sence of, by that Internal Law of Light in the Heart and Conſcience, without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it follows, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> owning the ſame Light, and that, in a more eminent Diſcovery, can not be guilty of ſuch an Ignorance.</p>
               <p>§. 14. But a litle further to inſpect his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If the having no Outward Rule was to be without all Rule, whereby to Try a Right from a Wrong Power; I would gladly know, how the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> themſelves were aſſured of the Truth of their Motions, being without any outward Touch-Stone; and by what means the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> knew, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Power which acted them to reject and decry the whole Service of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which God had ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly Inſtituted (Circumciſion for Inſtance, that was given for a Sign FOREVER) was the right Spirit or Power? I ask, <hi>Was it the Scripture without, or the Son of God, otherwiſe called the Light or Word of God revealed in them?</hi> But I will yet proceed; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Man who is call'd an <hi>Independent,</hi> and owns the Scripture to be that which <hi>J.

Faldo</hi> aſſure himſelf or others, of the Sincerity or Impoſture of ſuch a Perſon? his Rationals being otherwiſe Sound; his Life Sober, and his Pretences no way anti-Scriptural? <hi>O Weak Man!</hi> Is thy Religion without a ſecret <hi>Light, Life, Power, Vertue, Sight or Reliſh</hi> of the Root and Ground
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47076:33"/>
of things; or rather doeſt thou conclude, that all Mankind, however Chriſtian, are left <hi>Deſtitute of any Inward Power to Try or Diſcern Spirits,</hi> becauſe it is thine own State of Darkneſs? I affirm to thee and all the World, that in this Caſe, no outward Mean whatſoever decides the Matter, or clears the Doubt; only the inviſible Light, Power or Spirit of God: Yea, and that in far leſs Caſes too. In which ſenſe chiefly, it is the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, ſo call'd, and juſtly preferr'd before all other.</p>
               <p>And this I leave with him; that nothing can judge of the Root and Ground of Evil, but the Root and Ground of Good. The Works of Evil, the Scriptures tel us, are abominable; But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, <hi>How do I know, what they declare to be Evil, is ſo?</hi> what works the Conviction in me? and where an Evil Spirit brings it ſelf not forth into thoſe Works, what ſhall diſcern him, except it be the Good Spirit? It is the Power of God within, that cruſheth the Power of the Devil within. The Scriptures without, Reprove his Works without; But ſince the things contained in the Scriptures were ſuch in themſelves, and true, and experienc'd before they were written: will it not follow, that the inward Power was both a ſufficient Judge, and their Author too; and conſequently Greater.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. HIs Fifth Chapter deſigns to Prove, <hi>That we Deny the Scriptures to be a Rule of Faith, and Judge of Controverſies;</hi> And that he may ſufficiently prejudice his <hi>Reader</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">p. 65, 66.</note> us, and our moſt Holy Faith, He not only tells him, that to deny them to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> is a good Reaſon, why he ſhould conclude us to deny them to be a Rule (though at the ſame time, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſhows, that we would acknowledge them to be ſuch, were they the Word of God, and that therefore the Word of God is our Rule) but he ſuggeſts, that we believe a Conformity to their Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, <hi>cannot render a prophane Man leſs prophane:</hi> To prove this, he quotes <hi>James Parnel,</hi> thus, <q>And he alſo that ſaith, The Letter is the Rule and Guide of the People of God, is without, feeding upon the Husks, and is ignorant of the true Light, which was before the Letter was: <hi>Shield of Truth,</hi> p. 10.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Smith</hi> thus, <q>And if thou lookeſt upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47076:35"/>
the Scripture, to be for a Rule, and for Trying, thou giveſt that unto them, which is due unto Chriſt: for He is the Rule, and leads his People; and he alone ſearches the Hearts, and tryes the Reins, and not the Scripture.</q> Again, <hi>But if you will ſee a Mouth full of Blaſphemies againſt the Authority of the Scripture; read with Horror and Amazement, the following words:</hi> 
                  <q>God is at Liberty to ſpeak to his People by them, if he pleaſe, and where they are given by Inſpiration, he doth ſo; but ſays <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>In Anſwer to all which, he ſays juſt nothing; but thinks, it is enough to have cited theſe Paſſages and ſeems to triumph as reaſonably as the Man which dreamt he did eat, but awaket anhungry, delighted himſelf in his ſleeping Feaſt. Let us trie to rouſe him out of this Lethargy of Ignorance and Conceit.</p>
               <p>§. 2. I ſhall freely confeſs, that for the ſame Reaſons, that we deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, we cannot own them as the General Rule of Faith. But alſo, as we acknowledge them to be the Words of the holy, living and powerful Word of God; ſo that they expreſs and declare unto us many holy Rules for Godlineſs; and I declare in the Name of all the Right-born <hi>Quakers</hi> in the World, <hi>that we utterly reject all ſuch, as Deny the Scriptures to be profitable for Reprehenſion, Inſtruction, Exhortation and Eaification.</hi> How vain then is this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47076:36"/>
Man's Impeachment of us, as Perſons void of all true Reſpect for them?</p>
               <p>§. 3. In ſhort; as the Scriptures are not the Word of God, <hi>but a Declaration of the Word of God;</hi> ſo the Scriptures are not the general Rule, <hi>but a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the true general Rule:</hi> which I prove thus.</p>
               <p>That which alwayes was, and is a more general Rule then the Scriptures, muſt needs be, and is moſt properly THE <hi>general Rule,</hi> and not the Scriptures; but that was, and is the Light of God in the Hearts of Men; Conſequently not the Scriptures, but the Light was, &amp; is moſt properly <hi>The general Rule.</hi> The middle Propoſition only to be excepted againſt is clear, in that before the Scriptures were writ, and ſince, where they have not been known, Men have been &amp; are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, Reprov'd, Inclined, Taught, Order'd and Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inward Appearance of God's Light in the Conſcience. And among thoſe who are called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> let them be juſt to God and their own Souls, and they <hi>muſt confeſs, that there is ſomething very near them, when the Scriptures are quite remote,</hi> both from their Perſons, and their Thoughts, which upon any Miſcarriage is as a ſwift Witneſs, to ſmite: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the approach of Temptation is as quick to warn, and diſwade the Mind from falling into the Foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. Is not this then more Living, Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and General, that neither Sea nor Land, Day nor Night, nor any condition, <hi>but a Seared Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> can exempt People, or deliver them from the ſecret living and ſenſible Touches of this holy Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether they be to Counſel, Juſtifie or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn? This ſearcheth the Heart, this tryeth the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47076:36"/>
Reins: of which <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>It had made him Wiſer then his Teachers,</hi> who read and expounded the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Law unto him.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And indeed, it is unworthy of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Adminiſtration of Life it ſelf, more glorious then that of Condemnation, the State of the Law, that an outward Book, though declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of never ſo much good, and not the Good it ſelf ſhould be the ſole general Rule of ſuch as are under it. What is it, but to ſubject the Spirituallity of the Goſpel to the Letter of the Law? And thus much worſe, that then it ſelf they had either the daily Living Voice of God, or a Law engraven on Stone, whilſt the Scriptures, which they call the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Goſpel Rule, are but in Paper. But can any true Chriſtian think, that God is ſo wanting to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, who promiſed <hi>to Write a Law in the Hearts of his People,</hi> as to bound them by meer <hi>Literal Preſcripts?</hi> No ſurely; but much rather, that the Law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, which he promiſed to write in the Hearts of Men and Women, ſhould be the Rule of this Adminiſtration, <hi>which is a Living Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Rule,</hi> preſent upon all Occaſions, and in all ſtraights, and ready to aſſiſt with Counſel, Wiſdom, and Knowledge, all who act agreeably to the Mind of God, who will reward every Man according to his Works. So that <hi>J. Parnel,</hi> and <hi>W. S.</hi> their Expreſſions are clear'd. For <hi>J. N's,</hi> the laſt of the three, it was not written in Deriſion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is unworthily ſuggeſted; but to prove, that God is not limited to Inſtruments. God, whoſe holy Spirit is the living ſubſtantial Rule, may appear after divers Manners, either by bringing into
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47076:37"/>
the very Conſcience the Truth of ſome weighty Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Scripture, or by a Miniſtry, or any other Way; yea, by <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and that without Blaſphemy or Prophaneneſs; For by whom, or what may not the Almighty direct the Sons of Men? ſtill it was not ſo mean a Creature as an Aſs (which God ſpoke by, to aggravate the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and greaten the Miracle) No; Nor the Apoſtles themſelves, much leſs their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; but the Word of the Lord, that <hi>was as a Fire to the Workers of Iniquity, and Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to them that believe it.</hi> That was the <hi>True Rule;</hi> wherefore ſaid the Prophet., Hear the Word of the Lord. What Word? that, <hi>nigh in the Heart, which</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>preach'd.</hi> Still the outward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is not the Rule; the <hi>Prophet</hi> is not the Rule, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is not the Rule, much leſs are their Writings, being they are but all external Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And this I will abide by againſt all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of our Enemies by God's Aſſiſtance, that both they are but ſuch Inſtruments; and that ſuch Inſtruments are not the Goſpel-Rule, but <hi>that Light, Life, Power or Spirit, which uſeth them;</hi> and who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes that Honour to the Inſtrument, which is due to the chief Mover in it, or by it, commits down-right Idolatry; Therefore what is flung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Quakers</hi> by their <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> is more juſtly chargeable upon their <hi>Adverſaries.</hi> But we cannot help it, if that People will not work through the Outward to the Inward; the Writings or Perſons, to the <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> that employ them for any Uſe or Service in the World! Nor ſhall we ever be condemned of God, that we therefore decline to attribute thoſe Titles to the Scriptures (otherwiſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47076:37"/>
worthy above all Books) which are only due to that which gave them forth; eſpecially, ſince what we believe in the Matter, is with an holy Fear and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards our God, and Good-Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Men.</p>

                  <hi>is therein affirmed by the Lord, we ought to believe;</hi> proved from Chriſt's Words, <hi>O Fools, and ſlow of Heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken!</hi> Luk. 24, 25. (2) <hi>That what is thereby commanded (not being repeal'd by the coming of Chriſt) it is our Duty to obey,</hi> Deut. 5. 34. (3) <hi>That the holy Scriptures do in their kind determine or diſcover to us, whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and walk, or practice aright or not,</hi> proved hence; <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works;</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in [all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets] <hi>do I excerciſe my ſelf to have a Conſcience void of Offence. 2 Tim. 3. 16. 17. Acts</hi> 24. 16.</p>
               <p>To all which I ſay, we do with him acknowledge, that, whatever the Lord hath by his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> who writ the Scripture, <hi>affirmed,</hi> and <hi>required</hi> (taking in his Exception about <hi>Chriſt's Coming)</hi> it is our Duty both to Believe and Obey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that there is no Difficulty in that Matter. For the laſt Paſſage, there is ſome ſober Scruple in our Minds about it; For there are manifeſt Conteſts in the World, both about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> They reſult not from the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> I grant: but that they proceed from Mens wrong Apprehenſions of <hi>Scripture</hi> in a great Meaſure, that I affirm; and I know no Man ſo ſtupid,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47076:38"/>
as to deny. Now, I would fain know, which way thoſe wrong Apprehenſions are to be rectified: He ſays, by <hi>Scripture:</hi> I ſay, Not; for the <hi>Key</hi> is wanting. What is that <hi>Key</hi> may ſome ſay? <hi>The Spirit of Truth, who gave them forth:</hi> Who can explain any Man's Mind ſo well as Himſelf, in a Matter, wherein he is not rightly underſtood; or it is hard to underſtand Him? And if none but what is indued with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is capable of underſtanding a Rational Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; Neither can any Man whatever underſtand ſpiritual Propoſitions, or Propoſitions about ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Matters in the <hi>Scriptures, but by the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Holy Spirit in ſome Degree or other.</hi> This is ſo clear, that the Sun is not more obvious at Noon-day in a clear Sky, then this muſt be to all Diſcerning Minds; ſo that the Scriptures, though profeſſedly own'd by us to be Inſtrumental to the Knowledge of that Doctrine of Reproof and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Righteouſneſs (weightily mention'd by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (for certainly they do declare to us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Excellent Precepts and Rules) yet, they are ſo far from being THE General and Abſolute Rule, that the very <hi>Light or Spirit of Chriſt is, and ought to be our Rule, how far, which Way, and to what End we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practiſe them.</hi> And I cannot forbear at this time (though I have often done ſo) to ſhew the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible perverſion of Scripture, this Man is guilty of in the laſt of theſe two Scriptures, by him quoted for Proof of the Third Head. The Apoſtle in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the Publick <hi>Orator</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> tells the <hi>Governour</hi> then preſent, among other Paſſages, that though he was no Diſturber, as accuſed; yet, ſaid he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I confeſs, <hi>that after the Way which they call</hi> Hereſie, <hi>do I Worſhip the God of my Fathers, Believing all things
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47076:38"/>
which are written in the Law and the Prophets, and have Hope towards God, which they themſelves alſo allow, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Dead, both of the Juſt and the Unjuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. Now brings in <hi>J. Faldo</hi> theſe words <hi>[all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets]</hi> do I exerciſe my ſelf to have a Conſcience void of Offence towards God and toward Men. I do ſay, this is a perverſion of Scripture; for he hath <hi>Firſt</hi> left out that which is more applicable to the Words, and put that only in, which is leaſt ſo: and <hi>Next,</hi> he has done it in the ſame <hi>Character,</hi> by which common Readers may be miſtakenly ſtrengthned againſt us; this is plain: And for the former, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it could not be ſo proper in the Apoſtle to ſay, he <hi>was exerciſed in his Belief of the Law and the Prophets,</hi> as in that Way of Worſhip, <hi>they call'd He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> and <hi>his Hope of a Reſurrection;</hi> both left out by our <hi>Adverſary.</hi> Nor is ſuch a Uſe of his words ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Condition <hi>Paul</hi> was in: For he having out-ſtript both the Law and Prophets, and <hi>being brought to a Brighter Day, and more Excellent Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he cannot be ſo rightly ſaid to have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in that he had left behind him, <hi>as in the Work of his own Day, which fulfill'd and ſwallow'd up the other Diſpenſations,</hi> as but Fore-runners of it; which was that ſpiritual Worſhip Chriſt ſet up, and he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd the God of his Fathers in, and endeavour'd to gather others to, though they reputed it <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and that Hope of the Reſurrection of both Juſt and Unjuſt, which they themſelves pretended to own. What then could be <hi>Paul's</hi> Meaning in that Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets?</hi> I Anſwer, what is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47076:39"/>

Whence we obſerve (1) The greateſt Enemies to the Spiritualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Evangelical Diſpenſation, <hi>where the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Profeſſors of a Literal Religion, the only ſeeming Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of the Scriptures, and earneſt Contenders for the Faith and Religion once delivered to the Fathers,</hi> at leaſt as they pretended. (2) That they were wont to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch as were eminent Promotors of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Contemners, at leaſt Slighters of the Law and the Prophets.</hi> What need I ſay any more; Behold a Parallel, as plain as Light it ſelf; <hi>The Literal</hi> Jews <hi>then, the Literal</hi> Chriſtians <hi>now; the Spiritual</hi> Jews <hi>then, the Spiritual</hi> Chriſtians <hi>now.</hi>

                  <hi>that it is not ſo determinative of all Caſes, as ſome thing elſe may be, which is a more Living, Immediate and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge then a WRITING is or can be;</hi> and we will grant, that the Scriptures do determine, as much as any Writing in the World can do, unleſs God would pleaſe immediately and more full to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal ſomething, leſs clearly laid down in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>and then ſhould require that Revelation to be Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> for Men muſt have a care of limiting, either his Power or Will. If <hi>J. Faldo</hi> had at the beginning of his Oppoſition to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Belief in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, well conſider'd this, I am of opinion, that either he would have never given himſelf, and us the trouble of ſo much needleſs Diſcours, or have been ſo Careful of his Cauſe, as never to have wounded it with this fatal Blow, <hi>that the Scriptures can determin as far as a Writing will go:</hi> Nothing to the Queſtion at all, which lyes here; <hi>Whether any the beſt Writing, or the Spirit of Truth, that gave it forth, is Judge;</hi> and as far from his purpoſe, as quite looſing of his Cauſe amounts to. Again,</p>
               <p>§. 8. His Inſtance about the Law is lame, for the good Laws of any Land are but <hi>Reaſon Written,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared by writing, which is oblieging againſt the Corruption of a <hi>Judge,</hi> but not the Reaſon of the Judge. Neither is the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Judge,</hi> but there is a Judge, who interprets and ſpeaks from the freſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his own Reaſon, the Meaning and Intendment of thoſe written Laws. If the Laws be Sufficient without a Judge, why is there a Judge? If then they are <hi>Dark, Obſcure,</hi> and <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in many Caſes, ſo as to need a Judge and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, which I call <hi>Living and Immediate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47076:40"/>
then ſince the Scriptures are Writings, in which are many Things very Difficult to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; it follows, <hi>that there muſt be an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Living Judge:</hi> which muſt be therefore the Spirit of Truth that gave them forth; becauſe, <hi>none Knows the things of God ſave the Spirit of God;</hi> and that thoſe who are the Makers of Laws, are the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are fit to judge and determine in Caſe of Difficulty, by a declaration of their Mind or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any ſuch obſcure Paſſage. So that if <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſhould write a Thouſand Years againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> he would never be able to weather this one Paſſage, in which <hi>he has moſt evidently ſubjected the Scriptures to a more Living, Spiritual, and Immediate Judge, then any meer Writing poſſibly can be,</hi> which he makes them but to be.</p>
               <p>§. 9. In ſhort, either the Scriptures are not obſcure (a thing we daily ſee) or if ſo, yet ſufficient, which is impoſſible, or they muſt have a Judge, which is moſt true and neceſſary; and what Judge, but the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth? And ſo far are Decrees from determining, becauſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that they are therefore determinative of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, becauſe of that Conviction, the Power from whence they came, works upon the Conſcience. So that, though what is true in it ſelf, is not the leſs ſo, becauſe written; yet is not the Writing (ſubject to an hundred Caſualities) nor Matter therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as there, eminently the <hi>Rule,</hi> much leſs the <hi>Judge,</hi> after our Adverſaries Notion of a <hi>Judge;</hi> But that Living, Powerful Spirit, which gave it forth, and who are made ſpiritual Men by it: For the ſpiritual Man judges all things. Such Writings may be declaratory of the Mind and Determination
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47076:40"/>
of the Living <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Judge,</hi> I grant; but alſo I utterly deny, that the Writings themſelves are that Rule, how People are to believe them; and a Judge, how to determine of the Difficulties and Obſcurities within themſelves. A meer Begging of the Queſtion, and a thing altogether abſurd.</p>
               <p>We cannot end this Chapter without an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Goodneſs of God; in Opening things ſo clearly to the making known his Divine Light and Truth, and manifeſtly Diſcovering the great Darkneſs and Blindneſs of its Oppoſers.</p>

                  <hi>within to the Light without, putting the Letter for the Light,</hi> &amp;c. Shield of Tr. pag. 10. And what then? Becauſe we ſay, that he who inlightens all Men, <hi>God,</hi> that is the Sun, and Fountain of all Divine Light, and in whom there is no Darkneſs at all, is greater then the Scriptures; therefore will it follow, that we take People off from Reading or Looking into them. Behold your <hi>Prieſt,</hi> you that hear him! <hi>Is this Man to be accounted of, as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, that thus unrighteouſly deals with us?</hi> But God will recompenſe upon his Head in the Day of his terrible Vengeance for all his Hard and Ungodly Sayings againſt us.</p>
               <p>We do ſay, and that rightly, <hi>Whoever puts the Letter in Oppoſition to, or above the Spirit, is an Idolater;</hi> For there can be no Compariſon rightly made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; the Heavens don't excell the Earth more, then the Spirit does the Letter, and the Power the Form: But if we do not therefore deny the <hi>Form of Godlineſs,</hi> becauſe we prefer, and preſs more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly <hi>the Power;</hi> neither do we exclude the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe we prefer and preſs the Everlaſting <hi>Word of God nigh in the Heart:</hi> And this I will tell him, that, to buſie the Minds of Men with the Depth of thoſe Truths the Scriptures declare of by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and exerciſing their Minds, in Meditating thereon, before they have been turned unto the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Light or Grace of God in the Heart, to believe and obey that in its ſecret Diſcoveries, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and Strivings, <hi>is, to ſet Men about Images, to conceive a God, a Chriſt, a Salvation, a Damnation,

               <p>§. 3. But <hi>J. Story,</hi> he thinks, has Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to prove his Aſſertion in this <note place="margin">pag 80.</note> Paſſage: <q>And although the holy Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and the Saints Practices are <hi>as Lights</hi> in the World; yet, far be it from all true Chriſtian Men, ſo to Idolize them, <hi>as to ſet them in Eſteem above the Light, which is ſufficient to guide;</hi> or to eſteem them Equal with the Light and Spirit of God within.</q> 
                  <hi>J. S.</hi> Short Diſcourſe: Pag. 2. To this he objects, that J. S. <hi>confeſſes them to be as Lights but not a Light, and that our Commendations of that Idol the Light within, are ſuch, that if they were true, he were a ſtark Fool, that would direct his Eyes to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here the <hi>Prieſt</hi> fail's egregiouſly. For if the Scriptures are as Lights, I cannot ſee how they ſhould be denyed to be as in the Nature of a Light; unleſs to acknowledge their Teſtimonies to be as <hi>Lights,</hi> be to deny them to have <hi>any Light</hi> at all. Is this the great <hi>Originalian, Linguiſt, Critick, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> and what elſe his own conceit will have him? What is it but to ſay, that ſix burning <hi>Candles</hi> are ſix
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47076:42"/>
                  <hi>Lights?</hi> but not that they give a Light, either joyntly or ſeparately; But 'tis below us to purſue every Advantage his Ignorance gives us: I find him more in Words then Matter, a great deal, and I ſuppoſe, more are of that Mind, or elſe what means his great Pains to be made waſte paper of already? <hi>Quakeriſm no Chriſtianity,</hi> has exchang'd the Book-Sellers Stalls for the Tobacco Shops.

               </p>
               <p>But to his Reflection upon the <hi>Light, as our Idol; and their Folly, who attend upon the Scriptures, when they have ſo excellent a Light in their own Boſomes;</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the reſt of the Chapter, I thus return. God is that Light which hath enlightned Mankind, and to have the higheſt Reverence for him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him can be therefore no Idolatry: And for the Scripture all grant, that there is a State above them; For I hope, the Man does not think, that People ſhall have Bibles in Heaven, and the more any approach to the heavenly Life, and Glory, the leſs need there will be, and yet not the leſs value of them. But this we alſo ſay, that they are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Inſtruction and Comfort in this World: And God hath ſpoke, does, and yet will by the Scriptures ſpeak to the Conſciences of Men; For, being given forth by the Spirit of God, they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that <hi>Reproof, Exhortation</hi> and thoſe <hi>Promiſes,</hi> which being felt in ſome Sence of the ſame Divine Light, <hi>do adminiſter Knowledge and Refreſhment.</hi> But we do alſo and again declare it as our Faith, <hi>that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47076:43"/>
the Pouring out of the Spirit, is a Goſpel Priviledge,</hi> yea, the very proper and peculiar Promiſe and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Father in that State; and that, as the Spirit is ſuperior to the Letter, ſo we earneſtly contend, not againſt the Scripture, but for that <hi>Living Experimental Knowledge</hi> of them, which all witneſs, who are truly taught and led by the Spirit, and <hi>which can't be obtained by any meer Writings whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> Nor does it follow, that becauſe God has given a ſufficient Light, therefore all other Means ſhould be ſuperfluous. Certain I am, <note place="margin">p. 81.</note> this Argument is fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> then one who more then once Vaunts himſelf to be a <hi>Critick</hi> (indeed a Quibler) For what is it but to ſay, that though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man has Reaſon enough in him to know, that Intemperance is below a very Brute, yet becauſe he is Intemperate, his Reaſon is not ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him better; Or, if it be ſufficient, he ought to deſpiſe anothers Admonitions however ſeaſonable, his Reaſon being enough to his Information: Was <hi>Nathan</hi> of no uſe to <hi>David,</hi> who had ſo ſecret, and ſufficient a Teacher? And here I do obſerve that all our <hi>Oppoſers</hi> ſplit themſelves, and will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unleſs better inform'd; <hi>They ignorantly or baſely infer a Fallibility or Inſufficiency to be in the Light, from the Fallibility and Rebellion of thoſe Perſons, whom we ſay, are lightned by it:</hi> And on the Contrary hand, <hi>that all ſhould be neceſſarily Infallible, who are Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by an Infallible Light,</hi> not conſidering, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Grace of God <hi>Inſufficient to Save, becauſe Men refuſe to be Saved by it; nor, though it be ſufficient,</hi> and Infallible in it ſelf, <hi>that therefore all thoſe to whom it is tender'd are ſav'd;</hi> or therefore <hi>are Infallible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Conſideration had to their Obedience.</hi> How Falſe?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47076:43"/>
How Injurious? How (almoſt) Unpardonable is this <hi>Prieſt</hi> then? Who ſeems to charge us with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>that all Power in Heaven and in Earth is in every Particular Man,</hi> becauſe, ſayes he <note place="margin">p. 81.</note> 
                  <hi>this Light in every one is God, Chriſt, Spirit &amp;c.</hi> For, though we confeſs, that as to every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, all the Power, which is requir'd to redeem that Soul from the Pollutions of the World, unto the pure and undefiled Religion, is in that <hi>Divine Principle,</hi> which, with reſpect to the great Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the World, is very aptly denominated Light, yet that therefore the whole Light and Power of it ſhould be comprehended by, or contained in every Individual Soul, I utterly Renounce as no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our Doctrine; For that were to ſay; <hi>in every Room where the Sun ſhines, there is a diſtinct Sun.</hi> Theſe are but ſome of the Prieſts old <hi>Bulbeggars</hi> to ſcare the Simple, and they will at laſt do as much for their Inventors. It ſhall ſuffice us (1) that, though the Light ſhines not alike into all habitable Places, yet the ſame Light, by Nature, ſhines into all ſuch Places. For illuſtration only; If a Man has ſix Rooms expos'd to the Sun, there may be more Light in ſome one then another, yet not therefore another Sun or Light. (2) If People refuſe to ſee by it, it implies no Deficiency in the Light, but argues mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Rebellion in the Party. (3) That, whatever Means it may pleaſe God, to uſe to ſtir up Men to obſerve &amp; obey the Light they withſtand, they ought not to be thought ſuperfluous, or the Light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Inſufficient. (4) That all ſuch Means as can be effectual, proceed from that Divine Principle in <hi>others,</hi> and with Deſign of turning the <hi>Rebellious</hi> to the Grace which they reſiſt in themſelves. So,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47076:44"/>
notwithſtanding the <hi>Quakers</hi> do own and aſſert the Spirit to be Superiour to the Scriptures, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this Adminiſtration; yet, they do not deny the Scripture all Service or Benefit, by no means, but believe, it ought to be Read, Believ'd, Honour'd and Obey'd, as that, by which God has, doth, and may yet reach to the Hearts and Conſciences of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And to the Righteous Lord God of Heaven and Earth do we make our Appeal in this Matter (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Unrighteous Dealing of this traduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Prieſt)</hi> who is the Searcher of the Hearts of all Men.</p>

               <p>§. 2. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>affirm, the Doctrines, Commands, Promiſes, holy Examples expreſſed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">pag. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Scriptures, as ſuch, not at all to be binding to us. This,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is a Denying of the Scriptures, and the Authority of the God of the Scriptures.</hi> For Proof of this, he brings out E. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> Speaking thus, <q>That is no Command of God to me, what he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to another; neither did any of the Saints which we read of in the Scripture, act by that Command, which was to another, not having the Command to themſelves; I challenge to find an Example to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer briefly, and plainly. <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi>'s Expreſſion may be taken two wayes, and both ſafe enough to the Honour and Credit of the Scriptures, though not to the Charity or Honeſty of <hi>J. Faldo.</hi> No Command in the Scripture is any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oblieging upon any Man, then as he finds a Conviction upon his Conſcience; otherwiſe Men ſhould be engaged without, if not againſt Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a Thing Unreaſonable in a Man. Therefore the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when he wrote to the Churches, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, Not to do thoſe things whereof they were aſhamed, to ſhun what was manifeſted to be Evil; and affirms, <hi>That whatever might be known of God was manifeſted Within; for God had ſhown it unto them.</hi> So,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47076:45"/>
that Conviction can only obliege to Obedience; and ſince what works that Conviction, <hi>is the Manifeſting Light, Univerſal Grace, or Quickning Spirit in the Heart of Mankind,</hi> it follows, that <hi>the principal Ground for our Faith in the Scriptures, and Reaſon of our Obedience to the Holy Precepts therein contained, is the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Conviction and Secret Drawings</hi> of <hi>the Light, or Spirit of God in the Conſcience:</hi> And thus <hi>E. B</hi>'s Words are Sound and Scriptural; for the Scriptures are chiefly believed to be true upon Conviction, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Practice therein: and when any Man is convinced, that what was Commanded another, is required of him, then, and not till then, he is rightly authoriz'd to perform it. Again,</p>
               <p>§ 3. Such Commands are either relating to <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or Extraordinary Caſes:</hi> By <hi>Ordinary Caſes,</hi> I mean, ſuch as chiefly concern <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holy Life,</hi> which are General, Permanent, and Indiſpenſible; and then I deny his Conſequence.

To all which I ſay, (1.) That greater Untruth Irreverence, and Impertinency could not well have been expreſt, then in his ſaying, <hi>That no Man can come to the Father, but by Chriſt; and no Man can come to the Knowledge of God, but by Chriſt, are two different things:</hi> For it manifeſtly implies, that Men may know God without Chriſt, either inwardly or outwardly, <hi>(though no other Name be given) and that to know the Father, was to know ſome other kind of Being, then to know God:</hi> Or, that when they did know the one, <hi>they did not know the other.</hi> (2.) That it was never denyed by any <hi>Quaker,</hi> that God might, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does reach into the very Heart and Conſcience by the Scriptures: Shall I allow, that a Man may be convinced of his Evil by reading one of our Books; and ſhall I deny it to be as poſſible for any to be convinced by reading ſome Paſſages in the Holy Scriptures? God forbid. Neither did <hi>William Smith</hi> ever mean, that Chriſt was ſo the only Way to the Father, as thereby to exclude all Inſtruments; <hi>for then he had both cut off all Benefit that could accrue to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his Books, and alſo from that Miniſtry God had given him to profit others with,</hi> which was far from his Thoughts, we may be ſure. So that the great Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of this <hi>Prieſt</hi> is herein manifeſt, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Coſt to know him; for he argues from our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that there is any other Way to the Father, but Chriſt, <hi>to our excluding the Scriptures, and conſequently our own Books, and Miniſtry with them, from being any way Inſtrumental of Good. Reader,</hi> what can be ſaid to ſuch a Man; but that he is either Ignorance or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice it Self? I wiſh it were the former, but his Book makes me fear the latter.</p>

§. 5. In ſhort, through all Inſtruments, <hi>He,</hi> who in time, and with reſpect to that Manifeſtation, was call'd <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was, is, and ever will be the <hi>alone Way</hi> to the Father: And though he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover himſelf by divers Inſtruments, yet it is but in order to incline Man <hi>to his Holy Voice in Man;</hi> Some they hear and obey and live; Others they reſiſt the Grace, grieve the Spirit, turn from the Way of the Light, and are in a State of Death.</p>
               <p>God hath been frequently pleaſed to move in the Hearts of the Obedient to viſit the Rebellious, that the Inward Strivings of the Holy Spirit might be the more Efficacious by its Strivings through ſome Outward Inſtruments; but ſtill it is the ſame Light, Grace or Spirit of God: Nor is the Light within any whit the more Inſufficient to reclaim the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, if minded; for it is the ſame Light with that, which moves in the Hearts of the Obedient to bear Record for God againſt their Ungodly Deeds. Only Mens Minds being far ſtrayed from that Holy Light, or Word in the Heart, and gone abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wide World of Luſts and Vanities, it hath pleaſed God to viſit Mankind ſo degenerated, by thoſe who have been Obedient Children, to the End they might be the more eaſily gained to a Subjection unto the Holy Light in themſelves: ſo that all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Converſion, are to be aſcribed to the Light, Grace, and Spirit of God, whether imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the Creature, or mediately by any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Only take this by the way, that whatſoever is Efficacious mediately, is not to be underſtood ſimply of another Man's Meaſure of Light or Grace, but in Conjunction with what God hath given, and may be at work in the Party convicted and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

That there are Children of the Fleſhly, Literal and Hiſtorical Knowledge of the Scriptures and Religion, who are Strangers to, and therefore Perſecutors of the Children born of the Spirit: And that in all Ages there hath been more or leſs of this among Inward and Outward <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> and let <hi>J.

               <p>It cannot be ſo ridiculous in <hi>W. P.</hi> to aſſert the Impoſſibility of any Man's Knowing God, or the Things belonging to his Everlaſting Kingdom, but

by Experience, or, as God hath been pleaſed, by the Inſpiration or Illumination of his Light or Spirit to demonſtrate, or diſcover unto Mankind, as it is Impious and Antichriſtian in <hi>J.

               <p>§. 3. But ſays he, <hi>How!

               </p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>But is it thus, that you know Chriſt died, that there ſhall be a Judgment, and an Immortality?</hi> I anſwer, not altogether thus; <hi>One Part</hi> is Matter of Story, and is believed, <hi>firſt,</hi> Hiſtorically, upon the Credit
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47076:49"/>
of Hiſtory; and <hi>then</hi> upon the Account of Inward Conviction too: <hi>The other</hi> is Knowable only upon Experience; For we feel in our ſelves Rewards and Puniſhments for Good and Evil in this Life, and receive them as Earneſts of what will attend Man-kind in the next: And we have an inward Sence of a never dying Life; which, as we are Gather'd into it, and Grow up in it, we ſhall Inherit Eternal Felicity; and as there is an Erring from that Holy Spirit of Life, the Wages of ſuch Rebellion will be the direful Portion of Death and Miſery to every Soul forever.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Nor does this claſh with <hi>Faith,</hi> whatever the <hi>Prieſt</hi> would ſuggeſt. <hi>For Faith is a believing in, or relying upon God, with reſpect to a further Knowledge and Enjoyment of him;</hi> which no wayes impugnes or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands a Knowledge of God upon Experience, ſo far as Men do experience: wherein they ſimply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>they do not yet ſo perfectly experience, which ends Faith;</hi> yet it abides certain, that when they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that further Revelation of the Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Riches of the Love of God, as the End of their Faith, <hi>then, and not before, they may be ſaid to know thoſe things.</hi> Why then ſhould we be denyed to conclude, and that moſt rightly, that to <hi>Know,</hi> and to <hi>Experience,</hi> are equivalent Terms? No <hi>Knowledge</hi> without <hi>Experience;</hi> no <hi>Experience</hi> without <hi>Knowledge.</hi> And though Men may believe in a further Enjoyment of what they now have but an Earneſt of, yet <hi>that,</hi> as ſuch, they know not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they experience it not. And ſo much this inſolent <hi>Vilifier</hi> of that ſerious Expreſſion, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to us, and diſputes for (as he thinks againſt)

us, when he ſayes, <hi>where is Faith all the while? and if none but Believers be Saints, ſuch as</hi> W. P. <hi>are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly</hi> none. Since then my Affirming no <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God without <hi>Experience,</hi> ſtrikes not at <hi>Faith,</hi> becauſe <hi>Faith,</hi> ſays our <hi>Adverſary, is not a clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but believing or relying upon God, as to things not yet clearly known and enjoyed;</hi> what has the Man been a doing all the while? But here was his ſhameful Miſtake and Contradiction; That <hi>Knowing</hi> and <hi>Believing</hi> are <hi>one and the ſame thing;</hi> and this I will make appear from his own Words, and a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to himſelf, at the End of it.</p>
               <p>§. 6. He quarrels my affirming all Knowledge to reſt upon Experience, and oppoſes to it this queſtion, <hi>Can we experience his Omnipotency?</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>yet we know it;</hi> elſe he queries impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

a little Child, or new Bottle fitted for the new Wine of the Spirit; and to which the Scriptures teſtifie.</hi> Many can talk of Chriſt from the Scriptures, which crucifie him in themſelves by Wicked Works, and do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Praiſes to him, as the Seed that hath bruiſed the Serpent's Head, while the Serpent may be yet raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. All ſuch <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion of Religion from the meer Letter of the Scriptures, diſtinct from the Revelation and Operation of the Eternal Spirit within, muſt be Unlearnt, Unravill'd, Unbottom'd; one Stone muſt not be left ſtanding upon one another,</hi> that there may be a Beginning upon a right Foundation. But, far be it from me, to ſay, <hi>that a Man muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn that Knowledge he has had of the Scriptures from the Key of</hi> David, <hi>the Living Word of God, when it has opened the Myſteries therein declared of;</hi> By no means; <hi>for ſuch Knowledge is Right, Natural, Sanctified from God, and to be eſteem'd very Excellent and Divine.</hi>

               <p>§. 11. My <hi>Latin, Greek, Authors, Logick, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Quotations</hi> I therefore us'd, and urg'd, with plainneſs and brevity, to prove and recommend the Truth I defended to the World; that lying under great Diſcredit with too many, they might ſee that ready to its Confirmation, which they perhaps would not otherwiſe have thought upon: But the <hi>Prieſt</hi> has been as Uncandid with me here, as with my Friends and Self abundantly elſewhere; for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers general Affirmatives or Negatives from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Propoſitions: becauſe I affirm'd, that Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men muſt begin again, that their Religion muſt be unlearn't, as to their way of acquiring it, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> concludes, the <hi>Quakers deny all Knowledge which comes from reading, Meditation, or any ſuch Means, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47076:52"/>
ſanctified;</hi> then which, there can be nothing of that kind more Untrue; ſince it were to ſay, <hi>becauſe we deny an erroneous Underſtanding, therefore we deny all Underſtanding; or, in as much as we comdemn all ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquired or wrong-gotten Knowledge, for that cauſe, we are to be concluded Enemies to all true and well gotten Knowledge.</hi> But we muſt bear this, and a great deal more; and the rather, ſince he does ſo ſeaſonably aſſiſt to his own Confutation, by acknowledging <hi>that the Scriptures without, and God above has taught him better things.</hi> Now what is this <hi>Teaching of the God above?</hi> If it be in the Scripture, it was impertinent to ſay any more then that the Scriptures have taught them better things: but if he meant that God taught by his immediate Diſcoveries, with and beſide the Seriptures; then wherein do we differ? Why has he taken ſo much Pains, and flung ſo much Dirt? He bids us alſo <hi>to put on the Armour of Light:</hi> If he means that of the Scriptures, he errs egregiouſſy; for no Man can put them on, neither are they <hi>that Light which manifeſts every Thought, Word or Deed;</hi> but that Light which we aſſert to have been before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were, and now is, where they are not, or at leaſt, when they are not thought upon, which is ſome thing more Immediate, Living, Spiritual and Inward, and that brings Thoughts, Words and Deeds to Light, ſavours, reliſhes, diſcovers, and accepts or condemns. In ſhort, thus; if whatever makes manifeſt, is Light, then becauſe the Thoughts, Words and Deeds of Men and Women have been manifeſted unto them in all Ages, as well before Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were, and where they have not been, as ſince they were, and where they have been; it follows that they had Light, and that the ſame Light cannot
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47076:53"/>
be the Scriptures, though the Matter Written, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Scriptures, was manifeſted by that Light to the holy <hi>Pen-men</hi> before they were written; which ſtill makes for the Authority of the Light within. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> exhorts us to that, he endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and with which holy Armour we have fairly foyl'd him in his own Field. The ſame may be ſaid of the Word of God, though not of the Scriptures any further, then the ſharp-Word of God may ſpeak, or pierce through them into the Conſciences: for with good Reaſon do we affirm, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> or Writings, <hi>are not that Sword, but that from whence they came.</hi> The word was a <hi>Fire,</hi> an <hi>Hammer,</hi> a <hi>Sword,</hi> in the <hi>Prophets:</hi> But the Words or Writings it ſpoke by, were not that Fire, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nor Sword; <hi>neither bad they any other Edge, then what the Word put upon them.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe may I argue againſt their being the Off ſpring of God, properly; for, as ſuch, they could not be ſubject to Caſuality. God's Off-ſpring is more Living and Eternal: that Word is to high, for properly taken, I mean as Writings, they were the Off-ſpring of the Writers only; but the Truth they declare of, is of God, and that will abide forever.</p>
               <p>§. 12. But upon the <hi>Shield of Faith, and the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which <hi>is the Word of God</hi> he has a pretty Fetch. <hi>Faith in the 16. verſe is preferred above the Word in the 17. verſe; Therefore it is not Chriſt the Word, but the Scriptures the Word; for Faith is not above Chriſt.</hi> But neither will this do his Buſineſs: and a Shame it is, that this Man ſhould bring theſe Places to prove that the <hi>Scriptures are Means, whereby to reſiſt Temptation,</hi> which concern them not, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47076:53"/>
this in hand; unleſs he would have <hi>Faith</hi> to be the <hi>Scriptures</hi> or Word of God, in his Senſe, which as it is abſurd, ſo it will by him be denied, ſince he allows the Faith to be preferr'd above the Word of God, therefore diſtinct from it, and not Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſame with it. And ſhould we grant to him, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not underſtood by the Word of God, but the Scriptures, yet obſerve, the fatal Blow his Cauſe receives at his own Hand; Every true Chriſtian hath Faith, that Faith is above the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>therefore every true Chriſtian hath ſome thing in him above the Scriptures.</hi> Every true Faith overcomes the World, and quenches the fiery Darts of Satan, conſequently Temptations therefore not ſo properly the Scriptures, <hi>but true Faith which is preferred above them, and reſiſts Temptations, and overcomes the World.</hi> The juſt they live by Faith: <hi>but Faith is above the Scripture; Therefore the Juſt live by that which is above the Scriptures,</hi> and of courſe the Scriptures are not the Rule of Faith; for how can any thing be ruled by that which is inferiour to it? Thus much we get, granting to him that the Scriptures are <hi>that Word of God.</hi> But we deny that Gloſs too. For the Spiritual Sword, as he ſays <hi>Beza</hi> renders it, which is that Word of God, muſt be at leaſt of the Nature of that reſt of the <hi>Armour</hi> mentioned in that Chapter, <hi>I mean of an Inviſible Spiritual Nature, which the Bible, as a meer Writing is not.</hi> If any ſhould ſay, <hi>but the Truth it declares of;</hi> I ſay ſo to: and the very Words, when by the living Word brought into the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, do <hi>Pinch, Prick, and Wound;</hi> but then that Operation comes from the Power of the Word, which through them reacheth into the Heart of the Creature, and ſo the Words without, and the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47076:54"/>
Word within carry a double Conviction with them. But ſaid Chriſt to the Devil, <hi>it is written;</hi> what then? <hi>therefore muſt the Quakers needs deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be any Means to reſiſt Temptation.</hi> Or rather are they not ſuch Means, when God is pleaſed to uſe them, which I am ſure, no right <hi>Quaker</hi> ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. Beſides, it was Reaſonable that Chriſt ſhould ſo anſwer (ſet that Power aſide which fill'd up thoſe Words, and chained <hi>Satan)</hi> becauſe the Devil uſed Scripture to prevail upon him, as the place proves. However, we deny not, but confeſs, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God is pleaſed to ſpeak by any place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a tempted Soul, the Scripture may be very well acknowledg'd to be a Means by which God ſcatters ſuch Doubts and Diſpondencies, and gives Power over Temptations; and that it may often ſo occur: Yet we would not have People fly to them, as what of themſelves may be ſufficient, but rather have Recourſe to that Divine <hi>Faith,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teſtifie <hi>is able to Quench the fiery Darts, and Overcome the Temptations of this World;</hi> and which <hi>J. Faldo</hi> has largely confeſt, <hi>is to be preferred above the Scriptures themſelves.</hi>

What <hi>William Smith</hi> ſaid, refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not in the leaſt upon the Scriptures, nor yet thoſe Doctrines, which were truly received thence. No ſuch words can be produced by our <hi>Adverſaries:</hi> had <hi>W.

Smith</hi> addreſt himſelf to that <hi>Adulterated Spirit,</hi> which had defiled Nations, that nevertheleſs were under the Profeſſion of God, Scriptures and Religious Worſhip, though in Works they deny'd God; and as concerning Scripture and true Worſhip, groſly err'd, not knowing the Power of God, nor how to Worſhip him in Spirit, and in Truth: not that he ever durſt to entertain ſo Blaſphemous an Apprehenſion of thoſe Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,

or thoſe Doctrines that are truly received thence, as is ſuggeſted by our moſt unfair <hi>Adverſary.</hi> And is it not the height of all Unrighteouſneſs to our Neighbour, that when he condemns the Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit, Knowledge and Worſhip of any People, however profeſſing the Scriptures, and it may be pretending to believe accordingly, as <hi>W.

               <p>§. 3. But he offers another, and the laſt Proof of his Charge from <hi>J. Naylor.</hi> 
                  <q>That of this ſort are they falſe Prophets (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">P. 120.</note> he means) who have their Preaching from Study, and other Men's Mouthes, and not from the Mouth of the Lord.</q> From which he infers, that what we have in the Scriptures, is not from the Mouth of the Lord; and queries: <hi>I would know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>what they will make of the Mouth of the Lord? It was ſaid to</hi> Jeremiah, Jer. 15. 19. Thou ſhalt be as my Mouth.</p>
               <p>Our Meaning is ſtill over-look't by this diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and a quite contrary thing ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47076:56"/>
The natural Purport of the Words can be no more then this: That though the Things decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of in the Scriptures, were the Word of the Lord to the holy <hi>Ancients,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> as God's Mouth (not his Mouth therefore) to the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yea, and much of it the Word of the Lord to us too; yet, for Men to ſay any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by wrote, eſpecially if they add their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Gloſſes, fraim'd from Study to any part of the Scriptures, and cry, <hi>Thus ſayes the Lord;</hi> or <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord; and not in the ſame living Senſe, nor upon the like Commiſſion, every ſuch one doth Rob his Neighbour, and Steal his words:</hi> And He is no more a True Prophet for ſo doing, then a <hi>Parrat</hi> is a <hi>Man,</hi> becauſe he can talk. If then no ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is therefore to be reputed Rational, nor what he ſays, Reaſon, as to him, though ſo in it ſelf, becauſe it proceeds not from the Root and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Reaſon, but by meer Imitation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Prater, in no caſe to be minded: Neither is he a <hi>true Prophet, nor that the Word of the Lord, with reſpect to that Prophet, who has not received what he delivers, from the immediate Word of God himſelf, but by Hear-ſay, or meer Imitation.</hi> No, he is but a very <hi>Babbler,</hi> and begets People no further then into meer Words, and Imaginary Gloſſes, which is the Ground of that Uncertainty that is in the World about Religion.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures then are to us oblieging, as the Things they declare of were the Word of the Lord to ſeveral Ages (Temporal Commands excepted) and they are not without a Mouth; yet they, and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> too, are Inferior to the Mouth of the Eternal Word, which ſpeaks in this Evangelical Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47076:56"/>
the Will of God unto Mankind after a more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and immediate Manner, as was propheſied of old. And I may thus far gratifie our <hi>Adverſary</hi>'s Curioſity about <hi>God's Mouth,</hi> and tell him, that the Word of God, is the Mouth of God; <hi>and the true Prophets and Apoſtles in all Ages have been the Mouth</hi> of the Word of God, and the Scriptures are the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thoſe holy Prophets and Apoſtles, as they were the Mouth of the Eternal Word, revealing God's Will in their Hearts, that they might declare it, whether by Word of Mouth, or Writing to the People: and this is the true Order and Deſcent of things.</p>

bowing to, as indiſpenſible Goſpel-Truths, is to be <hi>reputed nothing below Idolatry it ſelf:</hi> Yet far be it from us to ſay, that to believe the Truth, as declared in the Scriptures, <hi>is Idolatry,</hi> as well as that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Folly in any ſo to ſay or think of us; when not only we are moſt careful and deſirous of rendering what we believe <hi>purely Scriptural;</hi> But I do declare, that as no man can live the Life of the Scriptures without the Operation of that Spirit which gave them forth, ſo to live up to what they do <hi>exhort and declare is the higheſt Pitch of Purity Man's Nature is capable of aiming at, and attaining to.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">P. 128, 139</note> 
                  <hi>Sayings; deny them to be a Rule of Faith and Life, a Judge of Religious Controverſies; take Men off from Reading them; deny the Scripture to be any Means whereby we may come to know God, or Chriſt, or our ſelves; affirm them to be no Means whereby to reſiſt Temptation, and are Dangerous to be read; deny them to be Profitable, but as Experienced; put Scripture and Spirit in Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; affirm the Doctrines, Commands and Holy Examples expreſſed in the Scriptures</hi> (as ſuch) <hi>to be not at all bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us; hold it as the Sin of Idolatry to believe and live according to the Inſtructions and Holy Examples expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in, and by the Scriptures, except we have them by immediate Revelation, as the Apoſtles: They who do all theſe things, mentioned in the fore-going Particulars, Deny the Scriptures.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:47076:59"/>
                  <hi>But the</hi> Quakers <hi>do all theſe things; therefore they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I return this Argument.</p>
               <p>If to Deny the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God;</hi> to make what Writings are given forth by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit relative of the Scriptures; if not to prefer any Writings before the Scriptures, nor equal them to the Scriptures; if to deny the Scriptures to be moſt properly the General Rule of Faith and Life, and Judge of Controverſie, and not the Spirit rather; if not to take Men off from Reading the Scriptures for Inſtruction, &amp;c. if not to Deny them to be any Means, whereby Men may come to know God, Chriſt or our ſelves; if to affirm them to be a Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to reſiſt Temptation; not Dangerous to be read; if to deny them to be read to any profit, without the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, eſpecially by ſuch as know them not, who are in a Rebellious and Unregenerate State; if never to dare to put the Scriptures and Spirit in Oppoſition to each other; if not to affirm the Doctrines, Expreſſions and Holy Examples, as ſuch, not to be binding (Temporary Services ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) if to hold it as no Sin of Idolatry, nor any other, to Believe and Live according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Holy Examples expreſſed in, and by the Scriptures: If to do all theſe things, ſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>be not to deny, contemn and Undervalue, but rather to honour, rightly inſtate and recommend the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; then the</hi> Quakers, <hi>who Believe and Do all this, are not Denyers, but Owners, Aſſerters and Defenders of the Scriptures,</hi> ſo far as they themſelves deſire to be Defended. But we have largely prov'd, that ſo to do, is not to deny them, and that the <hi>Quakers</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:47076:59"/>
ſo hold; therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> are no Denyers, but Maintainers of the True and Divine Authority of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>§. 8. For his Compariſon of us with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (though he has been ſo Cunning, or Unjuſt rather, as to quote their <hi>Authors</hi> and not ours, and ſome paſſages we juſtly doubt) it is Ridiculous, and every way Unworthy of our Notice.

               <p>But we can never allow of the Compariſon, <hi>ſince the</hi> Papiſts <hi>place the Rule and Judgſhip, in a</hi> Pope, <hi>or General Council, and the</hi> Quakers <hi>in the Eternal, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errable, Holy Spirit of God,</hi> and conſequently, our Adverſary is baſely Irreverent to God, that brings the <hi>Pope, or a Council of Fallible Men</hi> upon a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with his Infallible Spirit.

               </p>
               <p>In all which I find no Denial of <hi>Goſpel Ordinances;</hi> Nor were they ſo much as meant by him: His Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is Scriptural; For Chriſt did <hi>blot out the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances,</hi> and he <hi>was to the Saints then, and is to thoſe now, who rightly</hi> believe in him, the End of <hi>all Meats, Drinks, Waſhings, Days, or any other Temporal, Elementary or Figurative Worſhip:</hi> for <hi>J.

               <p>I perceive that unleſs we will allow <hi>J.

and I know he do's his Work. But we are not ſo eaſily to be <hi>overlaid.</hi> We do declare, that while Men have <hi>Bodies,</hi> which are the viſible Parts of Men, and the <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men are converſably concern'd in Religious Worſhip as well as the Soul, <hi>there will be, there muſt be, and there ought to be a Viſible Worſhip;</hi> Therefore moſt falſe is <hi>J.

               </argument>

But hear him.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>They Deny all Miniſtry that hath a mediate Call to that Office;</hi> quoting <hi>J. Parnel's Shield</hi> &amp;c. p. 16. <q>And their Call to the Miniſtry we deny, which is <hi>Mediate.</hi> Alſo <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his <hi>Gr. Myſt.</hi> pag. 45. But who can witneſs an <hi>Immediate</hi> Call from God, and ſpeak as they are moved by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſuch travel from place to place having no certain Dwelling-place, <hi>this Miniſtry we own and witneſs.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Charge againſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> I eſteem ſound, but not <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s againſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi> We do for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reaſons already urg'd, deny that any Man can be <hi>a True Miniſter who is not immediately Call'd;</hi> for it's not, <hi>go ye forth into all the World and preach the Goſpel,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:47076:62"/>
that belongs unto all Men; no more then, becauſe <hi>Princes</hi> ſend <hi>Ambaſſadors to Princes with their Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, therefore every Man ought to do the like in Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without conſidering thoſe neceſſary Qualifications</hi> that belong to ſuch an Action. <hi>Peter, John</hi> &amp;c. were a great while Diſciples, not at <hi>Academies,</hi> but in Chriſt's <hi>School,</hi> which taught <hi>the Mortification of Luſts, and an holy ſelf denying Life;</hi> To ſuch it was that the Commiſſion came, but neither was their Commiſſion of force, till they had received <hi>that Anointing, which was to enable them</hi> to act by it. If then every Holy Man as ſuch, is not fitly <hi>gifted and impowerd</hi> to be a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but that it depends upon a more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and Extraordinary thing; certainly thoſe, who take upon them the Miniſtry, <hi>that have neither learnt by true Mortification to be Holy, nor receiv'd any Power from Heaven to be Miniſters, but explode both as to the preſent Age, and Teach for Hire, and Divine for Money, are not of Chriſt's making, but their own; and therefore to be denied.</hi> And thus much <hi>J. Faldo</hi> to his own <hi>apparent Overthrow</hi> grants us; where <note place="margin">pag. 9.</note> he ſays, <hi>we acknowledge that all True Miniſters of Chriſt ought to have an Immediate Call, ſuch as conſiſts in Grace and Gifts; And ſuch as have not this Immediate Call, we account unworthy of the Thing and Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What more has any <hi>Quaker</hi> ſaid? Why is <hi>James Parnel</hi> quoted to prove that what he charges upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> as to their Denying the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, is a Truth, when it is become no Crime at all in <hi>J. Faldo</hi> to aſſert, <hi>that who are not Immediately call'd are Unworthy both of the Name and Thing? Is he become an Enemy himſelf to that Goſpel-Ordinance?</hi> If <hi>Immediate,</hi> then not <hi>Mediate:</hi> and if not <hi>Mediate, then</hi> J. Parnel <hi>and</hi> G. Fox <hi>writ Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxally;</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:47076:62"/>
conſequently, we are not to be reputed <hi>Denyers of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, becauſe we aſſert that no Man is a Goſpel-Miniſter, who is not Immediately call'd thereto.</hi> So that his Mincing of the Matter in the next page, will no ways qualifie it; viz. <hi>That Motions by the Holy Ghoſt he allows, yet he affirms, that thoſe who are moved by the Commands of the Spirit in the Scripture, are mov'd by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> For if any holy Man reading the Apoſtle's Commiſſion, ſhall at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of Time receive an Heavenly Power to make it his, laying that ſame Injunction upon him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing him with ſuch a Meaſure of that Divine Power, as they received, <hi>We ſhall cheerfully grant him to be truly call'd;</hi> yet not becauſe, <hi>Go ye into all Nations and preach the Goſpel, is there written,</hi> but becauſe <hi>God reſpoke thoſe Words by the ſame Living and Eternal Power immediately to that Particular Perſon, which made, what otherwiſe was but the Commiſſion of the Apoſtles, his Commiſſion alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. But there is a Word or two, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving layn hard upon his Stomach he vomits up thus: <hi>As for having no Certain Dwelling-place,</hi>

                  <hi>and leaving Houſes, Lands and Poſſeſſions, let them repair to</hi> William Penn, <hi>and others of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for an Anſwer to it, who have large Poſſeſſions and brave Habitations, ſuch as few Miniſters as they diſclaim (eſpecially the</hi> POOR NON-CONFOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISTS) <hi>enjoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Anſwer this is to that part of <hi>G. Fox's</hi> Words, which it pretends to refute, is obvious to the meaneſt Capacity that is not prejudic'd; For my part, I know not what induc'd him to any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at all, being Scripture Words, unleſs it were,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47076:63"/>
that he might reflect upon the <hi>Plenty God hath given ſome of us.</hi> What!

Way of God, in which he has believ'd, from whom he received, and to whom he ow's all that he hath.</hi>

               <p>But why <hi>poor Non-Conformiſts,</hi> after all their preacht up <hi>Battles, Spoyls, Plunders, Sacriledges, Decimations? &amp;c.</hi> Rich, and Covetous as ever: As Rich, becauſe <hi>the Baſon walks, and takes its Rounds two to one of which it did;</hi> and Covetous, <hi>becauſe they remain as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, as if they were ſtarving;</hi> witneſs a Late <hi>begging Book</hi> from a <hi>Non-Conformiſt's</hi> hand, <hi>which conjures their Hearers into larger Benevolence,</hi> though by the ſtyle one would think, <hi>it were their juſt Due.</hi> I am perſwaded, their <hi>Preachings, Chriſtnings, Burials, Churchings,</hi> alias, <hi>Lying in Viſits, Exhortations, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and Prayers, have cheated People of more Gold and Silver, then ever they did dare to make the leaſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to</hi> (though they alwayes dar'd to take, what they could get) <hi>in their former Dayes of Power.</hi> But this is nothing to me further, then that it is leſs diſhonourable to <hi>William Penn,</hi> or any other <hi>Quaker,</hi> whom God hath bleſſed with a plentiful Subſiſtence, that having Eſtates, <hi>they notwithſtanding ſhould ſuſtain the Labour, and Suffering of Preaching the Goſpel,</hi> and that at all ſeaſons, then in <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>Strange Impudence, to call this a Proof.

But if ſuch a Thing will be allow'd us, then ſince the Letter or Scriptures <hi>are not by them rejected, but in Shew moſt highly admired, and that they pretend to collect all they believe or know from thence</hi> (though indeed they underſtand them not) we have great Reaſon to ſay, <hi>that thoſe who are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters only from the Letter, with what they imaginarily comment upon it, are not Chriſt's Miniſters.</hi> We are ſo far from making it a Reaſon why we deny your <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> who are under that Qualification, that we utterly deny you to have that Knowledge from the Scripture which we except againſt, but your own Inventions and groundleſs Conceits alone: For though <hi>J. Faldo</hi> thinks it very <hi>Heterodox</hi> to ſay, that unleſs we are immediately aſſured from the Light within of the Truth of what we hold, and that all Belief, not ſo diſcover'd, is a Lye; deriding at <hi>Samuel Fiſher's</hi> Anſwer in that <note place="margin">pag. 14. 15.</note> Caſe, <hi>Thoſe who ſwore, as the Lord lived, ſwore falſly, becauſe they knew him not to Live;</hi> affirming to us, <hi>that they were ſuch as did not believe him to live at all, and therefore</hi> S. Fiſher <hi>erred</hi> (in his Conſtruction) I ſay, though it be ſo, yet we are not forelorn of Reaſon as well as Scripture to our Defence. For
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47076:64"/>
no Truth is ſuch to me, which I either do not know to be true, or have not ſome real Ground to believe to be ſuch, <hi>however true it may be in it ſelf.</hi> And that <hi>Sam. Fiſher</hi> urg'd that Scripture pertinently, and Conſequently his return upon it is impertinent, He himſelf has provided us with an Argument; for if he will not have it, that they therefore lyed, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Lord liveth, becauſe they knew him not to live, we muſt ſee what was the Reaſon that God gave their Aſſeveration the Lye. Sayes <hi>J. Faldo, they did not believe him to live at all.</hi> Very well, then the Narrow of the Difference lyes here, That we ſay, <hi>They knew him not to live; And</hi> J. Faldo ſays, <hi>That they believ'd him not to live.</hi> Now I would fain know which are moſt excuſable? One ſayes, they <hi>who ſaid, as ſure as the Lord liveth, lyed,</hi> becauſe they know not God to live; and the other, <hi>that they believ'd him not to live.</hi> If any thing be to be gotten, it is this; <hi>that they who know him not to live might believe him however to live, whilſt thoſe who believ'd him not live, would not believe a thing they had no Ground or Knowledge inducing them to it.</hi> But he has lead us to a quick Expedient, <hi>They did know God to live; becauſe he that lives, may know from thence that God lives, who holds every Soul in Life that lives.</hi> To which I return, that they did believe God to live, <hi>becauſe they lived; for how could they doubt of his Living, who held them in Life:</hi> But enough of this. To conclude; <hi>A Living Spiritual Miniſtry we own that preaches the Everlaſting Goſpel in its own Power, and that freely, to the Raiſing of People dead in Treſpaſſes and Sin, to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, that they might ſerve the Living Lord God of Heaven and Earth, in the Newneſs of the Spirit, who is worthy of all Honour and Glory forever.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. THe Next Goſpel-Ordinance, he ſays we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is a <hi>Goſpel-Church;</hi> Not to ſpend time about his Way of Phraſing it, though uncooth enough; <hi>We ſhall attend his Proof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And the Church ſo gathered into God, is the Pillar and Ground of <note place="margin">page 16. 17, 18.</note> Truth, where the Spirit alone is Teacher.</q> J. N. <hi>Love to the Loſt,</hi> pag. 17.</p>
               <p>Upon which he argues thus, <hi>The Goſpel-Church is a Church which hath other Teachers, and not the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; whereas the Apoſtles gave themſelves to Preaching of the Word, and Elders were ordained; therefore the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny a Goſpel-Church, and they contradict themſelves, for they have more Teachers then All others.</hi> A Lye to be ſure.</p>
               <p>There is greatly wanting to this <hi>Prieſt</hi> a better Underſtanding, or more Honeſty in uſing what he has; for who is not blinded with Prejudice, may diſcern, that from our ſpeaking of the <hi>Univerſal Church of God,</hi> which ſays the Apoſtle, as well the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47076:65"/>
the Quakers, <hi>is in God;</hi> he infers, <hi>that we deny all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Religious Societies, commonly called by the Ancients the Churches of</hi> Aſia, Theſſalonica, Epheſus, Corinth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from our Aſſerting the Spirit to be the only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Teacher of all who believe, he concludes, <hi>that we deny all Preaching of Men, though by the Spirit.</hi> O blind, or elſe moſt diſingenuous Man! What? Charge that upon us, <hi>which our Practice gives the Lye to every day.</hi> But when we urge this againſt him, and ſuch like <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> then it is not, that he hath Miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented us, <hi>but that we have Contradicted our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to clear the Point, if it can yet be doubtful: We do believe, <hi>there is One, and but One Univerſal Church, the Ground and Pillar of Truth, and that is in God; anchor'd, eſtabliſht and built upon him, the Rock of Ages, and Foundation of many Generations:</hi> and as ſuch, neither is every Viſible Society, making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, nor are all of them together, <hi>that Church;</hi> but ſuch alone, <hi>who are waſhed in the Blood of the Lamb, and ingrafted into the True Vine, bringing forth the Fruits of Holineſs to the Eternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory, and Renown of Chriſt the Head, who is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, God, bleſſed for evermore.</hi> And though there be a Mediate Preaching, which is to ſay, that the Spirit ſpeaks by ſuch whom he hath anointed to preach; yet it cannot be ſtrictly ſaid, that <hi>Man preaches,</hi> or it is <hi>Man's Miniſtry,</hi> but rather, <hi>the Spirit by Man, and that it is the Spirit's Miniſtry, and Man only a Mean, or Inſtrument, through which the Teaching is convey'd,</hi> or <hi>Direction rather to the true Teacher, the Light in the Conſcience:</hi> Not that the Lord doth not ſometimes plentifully teach his Children without any ſuch Means too, who are turned to the Grace in the Heart, and believe and walk in his Holy Light, where
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47076:66"/>
God is to be found, and an Acceſs to this Holy, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Preſence adminiſtred; for he hath both promiſed <hi>it</hi> of old, and perform'd <hi>it</hi> in our Dayes. Thus the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Preachers,</hi> not from Man, nor by Man, but by the Revelation of the Son of God, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Myſteries of God's Everlaſting Kingdom, as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt: And ſo none are exempted; <hi>for all may Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie</hi>

                  <hi>one by one, that the Church may be edified.</hi> Yet I cannot but obſerve, that (1) the Man implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies <hi>that to be a True Church, which is the Ground and Pillar of Truth,</hi> for ſuch the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtyle <hi>a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Church.</hi> (2) That he affirms <hi>the True Church to have other Teachers then the Spirit:</hi> which is to ſay; <hi>that the Primitive Churches were not led, guided and taught by the Spirit of God only, but by ſome other Teachers alſo; contrary to expreſs Scripture, the Promiſe of God, and very End of the bleſſed Goſpel.</hi> If he ſayes that he meant the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that were inſpired; I anſwer, that was never deny'd by us, <hi>becauſe that was the Teaching of the Spirit by them,</hi> which was very little leſs, then if it had been immediately in them: So that one of theſe two things muſt follow from his kind of Arguing; <hi>Either the Apoſtles preacht without the Motions of the Eternal Spirit; Or, Preaching as they were moved of God's Spirit, was their Preaching, and not the Holy Spirit's that ſo plentifully dictated to them what they were to ſay:</hi> But in as much as neither can be reputed true by true Chriſtian Men, I conclude <hi>the Quakers ſound,</hi> and their boaſting <hi>Adverſary Heretical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. But he thinks he hath clearly got the Point of us, about a <hi>Quaker's</hi> telling him, <hi>they knew, that one of the</hi> Dutch <hi>Nation ſpoke by the Spirit in a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47076:66"/>
of ours, though in that Language which was not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Meeting, becauſe they all found Refreſhings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will be faithful in giving his Obſervation upon it: Of the unknown Language he ſayes, <hi>This was orderly according to the Popiſh Maſs, who read Prayers in an Unknown Tongue to the People;</hi> but herein he wrongs us, for though we do acknowledge, that the pure and ſingle Power of the Almighty, may both ſtrike Aſtoniſhment, and give Refreſhment, where the words utter'd are not alwayes underſtood; ſince he doth both frequently without them: and that Underſtanding and Sence are two things; for the <hi>Devil</hi> may ſpeak the beſt words in the Bible, and be an undiſcover'd <hi>Devil</hi> ſtill, except by this Divine Light, Power or Spirit he be inwardly manifeſted; conſequently a right <hi>Sence</hi> may be had, where words may not be underſtood, which is the <hi>One Tongue</hi> to the Children of the Light. Yet we not only decry all deſign'd Obſcurity by Praying and Preaching in unknown Languages, but with the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſay, that we chooſe rather by far to ſpeak in a known Tongue, that the People may underſtand our Words, as well as have a ſence of our Spirits; Nor did ever any <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> yet pretend to be moved to pray in an Unknown Language, whilſt he was Maſter of that which was well known to the People: ſince then we don't affect ſuch Obſcurity, the Caſe of all thoſe <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who pray in <hi>Latin,</hi> rather then in their Native and vulgar Tongue, he is very diſingenuous in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> Reaſon, why they knew that Declaration was from the Spirit of God, viz. <hi>becauſe they found Refreſhings,</hi> he beſtows this Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               </p>
               <p>But what a Paſs, may I rather ſay, hath this Man's implacable Spirit againſt the Truth of God brought him to? who to his Diſhoneſty before, adds Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joyn'd with Scoff and Impudence, when he denies all Refreſhment that comes not by ſound of Words, in a known Tongue, <hi>to be any more Certainty from God's Spirit then the Pleaſure, Children take at</hi> Puppet-Plays, though he could not but think the Perſon that ſpoak to him, <hi>meant by Refreſhings what came from God, &amp; that there can be no Proportion or Compariſon betwixt that Pious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and the Ungodly Sport of</hi> Puppet-Playes. <hi>Ben.

               <p>§. 4. But let me not omit to ſhow the Blow he gives his own Cauſe in this Expreſſion; ſince by the ſame Reaſon that we know no <hi>Refreſhment</hi> to be any more of God, without known Words, then that of a <hi>Puppet-Play; he knows not any more the Teachings of the God above, p. 113. nor the</hi> Motions <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt or Dictates of the Grace of God within 2.

                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:47076:67"/>
The Conſequence of which <hi>Diabolical Compariſon</hi> is nothing leſs, <hi>then to overthrow all inward ſence of God's Preſence, or that Refreſhment which comes from it;</hi> And then indeed, we muſt confeſs, we ſhould be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated either to deny all Teaching, or conclude with this Antichriſtian Prieſt, <hi>That Man's Teaching, or Miniſtry ought to be adhered to.</hi> Where <hi>if Puppet-Playes be meer Imitations of real things,</hi> as I have been credibly told, we know not, <hi>but our Ignorance of an Inward Sence, might render us very fit to judge in favour of the</hi> Prieſt <hi>&amp; his</hi> Puppet-Play-<hi>Doctrine;</hi> till when, we leave Imitating <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>This is ſo far from making againſt us, that it makes for us, at an high rate; For who preaches without that <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm all True Preaching proceeds from, preaches not from the Diſcoveries and Leadings of the Light, and conſequently all ſuch Preaching <hi>is in the Darkneſs,</hi> where God's Counſel cannot be known.

               <p>§. 2.

Conviction of the Truth, of what is outwardly read, or writ in that excellent Book called Scripture. <hi>So that ſtill to Chriſt the True Light, as the Chiefeſt Cauſe</hi> (in which ſenſe he is moſt properly ſo called) <hi>do we rightly aſcribe all the Knowledge we have of God, and his Everlaſting Kingdom.</hi>

                  <p>His Charge of our Denial of <hi>Goſpel-Prayer,</hi> inverted. The Prayer he pleads for, Anti-Goſpel. True Prayer ſtated, aſſerted and defended with Plainneſs from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon.

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>BUt we deny Prayer as well as Preaching,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 23, 24, 26.</note> if he may be credited; and indeed we do ſo by the ſame <hi>Figure,</hi> or contrary Way of Speaking, <hi>that We deny them,</hi> that is, as <hi>John Faldo</hi> owns them; but not that therefore we ſhould deny them at all. His Charge lies in three parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That we Contemn True Goſpel-Prayer;</hi> To prove which he cites <hi>W. Smith's Catechiſm,</hi> p. 107. <q>Though ſome may not ſpeak in ſuch formal compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Words, yet in the ſame Wiſdom their Words are formal; they can ſet their own Time to begin and end; and when they will they can utter Words, and when they will they can be ſilent: and this is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47076:70"/>
the Unclean Part, which offers to God, which he doth not accept.</q> Very well, and what is this to the denying of Goſpel-Prayer? It ſeems then, that what Prayer this Paſſage reflects upon, is Goſpel; conſequently, if I underſtand any thing, <hi>formal, wiſe Words, in Man's Time, and Will, which is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, is Goſpel-Prayer in</hi> J. Faldo's <hi>account;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is utterly falſe to ſay, <hi>That</hi> W. Smith's <hi>Words prove the</hi> Quakers <hi>to contemn Goſpel-Prayer.</hi> But what can be more clear to the View of every Impartial Soul, then that <hi>J Faldo</hi>'s making that Prayer only which he is capable of himſelf, that ſtands in his own <hi>Time, Will, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> to be Goſpel, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to deny it, and ſeek after one more truly Evangelical; <hi>is not ſo much to maintain the Truth, as himſelf.</hi>

               <p>§. 2. Secondly, he ſayes, <hi>That we own no Prayer that is not by immediate Inſpiration and Motion of the Spirit, and without the Uſe of our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                  <hi>and Direction of our Underſtanding:</hi> His third I will add to this, becauſe to the ſame Purpoſe; viz. <hi>That we own no Prayer, but what is by and in the Light Within;</hi> and here he brings 3. or 4. Teſtimonies which are to the ſame purpoſe. I grant what he ſays of us in this particular, <hi>to be our Faith;</hi> and ſhall prove it to be ſound Doctrine from the Scriptures of Truth. <hi>The Worſhip of God is in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in the Truth;</hi> Now unleſs Men <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 24.</note> may perform Goſpel-Worſhip without the Spirit and the Truth, or if in the Spirit and the Truth, <hi>yet not by the Motion of either,</hi> a thing abſurd; it muſt needs be, <hi>that Men ought only to pray or preach by the Motion of the Spirit and of the Truth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:47076:70"/>
If ſuch only are Children of God, who are led by the Spirit of God, and walk in the Light, as Chriſt is Light, and that therein Acceſs alone may be had to God, who is Light, and in whom is no Darkneſs at all; then with good Reaſon may we ſay, <hi>That no Prayer that aſcends to God without the Leading of God's Spirit, and which is not by, and in the Light, can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with him;</hi> conſequently, <hi>Goſpel-Prayer is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Motions of the Spirit of God, and by and in the Light of Chriſt.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p>If no Prophecy or Preaching was to be of old, <hi>but by the immediate Revelation or Motion of the Spirit,</hi> though it was but to Men; of far greater Reaſon, <hi>ſhould not any Prayer be made without a Motion of the ſame Spirit, which is to the Eternal, only Wiſe God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. Nay, the Creature conſidered from under the Leadings of God's Spirit in all Religious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is unable to think a good Thought, much leſs, to perform one good Work; and as the Profeſſors ſay, <hi>from the Crown of the Head to the Soal of the Foot, are altogether unclean;</hi> will it follow then, <hi>that either ſuch corrupt and ſinful Duties are Goſpel-Prayer, and an Ordinance of God:</hi> or elſe, that what we aſſert of Praying by the Motions of the Spirit, and in, and by the Light of Chriſt in our Hearts, <hi>muſt be the only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Worſhip,</hi> which we are yet further inclined to believe.</p>
               <p>For it is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>that the Word and Prayer ſanctifieth all things:</hi> Now if we take this <hi>Word</hi> in our ſenſe, to wit, <hi>the Word of God;</hi> then we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether the <hi>Word</hi> derives its Sanctifying Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from the <hi>Prayer,</hi> or the <hi>Prayer</hi> from this <hi>Word?</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:47076:71"/>
Not the former to be ſure; If then it be allowed to be the latter, ſince this Prayer (which to be ſure is Goſpel, or the Apoſtle would not have owned it) <hi>hath a Sanctifying Vertue in it;</hi> &amp; that no Prayer begun or carried on by meer Man, can ſanctifie, becauſe we are of our ſelves unable to <hi>think one good Thought,</hi> it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, <hi>That this Word of God, which gives Pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er that Sanctifying Power, doth begin or move firſt to that Sanctifying, Acceptable, Truly Goſpel-Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. But now ſuppoſe by <hi>Word</hi> is meant the Words, either of Scripture, or Preachings, yet are we ſafe; For, ſince nothing can sanctifie, but it muſt be from it ſelf, or ſomething elſe, and that meer Man in Preaching or Praying cannot; and that God is that alone Power, Wiſdom and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit that is able to ſanctifie; it will follow alſo, <hi>that God's Spirit or Power moving in the Heart is that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone which renders the Words or Prayers of any ſanctifying.</hi> Nor is this all: The Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> is a notable Figure of the Matter in hand: where the Certainty of being cured upon ſtepping into the <hi>Pool</hi> ſo ſoon as ever the <hi>Angel</hi> had moved the Waters, doth very lively repreſent to us, that <hi>what Benefit we may ever expect to receive from the Lord, comes not from an haſty Ruſhing into any Religious Performance in our own time, but our patient Waiting, till the Lord's holy Angel ſtirs and moves the Waters, and then to lay all aſide to imbrace ſo bleſſed an Opportunity.</hi> Further,</p>
               <p>§. 5. The Goſpel-State is an <hi>Eternal Sabbath.</hi> He that prayes in his own <hi>Will, Time, Wiſdom, Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is picking Sticks, and kindling a Fire, and compaſſing

himſelf about with the Sparks of the Fire of his own kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> This Man hath not <hi>Ceaſt from his own Works,</hi> he will ſuffer loſs in the Day of God, and his Bed will be made in Sorrow.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Nor is this the utmoſt of our Force; For whatever God hath not required, juſt will it be with him to ſay, <hi>who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> 'Tis true, God loves that his People ſhould pray, and Chriſt injoyns it; <hi>but he alſo bids all Watch unto Prayer;</hi> that is, <hi>wait to feel that Spirit of Life to ſtir which gives Life to Prayer, the Key of</hi> David, <hi>by which Heaven's Door is opened, and the Soul comes to receive True and Heavenly Refreſhment.</hi> The Want of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſo much Complaint among ſome, <hi>that their Duties are Unholy Things, they want Power, they have prayed long, but to little purpoſe;</hi> whereas had they pray'd aright, that had never been. Much more might be said to this, but my Conſcience is clear in the Matter, and I ſhall conclude this Point with a general Confeſſion and Caution.</p>
               <p>§. 7. We do acknowledge, <hi>That God is; That he ought to be worſhipped; That Worshipping of God is ſtricktly a bowing down before him, in Fear and Holy Reverence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he makes himſelf known to the Creature. That Prayer is a Goſpel-Ordinance; That it is not only Good, but Neceſſary to be uſed; That God only can give us to pray aright, as well to pray at all; That therefore his Aſſiſtance is neceſſary;</hi> to have which, there ought to be <hi>a Waiting out of all Conceivings, Inventions, or Forms, to receive a Living Touch, and Sence from his Pure Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Eternal Spirit, whereby to ſet our Spirits at work.

                  <p>His Charge of our Denial of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> introduc'd with a Diſcourſe of poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Deſtructive of the Foundation of Religion.

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. I am now come to the two laſt Particulars of this Charge, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which he introduceth with a ſhort Diſcourſe of the Nature of God's Commands, reſpecting <hi>Goſpel-Ordinances,</hi> which he ſayes, we deny. I ſhall onely take notice of this Paſſage, where he tells us, <hi>that the Ordinances, hitherto conſider'd, are called</hi> Moral, <hi>from their natural Obligation,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">pag. 33. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>although reſpecting the Subſtance, they deſerve a more</hi> EVANGELICAL <hi>Denomination, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot</hi> (ſays he) <hi>call them</hi> CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN ORDINANCES. <hi>But theſe two I come now to conſider, are purely poſitive, and depend meerly upon divinely reveal'd Inſtitution, and God has ſo expreſs'd his Jealouſie over this Right of his, that when Sins not onely againſt natural Light, but ſuperadded Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to confirm and ſtrengthen its Doubtfulneſs and Decays, have been paſſed by without any ſpecial Expreſſions of his Provocation; Sins committed againſt his poſitive Laws
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47076:74"/>
(as</hi> CIRCUMCISION, and all Ceremonial Laws, as well as <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and what is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally call'd the <hi>Lord's Supper)</hi> have been avenged with a high Hand.</p>
               <p>To all I return theſe ſhort Heads of Matter. Firſt, that a <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> grounded <hi>Internally</hi> upon the Grace and Gifts of God; <hi>externally</hi> upon the Scriptures of Truth; A <hi>well order'd Church,</hi> conſiſting of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Members; <hi>Preaching, Praying, and that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally too</hi> (by him call'd <hi>Chriſtian-Ordinances)</hi> are by him made <hi>Natural to all Nations,</hi> antecedent to Chriſt's outward Coming, and conſequently, there was the <hi>Thing Chriſtianity,</hi> before the <hi>Name Chriſtianity:</hi> which pleads our Cauſe againſt his firſt Chapter; and a groſs <hi>Self-Contradiction.</hi> Next, that thoſe he calls <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ordinances,</hi> and of Univerſal Obligation, are far more <hi>Subſtantial and Neceſſary to Salvation, then thoſe two of Water-Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper,</hi> upon which he more peculiarly beſtows the Title of <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> ſince no Man can ever be ſaved without the one, I mean thoſe <hi>Natural Ordinances,</hi> as he calls them; <hi>and any Man may be certainly ſaved without the other,</hi> that he ſo peculiarly calls <hi>Chriſtian-Ordinances;</hi> which how Unreaſonable, and Prepoſterous it is, let the <hi>Impartial</hi> Judge.</p>
               <p>Yet again, his great Ignorance, and Abuſe of God, and true Religion appears in this, that not only he himſelf egregiouſly errs in ſuch a Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but confidently affirms <hi>God to be more concernd to vindicate the former, and take Vengeance for the Breach of his poſitive and exterior Precepts,</hi> as the <hi>Ceremonial part of the Jews Worſhip, and the Bread, Wine, and Water</hi> Sacramentally us'd now a days (if yet as ſuch, they may be accounted Precepts) which the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47076:74"/>
can creep into the Profeſſion of, and cannot cleanſe as concerning the Conſcience, <hi>then of his fundamental natural and ſubſtantial Laws and Ordinances, without which God cannot be worſhipped, nor one Soul ſaved;</hi> in plain <hi>Contradiction</hi> to that notable Paſſage of the Prophet, <hi>Bring no more Vain Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Incenſe is Abomination unto me, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi>

                  <hi>the Calling of Aſſemblies I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with, it is Iniquity, even the Solemn Meeting. And when you ſpread forth your Hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea when ye make</hi> (or multiply) <hi>many Prayers, I will not hear; your Hands are ful of Blood:</hi> WASH YE, MAKE YOU CLEAN, PUT AWAY THE E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIL OF YOUR DOINGS FROM BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE MINE EYES; CEASE TO DO EVIL, LEARN TO DO WELL, SEEK JUDGMENT, RELIEVE THE OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESSED, JUDGE THE FATHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS, PLEAD FOR THE WIDDOW; Where the Caſe is determin'd againſt him. For here we have an Account of their <hi>Exactneſs in many Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremonial Laws, ſtanding in figurative things,</hi> and a moſt ſevere Reproof of them, <hi>for their great Degeneracy &amp; Corruption, as to their Morals, or Rebellion againſt God's Natural Ordinances,</hi> as <hi>J. Faldo</hi> calls them.</p>
               <p>God himſelf brings the natural and poſitive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances (as by this <hi>Prieſt</hi> diſtinguiſht) into the Scales, <hi>&amp; gives the weight againſt the latter.</hi> Let him ſhow us when ever there was a Man waſht and clean'd that was reprov'd for omitting any of thoſe poſitive and Ceremonial Laws, <hi>as I have produc'd a plain. Scripture, that expreſſes God's Deteſtation and Abhorrence of thoſe of his Elected Nation the</hi> Jews, <hi>that erred from the Eternal
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47076:75"/>
Law of Righteouſneſs writ in the Hearts of the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, though they were never ſo punctually as to their Obſervance of outward Inſtitutions;</hi> and he will do ſomething: otherwiſe, as it is manifeſt, what a Kind of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> this Man would make, that any <hi>Celſus</hi> or <hi>Porphyry</hi> would blow away with a breath; ſo it is moſt clear, <hi>that God lays a far greater Streſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mens walking up to thoſe Immutable Ordinances</hi> (by our <hi>Adverſary</hi> called Natural, which we can accept of, as being proper to Mankind) <hi>then thoſe Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Shaddowy Services that muſt vaniſh upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearence of the Subſtance it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Laſtly, It is no leſs then <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,</hi> and an evident Contradiction to himſelf, to assert, <hi>That the Light he grants thoſe Immutable Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to reſult from, may be doubtful, or decay, reſpecting it ſelf:</hi> since it were to ſay, <hi>That God the Fountain of that Rivelet of Light, from whence thoſe excellent Streams come, is Doubtful, and lyable to Decay;</hi> for whatever is naturally incident to any meaſure of Light; <hi>is ſo to the whole:</hi> Nay, it is to affirm, <hi>that from a doubtful and decayable Light may and doth iſſue forth Clear, Divine and Eternal Precepts of Righteouſneſs.</hi> I would not have <hi>J. Faldo</hi> lay the Blame of his own Doubts or Decays upon the Light; but upon his own Rebellion againſt it. He has too too largely vilified that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Manifeſtation, to receive much Benefit by it. But O the Injuſtice of Men, <hi>that impute all of Incapacity to ſee, which is truly from themſelves, to the Light With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> which yet they refuſe to be ruled by! Let the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Reader</hi> be ſeriouſly warned, that he believes in no ſuch Peſtiferous Doctrine, which in ſhort, tends to no more nor leſs, <hi>then an Exalting and Preferring the Exterior Coat, or Shell of Religion</hi> (and that moſt of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47076:75"/>
their own making too) <hi>above and beyond that Eternal Light, which is the Law of God in the Heart, that leads to perform our Duty uprightly both to God and Man.</hi> For I had rather be <hi>Moral Socrates</hi> in the Day of God's terrible Judgment, then <hi>Out-ſide-Chriſtian</hi> J. Faldo, <hi>with all his Jeer and Enmity againſt Chriſt's Light within.</hi> But let's hear what he ſayes to theſe <hi>Chriſtian-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> in particular, though we have no Reaſon to expect much to his own Purpoſe, whatever he may ſay for ours, when we conſider, how ſhamefully he has introduced them.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>I ſhall begin with</hi> Water-Baptiſm, <hi>it being the firſt in order of the two, both in its Inſtitution and Practice; which the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny (in theſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>words)</hi> 
                  <q>Baptiſm we own, which is the Baptiſm of Chriſt with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire; but we deny all others. <hi>J. Parnel's Shield of Truth,</hi> pag. 11.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which I ſay, that we have great Reaſon ſo to do; for firſt. Chriſt never was <hi>Adminiſtrator of Water-Baptiſm, but that of Fire and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Water-Baptiſm was <hi>John</hi>'s, the Fore-runner, figuratively, and uſed to that Preparation, neceſſary to receive the viſible Coming of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> were the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> now viſibly to come, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> alive, it would be Indiſputable: But that Time being paſt, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John</hi>'s Viſible Adminiſtration, which is over, and not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s; and laſtly, that the Fore-runner is not to continue, but give way to Him, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, that was ſo fore run, which was Chriſt, and his Baptiſm; we do conclude, that there is no ſuch <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as <hi>J. Faldo</hi> charges us with the Denial of, that can plead any Continuance in the <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47076:76"/>
Church:</hi> Which <hi>John</hi> himſelf was not unſenſible of, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall Decreaſe, but he will Increaſe;</hi> and who (like the Morning Star) accordingly Decreaſt, and became Ecclipſt by the Encreaſe of the Brighter Glory of Chriſt, who was and is Lord of all.</p>
               <p>§. 3. If any ſhould ſay, that it is not meant of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but a new Water-Baptiſm inſtituted by Chriſt, becauſe of thoſe onely Words on which they ground their Commiſſion, <hi>Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c. J. Faldo</hi> anſwers for me, that it is a Miſtake; <hi>He means not another Water-Baptiſm from John's,</hi> when he tells us, <hi>that the Water-Baptiſm (which he calls the</hi> Chriſtian-<hi>Ordinance,</hi> and renders the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> a ſort of <hi>Heathens</hi> for denying) <hi>is that Baptiſm which was in point of Order and Inſtitution, before the Bread and Wine were inſtituted:</hi> which how well ſoever it may ſquare with the <hi>Epiſcopalians, Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> Notion of Baptiſm, (whom he ſays, he has no further concern'd in his Book, then vindicated) and his own date of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from Chriſt's Resurrection, it is manifeſt; firſt, <hi>That no Commiſſion was given by Chriſt, before he broke Bread with his Diſciples; Conſequently he muſt intend</hi> John'<hi>s onely:</hi> And next, <hi>That</hi> John'<hi>s Commiſſion it ſelf is not extant; mu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From whence nothing can be clearer, then firſt, that the Baptiſm mention'd in, <hi>Go, teach all Nations, Baptizizing them, &amp;c.</hi> was not the <hi>Baptiſm of</hi> John; but the <hi>Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> call'd, <hi>the Promiſe of the Father,</hi> which they were to wait for, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Luke,</hi> both in the 24th Chapter of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Chriſt, and the firſt Chapter of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Nay, leſt it ſhould be thought, that he meant of another <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> as ſome vainly imagine; to help their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and prevent all ſuch Miſtake, he diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, <hi>not betwixt</hi> John'<hi>s Water-Baptiſm, and his own, but betwixt Any Water-Baptiſm at all, and his own Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Holy Ghoſt.

                  <hi>was an Ordinance: and that he baptiz'd ſo few, was but provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, not deſigned; and the Reaſon why it was not laid upon the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>was becauſe his Call was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and out of due time.</hi>

viz. <hi>He was called extraordinarily, and out of due time.</hi> But as they were all extraordinarily called, or elſe the <hi>Prieſt</hi> contradicts himſelf, ſo if we may believe the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> he was Inferior to none of them; If not in his Works, I know no Reaſon, why he ſhould be reputed ſo in his <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> That his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was of God is granted on all hands; And if it pleaſed God to make it none of <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> we would be glad to ſee any of our time produce one more large, and effectual; till when, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with no more Extent in the Point, then God pleaſed to give his <hi>great Apoſtle:</hi> and believe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>J.

               <p>
                  <hi>I muſt tell him by the way, that he tells an Untruth wilfully.

               <p>I perceive the Man thinks he can turn <hi>Quaker</hi> much at the rate he can <hi>Pray,</hi> I mean, when he will;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47076:78"/>
but I will tell him ſo much, that it is as hard a Task for him to turn <hi>True Quaker,</hi> as to be a true primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a thing moſt difficult to be ſure.</p>
               <p>But to his Quibble about <hi>But,</hi> that <hi>J.

Now if there is <hi>but One</hi> Lord, &amp; <hi>One</hi> Faith, as it is to be ſuppoſed, <hi>J.

§. 2. <hi>But the</hi> Quakers <hi>main Objection,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is, that Chriſt is come in Spirit to them, and his Diſciples were to do it in Remembrance of him till he came; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Precept doth not binde them. J.

               </p>
               <p>That I may briefly and fully reply, be pleas'd to obſerve (1) That we don't deny Bread and Wine to have been given, and that by Command of Chriſt to his Diſciples. (2) That it was a Sign to them of that Life he would give for the World, and which at that time they were weak in the Knowledge of (3) We believe the Life moſt eminently meant, and which they were to do it in the Remembrance of, was that Fleſh and Blood that in the 6. of <hi>John</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Who did not eat nor drink thereof,</hi>

                  <hi>ſhould have no Life in them;</hi> and which, 5. verſes after, <hi>he calls the Bread that came down from Heaven.</hi> (4) 'Tis our Faith, that this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Bread and Wine, and Fleſh and Blood,</hi> which ſuch were to eat of, that would have Life Eternal, for which he came (and of which the Diſciples themſelves were then ſo ignorant) was <hi>the Thing ſignified by the Sign Chriſt gave</hi> his Diſciples.

(7) That the <hi>Practice</hi> of it after the Pouring forth of the Spirit, is not, neither can it be, any Inſtitution, or ſo much as a Continuance of it upon an Inſtitution, <hi>any more then the Apoſtles forbearing ſeveral things lawful in themſelves, that were upon the Command of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Ceremonial Law forbidden; The Circumciſion of many</hi> Gentiles; <hi>and above all, the Apoſtle</hi> Paul's <hi>Purifying of himſelf at the Temple of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>after he had been near thirty years a Chriſtian, or Goſpel-Preacher, and conſequently a Thrower-down and Demoliſher both of the Temple, and all its Ceremonial Worſhip.</hi> (8) That every one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and were in ſome meaſure turned to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and were accounted Members of the ſeveral Churches becauſe of ſuch Profeſſion, <hi>did not preſently come to know Chriſt after the Spirit, or diſcern his ſpiritual Manifeſtation, and whilſt they were as yet Weak and Carnal in their Conceptions of Chriſt, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, and accounting of him but after the Fleſh</hi> (a Knowledg of him, the Apoſtle himſelf confeſſeth once but to have had) <hi>the Outward Bread and Wine might be ſuitable to that ſort of Belief, and a Sign ſhowing forth a more Spiritual, Internal Bread and Cup,</hi> which the

(9) It ought not to ſtumble any, that it ſhould laſt <hi>to that Day</hi> and yet be laid aſide <hi>Now;</hi> For, <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> when once <hi>introduc'd and receiv'd, are not eaſy to be relinquiſh't or left off;</hi> and it having been the <hi>Token</hi> Chriſt gave to his Diſciples in the time of their great Weakneſs, Fear and Unbelief concerning him, it was quickly embrac'd and imitated, by ſuch as believ'd, eſpecially <hi>Jews,</hi> who juſt coming out of a Multitude of <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Services,</hi> were ready to make part of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſt therein: But as ſuch came to grow into the true <hi>Jews</hi> State, they ſaw beyond all Exteriour Signs and Services, <hi>And that nothing which could be taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or handl'd, and that periſht with the Uſing, and that could never clenſe the Conſcience from dead Works but were the Shaddows only of Chriſt the Living Eternal Subſtance and Bread of Life, could be a ſtanding Ordinance of the Everlaſting Goſpel.</hi>

Burroughs</hi>'s <hi>Trump.</hi> p. 17.</q> Which <hi>J. Faldo</hi> wickedly conſtrues thus; <hi>This he ſaith by way of Reproach againſt all that act Faith on, and receive Comfort from the Bleſſed Effects of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Sufferings by him wrought and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when he was in the World:</hi> Whereas in Honeſty and Truth (which <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſhews himſelf wholy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with) he meant no more, <hi>then their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Admiration of, and the Regard to what Chriſt did without, whilſt they neglected, undervalued and decry'd for Blaſphemy and</hi> Euthuſiaſm <hi>the Appearance, Work
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47076:83"/>
and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt within.</hi> But he thinks, we have miſtaken him, and that he is better armed for us, then we are aware of: <hi>What Righteouſneſs Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without me, was not my Juſtification, neither was I ſaved by it: R. Farnſworth</hi> he quotes for <hi>Author,</hi> but no <hi>Book;</hi> which is very unfair. However, this may be ſaid in Defence of <hi>R. F.</hi> that what gives daily Acceſs and Acceptance to, and with the Lord, is that Preparation of Clean, and Righteous Adornment the Soul actually receives from Chriſt, who is the Lord her Righteouſneſs. And take Juſtification in this ſenſe, and not for Remiſſion, in which he meant it, if ever he ſaid it, and we do all own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame, and let our <hi>Adverſary</hi> do his worſt: Only I deſire him to tell us the <hi>Book</hi> next time, which affords that Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But <hi>I. Pennington,</hi> he thinks, he has made his own. <hi>Can Outward Blood clenſe the Conſcience? Can Outward Water waſh the Soul clean?</hi> Queſt. p. 25. I beſeech you that read me, hear his comment, <hi>A plain Denial of the Efficacy of the Blood of Chriſt ſhed on the Croſs to clenſe the Soul from the Guilt of Sin, by its Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have had to do with many Enemies to God's Truth; But I muſt profeſs to the whole World, I never yet ſaw, ſpoak to, or read of a more diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Man: <hi>To pervert our Words, alter Sentences, draw Generals from Particulars, and then call them Ours is Baſe and Unmanly.</hi> I would fain have an impartial Man anſw<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r me. Doth <hi>I. P.</hi> deny, or any way meddle with the <hi>Outward Blood</hi> concerning the Guilt of Sin paſt, how far it had an Influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juſtification, <hi>taking Juſtification in that Senſe?</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:47076:83"/>
But does he not treat of the Outward Blood, with reſpect to <hi>Purgation and Sanctification of the Soul from the preſent Acts and Habits of Sin, that lodge therein?</hi> Is he ſo Sottiſh, as to make no Diſtinction betwixt being pardon'd Sin paſt, and the Ground of it; and being renewed and regenerated in Mind and Spirit, and the Ground of that Conversion? or elſe is he ſo impiouſly Unjuſt, that becauſe we do deny, that Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blood can be brought into the Conſcience to perform that Inward Work (which they themſelves dare not, nay, do not hold) <hi>Therefore</hi> I. Pennington, <hi>denys any Efficacy to be in that Outward Offering and Blood towards Juſtification,</hi> as it reſpects meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of former Sins, and Iniquities? This may give the Sober-minded ſome Reliſh of his Rancker: We do ſay, that Outward Blood can no more clenſe, then Outward Water; But we alſo ſay, <hi>that Chriſt's Blood had an Influence into Juſtification (as he phraſeth it)</hi> which I ſhall preſently ſhow.</p>
               <p>§. 3. He undertakes the Defence, of what he falſly ſays we deny, but ſo confuſedly, as ought to ſhame a modeſt Man, and a Pretender to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy.</p>
               <p>His firſt Scripture is this. <hi>And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 50, 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them, that believe, though they be not circumciſed, that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs might be imputed to them.</hi> Rom. 4. 11. His Obſervation and Inference run thus, <hi>that Imputation is a Reckoning that to any, which they have not from them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, nor actually from another, otherwiſe it could not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47076:84"/>
be Grace, therefore it was the Righteouſneſs of another, not his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſo baſe a Pervertion and Miſ-uſing of the Word, that <hi>Imputation</hi> both in Scripture, and Common Diſcourſe is always taken and uſed in the contrary ſenſe; Let him produce me one Scripture that countenanceth his Notion. This imputed Righteouſneſs is beſt underſtood by the Context: <hi>Even as</hi> David <hi>alſo deſcribeth the Bleſſedneſs of the Man unto whom God imputes Righteouſneſs without Works,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they, whoſe Iniquitys are forgiven, and whoſe Sins are covered; Bleſſed is the Man, unto whom the Lord will not impute Sin. Cometh this Bleſſedneſs then upon the Circumciſion only, or Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion alſo?</hi> for we ſay, <hi>that Faith was reckoned to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>for Righteouſneſs. How was it then reckoned? when he was in Circumciſion, or Uncircumciſion? And he received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Faith, which he had yet being Uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe, though they be not Circumciſed;</hi> that Righteouſneſs might be imputed unto them alſo. verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>In which we may perceive, <hi>Firſt</hi> that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inferr'd from <hi>David</hi>'s Words of the Bleſſedneſs of that Man, <hi>unto whom God imputed not Sin.</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, <hi>whom God forgives, he imputes not Sin to;</hi> and to whom he imputes not Sin, <hi>ſuch he lookes upon as Righteous,</hi> that is, <hi>to be as clear of the Guilt of former Sin by Remiſſion, as if it had never been committed. Secondly;</hi> that not Works of our own, no, though aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit to perform them, ſtricktly conſider'd, can juſtifie in this ſenſe, <hi>but Faith only in the Goodneſs,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47076:84"/>
Mercy and Promiſe of God to Pardon, Remit, and ſhow Favour unto all ſuch, who Diſtrusting their own Weakneſs, and Repenting of their former Miſcarriages, humbly, yet firmly put their Confidence in him.</hi> This being <hi>Abraham's</hi> Caſe with reſpect to himſelf and Poſterity; God no more lookt upon him as a Stranger at a diſtance from him, but one, who by Faith was brought nigh, and became thus juſtified not by Works of Righteouſneſs that he wrought, <hi>but by Faith in God,</hi> which was accounted unto him for Righteouſneſs, and that really too; ſince he could not believe without an Inward Act of Righteouſneſs: but not of his own.</p>
               <p>§. 4. In ſhort, <hi>Juſtification</hi> bears a twofold ſenſe in the Scripture; and becauſe we are frequently miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken about it by ſuch as underſtand not the Extent and Uſe of the Word, I will explain it. <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is ſometimes to be underſtood of <hi>Remiſſion, or non-Imputation of Sin upon Repentance, and Faith in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God.</hi> In which ſenſe we ſay, That all the righteous Works Man is capable of, either from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if ſuch can be; or from the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit ſtricktly as ſuch, can never move one Jot to Juſtification, that is, <hi>to the Blotting out of former Iniquities;</hi> for if Men could do more a thouſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold then they do, and that it were never ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, <hi>it is but their preſent Duty, and cannot have Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue enough in it to anſwer a preſent Obligation, and cancel the old Debt of Diſobedience</hi> too: God only upon Faith in his Goodneſs, Mercy and Holy Promiſe can give <hi>Remiſſion, Pardon, or make free from the heavy Debt Transgreſſion hath brought upon us;</hi> and that not as thereby meriting, but as obtaining ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47076:85"/>
from God, upon his own free tender. This is Evangelical Faith, and Righteouſneſs too, of which <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Partaker, as well before as after Circumciſion, that he might be the Father of all.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But <hi>Juſtification</hi> is not only taken for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of former Sins, and Accounting of Believers, as if they had never tranſgreſt,</hi> that is, <hi>Righteous;</hi> but for that <hi>Regenerate</hi> and <hi>Clean State of Soul, and that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to, and Acceptance with God reſpecting Daily Duty;</hi> In which ſenſe <hi>no Man, nor Woman ever was, or ever will be Juſtified another way, then by Inward and Real Righteouſneſs:</hi> Nor in this ſenſe can any be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Juſtified,</hi> and <hi>Accepted,</hi> then as they are thus <hi>purified</hi> and <hi>regenerated;</hi> Since it could be to ſay, not only that God upon Repentance of former Sins and Belief in his Promiſe has blotted out their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which may be, <hi>whilſt habitual Sin is yet but a working out, and not quite overcome;</hi> for that is true enough: but <hi>that God accepts ſuch as purified, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and regenerated</hi> (the other ſenſe of Juſtification) <hi>while they are actually Impure, and Unregenerated;</hi> this we abominate, and then which nothing can be affirm'd more Reproachfull to, and Deſtructive of his Eternal Holineſs.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Having thus explained and expreſt what we underſtand by the Word <hi>Juſtification,</hi> I ſhall declare, How far we believe <hi>Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> reſpecting his Coming both in the Fleſh, and Spirit, influenceth into our Juſtification (as the <hi>Prieſt</hi> terms it) The <hi>Seed,</hi> afterwards call'd <hi>Chriſt, was and is God's free Gift, Promiſe, and Covenant of Light,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47076:85"/>
by whom alone, Remiſſion, Juſtification, and Eternal Salvation did or can come to Mankind; That in the Fulneſs of time a Body was prepared, in which he came to fulfill the Fathers good Pleaſure; that he preacht the Promiſe of Remiſſion of Sin, and Salvation to as many as believed in him, and took up his Croſs and followed him; confirming the ſame by many Miracles.</hi> For this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Redemption, and aſſerting himſelf to be the Off-ſpring of God, one with God, to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth was committed, <hi>the</hi> Jews <hi>perſecuted him, ſtigmatizing him with the Name of Blaſphemer, and at laſt apprehended and crucified him.</hi> We do ſay then, <hi>that Faith in the ſame Chriſt who then appeared, who ſo preached, worked Miracles, and lay'd down his Life for the World, and not in another, does give Remiſſion of Sins; and as follow'd, as become all true Diſciples, Eternal Salvation:</hi> yea, <hi>that Outward Blood was then, and is now to be reverently believed in as a Seal, Ratification and ſtrong Confirmation of that glad Tidings of Remiſſion of Sin, and Eternal Salvation, which he held forth in the Name of his Father, to thoſe who would take up the Croſs and follow him.</hi> And therefore with good reaſon was Remiſſion of Sins preached in his <hi>Blood,</hi> becauſe it was the moſt viſible eminent Act of his Life, both fitteſt to recommend his great Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for poor Man, and confirm the Truth of that bleſſed Goſpel he preached to him in the World.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And as for <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> Though we deny any ſtrickt and rigid Purchaſe, as carnally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and irreverently held by many; yet that the Offering up his Innocent Life did and doth turn to Account to as many as truly receive him, we faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully believe; yea, that he did bear that for Man.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47076:86"/>
(I mean his Iniquity) <hi>he could not for himſelf;</hi> And has by that Suffering obtained precious Gifts, that is, that Victory Man could never have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; yet ſtill we do aſcribe all that was done, but inſtrumentally to the bodily Sufferings, and principally to the <hi>Will</hi> of that Divine Life, whoſe <hi>Body</hi> it was, which offered <hi>it</hi> up, and by the which <hi>Will it was Sanctified,</hi> and ſo acceptable with God: Otherwiſe more, nay all would be aſcrib'd to the Body, which I affirm to be Blaſphemy it ſelf; for it was not the Body eminently, which ſaved the People from the<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r Sins; but that which dwelt in <hi>it,</hi> whoſe it was; ſo that though the <hi>Body bore the Name of the Whole, yet was it not the Whole;</hi> but by <hi>Syneedoche,</hi> a part for the whole, which is very familiar in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>§. 8. To his Spiritual Coming into the Soul do we aſcribe the <hi>Inward Righteouſneſs.</hi> We ſay, <hi>That Chriſt as he is the Light, Power and Righteouſneſs of God, being received into the Soul, and diligently obey'd, and communed with, he doth firſt Convince of Sin; then brings Trouble for Sin; and Sin thus becoming a Load to the Soul, he adminiſters Strength to ſhake off every ſuch Load and Burthen, and to conquer and ſubdue the Power of Sin and Satan in the Soul:</hi> In which ſenſe he is more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly <hi>a Saviour, when he binds the ſtrong Man, ſpoils his Goods, caſts him out, deſtroys the Works of the Devil, finiſhes Tranſgreſſion, and brings in Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs;</hi> Otherwiſe, in vain would he have that Title, <hi>And thou ſhalt call his Name</hi> Jeſus, <hi>for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins;</hi> not the <hi>Effect, Eternal Death,</hi> without the <hi>Cause, Sin:</hi> For the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Sin is Death; As men ſow, ſo ſhall they reap.</hi> And
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47076:86"/>
a dreadfull Diſappointment will it be to the <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Profeſſors</hi> of this day, that dream of <hi>Juſtification, Redemption</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and are yet carried away with the Temptations of <hi>Satan,</hi> at his will; being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the inward Power of Chriſt to bruiſe the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Head. To conclude, that Righteouſneſs which Chriſt as God's true Light, Power and Righteouſneſs works in us (therefore is not of us) is that <hi>which alone brings into true Union with God, and Memberſhip with his Unſpotted Church;</hi> conſequently, <hi>no Man without that Qualification, can be ſo accepted with him, or have Acceſs to him: for God is of purer Eyes then to behold Iniquity; and without Holineſs no Man ſhall ever ſee the Lord.</hi> But let none miſtake me, I do not intend, that who is not quite Perfect, is altogether to be condemned; by no means: but that Man is only ſo far accepted of God, <hi>as he is really Regenerated and Beautified by the internal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe is that other Scripture, he quotes againſt us; <hi>That as Sin has reigned unto Death, even ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſneſs unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> For all Men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving actually ſinned, and Sin ſo becoming inherent; Grace (that teacheth to deny all Ungodlineſs, and Worldly Luſts, and to live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly, which is that Righteouſneſs) ſhould alſo reign in all by Jeſus Chriſt. Now unleſs it be an Evil for us to ſay, that Men are accepted with God upon Chriſt's <hi>Inward Righteouſneſs,</hi> when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay, that the Reign of Grace through Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs (where Sin reigned, which was within Man certainly, and therefore <hi>Inward)</hi> is unto Eternal Life (as full a word, as being accepted with God) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, <hi>but in our holding forth Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47076:87"/>
be made ours by the Operation of his Holy Spirit in the Heart, as the Efficient or Principal, if not only Cauſe of our daily Acceptance with God, we are Scripturally Orthodox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. We would alſo provide againſt the Malice of thoſe Tongues, who, becauſe we do allow Good Works or Fruits to be well-pleaſing to God, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Life Eternal, do therefore rank us among the <hi>Papiſts, as pleading for the Merit of Good Works:</hi> For we lay not this <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and much leſs the <hi>firſt,</hi> upon any Exteriour Works, that the very Spirit of Truth himſelf leads into, <hi>as meerly Exteriour,</hi> be they Acts of <hi>Juſtice, Mercy, Charity,</hi> or ſuch like; But upon the holy Working of God's Power and Spirit in the Heart, and the Creatures believing in, and reſigning himſelf up unto God, to be by him renewed, ordered, led, and diſpoſed: So that the Creature has no further Share, then as he bows to the Requirings of God, and contentedly acquieſceth, in what it pleaſeth Almighty God to do with him. So our Wills there daily ſubmitted to the Holy Will of God, which is Sanctification, is the Ground of our daily Acceptance with God, and being received (not as juſt by the <hi>Non-Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Sins formerly committed, for that alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Repentance, and Faith in God's free Love to remit; but) as juſt, <hi>by being actually and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made ſo through the Participation of the Juſt and Righteous Nature of Chriſt,</hi> who is to all ſuch, <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification and plentious Redemption;</hi> and here we will end this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaving our Faith therein with God and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men.</p>

To which he ſayes, <hi>They do not deny, that there was ſuch a Man as</hi> Jeſus <hi>the Son of</hi> Mary, <hi>and that God, or rather Chriſt was in him; but this is no more, then they profeſs of themſelves, that Chriſt as God is in them, yet that Body of the Man</hi> Jeſus <hi>which he calls here the bodily Garment, he tells us they can never call Chriſt.</hi> This Quotation he offers as explaining by another from the ſame <hi>Author and Book,</hi> p. 20. <q>For that which he took upon him was our Garment, even the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature (VERY RIGHT; but what followeth is wofully falſe) which is of an Earthly Periſhing Nature; But he is of an Heavenly Nature.</q> From whence <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>But before we give him off, we hope, through the Help of our God to prove, the Contrary to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Chriſt, Scriptures and ſound Reaſon; He has done us right in two reſpects, which may a little anſwer for the Ill-Language he giveth us in our Charge. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he acknowledgeth, we own, that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Jeſus the Son of</hi> Mary (in Contradiction to abundance of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) <hi>and that God was in him,</hi> which makes up our Chriſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he whom we call <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not <hi>J.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47076:88"/>
Denying the Man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> yet behold the <hi>Babel</hi> of the Matter, who after this dare ſay (VERY RIGHT) to this part of <hi>I. Pennington</hi>'s words; <hi>for that which he took upon him, was our Garment, even the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature:</hi> Where he manifeſtly implies, that what he juſt now accounted the whole <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us for denying to be ſuch, is not the <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf, but his Garment only; <hi>unleſs there be no Difference betwixt Chriſt, and his Garment;</hi> or that <hi>Chriſt was but the Garment of that more excellent Soul, or Divine Being that dwelt therein,</hi> which is Unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and very Carnal. If this Man had not charged us, with what he cannot prove; nay, if he has not manifeſtly contradicted himſelf in his Endeavours to do it, no Man was ever guilty in thoſe Reſpects. But that none may be ſtumbled by his <hi>untrue Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> of us: We do believe, and plainly declare, and that with Holy Reverence and Fear, that we cannot, we dare not call the <hi>meer Body,</hi> the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but the <hi>Body of Chriſt;</hi> That he was after the Fleſh born of the Virgin, like unto us in all things, Sin excepted; and conſequently, that Body muſt have been of the ſame Nature with ours; elſe it was not a Real, but Phantaſtical Body, is moſt true; and if it had not been ſo, neither could it have been a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nature of our Fleſh, which is ſo, and to which <hi>J.

               <p>And now, whether it be moſt againſt <hi>Chriſt, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon,</hi> to ſay that that Body, which was nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Croſs, <hi>was the Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Body of Chriſt onely,</hi> I leave with <hi>Christ, Scripture and Reaſon to determine?</hi> Certain I am, that this Principle muſt

And why did the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſpeak <hi>of no more knowing Chriſt after the Fleſh, and of his being revealed in him, and in the Saints, as their Hope of Glory, and that he was the Quickning Spirit and Lord from Heaven;</hi> If that <hi>Body</hi> was the Intire Chriſt, &amp; not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the Body prepared for that Divine Power, Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs to tranſact in,</hi> and appear by, and to the Sons of Men; which with reſpect to that great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, was denominated <hi>Chriſt</hi> or Anointed, ſhall we dare think, that he, who ſo ſpoak, and of whom the Apoſtle ſo teſtified, was not the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which to be ſure was before that <hi>Viſible Body)</hi> God forbid.

Will <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> or any Man that owns Scripture, dare to affirm, there was not ſomething belonging to the True and Compleat Chriſt, beyond what his outward Eyes could poſſibly ſee?

               <p>One would think I had ſpent my Time in vain, when I ſet about to prove, that the Divine <hi>Light, Life, Power, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> were not unconcerned in the true Chriſt, and conſequently that the <hi>Body</hi> which only died, was not the Entire <hi>Jeſus</hi> or Saviour; ſince our <hi>Adverſary</hi> calls us <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers</hi> and <hi>Deluders</hi> (and I know not for what, except it be) for Teaching that Doctrine he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in the ſame Paragraph, wherein he calls us thoſe <hi>hateful Names.</hi>

               <p>Enough of him at this time in Contradiction to himſelf, and of his Ungodly Cenſure of us.

(2) <hi>That the meer Body was the Only and Intire Chriſt,</hi> whatever he pretends, <hi>and not ſo much as the Man's Soul in Conjunction with it,</hi> unleſs the Soul was of ſuch a material groſs Matter, <hi>as that it could be hang'd on a Tree, dye, and be laid in a Sepulchre</hi> (which is to aſſert the Mortality of the Souls) all which happened to the Lord's Chriſt, ſays <hi>J. Faldo:</hi> But becauſe the Man's Soul was not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and could not be hanged on a Tree, and put into a Sepulchre, it follows, that it was the <hi>Viſible Body,</hi> which could only be hang'd on a Tree, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47076:91"/>
laid in a Sepulchre, that was and <hi>is the Only and Intire Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in</hi> J. Faldo's <hi>ſenſe:</hi> Which, how Impious it is againſt him, that truly is ſo; how groſly Abuſive of all People; and how Contradictory to himſelf, let the whole World of Reaſon judge. Is this the Man, that muſt be thought fit to <hi>vaunt it over us with ſuch Impudent Scurrility,</hi> Ungodly, as well as Unmannerly Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But in the Earth there is not any thing ſo Fantaſtical, Conceited; Proud, Railing, Buſie Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſometimes Ignorant, as a Sort of <hi>Prieſts</hi> to me not unknown (among whom our <hi>Adverſary</hi> is not the leaſt) who think their Coat will bear out their worſt Expreſſions for <hi>Religion,</hi> and Practice an haughty Reviling for Chriſt, as one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Demonſtrations of their <hi>Zeal:</hi> an Ill-bred and pedantick Creco, the Bane of Reaſon, and Peſt of the World; the old Incendiaries to Miſchief, and the beſt to be ſpar'd of Mankind; againſt whom the boyling Vengeance of an irritated God is ready to be poured out to the Deſtruction of ſuch, if they repent not, and turn from their Abominable Deceits.</p>

We will as truly, and honeſtly ſay, as it is poſſible for him to do, <hi>that it was the Body of

the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (which ſometimes bore the Name of the whole Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Saviour of Men) <hi>that was born of</hi> Mary, <hi>was hanged on a Tree, and laid in the Sepulchre of</hi> Joſeph <hi>of</hi> Arimathia. And if he will adventure to ſay more, the Conſequences <hi>of Excluding the Divinity, and Man's Soul, from being any part of the True Chriſt, or their Mortality with the Body</hi> (who are Immortal) and not capable of being hanged on a Tree much leſs buried for dead in the Sepulchre of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathia) will inevitably fall upon him, and daſh him and his Carnal Notions into peeces.</hi> Thus have I clear'd my Conſcience in clearing up the Conſiſtency of our Belief of the Bodily Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the True Chriſt, with Scripture, and ſound Reaſon; and I hope, to the plain Overthrow of our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and that with what Brevity was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>

                  <hi>things were made, the Light of Men, &amp;c.

that he was got to the <hi>higheſt Round of the Ladder;</hi> in this place he has twiſted himſelf <hi>Rope enough to anſwer the End of his Climing thither;</hi> for if I do not from hence irrefutably prove, (1) That the meer <hi>Body</hi> was not the Intire Saviour: (2) That the <hi>Light</hi> within is of a Saving Nature; I ſhall be ready to allow all our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> Detrectations from the Light within, but juſt Epithetes, and a true Character of.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the <hi>Light,</hi> which is that <hi>Word,</hi> which made all things, and therefore <hi>God</hi> (as ſaith <hi>J.

And leſt we ſhould yet miſtake him; he calls it <hi>God manifested in the Fleſh,</hi> for thoſe Ends, <hi>to wit, Salvation and Eternal Life:</hi> And that he might ſpeak <hi>all for us in a little,</hi> and give the Deaths-wound to his own Cauſe, he tells us in ſo many Words, <hi>That the Salvation and Life Eternal of poor Sinners was wrapt up in Christ, as God.</hi> Is not this pretty fair for an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> as ill-willing to us and to the Truth,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47076:93"/>
as <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> one of Ten Thouſand in his Diſpleaſure againſt us? Certainly, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for believing, It was and is Chriſt, as the Word in whom was Life, and that Life the Light of Men, that he was, and is a Saviour, <hi>J. Faldo</hi> muſt not be the Man, that ſhall give the Sentence, who, I know not how? nor why? but that God and his Truth may be glorified by his Self-overthrow, hath aſſerted the <hi>Quakers Principle,</hi> and that at an high rate; and if it can be an Honour to him, that he has aſſiſted to the Conqueſt of himſelf, he ought to have it without any Envy.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But he is as ſerviceable to us altogether in Defence of the Light, however undeſigned; which I prove thus: If Chriſt be properly that Light, which manifeſts or diſcovers any thing (the terms of his Conceſſion) and therefore it doth manifeſt the Purpoſe and Grace of God, which was given in Chriſt before the World was, whereby Death comes to be aboliſhed, and Life and Immortality brought to Light; Then muſt <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> this manifeſting Light, <hi>be a Divine and Saving Light without all Diſpute:</hi> Now, <hi>J. Faldo</hi> affirms Chriſt to be that Word, and proper Light, that ſo manifeſteth, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth, as expreſt; conſequently, that Light, which doth ſo Manifeſt and Diſcover, <hi>is a Saving Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, If the <hi>Light,</hi> be not only a <hi>Manifeſting</hi> Light (which is to take it <hi>Properly)</hi> but a <hi>Comforting</hi> Light alſo (which is to take it <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> as ſaith <hi>J. Faldo)</hi> Then this Light, as the <hi>Word-Creator,</hi> is not therefore call'd Light from a bare Act of Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; <hi>but is a Principle of Life, Power, Vertue, &amp;c.</hi> by which ſuch as obey it, <hi>are conſolated,</hi> and by the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47076:94"/>
of Contraries, who rebel againſt it, <hi>are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Which makes up thoſe two States of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> and their Rewards, <hi>Conſolation</hi> and <hi>Miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much our <hi>Adverſary</hi> further proves for us; <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men,</hi> that is, <hi>the Salvation and Eternal Life of poor Sinners was wrapt up in Chriſt, as God:</hi> which is to ſay; That the Life of the Word was, and is the proper Light of Men, and unto all ſuch poor Sinners as did and do believe in it, <hi>that Light is unto them Salvation and Eternal Life;</hi> then which, <hi>nothing can be more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in the Point.</hi> Who would think that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſhould ever undertake the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Principles? And if he did know them, What ſhould aile the Man to be ſo much our Friend to write againſt himſelf, under Pretence of writing againſt us? One would think, he did it by the ſame Figure <hi>Irony,</hi> that ſome call Fools, Wits: Yet he would fain diſtinguiſh <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Light, as <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> making the firſt Common, the other Peculiar, and that ſpoils all. To which I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer, for he only ſtarts it himſelf: There is but one Kind of <hi>Light,</hi> which reſults from the Life of the Word, and becauſe it cannot be ſuch, but it muſt be Divine and Sufficient, as well to Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Conviction; it will unanſwerably follow, that the manifeſting Light of the Word <hi>J. Faldo</hi> confeſſeth all Mankind more or leſs to be lighted with, is of a Divine and Saving Nature; and that which ſtrengthens this Concluſion, is, <hi>that Chriſt, as God,</hi> is by our <hi>Adverſary</hi> made the <hi>Saviour;</hi> and unleſs he would deny him that he calls God, to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Manifeſtation in Fleſh, a Redeemer to the Ancients (which were to conclude the Damnation
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47076:94"/>
of all that died antecedent) Chriſt, the Word, <hi>as that Light was the proper Redeemer through all Generations;</hi> Though I will grant to him, and that in the Name of all that People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> the Diſcoveries made by Chriſt, <hi>or God manifeſted in the Fleſh tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all former Manifeſtations,</hi> and as in my <hi>Spirit of Truth Vindicated</hi> it is largely confeſt (had this <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</hi> been Ingenuous enough to have weigh'd it) So again I declare, that eminently whatever was before, or hath been ſince, might in a ſenſe be ſaid of that Manifeſtation; becauſe he that then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the Fulneſs of that Light, Life and Power which meaſurably was, is, and may be diſpenſed to the Sons of Men; wherefore in that ſenſe he was, both before and after, the ſame Convincer, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Redeemer and Saviour to the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But he is much ſtumbl'd, and not a little abuſive, becauſe I would have <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>How far this Character may be by any thought to reſemble <hi>William Penn</hi> (a Man he often ſtrickes at) I know not; but I dare ſay for him, he never was ſo Diſingenuous as to deſerve it, and leaſt of all from <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> with whom he never had to do, and who muſt needs make a Random-gueſs in the Matter. But this is not the only Scurrility, <hi>William Penn,</hi> however unconcern'd he be, has receiv'd at the hands of that Rude <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor that he is able to bear. He takes it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47076:95"/>
for granted that <hi>W. P</hi>'s <hi>Paſſive Religion,</hi> is like to be a Protection to his baſe Tongue, and ſo long the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſleeps in a whole Skin. I cannot imagine what his daſhoe—ſhould ſignifie; But it is ill done of a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to quarrell his next Order, and one too, which, if I am not miſtaken, the <hi>Non-Conforming Prieſts</hi> have ſwarm'd after, as the next way of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to their diſplac'd <hi>Carkaſſes;</hi> in ſo much, that we have almoſt as many <hi>Phyſicians</hi> as <hi>Patients.</hi> One would have thought <hi>J. Faldo</hi> had been looking that way by his <hi>Ebullitions,</hi> a Tearm of Art in pag. 127. But that is one of their laſt Refuges: For it requires Pains, which Men of his Function can't abide to do. They are for the Land of <hi>Milk and Honey,</hi> whoever toyles; and <hi>that</hi> they will make the Labours of others yield them <hi>in a Land of Briars and Thorns.</hi> But it happen'd unluckily, that he ſhould charge ſo much Epicuriſm upon <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> whilſt they impoſe ſuch Abſtinence on their Sick, to whoſe way of Life ſo many of his Friends are devoted. Shall I infer, it is <hi>to have thoſe Cups and that Cheer, their Ill-Preaching could not give,</hi> and that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> is therefore as very a—as thoſe <hi>Phariſees, that bound heavy Burdens, and layd them upon the People, but themſelves would not put their Fingers to ſupport them.</hi> Does he live to what he requires from others? if not (and the Courſe he takes, I know not how he ſhould) let him take his <hi>as very a</hi>—to himſelf, which much better becomes Him, then any Body I have to beſtow it upon.</p>
               <p>But to the Point controverted. I ſaid then, and do now again, that the Light muſt be in the Soul, or Intelligent Place of Man; and with reſpect to the Inward parts, I ſaw no Difference between ſaying,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47076:95"/>
the <hi>Light of Chriſt lighteth the Soul, or inward parts of Man,</hi> and that <hi>the Light inlightneth Man:</hi> Only ſometimes I granted, that <hi>Enlightning</hi> did import <hi>a Belief in the Light, and ſome Divine Attainments</hi> thereby; both which are ſober, and true, and granted by <hi>I. Faldo,</hi> if I underſtand what he ſayes when he confeſſeth, that moſt Tranſlators render it <hi>enlightneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. The laſt of what concerns his pretended <hi>Defeat</hi> of our Conſtruction of that Verſe; That was the true Light <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is <hi>Every Man:</hi> hear him; <hi>If this Phraſe be taken ſtricktly in its full</hi>

               <p>But this hath been ſo effectually conſider'd already, that it would be needleſs Repetition, a Fault <hi>I</hi> would not be guilty of (eſpecially at this time) to ſay much to it: Let it ſuffice, that the Light Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and Immediately reſulting from the Word, which was and is the Life of the Word, <hi>is the ſame in Kind, both before that Manifeſtation of God (who is Light) in that Holy Manhood</hi> then, and ſince; though not the ſame with reſpect to the Degree of its Diſcoveries. But he tells us, though he can allow it univerſally <hi>as Creator, yet not as Redeemer;</hi> and brings us theſe Scriptures; <hi>Whom we preach,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47076:96"/>
warning every Man, and teaching every Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Commending our ſelves to every</hi>

So, who were upheld, God upheld; and who are raiſed up, are raiſed by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is too mean to invalid the Force of the Place, and our plain and <hi>inextorted</hi> Underſtanding of it. The Reaſon of this Miſtake lies here: If it be his Light, ſayes <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> as <hi>Creator,</hi> then it hurts us not; if as <hi>Redeemer; why are not all redeem'd?</hi> putting no Difference <hi>betwixt the Sufficiency of the Light to ſave, and the Salvation, that may be wrought by it upon the Obedience of the Creature.</hi> A Doctrine accurſt from God, and deteſted of all Men not mad, or abuſed by the Suggeſtions of others; for the <hi>Calviniz'd Predeſtination</hi> is the Bottom of it. Let it ſuffice, and ſo we will venture it. (1) <hi>That Chriſt died for all Men,</hi> though all Men, receive not the Benefit intended by it; The <hi>Neglect</hi> of Men don't render God's Love, <hi>no Love,</hi> or that it is not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and leaſt of all that it ſhould be Inſufficient in it ſelf. (2) If God has not lightned the Soul of all Mankind with a ſufficient Light to Salvation, the Damnation of Men can never lye at their own Door; neither will they be left without Excuſe. (3) The Light with which he enlightens, being the <hi>Life</hi> of the Word, muſt be Saving; call it the Light of the <hi>Creator,</hi> or <hi>Redeemer, for He is one in himſelf, and ſo is his Light. (4) All Mankind,</hi> in all Coppies

and Tranſlations, and from the Reaſon of the Thing, muſt be confeſt to be the Subject of this Illumination: Neither let it be hard for our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> to grant; <hi>ſince it may be the Light of Chriſt as Redeemer, and yet Men may not be redeemed thereby, through their own Diſobedience.</hi> An inevitable Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then not following upon Mens being thus light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>but upon their Receiving of it,</hi> I cannot ſee but it may be allow'd us, <hi>that all Mankind not being redeem'd, is no Argument, why</hi>

               <p>§. 5. Now as to his Scripture-Quotations, they are no whit to his Purpoſe: For the <hi>Warning</hi> and <hi>Commendation</hi> were Univerſal, there is not one Soul exempted. And ſhould I grant him his Deſire, what could it availe? For if the Apoſtle had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Regard to thoſe among whom he laboured, neither doth that hinder the Univerſality of the Truth of the Thing in it ſelf, for the Warning is to all, or the Scripture is not binding to all, contrary to our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> Judgment of it.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Caſe parallel with the Relation given of the Divinity of the Word, its Creating Power, and peculiar Benefit of Light from its own Life univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally extended to Mankind, unleſs that in the places where the word <hi>All</hi> or <hi>Every</hi> is uſed without any
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47076:97"/>
Exception, an Exception ſhould be made, becauſe ſome one particular Caſe may admit of an Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For neither doth God raiſe up <hi>all who fall;</hi> Nor is it to be underſtood, that all who are raiſed up in all caſes, God doth immediately raiſe, but rather thus; the Lord alone is able to uphold all who fall, and raiſe up all that be bowed down, as to a ſpiritual State, the purport of the words: So that the Univerſal, I mean <hi>All,</hi> remains entire, and the contrary Opinion reſpecting the Light, ends in an abſolute Denial of a Saving Light to the greateſt parts of Mankind; which dreadful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence I had much rather ſhould reſult from <hi>J.

               <p>§. 6. But to ſhut up this Diſcourſe, let us take notice of an Expreſſion or two, that this <hi>Critick</hi> lets fall in the cloſe of this Paraphraſe, and that is, Concerning <gap reason="foreign">

That was the true Light, which coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World lighteth every Man,</hi> rather then <hi>that was the true Light, which lighteth every Man coming into the World. If,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>it ſhould refer to Man, every Man in the very inſtant of, or before his Birth, Chriſt enlightneth; it muſt be meant of created Faculties—For Experience and Senſe without (any one Inſtance to controle it) will tell us, that none can believe without Hearing, nor hear without a Preacher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He might much better have ſaid of himſelf, then of the <hi>Quakers-Meeting,</hi> that he was but a <hi>Puppet</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:47076:97"/>
indeed, who knows nothing but by Hear-ſay or meer Imitation: If Man have not ſome more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teacher, farewell to the Truth of all Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Scriptures, and whatever comes by, or from the Inſpiration of the Almighty. This Man, if yet he ben't to much beſotted to deſerve ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Name, at once deſtroys all Wayes, or Means, whereby to know, and that not only to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but himſelf too; For the Scriptures themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded upon Revelation, and his Knowledge, upon them, as he pretends: Take away Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ye take away the Scriptures; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently what Knowledge <hi>J.

Thus is this <hi>Blind Leader</hi> faln into the Ditch of his own digging.</p>
               <p>But muſt it be abſurd, becauſe Children at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their coming into the World, can't be ſaid to be ſo enlightned. Very well; and what thinks he of the Inſtant of Chriſt's coming into the World, out of the Virgin's Womb? Did he enlighten all who ſhould ſavingly be enlightned at that Inſtant? A mad Diſputant, indeed. What was it enlightned <hi>Simeon?</hi> Who told and revealed to him the Lord's Chriſt? For Shame quit all Pretence to diſpute.</p>
               <p>§. 7. But let's hear him further; <hi>There is a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Text, gives ſuch a Countenance to referring it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47076:98"/>
to the Light, as will never be found for the Contrary.</hi> That was the true Light, not <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>This is; not as Chriſt is now in Heaven, nor as preſent with the Evangeliſt</hi> John, <hi>and the then Saints; but it points at Chriſt's Appearance in the Fleſh.</hi> Very notable indeed, and we will not let it ſlip our Obſervation.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Word</hi> that made all things, which was with God, and was God, was that true Light, as ſaith <hi>J. Faldo</hi> himſelf, p. 84, then can it never be reſtrained to that Appearance as the Beginning or End of it. Nay, the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> is not yet come, ſo much as to mention any thing of his Manifeſtation in Fleſh; and if we will believe <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> the Verſe concerns the <hi>Word</hi> as <hi>Creator,</hi> and not as <hi>Redeemer,</hi> which he ſtints to his Coming in the Fleſh, ſee pag. 89. But by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, that is not relative to his Appearance in the Fleſh, but rather to the <hi>Word,</hi> which was with God, and was God, as p. 84. and ſo the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation has it, <hi>That Word was the true Light, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that either the <hi>Word</hi> was not before that Appearance; or if it were, being that true Light, that true Light was before that Appearance; And Mankind being: alſo antecedent to that Manifeſtation, may very well be ſaid alwayes to have been enlightened by that Light. For that the <hi>Word</hi> ſhould be before that Appearance, &amp; that true Light, which is the very Life of the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Word it ſelf,</hi> ſhould be ſtinted to that Appearance, is as abſurd, as any thing well can be. Again, that we ſhould take <hi>It</hi> to deny Chriſt now to be the true Light, that enlightens all, becauſe he was ſo, is a ſtrange Impertinency, and groſs Falſhood; for then by good Reaſon ought we to infer, that becauſe the Word was with God, and was God, therefore he is not now either with God, or God. Is this your <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus?</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:47076:98"/>
Beſides, If we had nothing of this to offer, the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> might very well refer to that Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance without any Denial at all of an antecedent Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; It being the moſt excellent Breaking forth of the Divine Light. And this is largely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and proved in my <hi>Spirit of Truth Vindicated.</hi> Which had he conſider'd but half as much as he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes us to have his own, he might have ſaved us the Labour of this Animadverſion. But God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is our Portion from many ſuch like baſe and unworthy <hi>Adverſaries.</hi> Every thing is a Fault in a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and nothing in them.

               <p>I hope it will be alwayes forreign to me, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the holy Scriptures; But the Truth I will take Liberty to defend. The whole Chapter is a very weighty and zealous Recommendation of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to the Churches, preſſing them to call to Mind the Love of God unto them, and to mind their Duty to him, who had ſo loved them; And as a great Ground, both of their Faith, Love and Duty, the Apoſtle in the 16th verſe tells them, <hi>For we have not followed cunningly diviſed Fables, when we made known unto you, the Power and Coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; But were Eye-Witneſſes of his Majeſty: for he received from God the Father Honour and Glory, when there came ſuch a Voice to him from the Excellent Glory,</hi> THIS IS MY BELOVED SON, IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED. <hi>And this Voice, which comes from Heaven, we heard, when we were with him in the Holy Mount; We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy, &amp;c.</hi> Now that this cannot be meant of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47076:100"/>
the Scriptures (and take in the Compariſon) I thus prove. If the Reaſon of their Aſſurance, that what they delivered to the Churches, was not Fabulous, but true, <hi>was their being Eye-Witneſſes of his Majeſty, and Eye and Ear-Witneſſes of that Teſtimony God gave of his Son in the Mount, by that Honour, Glory and Voice of Words, which were there utter'd, and did in that Plaee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;</hi> then the Scriptures not only were not a ſurer Word of Prophecy, but not ſo ſure, becauſe they never heard nor ſaw them ſo delivered; nor yet had any of the Prophets, ſo Glorious, ſo Tranſcendent, and Unqueſtionable a Teſtimony to their outward Eyes and Ears that we read of <hi>(J. Faldo</hi>'s moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Way of true Knowledge (ſee pag. 91.) as was that which God gave to the Diſciples, when he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> But we may inform our ſelves from the Verſes reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they were a more eminent Ground for their Knowledge, Aſſurance, and Belief, then the meer Scriptures; And conſequently the Scriptures are not <hi>the more ſure Word of Prophecy.</hi> Again, the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Account of another's Revelation cannot be more ſure to me then that Revelation which I do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately receive from God; ſuppoſe it be from God: But this was a Revelation to the Diſciples, and they were ſure it was from God; Conſequently the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Account of another's Revelation, as were the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament (ſo called) to the Diſciples, could not be <hi>a more ſure Word of Prophecy.</hi> For it were to ſay, that they were more ſure, that he among them who was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was the Son of God from <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Teſtimony, <hi>That he would give him for a Light to lighten the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the Immediate Voice of God, when he pointed ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47076:101"/>
at him, <hi>This is my beloved Son;</hi> He that is amongſt you, whom you have followed, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> Then which, what could be more demonſtrable on God's part, and incredulous on their ſide, who ſhould yet ſubject that living Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, to any the beſt Tradition? Let me not forget to add; That what the Diſciples then ſaw and heard from God, and the Epiſtle, <hi>Peter</hi> wrot by the holy Ghoſt, being made part of the New Teſtament-Writings, and they accounted more eminent by far then the Old, with reſpect to the more eminent Pouring forth of the Holy Ghoſt, in that Day, which the Prophets fore-ſaw, and they enjoyed, the Old cannot in any wiſe be reputed a more ſure Word of Prophecy, as <hi>J. Faldo</hi> aſſerts; therefore this <hi>more ſure Word of Prophecy,</hi> muſt be another thing.</p>
               <p>§. 10. What that is which may be reputed a more ſure Word of Prophecy, will much deſerve our ſerious Conſideration. If it was not the Voice in the Mount, which we have invincibly proved, to be more <hi>Immediate, Living, Freſh, Convincing and Confirming</hi> to the Diſciples, then any the beſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Prophecies they had; It will follow, that it was meant of the <hi>holy Anointing, that Spirit,</hi> and <hi>meaſure of the Grace, or bleſſed Light of Chriſt,</hi> which is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and out of the Reach of all Viſible Things, to <hi>ſophiſticate, corrupt, miſ-repreſent, miſ-render,</hi> or <hi>miſ-tranſlate,</hi> all which have greatly befallen the Scriptures: For I do affirm, that <hi>Senſe</hi> it ſelf is not ſo certain as Reaſon, and what clearly and fully occurs to the Underſtanding part of Man, is a more ſolid Ground for <hi>Faith</hi> and Knowledge, then
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47076:101"/>
thoſe External <hi>Sights</hi> and <hi>Viſions,</hi> which Man might be attended with to Confirmation. For what ſhall be the Rule for trying the Certainty and Truth of any ſuch <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Prophecies?</hi> It muſt be ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that Anointing, which was afterwards given more largely to them, in order to try Spirits, and in all other Caſes, which concern the Goſpel; otherwiſe they ſhould not have believ'd with any Certainty, or upon ſpiritual Conviction as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For if a Man has not ſomething Divine to direct and inform his Underſtanding as to the true Reliſh, Judgment, and Application of what he may read in any Book, or externally might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to his Sences in the Way of extraordinary Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there could be no probable, much leſs certain Ground for his Belief in, or Knowledge of the Truth of that thing, however true in it ſelf. In ſhort, <hi>That which is Truth it ſelf, which is able to teach all things, to try all things, and to lead into all Truth</hi> (which the Scriptures (though Truth) cannot do; for then, they would be Clear, Plain, Perfect, uncapable of Additions, Diminutions, Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Miſtranſlations &amp;c.) <hi>muſt be this more ſure Word of Prophecy;</hi> But that the <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> which the Saints had received of him <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27.</note> was able to do, as ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, but the Anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and need not that any Man teach you; but as the ſame Anointing teacheth you of all things, and is Truth, and is no Lye: And even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him;</hi> Therefore this Anointing thus able to do all things, muſt needs be <hi>that more ſure Word of Prophecy;</hi> if <hi>more</hi> ſhall be allowed. In ſhort, <hi>The Law written in the Heart,</hi> is a more ſure <hi>Covenant.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47076:102"/>

               <p>The Way he takes to prove this heavy Charge is this. <hi>Thoſe which own and profeſs that to be God, which is not, are groſs Idolaters; but the</hi> Quakers <hi>do ſo.</hi> The ſecond Propoſition (the firſt being granted by all) he endeavours to prove thus. <hi>Who own and profeſs the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47076:105"/>
Light within, and the Soul of every Man to be God, own and profeſs that to be God, which is not God. But the</hi> Quakers <hi>do ſo; therefore Idolaters.</hi> The making good this Charge, will lie upon the Teſtimony he brings out of our Friends Writings, ſince he pretends to no leſs Demonſtration, for every thing he has to lay againſt us. I deny in the Name of all that abuſed People; <hi>firſt,</hi> that we ever own'd or profeſt <hi>the Light within every Man to be God</hi> (though we ſay, it is of God) much leſs that we worſhip it as ſuch: And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> we do forever renounce any ſuch Principle, <hi>As that the Soul of Man, ſimply as ſuch, is the very Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Being of God:</hi> If he fails in his Proofs, he muſt fall with Infamy to the Ground.

                  <q>I will make you know, that I the Light which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, that all through me ſhould believe, am the True Eternal God, which created all things; that by me (the Light) all things are upheld; and that there is not another beſide me can ſave. <hi>Fox</hi> Young. p. 53.</q>

was not mentioned; and by his Silence, I ſuppoſe, I may conclude it <hi>Orthodox.</hi> For no Man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves Scripture, will dare to deny that God is <hi>Light;</hi> That every Man is enlightned by <hi>Him;</hi> and that by <hi>Him,</hi> who is call'd <hi>Light,</hi> all things are <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,</hi> and that <hi>He</hi> alone is <hi>Saviour.</hi> A Doctrine <hi>J.

To the other Scraps of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I anſwer, That we never did, do, nor ſhall aſſert, the God that made Heaven and Earth to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendable within the Soul of Man; No, it is more impoſſible, then that the Sun in the Firmament could be contain'd within the Body of any individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Perſon. <hi>But that God, who is the great Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, doth as truly cauſe his Light Spiritual to ariſe upon the Souls of Men, as his Sun Natural upon their Bodies:</hi> and as what Knowledge we have of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sun is by its Light, Operations and Effects upon the World, ſo our Knowledge of the Eternal Sun of Righteouſneſs, <hi>God (who is Light, and in whom is no Darkneſs at all)</hi> is only and alone by his Divine Light, <hi>Operations,</hi> and Effects in and upon our Underſtandings and Conſciences: ſo that when we ſay <hi>that the Light is within any,</hi> we do not intend the <hi>whole Being of Light,</hi> nor was it in this groſs ſenſe that <hi>G. Fox the Younger</hi> ever meant it. But that <hi>He, who is the Eternal Fountain of all Life, and Sun of Light, cauſeth his Light to viſit the Hearts, and ſhine into the Conſciences of all Mankind, as well of ſuch as Rebel againſt it, and ſcorn it, to reprove them, as thoſe who Receive it, and gladly ſubmit to it, to direct and juſtifie them:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we utterly deny that the Manifeſtation in Man, ſtrictly conſider'd, <hi>is the moſt-high God;</hi> but a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of, or from God, <hi>by the Inſhinings of his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47076:106"/>
bleſſed Light.</hi> And we cannot be ſaid to Worſhip the Manifeſtation, but <hi>that Eternal God, which is Light, that is thereby manifeſted;</hi> and all Worſhip, otherwiſe founded, is not of God, nor pleaſing to him, but of the Invention of Men, which he will confound; and this, Scripture and Reaſon are ready to defend. <hi>Scorning the Light in them, and not owning the Light in them,</hi> by our <hi>Adverſary</hi> ſo ſtrongly inſiſted upon; is no more then, <hi>ſcorning and diſowning him who is the Light that ſhines in them, and that gives Light to them.</hi> What very vanity then, is all his Boaſt? And how does his Charge retort upon himſelf? But that we may ſend it quite back, to the Pit from whence it came, lets hear how he proves our Belief of the Soul, to be God; which he begins to do, with no ſmall Shew of Aſſurance, that he ſhall clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly compaſs his End.</p>

I perceive, <hi>J.

                  <q>As to the Spirit of Man which concurs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47076:107"/>
of Man in his primitive Perfection; it is the Breath of Life, which God breathed into his Soul, after he had formed him, as to his Body, of the Duſt of the Earth; whereby he came to be a Living Soul, a Soul, that did partake ſomething of God's own Life,—This (Spirit of Man) is that living Principle of the Divine Nature, which Man did before his Degeneration, and ſhall again after his Regeneration partake of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Charge,</hi> ſayes our Adverſary, <hi>being of ſo black and horrid a Nature, I did judge it meet to prove it by abounding Inſtances, and now</hi> Reader <hi>put on the largeſt Charity, and give me thy Verdict, if I have not made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>are groſs Idolaters,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To anſwer which, briefly and to Purpoſe, and to cloſe this Chapter, with a contrary Concluſion, I ſay, That the <hi>Spirit of Man</hi> is not to be taken, as of, or from Man, or that it is any part of Man's Nature, take <hi>Man in an Abſtractive ſenſe:</hi> And had he been ſo fair, as to give us <hi>S. Fiſher's</hi> Words at large, they would have prov'd themſelves of Age enough to anſwer for themſelves. <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of that Spirit, or Breath of Life, not that made Man ſimply a Living Creature of a meer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Capacity, <hi>but that Divine Life or Breath, which makes alive to God, and gives a kind of Heavenly Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Motion, or Life, to live to him, which conſtituted</hi> Adam, <hi>not a meer Man, but a bleſſed, holy, heavenly-minded Man, before his Degeneration.</hi> And that <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> did never intend it of the Natural Soul of Man, but rather of the Divine Life of the Soul, without which the Soul is deſtitute of the Knowledge of the True and Living God, his own Words very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhow; For if <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> intended that Spirit,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47076:108"/>
which is the Divine Principle, that Man did partake of before his Degeneration; certain and clear it is, that ſince Man did under that Degeneration partake of his own Soul, or elſe he could not have been a Man, <hi>S. Fiſher never meant the meer Soul of Man, but the Life of that Divine Principle which regenerates and renews the Soul unto a Life of Purity and Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we conclude, the <hi>Quakers</hi> not believing any ſuch Strange and Unſcriptural Doctrine, <hi>as that the Soul of Man, is the God that made the Heavens and the Earth</hi> (for ſo it would make it ſelf, and what is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then itſelf) <hi>They are not thoſe</hi> Idolaters <hi>they have been repreſented, and fouly charactered by</hi> J.

               </p>
               <p>To the Firſt; he brings in <hi>I. Pennington</hi> thus. <q>We ſay, that Chriſt is the Reſurrection, to raiſe up that which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, and to deſtroy him who deceived him, (viz. <hi>Adam)</hi> ſo Chriſt is the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto Life, of Body, Soul and Spirit, and ſo renews Man, &amp;c. <hi>Princ.

               </p>
               <p>I can't help it, if <hi>J. Faldo</hi> has made ſo unapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Quotation out of <hi>I. P.</hi> to his Buſineſs. I hope, none are ſo Blind or Partial, as to be angry, that <hi>I. P.</hi> did not write to his Purpoſe; it was ſufficient that he ſpake to his own, or rather to the Truth's. Our <hi>Adverſary</hi> falls down right upon us, with a Charge of Denying the Reſurrection of the Body, and is angry that the Place he produces, helps not his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Certainly, with ſober Men, the Blame will not
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47076:109"/>
lie at our doors for not making good his Charge, but at his own, that he exhibited one he could not prove. But will he deny the Reſurrection in <hi>I. P</hi>'s Words? If he does, I pronounce him no <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will a bare Confeſſing to it render him One: And where he ſtands, I fear, he is but too far from both. Let it ſuffice, that thoſe Words are a modeſt, ſerious and full Anſwer to this <hi>Caviller,</hi> ſince he does plainly acknowledge <hi>All</hi> that the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> loſt, <hi>to be reſtored by Chriſt the ſecond Adam;</hi> and all that the Sin of one incurr'd, <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the other redeem'd from.</hi> Now let his Notions of the Way and Method of Effecting this be what they will, <hi>we deſire not to be wiſe beyond what the Lord ſees convenient for us,</hi> as this buſie Intruder into ſacred Myſteries hath done, that lives in the Land, <hi>not of Light, but groſs Darkneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and whoſe very <hi>borrowed, made, framed Light,</hi> from <hi>Reading, Art, Study and his own Conceptions, is the very Blackneſs of Darkneſs.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But ſayes our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> upon a like place, and to this purpoſe, (viz.) <hi>We ſhall all be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: I would ask, if they would be content</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">pag. 139.</note> 
                  <hi>to be refuſed their Debts, if contracted before</hi> Quakers, <hi>and demanded when</hi> Quakers; <hi>I ſuppoſe they would believe that the Change in a Perſon, is not the Change of a Perſon; and that they are the ſame ſtill to whom the Money was and is due.</hi> But how clever any may think this <hi>Simile,</hi> we will prove it Lame, and Defective; For the Change was not of the Body any further, then as the Soul govern'd it after a new Way of Living. I cannot think that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> will dare to ſay, <hi>that a Man's Body is rendered ever the leſs Corruptible by any the beſt Change the Soul can make in this World.</hi> The Queſtion is about; what that Change muſt be which makes a Corruptible an Incorruptible Body? I mean not by Corrupt, <hi>Sinful, but that groſs Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Matter, which is ſubject to thoſe Impreſſions, Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, Mutations, and Paſſions which we ſee all Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bodies are ſubject to.</hi> Either the Reſurrection of the Body muſt be without that Matter, or it muſt not? If it muſt, <hi>then it is not that ſame Numerical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> and ſo their proper and ſtrict taking of the Word <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> they muſt let go. If it muſt not be without that ſame groſs Matter it dyed with, then I affirm, it cannot be <hi>Incorruptible,</hi> becauſe it will carry with it that which will render it Corruptible <hi>ad Infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what can be more Unreaſonable, then that Bodies compounded of this Elementary World, which
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47076:110"/>
ſayes our <hi>Adverſary, ſhall and muſt by Nature have an End,</hi> ſhould out live their own Matter, and which is more, never end? I ſay, we cannot ſee how that which is of <hi>Duſt</hi> ſhould be Eternal, whilſt that from whence it came, is by Nature but Temporal. And that which is yet moſt of all Irreconcileable with Scripture and right Reaſon, is, <hi>that the Loſs and Change of Nature from Corruptible to Incorruptible, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Spiritual ſhould not make it another Body.</hi> In vain do ſuch diſpute againſt the <hi>Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation</hi> as an Abſurd and Impoſſible Thing, who themſelves are guilty in a Caſe of the like Nature. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirm a Change in the Sacrament, though our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes tell us it is the ſame thing that ever it was.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> in the Point of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> boldly affirm, that it is the ſame Body, and yet Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated from Natural to Spiritual, or chang'd from what it was, to ſomething it never was. For my part, I think the Laſt not leſs Impertinent, and the Former more expreſly Scriptural.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſuch things run Men into <hi>Unprofitable Queſtions, various Searches, and a Philoſophical Way of Diſcourſing,</hi> no wayes tending to God's Honour, nor the Soul's Profit and Comfort, I will Conclude this Head with our Confeſſion, <hi>That every Seed ſhall have its own Body, and that ſuch an one, as it will pleaſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to give; and</hi> Thou Fool, <hi>belongs moſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to him, who acquieſceth not in an humble Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the good Will of God, and that manner of Body he ſhall give.</hi> And I think it would make more for Love, Peace, and Good-Will, if our Enemies would leave thoſe things with God, <hi>quicquid ſupra nos, nihil ad nos,</hi> whoſe Will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</p>

To the Second Head of the Charge to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in this Chapter; to wit, <hi>Our not Profeſſing of Eternal Rewards,</hi> needs no <note place="margin">pag. 141, 142.</note> other Anſwer, then, <hi>That none ever read ſo, He quotes no ſuch thing, nay, he ſays, that he has ſearcht, but to no Purpoſe;</hi> and I challenge him to name one Perſon reputed by us, to be of us, <hi>that has ever affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo groſs a Thing?</hi> Well then may I call this the <hi>Laſt great Lye of his Second Part of Lyes,</hi> and <hi>Slanders too:</hi> ſuch as he will be found much to weak to defend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunal of our God, where we have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both to Anſwer, and juſtly Accuſe him before Angels, as well as that we have now plainly refuted him before Men.</p>
               <p>But he makes this a Conſequence of Denying the Reſurrection, which is obviouſly weak; ſince whatever we have ſcrupled of the common groſs No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reſurrection of this Corruptible Body, we have ever held an Eternal State of Recompence.</p>
               <p>But ſo mean are his Proofs for this Conjecture, if I may give them that Name, that they ſhow far more of his Ignorance and Malice, then our Faith in that <hi>Atheiſtical Opinion:</hi> However hear them. <hi>R. Farnſworth,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>was not ſaved by what Chriſt did at Jeruſalem;</hi> therefore, ſays he, <hi>already ſaved:</hi> But can any in their Wits think, he meant ſaved from Sin here, <hi>to be the whole of Salvation and Bleſſedneſs?</hi> O weak Man! Well, but <hi>I Pennington</hi> ſays, <hi>Who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God are to be turn'd into Hell. What Hell?</hi> ſays <hi>J. F. only in this Life.</hi> A very Lye, and Infamous Slander: <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Book againſt us, unrepented of, <hi>will prove, we believe, that Eternal Wo and Vengeance ſhall be the Wages of that Helliſh Work.</hi> We ſay, That in this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47076:111"/>
Life, Men have an <hi>Earneſt of Heaven and Hell,</hi> and ſome Sence of both States, <hi>as they are Good or Bad;</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did we affirm <hi>Men to enjoy that full Meaſure of Joy, or Torment they ſhall have as their Eternal Reward or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>E. Bourrough the Day he died,</hi> ſaid, <hi>he was now putting off this Manner of Perſon, and returning to his own Being.</hi> Thoſe are not his very Words; but what then? Is this to prove we deny an Eternal Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to produce his own Teſtimony to an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting State of Bleſſedneſs, that he Himſelf was juſt entering into? But <hi>W. Penn</hi> vindicates an Heaven within after his faſhion, againſt the Author of the <hi>Spirit of the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <note place="margin">Read Biſhop <hi>Halls</hi> and <hi>Tho. Brook's</hi> Heaven upon Earth.</note> 
                  <hi>tried.</hi> And what is this to denying an Eternal Heaven for the Righteous? Did not the Saints enjoy <hi>Heavenly Places</hi> in Spirit, when on Earth? O Carnal Man! Be-nighted by the Power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe Underſtanding the thick Fogs and Miſts of Ignorance, Malice and Revenge have over-caſt; <hi>that thou call'ſt Good Evil, and Evil Good; Light Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Darkneſs Light.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Being A <hi>Reply</hi> to that laſt Part of his <hi>Book,</hi> which pretends to anſwer the firſt of my <hi>Spirit of Truth Vindicated,</hi> enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>An Examination of the firſt part of</hi> W.

            </head>
            <p>§. 1. THough there has been no <hi>Adverſary</hi> which has fallen to my ſhare, that has ſhown more Incivility, and leſs Learning, (a thing he pretends to) in Anſwer to any of my Books, then <hi>J. Faldo</hi> has done in this laſt part of his <hi>Quakeriſm no Chriſtianity;</hi> yet how little ſoever I have, at leaſt to beſtow upon him, I deſire to manifeſt more Temper, Truth and Civility, then to recompence him with that Ill-bred Language, thoſe School-puns, and looſe irreverent, if not prophane Sayings, amidſt the moſt weighty Matters, it hath pleaſed him to give me, for a great ſhare of his Anſwer to the <hi>firſt Part</hi> of my Book. I will rather betake my ſelf to ſingle out the Strength of his Objections, if any there be, and beſtow my Time in Vindication of the Truth, then to rail, revile, undervalue and ſtigmatize with, I
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47076:112"/>
know not how many diſgracefull Epithites, a Way that never yet reacht into any Man's Conſcience. And this Ken I have of <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> That all his Diſcourſe of Chriſtianity, interlined with ſo much Babling, Prattle, and baſe Abuſe, would never move a ſober <hi>Turk;</hi> and a <hi>Banian</hi> is a Saint to a Congregation of ſuch kind of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. He tells me <hi>he expected great Things, when firſt he ſet about to read my Book, and began to ſtagger in his Mind, as to that Ingenious Piece,</hi> call'd, <note place="margin">page. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The Spirit of the Quakers tried,</hi> or to that purpoſe: But knowing himſelf better, I hope he will excuſe me, if I do not believe him. He never had that Opinion of any thing writ in Defence of a People he teſtifies ſuch irreconcilable Hatred to, which is none of the meaneſt Blots in his Scutchion. <hi>Pen, the Anſwerer, if he were not furniſht with Fore-head and Tales beyond meaſure, his Pamphlet would have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable in it;</hi> Whether this be moſt a Lye or an Abuſe, I know not, perhaps the <hi>Reader</hi> may; but ſure I am, there is more of both then ſtands with true <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to give a comprehenſive Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der value of what he can never anſwer, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps goes for one among ſuch as have Faith in him, or know no better.</p>
            <p>§. 3. But he is angry at my Stating the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> thus, <hi>Whether God's Holy and Unerring Spirit is or ſhould be the proper Judge of Truth, Rule</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>of Faith and Guide of Life, among Men, eſpecially under the Adminiſtration of the bleſſed Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, or no.</hi> I affirm it, and proceed to prove it by Scripture and Reaſon. Upon which be pleaſed to hear his Reflection, and from hence make a Judgment, what that Spirit muſt be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47076:113"/>
that ſhould ſo pretend to anſwer my <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Conſidering his Words foregoing (which are too many and too worthleſs to tranſcribe) And what he drives at in the handling of this Queſtion, I never read one ſo lame and deformed in my Life come forth with ſuch State and Confidence, and ſuch a train and rout of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums as deformed as it ſelf; There is in it neither Logick nor Honeſty: Certainly if he had not turned</hi> Quaker, <hi>and in that Fall put all out of joynt, he could not likely after ſuch good Nurſing have been thus lamentably cripled in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects, and ſomewhat beſides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think the Strain of this Comment were Anſwer to it ſelf: Why ſo <hi>much</hi> flouriſh, and <hi>little</hi> done? Muſt Noiſe ſupply the Abſence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? and baſe Reviling go for Confutation? Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Man! what Lameneſs is there in the Queſtion? I profeſs I ſee none, nor has he ſo much as pointed at one Limb that is defective in all this Rabble of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. <hi>[I have neither Logick nor Honeſty]</hi> It had been to be wiſh'd that he had ſhown more of both in ſaying ſo, or held his Tongue. <hi>[But my turning</hi> Quaker <hi>has put ſomething out of joynt]</hi> But what, I know not, unleſs the good Opinion I once undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved had of ſuch Mountebank <hi>Prieſts.</hi> But give him his due, he is the firſt Man that ever acquainted me with the Ground of Cripling. I was never yet wiſe enough to think it a Natural Effect of Ill-nurſing, only through Careleſneſs in Nurſes, Falls and the like have brought it. I perceive he is not only a Wel wiſher to <hi>Phyſick</hi> by his hard Word, <hi>Ebullitions,</hi> but a ſmall Pretender to <hi>Chyrurgery,</hi> by his Terme, out of <hi>joynt;</hi> when he has given better Proof of his well-ſetting to rights his own diſ-joynted, or, if he will, diſlocated Cauſe with that of Chiſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47076:113"/>
he may better ſet up for a Religious Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetter, and in the mean time he can paſs but for a Pretender.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[But I have no Logick]</hi> And why? [Becauſe I ſay pag. 37. there is no more Difference to me between a Judge, Rule and Gaide, then <note place="margin">pag 4.</note> eſſentially there can be in the Wiſdom, Juſtice and Holineſs of God; he ſhould have added, <hi>ſayes J. Faldo,</hi> nor between <hi>Truth, Faith</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> amongſt Men.]</p>
            <p>I would know of any Man that can think himſelf capable of judging in the plaineſt Caſe; if this be an Anſwer to my Argument; I ſaid then, I do again, that there is no <note place="margin">Spir. Truth. Vin. <hi>p.</hi> 37. 31.</note> more Difference in them reſpecting the Principle, then eſſentially there can be <hi>in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice and Holineſs of God,</hi> which are but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Words to expreſs the Perfection of one and the ſame Being, for he is all, and that in all. Wiſe in being Juſt, and both in being Holy; They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, for <hi>That</hi> which gives me a right Senſe or Judgment of Truth from Error, is as well to me a <hi>Rule</hi> what I ſhould believe or diſ-believe, and a <hi>Guide</hi> what I ſhould practiſe or not practiſe, as at firſt it was my <hi>Judge</hi> of what was Truth from what was Errour; All which ſober, and indeed unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Arguing he thought fit to over-look, which is very Diſingenuous. I ſay, that <hi>the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is a Judge, is a Rule and Guide, even in that very Act, when it is a Judge,</hi> and that unavoidably; Therefore to diſtinguiſh them is frivolous, and to maintain one to be a Rule, and another a Judge, is abſurd and heterodox.</p>
            <p>For <hi>his Addition,</hi> it is not hard to anſwer, <hi>That
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47076:114"/>
there is more Difference between Truth, Faith and Life;</hi> for one may be without the other two, I mean Truth <hi>abſtractly:</hi> But if it ſhall be underſtood of Truth received into the Heart, I ſay, that there is ſo great an Affinity between Truth, true Faith, and an Heavenly Life, that they follow each other almoſt at an inſtant, and cannot be ſeparated from each other.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But <hi>he is Angry that I ſhould uſe theſe Words of Lord and Saviour in my Queſtion.</hi> I thought <note place="margin">pag 5.</note> them ſober; and I am ſure I meant them of him that was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in time appeared for the Salvation of his People, however he would diſintereſt us in them; but indeed the Way he takes to do it will do us no harm: For that he may inſinuate we mean another thing, he calls it <hi>Playing at Blind-Man's-Buff,</hi> which is worſe then a <hi>Buffle headed Expreſſion.</hi> Is this your Goſpel-Miniſter? Let him go Wraſtle at <hi>Morefields,</hi> play Foot-ball Matches, turn Ringer, a Practice he pleads for in his Book, &amp; leave off Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning the Holy Name of God with ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed Mouth and unbridled Tongue. Some of my Scripture-Arguments he pretends to refute, I ſhall mention, and what he objects, that both may be weighed in an equal Ballance.</p>
            <p>§. 5. The firſt Scripture by me urged is that in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ. 6. 3. My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with Man, &amp;c.</hi> From whence I infer, that <note place="margin">pag 8.</note> God's unerring Spirit both did ſo ſtrive either for Conviction and Converſion, or to prompt to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attainments, and that they were not at that time of the World without an Infallible Spirit to Teach, Rule, Judge, &amp;c. To which he ſayes, <hi>My Argument is a Thicket of Impertinences, that a Body had
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47076:114"/>
need of good Arithmetick to number the Terms, that I am a none-ſuch for Diving, if I can fetch up from this Scripture what is mention'd in this Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What need there is of all this little Wit, a better Word for Pedantry, I know not, and I believe more are of my Mind; but if my Conſequences are ſo Impertinent and ſo Numerous that ordinary Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick will not ſerve to reckon them, and laſtly ſo Unnatural as the Scripture will afford me not one of them, I am greatly to be blamed. But becauſe what he ſayes for me may be of more Force then all that I can offer, let this Paſſage be weighed <hi>[It is more then probable that the Spirit did ſtrive with them to make them better then they were, yet none of theſe Ends are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Text]</hi> An eminent Contradiction to him, and which is more, to it ſelf; For if the Spirit ſtrove to make them better, then ſince that better conſiſted in a Diſcovery of Good and Evil, with an Election of the Good, and a Denyal of the Evil, I would fain know of <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> how that could be, and the Spirit of Truth not be what I have inſtanced in my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Was it not then a <hi>Judge</hi> of what was Good from Evil? A <hi>Rule</hi> how to chuſe one and refuſe the other? A <hi>Guide,</hi> to lead, direct, enable to the Choice, and preſerve in it? O Weak Man! Is this the Upſhot of all thy poor Inſults? But why may not <hi>William Penn</hi> expreſs the Scope of any Scripture in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, though he find not the very Words in the Text, if it will bear them, eſpecially ſince <hi>J. Faldo</hi> himſelf allows it, both in granting that the Spirit ſtrove to make them better, which is not verbally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and by his Weekly Practice of Preaching, where nothing is more frequent then his Expoſition,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47076:115"/>
and after a ſort too, which the Text many times will not bear.</p>
            <p>But he tells me that <hi>my Queſtion is, to prove the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's Teaching indefinitely, or without Difference of Perſons; and my Proof ſpeaks of the Spirit's</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Striving with Wicked Men.</hi> For this he cries out, that <hi>I wander from Truth and Reaſon, and am Infatuated,</hi> queſtioning, <hi>if my Conſcience have any Eyes;</hi> and has Impudence enough to tell me, that <hi>I am beholding to him for giving no further Diſcovery of my Vanity and Folly, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How groundleſs his Cavil and Reflection are, and with what rude and unhandſom Terms he is pleaſed to give them, I need not trouble my ſelf to ſhew; But certainly if God affords Bad Men his Spirit to ſtrive with them; then Good Men, who cannot be ſuch without it, but Senſual and Deviliſh rather, muſt needs have this Holy Spirit, as well to preſerve them, as that is made them ſuch; if ſo, then may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our <hi>Adverſary</hi> Weak, as well as Envious, who from that <hi>Text</hi> denies my Proof of the Univerſality of God's Spirit. For what is it but to ſay, that though all Wicked Men have the Spirit ſtriving, Good Men have it not? Whoſe Conſcience wants Eyes at this time, will not be hard to determine; but ſure I am, it was his Wiſdom to leave off where he did, ſince his reputing my Sober Scriptural Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Infatuation, Folly, &amp;c, was the moſt evident Mark of his own he could well have given us.</p>
            <p>§. 6. The Second Scripture I urge, and which he perverts, is that in <hi>Neh. 3. 20 Thou gaveſt alſo thy Goo<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Spirit to inſtruct them,</hi> which, <hi>ſayes he,</hi> without being ſo Ingenuous as to mention, much leſs conſider, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47076:115"/>
anſwer my Argument upon it, <hi>is mainly the Spirit of God, which he put upon</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Joſhua, for which he quotes <hi>Numb. 11. 17. 27. 18, Pſal.</hi> 77. 20. But does he think us ſo Credulous, as to receive this Stuff for Goſpel? Certainly we muſt commit the greateſt Cruelty upon our Underſtandings to ſtrain them to ſuch a Fiction. He might with as good Reaſon have ſaid, that the Pillar of Cloud by Day, and Fire by Night were ſeen of none but <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as to grant, they had the immediate and general Benefit of them, and at the ſame time deny them to have had the immediate Benefit of the Spirit's Teachings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide had they not had ſome Meaſure of the Spirit of God, they could never have known that <hi>Moſes</hi> had been ſo inſpired, nor have ſo willingly bowed under <hi>Moſes</hi> as they did, and have ſhewn themſelves ſo well aſſured of his Conduct. Nor can the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of their Rebellion at times, invalid our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince it were to ſay, that they ſinned not againſt the Spirit of God in themſelves, but in <hi>Moſes</hi> only. But becauſe they did ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt in themſelves, and that it was the greateſt Ground for Charging of Rebellion againſt them, we may well conclude that they had the Spirit, that is, to Conviction.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures he brings, are no more to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then the Story of <hi>Toby</hi> and his Dog: For though there was the Gift of Spirit poured out upon <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> and others, that was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the People; yet this proves not that they were not without a Meaſure of the Unerring Spirit to teach them what was acceptable with God; The Difference was not, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. had the Spirit, and the People had it not, but that he and ſome
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47076:116"/>
others had the Spirit of Government, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had it not. But what is this for him? <hi>Doth not the ſame Eternal Spirit that teacheth to Rule, alſo teach People to be ruled?</hi> Nay, I affirm, that as God did gift ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral by his Holy Spirit to Govern, and conſequently they had the Spirit; ſo did he beſtow of his Holy Spirit upon the People, to enable them to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Government, and conſequently they had as truly their Meaſure of the Holy Unerring Spirit, as had <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> &amp;c. theirs.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The Third Scripture he would unconcern me in, is this, <hi>And the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them Underſtanding.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">pag. 11, 12.</note> this <hi>he asks</hi> me this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But doth this Incourage Men to caſt off all External Means, and the Uſe of their Reaſon? Nothing leſs,</hi> ſays he; <hi>Nothing leſs,</hi> ſay I too: And who can help it, if he underſtands me ſo; But that he may be as baſe, as baſe can be, he askes this Queſtion as the Reſult of my Argument upon the Place, and never yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers it at all: But I cannot help it, if <hi>J Faldo</hi> will render me a Fool, that he may ſhew himſelf Wiſe, I confeſs he wants ſome ſuch Fool for his Work, and his own Weakneſs may tempt him to that Diſhoneſty. Only I would have the <hi>Reader</hi> know, that Reaſon, Memory and Underſtanding are all uſeful Servants; we deny them not a Place in the Heavenly Work, but as Inſtruments, not Agents; what ſhould not move of themſelves to Religious Worſhip, but in and by the Motions of the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>§. 8. The next Scripture he thinks I abuſe, is this; <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit; or Whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> From whence <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> you can ſcribble thus. If
<q>

God's unerring Spirit be ſo nigh, and the Sence or it ſo certain, it muſt be either to Reprove for Evil done, or to Inform, Uphold, Lead and Preſerve, in reference to all Good: Now, in which of the two ſenſes it ſhall be taken, the Preſence of God's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, &amp; his being the Saints Inſtructer, Judge, Rule and Guide, are evidently deduceable from the Words—<hi>rudis indigeſta<expan>

            <p>And <hi>Reader,</hi> Canſt thou think that my <hi>Adverſary</hi> has taken a fair or probable Way to bring me to my ſelf again, whoſe beſt Arguments are ſordid, ill-bred Names, down-right Lyes and Slanders? I challenge any Man that can ſoberly pretend to Religion, to ſo much as abet this manner of Proceeding againſt me, and the Way I profeſs: if this were to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as it is Antichriſtian;</hi> were I a <hi>Turk,</hi> I ſhould take
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47076:117"/>
great Care I came not within the very Suburbs of ſo baſe a Profeſſion. Where's <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Reading, Learning, Conſcience in this one Paſſage? I will not ſo much as attempt the Defence of my Argument; for it were to ſay, it needed my Aſſiſtance, or that my <hi>Adverſary</hi> had done ſomthing to indanger its Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who has ſo pleaded the Sobriety and Truth of it, by an Oppoſition that could become none but a Creature as for-lorn of all Honeſty as himſelf, that it is a Credit to my Cauſe, almoſt equal with our Clearneſs, that ſo much Rancour and Ignorance ſet themſelves againſt it. This is no leſs Man then your Vaunting, Struting <hi>J. Faldo</hi> his own ſelf, who thinks as well of himſelf, and deſerves as little of it from other Men, as any Perſon that has come within my Ken a long time. In ſhort, whether I am out of my Wits, or he out of all Bounds of good Senſe or Manners, ſhall be left with the <hi>Reader</hi> to determine. For my part; if this be the Way he intends to take to confute his Oppoſers, he is like to anſwer himſelf; And give him his due, he is as good at it as moſt Men I know; and 'tis not to be doubted but he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in that Science.</p>
            <p>§. 9. But he tells me, that my main Fallacies are theſe two; Firſt, <hi>from an Infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit-Teaching. to the Infallibility of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 20.</note> 
               <hi>in which the Spirit dwells as a Teacher.</hi> Next, <hi>from the Spirit's Teaching, to its Immediate and Peculiar Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> If the <hi>Firſt</hi> be true, without any Conſideration had to the Obedience of the Creature, and his being guided by the Holy Spirit, I will yield it to him that I am miſtaken, though not fall aciouſly, that implying a Deſign to do ſo, which I had not: And for the <hi>Second</hi> I am content to ſtand by the Charge, not of a <hi>Fallacy,</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:47076:117"/>
but <hi>our Faith,</hi> and ſuch as is Defenſible both from Scripture and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>For if the Truth of no <hi>Argument</hi> I have made, nor any Expreſſion that has fallen from me, doth ſo much as imply his Charge, let him not be angry with me, that I ſay, <hi>He is one of the baſeſt Perverters among Men:</hi> And if that very Paſſage by which he hopes to prove this great Deceit of mine, is found mute in the Caſe, I hope no <hi>Reader</hi> will be ſo unjuſt as to refuſe me the Cenſure of his being <hi>an Unfair Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. The firſt Place he thinks to make for him, is this; <hi>Quench not the Spirit:</hi> On which I argu'd thus; Thoſe to whom he gave the Caution had the Spirit, if thoſe could not quench it, that had it not, conſequently the primitive Churches were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Unerring Spirit. To which he ſayes, <hi>but ſuppoſe they had the Spirit, it is a miſerable erronious and weak Concluſion, that they were Infallible.</hi> How far this makes for him, or rather how greatly he has miſtaken me is evident, if it may be conſidered that there is not one Word of any Man's being Infallible in all my Argument; only that the primitive Churches had an Infallible Spirit, not of their own, or from themſelves, but from God; and that they were only ſo in their Knowledge or Determinations from the unerring Guidance of God's Spirit; unleſs they either were without the Anointing, or that the Anointing was Fallible, both which are contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in that noted paſſage, 1. 2. 27. So that my <hi>Adverſary</hi> is manifeſtly guilty of that Fault He doth with no ſmall Aggravation charge upon me, <hi>viz,</hi> That from my Arguing the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the primitive Churches, having the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47076:118"/>
of God to direct them, from the Impoſſibility of their Quenching what they had not, he makes me to conclude <hi>the Infallibility of the Churches, whether they were led by it or no;</hi> As if I intended to plead the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of private Spirits, and not rather of the Holy Spirit of God, and ſuch only as were conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it.</p>
            <p>§. 11. His other Cavil confirms the Truth of my former Argument, and his own great Ignorance or Baſeneſs. My words are theſe, <hi>If God ſends forth his Spirit into the Hearts of his Children, then are they not without an Infallible Spirit,</hi> grounded upon that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts</hi> Gal. 4. 6. To which he ſayes; <hi>Your Adverſaries have not ſo little Knowledge of the Spirit of God, as to ſay the Spirit of God is Fallible, nor yet ſo Ignorant of your Spirits and of the Scripture, as to ſay, you are Infallible.</hi> Now I have two things to deſire of the Ingenuous <hi>Reader; Firſt</hi> to find me out ſo much as one Syllable in my Argument, that infers or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Spirits of ſuch to be Infallible, into whoſe Hearts God has ſhed abroad his Infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whether they are led by it or not; or that I could intend a concluding of the Spirit of Man In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, becauſe God has given his own unto Men, that is unqueſtionably ſo? I am ſure ſuch a Thought never entred my Mind, as fruitful of them as our <hi>Adverſary</hi> may be; <hi>Adverſary</hi> I may well ſay, not only becauſe he is one, but that he acknowledges to me as much, which let him know however, I am not ſuch to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing I have to deſire of the Candid <hi>Reader,</hi> is, that he would weigh with himſelf, how Unjuſt this Man is to me, to infer Infallibility to Men,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47076:118"/>
from my Affirming it to belong only to the Spirit of God; And as if he fear'd, I ſhould not be as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox as his Envy would have me, to conclude on my Account from what I urged to prove, <hi>That God's Children in all Ages had an Infallible Spirit to Judge, Rule, and Guide them; the Affirmative of the very Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion debated (that is, God's Spirit) That every ſuch one was Infallible in and from his own private Spirit.</hi> Oh Monſtrous Perverſion! I would impute it to his Miſtake of me, it being far better to be Ignorant than Diſhoneſt, but he will not let me, who a little below has Impudence enough to write; but we are NOT IGNORANT, <hi>that your Principles make no Difference, or Diſtinction between the Spirits of God's People and the Spirit of God;</hi> manifeſtly intending, (not that they are at variance, for ſo we ſhould eſteem his Charge a piece of Juſtice, but) that the Spirit of the Creature and the Spirit of God are but one Spirit; An Abſurdity that never fell from us. How many times hath <hi>J. Faldo</hi> been guilty in his Diſcourſe of plain Forgery and Diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty againſt us. So certain as there is a God in Heaven, terrible will his Judgment be in that great Day of Inqueſt, if he repent not.</p>
            <p>§. 12. He makes a great Stir about my Checking the late <hi>Socinian,</hi> for making Chriſt the Head of a Fallible Body, ſaying <hi>If Chriſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>be Head to none but the Infallible, Wo to the poor Saints, who have truſted hitherto they had a Head in Heaven who hath Pitty on the Ignorant, and thoſe that are out of the Way; and I am ſure Chriſt is then none of your Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have enough and leave his very Ill Language out. (1.) It is granted to us, that Chriſt is Head
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47076:119"/>
to a Fallible Body, or at leaſt to Fallible as well as Infallible. I charge him to give us one Scripture for this, or he is gone, for all his idle Puns, Shifts, and ſcoffing Flings at us. (2.) That a Man may be a Saint, which if we take it ſtrictly is one of that Number the Apoſtle prayed the Churches might be of, I mean thoſe which were ſanctified throughout, in Body, Soul and Spirit, I ſay, that a Man may be ſuch a Saint, and yet be Fallible or Erring. (3.) That the Saints are Ignorant and out of the Way; Truly, this Doctrine very well becomes <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> I had rather it ſhould be his then mine; I will venture them in the Scale of Truth, without thinking I run an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in the Matter, eſpecially when, if I err, that hinders not from being a Saint &amp; Member of Chriſt: But, <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> can a Man be a Saint, and yet Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſo much of God as is requiſit to conſtitute him ſuch? Or can he be ſuch, and yet out of that Way which renders him a true Saint? It is the firſt time that I ever heard in ſo many words, that a Man might be a Saint, and out of God's Way. Oh Doctrine of Devils! No Marvel ſo many Unclean Fowls flock to this Carkaſs. What! <hi>Saints,</hi> and err from God's Way? Strange! <hi>Saints,</hi> and ignorant of God's Mind? It ſeems then, that neither Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor Erring from God's Way, indiſpoſe any to be Saints. If this be not a plain Contradiction to the whole Record of Scripture, none ever was, is, or ſhall be eſteemed ſuch to the End of the World; How many, how grievous, and how ſharp have God's Complaints been againſt thoſe who have left the Right Way of the Lord, which has been the <hi>Way of Light</hi> and Righteouſneſs, <hi>the Juſt Man's Path through every Generation?</hi> No Wonder that ſuch Doctrines are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47076:119"/>
hoth greedily received and furiouſly maintained, that ſooth up People in the Belief of ſuch Pernicious Soul-murdering Doctrines. And the Truth is, and I do boldly affirm it, and that in the Counſel of the Eternal God, it is our ſtriking ſo conſtantly and earneſtly at this and ſuch like Sin-pleaſing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that makes the Devil thus beſtir himſelf in his ready Agents, to raiſe up, and beſpatter us with ſuch heavy Calumnies, as almoſt every one produceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. But we loſe not an Inch of Ground nor a Dram of Courage, our Godly Reſolution redoubles, with our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> On-ſets; and whatever may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us here, as our Hope, ſo our Reward is from God, in that high and heavenly Place, which is above the Reach of Time, and every Aſſault of our Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <hi>Adverſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 13. He tells me, <hi>He might proceed to my fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arguing from the Spirit's Teaching indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely expreſſed</hi> (that is, by Scripture, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <note place="margin">pag. 24.</note> Providences, &amp;c. means our Adverſary) <hi>to its Teaching peculiarly, frequently in my Pampblet,</hi> pag. 18, 29, &amp;c. that is, to the Spirit's Teaching Men and Women by its daily and Inward Diſcoveries, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Operations. <hi>But he will not;</hi> the Reaſon is, he dare not; For if the Spirit be not an Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Living Teacher, and works not as ſuch, to the Information, Conviction and Converſion of Men to God in theſe dayes, let him for Shame relinquiſh all Pretence to Goſpel, or an Evangelical Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, of which it is the peculiar Promiſe and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Though for want of better Language he is pleaſed to beſtow upon this Godly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the Term of <hi>Beetle-headed Saying,</hi>

and affirms, that <hi>the Scripture knows nothing of it;</hi> For which I may more reaſonably affirm, that <hi>He</hi> knows nothing of it: For can this Man be ſo beſotted, as to think, that when a Meaſure of the Spirit was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all to profit with; and that the Children of God were led by the Spirit of God, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that was ſent into the Hearts of the Sons of God, and the Anointing that was in the Saints that was able to teach them all things, was any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Part or Parcel of the Prophets or Apoſtles Writings? I cannot yet think him ſo Blinded, as Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or Envious as he is. Either theſe Paſſages are no Scripture, or that groſs Abſurdity muſt follow.</p>
            <p>§. 15. But he tells us that <hi>we may be miſtaken, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince ſome of us thought</hi> Paul Hobſon'<hi>s Mumbling through a Trunck, &amp; an Hole in the</hi>

               <hi>Wall to be the Voice of the Lord.</hi> But were it as true, as it is in many things falſe, it ſhews the Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> who dar'd to take the Lord's Name in his Mouth, and counterfeit a Solemn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a poor whimſical Wretch; and as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, out of a Spirit of Covetouſneſs and Inho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality, for he had no Mind to give him longer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; ſo that not knowing how better to be rid of him then to forge a Commiſſion, wickedly contrived a Paſſage into the Chamber where the Man lay, and through a Trunk prophanely utterred a kind of Commiſſion, to go to a certain place, where, I cannot tell; but I am ſure, as the Story goes, out of his Houſe, to whom his little Victuals had been a Burden; A Practice for the Avarice, Prophaneneſs and Abuſe of it, to be abhorred and deteſted of all ſober Men. And I think the Man more excuſable
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47076:120"/>
under his Miſtake then Major <hi>Hobſon,</hi> who ventur'd into ſo much Wickedneſs, &amp; that with Deſign to bring him into it. 'Tis true, that ſuch a Man there was, that he went to Major <hi>Hobſons</hi> Houſe, that he dealt ſo wickedly by the Man to be rid of him, that the Man had been among us; but as his Practice ſhew'd him to be none of us, ſo was not any of his Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons countenanced by us, but ſharply rebuk'd; and therefore that part of <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Reflection a Lye: Yet, ſince he has gotten this Story by the End, I will ſee how much better grounded <hi>J. Faldo</hi> would be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Principles againſt a <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſhould he be ſo Impious as to put the ſame prophane Abuſe upon him. Suppoſe <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> either by a Trunk, or Hole through a Wall, or one of the new invented Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, that carry a Voice a Mile, ſhould have as far as Words go, a very ſolemn Commiſſion to go preach the Goſpel in any other Place then <hi>Barnet</hi> (where I hear, he now lives) within this Iſle, or ſome more remote Part of the World, and that not only once or twice, but many times joyn'd with Threats and Promiſes; I will ſuppoſe his Inclinations will lie at home, unleſs more be to be gotten (an Infallible Ground of Motion with many of his Tribe) But I would know of him, which Way, or upon what Foot he would Receive or Reject ſuch a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The Scripture makes no mention of any ſuch thing in Particular; in General it will not reach it, becauſe this is no other Goſpel, that he ſhould be required to preach, then that which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be according to Scripture. I ſay, with what would he reliſh, ſavour, or try this Voice? Would he reject it, becauſe the Scripture did not particularly own it? There is the ſame Reaſon why he ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47076:121"/>
it, becauſe it does not particularly deny it. How will he do then? Why perhaps he will go, becauſe there is no General in Scripture that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it. But how does he know, that ſo many good Words in themſelves were ſpoken from God, and not to deceive, tempt or abuſe him? 'Tis true, the Scripture has general Denials to Falſe Spirits, and general Teſtimonies to the Motions of the True One, but ſtill here's but a Begging of the Queſtion; for how ſhall I know that the Voice or Spirit be True or Falſe? It is not Unſcriptural, Unreaſonable, nor Improbable. Alas for <hi>John Faldo!</hi> Have all his Preaching, Praying, Writing, &amp;c. no better Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation then Hear-ſay, Imitation, ſtrong Fancy and external Senſe? <hi>Can he not ſavour and reliſh Spirits as well as Words?</hi> If not, he may truly be ſtyled a Man of Words, but void of that Spirit which tryes Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and gives right Diſcerning to all that believe in it, and are led by it; of thoſe things that may concern them. I might ſay much upon this Theme, but let this ſuffice to detect the Weak Foundation of <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Faith, Knowledge and Practice; and that ſuch as he, though pretendedly 2 or 3 degrees more refined then the preſent Proteſtants, are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably apoſtatized from the Firſt Revolters from <hi>Romes</hi> Idolatries, who aſſerted, none could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures themſelves, much leſs benefit by them, who had not the ſame Spirit that gave them forth; conſequently <hi>the Spirit, and not the Scriptures were the Principal Cauſe of Right Knowledge, and Rule for our very Underſtanding of them.</hi> And truly though <hi>J. Faldo</hi> would have the World think he both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles very well, and has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed them very clearly; yet whether he will give
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47076:121"/>
me leave or no, I will make him ſpeak the Language of the <hi>Quakers</hi> paſſing well in this particular of the Spirits being the Judge, Rule and Guide of Faith, Worſhip and Converſation, the thing aim'd at in that Firſt Part of my <hi>Spirit of Truth Vindicated,</hi> by him ſo much quarrell'd at, perverted and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly abuſed, or elſe I greatly miſtake his Mind. And, which will be much to my Defence, he muſt likewiſe have done ſo himſelf. Hear him.</p>
            <p>§. 16. <hi>But Mr.</hi> Penn, <hi>do you deal fairely and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly with your Adverſaries to imply in your Queſtion that we deny the Spirit of God to be a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 15.</note> 
               <hi>proper Rule of Faith, Guide of Life, Judge of Truth? You know that we own it to be ſuch; and that it doth both</hi> IN THE CONSCIENCE <hi>and by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Creation and Providence perform ſuch Acts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and is to ſuch Purpoſes, &amp; that of Right;</hi> What can we ſay more? Has he not ſtrangly miſ-underſtood us? Again, <hi>Only we deny that the Spirit alwayes performs theſe Acts without the Uſe of the Scripture or any External Means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly and ſo do we; For we daily enjoy the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit both of God's Spirit by the Scripture, and publick Worſhip, as Means. If this be the Grindſtone my Noſe is to be held at, and by not mentioning of which (as he falſly ſayes of me) I abuſe and trifle him and my unwary <hi>Reader,</hi> I am contented to abide here while I live, as my Diſcourſe at large upon the Scriptures muſt needs have informed thoſe who have read it. But I am of the Mind that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> will finde it too hot for him, and I am aſſured that ſo much Conceſſion overturnes him for ever, as to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Baſis;</hi> For that he ſhould oppoſe my Diſcourſe that intended nothing more then to prove God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be the Great Rule to Believers, and yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47076:122"/>
after much Oppoſition, to give it away, and accord as far as any Man need to do, that would be of one Mind with us in the Point, ſavours of great Weakneſs and Inadvertency; not, that he now ſpeaks Truth, but that he ſhould ſo eager ly oppoſe it before.</p>
            <p>§. 17. There is one Paſſage more, which being to this Purpoſe, I will mention; <hi>We value not the Senſe (of the Scripture) for the Print's</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>ſake, but the Print for the Senſe ſake, and the Bleſſings that attend that Way of Conveying the holy and revealed Will of God, and ſo much as to correct your Vapour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he ſpeaks upon my Words, that the Intimate of a <hi>Prince</hi> needs not ſo much an Edict becauſe in Print, as becauſe of his living and more immediate Touches he may have had from his <hi>Prince.</hi> Now let any tell me if the <hi>Quakers</hi> have put the Scriptures into any degree below that, wherein <hi>J. Faldo</hi> himſelf has plac'd them. Do the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay that true Chriſtians have the Spirit; ſo ſayes <hi>J. Faldo</hi> too: Do the <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm that the Spirit of God is a Judge, Rule and Guide and ſpeaks forth the Mind of God into the very Conſcience; Does <hi>J. Faldo</hi> come one Jot behind them? But do they ſay, that it is the Senſe of the Truth declared of in the Scripture that puts a Value upon the Declaration? and that written or printed Words are valu'd for the Matters ſake they treat of, rather then their <note place="margin">part. 3. pag. 30.</note> own? yea, that the Scripture of it ſelf can do little? It is <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <note place="margin">part. 1. pag. 108.</note> Very well! But does <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſay, that God doth not alwayes ſpeak in the Conſcience immediately by his Spirit, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Spirit through the Uſe of Means, as the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47076:122"/>
Scriptures, Preaching, Praying, Creator, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that by ſuch wayes he reacheth into the Conſciences of Men? ſo ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> too. Would the Man but be certain to himſelf, we needed no other Advocate; But his Ignorance of our Principles, or Prejudice to miſ-repreſent them makes him at once oppoſe us, and contradict himſelf.</p>
            <p>And now we are come to the Concluſion of the Matter, which he ſayes, is, <hi>to ſhew me my ſelf in the Glaſs of Senſe, if I think my Eyes worth an Uſing.</hi> Indeed I do, and am willing to behold all he hath to ſhew me<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ſay, was the Language of your Adverſaries ſmal Crier, but as you call it, of a loathſome Sent.</hi> It ſeems <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Noſe calls it no ſuch thing; A long experienced <hi>Chaplin,</hi> a kind of a Religious Gentleman-Uſher, ſhould have learned better Manners.</p>

            <p>It is ſome Juſtice to us, that he will account ſuch Language to a <hi>Quaker</hi> a Fault.

            <p>I toſs not beyond the Bounds of Scripture and Truth; my Arguments were ſhort and plain, and what I writ was in Conſcience and Seriouſneſs, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meriting ſuch rough and flaſhy Reflection from any Perſon pretending to seriouſneſs, and leaſt of all, one that I never had to do with in my Life. <hi>Dreams</hi> I have none, they lie on <hi>J.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47076:124"/>
and that is <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Condition, who ſcoffs at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Knowledge without External Means, though to his own Conſuſion he ſometime reads another Lecture. I am no <hi>Man of Noiſe,</hi> further then your Noiſe makes me. The Profeſſion of the Way I am in, I came to through Sorrow for Sin, Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the World, Deſires after God, and Life that is Everlaſting; and ever ſince God has enabled me to his Service, (and here I hope to ſtand while I live) My Life, Spirit, Power and Principle wars againſt all yours that are embattell'd againſt us; and no Quarter I proclaim, in the Name of the Lord, to that wicked Spirit that acts you all againſt us, though to you Peace and Salvation, <hi>if ye Repent.</hi> Do you leave off your Envious Endeavours againſt us, or elſe blame your ſelves, and not us, for appearing on the Stage againſt us.</p>

            <p>This, <hi>Reader,</hi> is a ſhort Account of ſome of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom Entertainment I, a Stranger to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> have received at his hands. May my Soul never come within his Habitation; Prejudice, Envy and Cruelty lodge with him; Vanity, Frothineſs and Incivility are like Veins through his Book, and ſerve to convey what Life it has to ſuch as pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with that baſe kind of <hi>Satyre.</hi> Strange that it ſhould be reputed ſo Criminal by <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> to check my <hi>Adverſary</hi> for Abuſing me and my Friends by Name, when yet he exceeds in his Reflections upon us, and that without any ſuch Occaſion given! But, if we were condemnable, ſure I am, it belongs not to <hi>J. Faldo</hi> to fling the firſt Stone. I am very willing to leave it with all ſober <hi>Readers,</hi> our Circumſtances conſidered, which of us ought to be accounted the <hi>Unfair Adverſary.</hi> Oh, when will it fall to my Share to engage a ſober modeſt <hi>Adverſary!</hi> But why do I wiſh for that, ſince ſuch are our Friends. Well, it will greatly become me to be contented with my Lot; Faith I have, theſe things will not laſt long; and Patience will give to ſee the End of that Belief. A little foul Weather, and our Enemies are for their Creeks again; 'Tis natural with Inſects to ſting,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47076:125"/>
and Frogs to croak in Summer; and therefore it is, that our Beſt Actions are Evil in the Sight of theſe carping <hi>Zoilus</hi>'s If a Man be one of them, then a Saint, though a Devil: if gone from them, then a Devil, though a Saint. Such is his Farewel to me, who in three Lines tells me, he is a little pleaſant, he cannot ſweat about Cracking of Nuts, and yet that he has had ſome Heart-akes for me. Miſerable Man! Does Levity and Seriouſneſs go together? Froth and Sorrow keep Company? What would any Man give for ſuch Heart-akes, that bring true ones upon a ſerious Mind? But what are his Heart-akes? Why, he bewails, that a Man of my Hopes ſhould be thus left of God (he fears for Pride and Giddineſs) as to be made a Pillar of Salt, &amp;c. It ſeems then that there were once Hopes: But to what? To a Party. I know you very well, you will few of you ſtand by all that I could ſay and prove of ſome of you: I would adviſe ſuch Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to be quiet, enjoy their Toleration, a Kindneſs as great as they deſerve, and mind their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and now their Hands are tyed againſt the Powers, not employ them upon our Shoulders. But why ſhould God leave me, a <hi>Sufferer,</hi> from 14 Yeares of Age for Conſcience ſake (he feares) for Pride and Giddineſs? But the Cauſe of my leaving you, was that of my once frequenting you, I mean Conſcience; when ſome I then diſſented from, had as hard Names to give, for that non-Conformity. But the Truth is, when the <hi>King</hi> came Firſt in, at what time you were a little dejected, there was ſomething more Serious and Tender then ordinary revived among ſome of you, which did begin to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the National Pollution, and ſit for a

I heed not, for what I am at this Day I am by, through, and to God Almighty the Righteous <hi>Lord</hi> of Heaven and Earth alone. It is baſely done of any Man, that is a Profeſſor, who pretends to ſome Acquaintance with tender Conſcience, and thoſe Tryals that attend it, to cenſure another Man's Change and Afflictions for Counterfeit and meer Deſigne. Oh! The Righteous God will reckon with ſuch Uncharitable, Diſingenuous, Perverſe Spirits in the Day that haſteneth to Try all, and then will he recompenſe this ungodly Cenſurer of an Innocent Stranger to him, who, were I upon my Tryal at the Bar of his own Party, there be of them enough to give Evidence of another Spirit then that of vain Glory or Self; For where none of theſe things have indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but Sharpeneſs and Severities have met me, there

has been a Faithful Anſwering of Convictions, to ſome of their knowledge, who I believe, to be better Men then to refuſe me a ful Teſtimonial, if ſought for. But as I ſhall not think my ſelf ſo deeply engag'd or my Reputation ſo ſhaken in the Minds of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, as to need or deſire it by any Power or Force <hi>J. Faldo</hi> can attacque me with; ſo ſhall I leave the Concern of God's Truth, the Innocency of his People in General, and my own in Particular, to his Holy Wiſdom and Providence, who, we are well ſatisfied, will plead our Cauſe in the Conſciences of Ten Thouſands to the Shame and utter Confuſion of all our Obſtinate <hi>Adverſaries.</hi>

               <p> We ſay, That True Faith in Chriſt cannot be without Works, no more then a Body can live without a Spirit; Nay, by the Compariſon, if they were ſeparable, Works being compared to the Spirit, would have the better. The very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of any is an Act of the Mind, and therefore a Work to God; and no ſooner is that Faith begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but it falls to Working which is both the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and End of it: Nor do we ſay, that our very beſt Works, proceeding from True Faith it ſelf, can merit; No, nor Faith joyn'd with them: All that Man is capable of Believing or Performing, can never merit; There can be no Proportion (as there muſt be in Merit) between the beſt Faith, and Works of three ſcore and ten, and Eternal Felicity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that Man can do, even with the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, can never ſo merit, but that Right Faith and Good Works (which will follow it) may, and do obtain that bleſſed Immortality, it pleaſeth Almighty God to give and priviledge the Sons of Men with, who perform that neceſſary Condition and that we groundedly and therefore boldly affirm. So that we deny all Merit from the beſt of Works, eſpecially by ſuch as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are wont to conceive Meritorious: But as we on the one Hand do ſtifly deny them, ſo neither can we joyn with that lazy Faith which works not. Let not Good Works make Men <hi>Papiſts</hi> becauſe they make Men <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> I am ſure, Believing and not Working, and conceiving a Salvation from Wrath, where there is no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Sin, the Cauſe of it, is no whit leſs un-ſcriptural, and abundantly more Pernicious and

Spirit of Anti-Chriſt, Outward Court; that is, <hi>ſays he,</hi> all Ordinances, Worſhip, Faith, Obedience that have any Form, though Chriſt's and Goſpel Forms, being <hi>(with them)</hi> the Worſhip of <hi>Heathens,</hi> not of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. P.</hi> This <hi>Key</hi> opens into as many Forgeries as ever I knew one <hi>Key</hi> do in my Life. Certainly, were not this Man left of God for his Enmity, he could never run into ſuch extravagant Diſhoneſty. What! Belye us in the Sight of all? Indeed, it turns upon himſelf: For Viſible Worſhip, the Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faith and Obedience to every Ordinance of God we own, profeſs, and practiſe daily and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly through the Power of our God; in whoſe Name we renounce his Conſtructions, and trample upon all his Malice, black and enrag'd as it is.</p>

               <hi>J. F. pag. 89.</hi> THE VAIL IS OVER THEM, that is, <hi>ſays J. Faldo,</hi> the Belief of the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which was of our Nature to be the Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. P.</hi> Let this be the Laſt (though ſeveral more might be obſerved) which at this time ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, in which we ſhall ſee that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> has done like himſelf, and the Man we have all along taken him to be. <hi>The Vail is over them,</hi> it is a Scripture-Phraſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. uſed by the Apoſtle to expreſs the Darkneſs and Ignorance that to that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd over the Underſtanding of the <hi>Jews</hi> in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, and this Vail he makes us to interpret after this groſs and abſurd manner, namely. That the <hi>Vail</hi> is the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt. Wicked Man! Did ever <hi>Quaker</hi> ſo irreverently expreſs himſelf? Give us his Name, or tell us in what Book we may find it. What greater Malice couldſt thou have ſhown, then thus unjuſtly to pervert the Scripture in our Name,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47076:135"/>
belying and abuſing both? As if, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Fleſh</hi> is called a Vail, and the Ignorance of the <hi>Jews</hi> a Vail, that therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt of Neceſſity mean by Vail in the firſt ſenſe, Vail in the ſecond ſenſe; as if the Way to have the Vail rent, were to deny the Man Chriſt Jeſus; which were to make Chriſt rend and deſtroy himſelf, who, as the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit, alone rends all Vails of the Hearts of Unbelievers. Nor indeed have I met with one Term abſurd, or un-intelligible, unleſs the Scripture uſe ſuch; therefore 'tis an Untruth to ſtile them abſurd, and a Contradiction in him to offer at Explaining any thing, that is truly un-intelligible.</p>
            <p>And that all the World may behold the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> how Ill he governs himſelf againſt the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> (which makes not a little for them) let his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Epithetes and Expreſſions be well weighed. I think they are ſo naked they want no <hi>Key;</hi> and glad we are he found no ſuch Subjects from us to treat upon in his. <q>

            <p>This <hi>Reader</hi> is a Taſte of the Spirit of the Man, &amp; ſince he contends for the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be his Rule, I would fain have the <hi>Chapter</hi> &amp; <hi>Verſe</hi> that will abet this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Is this <hi>J. Faldo's Religion, Goſpel, Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Learning,</hi> Civility, or whatever may be reputed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Commendable? Away, away for Shame! It would ſtumble a <hi>Turk</hi> to hear ſuch Language from one that calls himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Miniſter</hi> too.</p>
            <p>But is it after ſo great Abuſe, ſo manifeſt Injury done us and the Truth too, that thou dareſt ſay, as thou doſt, <hi>I have the Witneſs in my Conſcience</hi> (who haſt been thus long Under-valuing it for a <hi>Glow-Worm,</hi> and <hi>Idol,</hi> a poor Creature, Uncertain, Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Errable, and what not) <hi>that I have not in this</hi> Key <hi>in any meaſure abuſed, or wronged the</hi> Quakers.</p>
            <p>Hadſt thou been half ſo <hi>Moral,</hi> as thou pretendeſt to be <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I doubt not, but to have ſeen more Truth and Moderation. To belye any, is a great Evil; but to do it with a ſhew of Religion, to call God's Witneſs, to palliate ſuch Injuſtice, is the height of Blaſphemy againſt God, and Wrong to thy

Neighbour. Never more abuſe Religion with a Pretence to it, nor for Shame profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that art Inferior to a thouſand <hi>Heathens,</hi> who rather then not compaſs our Diſ-grace, will endeavour it <hi>per fac, per nefas,</hi> Right or Wrong: I am ſure the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in thy own Conſcience never ſuggeſted this Unrighteous Proceed; though wonder we muſt, that one, who has ſaid ſo many detracting things of him, ſhould now appeal to him. Certainly, if the Witneſs of God be <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Rule and Judge, as his own Appeal makes him, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are the leſs to be blam'd for Believing in him, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be Lead by him; but we are well aſſured, that a Spirit of deep Prejudice hath animated him to, and through this Work, and not the Holy Witneſs of God, as both the Stile and Matter have abundantly teſtified. My Deſire is; that before the Evil one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate him into further Enmity againſt us, by a ſerious Retirement of Mind to the Holy Witneſs of God, that gives a good Underſtanding, and brings juſt Reproof for every Unrighteous Thought, Word, &amp; Deed. He may come to a Sight of his preſent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to be contrary to the Mind of God, and know true Repentance for it, and find Mercy of the Lord God: Which I heartily deſire, and it is my return to him for all his hard Speeches utter'd by him either againſt us in general, or my ſelf (though unknown to him) in particular.</p>
