            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Therefore my bowels and heart is more open in this unto all, because many have erred for lack of knowledge, and have wandred aside, because they have not found a true guide. Therefore in dear love unto all upon the face of the Earth, where this may come, I write and let out my bosome into this thing, that they may also be partakers with me of the free love of God, and the free grace of God, by which I am saved, and know the <hi>wall which is salvation, and the gates which are praise,</hi> which the Saints are compassed about with, and enterd in at; and for the sake of such who thirst after God, and the knowledge of him, I write for their information, and not to satisfie critical men, nor them who are in the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and vain deceit, who are swollen big in their fleshly understanding, and puffed up in their earthly mindes; for by such I desire not any testimony, neither accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But now to come to speak of that which many are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about; that is to say, the grace of God which bringeth salvation, which hath appeared to all men, whether this be a sufficient Leader and Teacher of it selfe, if it be received; but in order to the thing in hand, let all take notice of this, that when I speak of the sufficiency of grace, and that it is a

Oh! that all that long after him may wait for him in patience, in that wherein he will appear, they shall see him, whose sight will be a recompence for all longing, and thirsting, and desiring, and waiting, the sense of longing and thirsting will be taken away, when he that makes glad the heart appeareth, who lifteth up the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and maketh whole them whose hearts have been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for him whom their souls loved; therefore all wait, and think not the time long: Keep in your minds to his grace, which is his appearance, and him you will feel, and see, and be satisfied, and say, <hi>This is he we have waited for, let us rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for now he is come, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with him,</hi> to give every one that wait upon him in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, full contentment and satisfaction, where peace comes to be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God which teacheth to deny all ungodlinesse and worldly lusts,</hi> that hath beset and compassed the creature about as a thick cloud, and always maketh war against the soule; that till there be a listning unto that which sheweth ungodlinesse, which hath power in it selfe. None hath power neither dominion over that in themselves, which leads into the transgression: Therefore, though God who is salvation it selfe, hath let out himself so farre, and hath appeared in his pure and perfect grace unto all men, yet all have not received grace; For, though the Lord profer his gift intentionally, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might receive it, and so have benefit, and partake of its living vertue and operation; yet while that hath prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in man, which is contrary to grace, that will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, because it is contrary to the life of the corruptible, and takes its life away, and mortifies and slayes the enmity; therefore all must be still and quiet, and wait in that which is pure of the Lord, that they may feel that raised up (which receiveth grace) above the corruptible thoughts and desires of the carnall mind; but many who talk of free grace, have put no difference betwixt the precious and the vile, but hath put them upon doing and working, who are in the enmity, and curse, and in death, and so hath brought forth dead works; notwithstanding all performances, they being dead to the life God; another acteth in them, even he which hath the power of Death, which is the Devill, and so have not known that which was precious in themselves, could not minister unto that which was precious in others; but have been Ministers of Death, and have ministred to Death, and so Death nourisheth it selfe in all them who are not yet come to the separation, to see betwixt the precious and the vile.</p>

               <p>Obj. <hi>But further, some may say, If that it be saving grace, or at the least a degree, and a measure of saving grace, that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, then how is it that all are not saved by it?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Because I would all stumbling blocks were removed away, that the path might be made plain, that all might come to believe in that which is Gods gift, in which there is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and sufficiency; therefore I am constrained by the grace of God to declare of it, and to bear witness to it thus larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which I know will be to the edification of all that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after righteousness. All are not saved by it, because they believe not in it, neither are taught by it, yet its validity, power and vertue, is nevertheless in it self, and though them that are careless and heedless, say we feel no power nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in it to save us from sin, yet this makes not void their confidence who have received it, and knows its power, which hath given them power, and also sufficiency to do the will of God; what though unbelievers, who are in the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, say there is no beauty in Christ, neither form nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; this makes not his glory void, <hi>who is the express I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the father, full of grace and truth</hi>; the Disciples saw it, and bore record of him, who were in the faith, and the Pharisees said he had a devil, who were in the unbelief; but in brief, this is my testimony, that the grace of God, the perfect gift of God, which shews ungodliness, and leads from ungodliness all that are taught by it, is a sufficient teacher of it self, I mean, as the power of Christ through it is made manifest unto all them that hearken to it; <hi>Paul</hi> a Minister of the word of reconciliation, who <hi>was rapt up into the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he saw things unutterable,</hi> came to be tempted and buffetted with the messenger of Satan, and fear and doubting rose up in him, and he prayed unto God thrice, and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was given unto him, <hi>my grace is sufficient for thee</hi>; so this is evident to all understandings, who are opened by the Lord, that which shewed him the temptations, and Satans messengers, and Satans buffetings, was sufficient to preserve

him, and so is it for all who singly are kept to it and in it, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to shew ungodliness because of its purity, and to lead from worldly lusts by its power, and to teach the will of God, and to live like unto God in this present world; and this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony I bear of it, and to it, even what as I have felt, and tasted, and handled of its sufficiency, and vertue, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of its operation, for the confirmation of the same truth, which is believed by many brethren, and also for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them who thirst after the Lord, and for the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of all the gainsayers and opposers of it; which testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I commend to that of God in every man, which will witness me herein in the day of God, when all hearts is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and all falshoods and truth is made manifest, in the mean time shall rest in that which I have declared of, in which there is pure and perfect peace.</p>
