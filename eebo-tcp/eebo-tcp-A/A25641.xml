            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Anſwers to the Reaſons againſt paſsing the Earl of CLEVELANDS Bill as to the Mannors of <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Hackney</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <label>TO the firſt.</label> The Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi> hath not a proper remedy in <hi>Chancery</hi> more than 20. years being paſt ſince many of the forfeitures, and admit the ſuggeſtion be true, it cannot be reaſonable that the ſurpluſage of Equity ſhould abate the Remedy, and whether it is not better that a Cauſe of ſo great conſequence as this, ſhould be decided in a ſhort time by one Bill in Parliament, than to continue ſome years in <hi>Chancery</hi> upon hundreds of Bills which muſt be, there being hundreds who have ſeverall intereſts (and no decree can be made againſt any not parties to the Suite) let Reaſon decide. The anſwer to the latter part of this Reaſon is included in the Anſwer to the Third Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Second and Sixth.</label> The Second admits the Earls cauſe equitable, by acknowledging a power of redemption once in him, which if loſt at all, it was by his conſtant, and faithful attending of the late King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, and his Majeſty that now is, ſo that what is offered gives a diſloyal badge to the Author of the Reaſons plainly aſſerting, That ſerving King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, and his Majeſty that now is, ſhall be ſo far from ſuppo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting, as it ſhall deſtroy the Earls power of Redemption.</p>
            <p>Then to ſay, This will go to all perſons that were of the ſame ſide with the Earl, is as Irrationall as Factious, for the Equity of Redemption to all perſon; who ſerved the KING, does not appear as the Earls does upon Record in the Houſe of Lords, to which Records all perſons might reſort.</p>
            <p>Then conſider the abſurd partiality couched in the pretended Reaſons; by the Sixth it's urged, That becauſe many Martiners are beyond Sea, who are concerned in the Settlements, therefore the Earl ſhould not be releived; yet in the Second the Earl's ſervice to the KING, which as hath been ſaid, was the cauſe he loſt his opportunity of Redeeming, is thought inſufficient to preſerve his Equity, the conſequence whereof will be, That the meaneſt perſon who goes beyond Sea for his own private gain, ſhall be more regarded than a Loyal Peere, who to his preſent loſſe, hazzards his life to aſſiſt the KING; beſides if he who hath Right to the Mannors of <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Hackney</hi> muſt have no relief, till all the Tenants are in <hi>England,</hi> he ſhall never have any.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the third.</label> That the incumbrances upon the Mannors contracted by the Earl, began in 1631. <hi>viz.</hi> a Statute of 10000 l. <hi>July</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1631. to the Lady <hi>Weld</hi> for payment of 5000 l. with intereſt, and divers other great ſummes, as by the Schedule annexed to the Bill appears; So that of neceſſity the Bill muſt look back to take in the firſt incumbrance, elſe a clear Eſtate cannot be ſetled in the Truſtees, to make a good ſale.</p>
            <p>The Earl deſires not to avoid his own acts, but to ſecure the Purchaſers: for finding that ſome acts of his were done after great Debts contracted, and Statutes and Judgements given for ſecurities, and that Purchaſers might loſe their Purchaſe Money, (if the precedent incumbrances (as by Law they may and will) ſhould be laid upon ſuch purchaſed Eſtates, <note place="margin">Not above three <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

And if a Proviſo be admitted, that the Bill ſhall not extend to ſuch Purchaſes, then every Creditor, who hath a precedent incumbrance by Statute, Judgement, &amp;c. will be debarred of his debt, which the Law gives him.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Fourth and Fifth.</label> The legal poſſeſſion in the whole Eſtate was in Sir <hi>Iohn Weld</hi> (till the pretended Act for Sale of Delinquents Lands) by vertue of a Statute of 10000 l. entred into 1631. which ought ſtill to remain in him; yet he is contented to wave his legal poſſeſſion, that all Creditors may be ſatisfied, therefore thoſe who never had any legal poſſeſſion have no juſt cauſe to complain.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the Seventh.</label> Either they came in by <hi>Drury-houſe,</hi> and ſo have no title legal nor equitable, and then the conſequence of the Seventh Reaſon will be, that building upon anothers Ground, deſtroyes the Owners right; or elſe they claim under ſome forfeited mortgages and then the <hi>Chancery</hi> will not allow them for ſuch building, judging it againſt Equity to clogge an Eſtate with ſuch an incumbrance as will make it beyond the power of the Mortgageor to redeem, and the noiſe of being Purchaſers and in poſſeſſion, and of 100 Families undone if this Bill paſſes, is made only by thoſe who are not Creditors but Purchaſers, (as themſelves confeſs by their own Petition) under the order of <hi>April,</hi> 1641. or by <hi>Drury-houſe</hi> title, which if ſet aſide (as in all juſtice they ought,) all thoſe Purchaſes are at a period. Others who are the true Creditors (yet purchaſed under <hi>Drury-houſe</hi>) petition that the Bill may paſſe, and would be glad to receive their Money accordingly, and others, <hi>viz.</hi> Coll. <hi>Smith</hi> and his adherents have ſwallowed an Eſtate worth above 200000 l. for 10000 l. principal Money.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To the eighth.</label> For the Truſtees to receive the Rents and therewith to pay Creditors as they are in priority till ſales made, is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and no more than the Law giveth to every Creditor, who hath the precedency of others, and by this Bill the Truſtees may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon ſtating the firſt Creditors debt, and not ſtay till all are examined <hi>preut</hi> by the ſeaventh reaſon is alledged.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>TO the two firſt Anſwers.</label> That the Lord <hi>Bannings</hi> debt, and the Lady <hi>Homes</hi> debt, and the money (if any) depoſited for diſcharging precedent incumbrances, ſhall be ſatisfied, and other debts which will never be payed (unleſſe this Bill paſſes) will be truly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>To that concerning the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> under whom Mr. <hi>George Montague</hi> claimes, the Earl of <hi>Cleveland</hi> is contented, that Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> ſhall not only receive the Principal and Intereſt depoſited by the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> but alſo all moneys expended by the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> or himſelf in building, or otherwiſe improving the Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Clevelands</hi> defires are, that this Caſe, being of great conſequence to many of his ancient, and principal Creditors, and Sureties (who Petition the Houſe of Commons that this Bill may paſs) may be committed, and the equity of it examined by ſuch perſons as the Houſe ſhall appoint, and that he may not be forejudged in this buſineſs, but that this Bill which after long debate paſſed the Houſe of Lords, may in the Houſe of Commons receive a candid audience, the endeavours to prevent the ſame, arguing more of Intereſt and Animoſity, than of Juſtice or Equity; that being the moſt juſt ſentence which paſſes after the faireſt hearing.</p>
