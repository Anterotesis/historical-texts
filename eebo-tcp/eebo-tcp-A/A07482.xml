            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10532:4"/>In this time liued there in England an auncient Knight, whome this famous king for his many merits and well deſeruing déedes, had inſtalled in the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> a dignity as hee thought fitting the deſerts of this famous man, that had ſo often vndergone the furious attempts of the vnciuill Pagans, enemies to God, foes to his countrie, and great hindrances to the then but young plants of ſpringing Chriſtianity, as alſo endeuoring himſelfe euery where to defend the fame of his countrie, then of all other only fame worthy the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his order euery where honored, and the dutie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Knighthood, which hee alwaies perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, till at the laſt when the waight of many wearie yeares, gan bow his declining bodie downe to the lowly earth, making his oft tried Armour too heauie a burthen for his now war weakned body, his brandiſhing ſword beating downe his age fallen armes, and euery ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his luſtie limmes beginnes to faile of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer force, he determins to end his life in peace at home, whoſe beginning he had ſpent in warres abroad, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging younger men with the ſpectacle of his former valours, couragiouſly themſelues to attempt the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors.</p>
            <p>In which time of his home aboad, the heauens bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with two goodly Children, a Sonne &amp; a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but yet as it is the continual courſe of al ruling for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to mixe with euery good ſome ill, with euerie ſwéet a ſowre, &amp; with euery ſunſhine ſhow of promiſing hap, a tempeſtuous ſtorme of ill boading hurt, ſo fared it in the iſſue of this yet vnhappie Prince: for when the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houres of all ripening time had brought them from their Infant Cradelles to ſome participation of ſencible knowledge, his Daughter whoſe name was <hi>Laura,</hi> ſo forwardly proſpered in euery Liniament of her beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bodie, &amp; all eternall quallities of a vertuous minde:
<pb facs="tcp:10532:4"/>
ſo that in ſhort time ſhe became the cenſured ſubiect of all wiſe iudgements, in determination whether nature had better beautified her bodie, (where indéede ſhee had excéeded her ſelf) or the Gods quallified her mind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had made her the only ſimilitude of themſelues. No penne that was not buſied in painting her praiſes, though all too little for that purpoſe, and no tongue but was ſtill telling her perfections, though they neuer could attaine them: for too bright was her beautie, to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in the couloring cunning of a mortall capacitie, and too high her heauenly minde, to be enſtauld with the earthlie wéedes of mans baſe wit, that as the toile ſome Sailers in the dangerous Seas watching the miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of a tedious night, doth with themſelues mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admire the gorgeous ſtate of many twinckling ſtars, till when the ſiluer Moone proudlie riſing from her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bed, drawes backe their daſeled eies to behold her more than common countenance: ſo fares it in this age of theirs, where no ſtarre may compare with her ſtate, no face with her faire fortune, nor no grace with the leaſt glimce of her glorie: ſo to leaue to expreſſe that in wordes, which could not bée comprehended in all wits, neuer did nature before compoſe of ſo rude a Chaos, ſo comely a creature: But her Brother whoſe name was <hi>Chynon,</hi> outwardly formed in as faire a faſhion, as might well beſéeme the ſonne to ſuch a fire, but in his minde more than a maimed man, wanting that portion of ſenſible capacity which commonly doth accompany euen the meaneſt ſeruillitie: So that by how much his Siſter excéeded in extraordinarie wiſedome, by ſo much was hee ſcanted in ordinarie witte, where in ſtéede of Princely feature, was nothing found but fooliſh behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, for high atchiuementes boyiſh follies: for that which is required in a man, not ſo much as is commonly found in a childe, vncapable of the rudiments of good

counſaile, and vnſit to conceiue the commoditie of come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie quallitie: whence as all men with admiration won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the one, ſo none but with commiſſeration pittied the other, that ſo well faſhioned a body ſhould containe ſo ill formed a minde, ſtrongly had nature forged hys limbes, which promiſed his valour, but weakely had the enuious Fates framed his mind, wher was no hope of better, So that heere nature vnnaturally hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo good a ſubiect, had encloſed in the perfecte body of a man, little better than the vnperfect ſoule of a beaſt, like almoſt the imitating of an apiſh artificer, that in faire ſhowes deciphers a formall ſubſtance, in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cunning colours painting a Princely perfection, which ſatiſfies the outward ſence as the ſame, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not content the inward conceit, beeing but a bare ſhow: So by euery outward appearance was he iudged well, till triall by experience to euery one proued him worſe, but how great a corſiue it was to his careful Parents, I leaue it to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conſider whom experience hath taught to conceaue the like inconuenience, great griefe was it to his old father that had béene himſelfe full of valour, to ſée his young ſonne though able, yet vnfit for any ſuch endeuour, which turned his hoped for reſt to hapleſſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, his aged mirth to angrie moane, and what ſo euer other content, into a contrarie conceit, to ſée his poore neighbours comfort their ſeruile liues with the ſight of their forward Children, and hee their vnfortunate Lord wanting that redreſſe which thoſe poore creatures in reſpect of him in ſuch plentifull manner do daylie poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus grieuing to remember that which hee cannot forget and ſorrie to haue ſo diſcontented an obiect to his aged eies, which he ſtil be wailed, though by no meanes his griefe could be healed, atlaſt learnes with patience to beare that which with paines he cannot amend, and

inſtantly ſolicites the great Parlament of heauen, in whoſe diſpoſe reſts the eſtate of all creatures, that in their vnſearchable wiſedome they woulde either open the eyes of his blinded ſoule, forged in the miſtie vale of a cloudy ignorance, or els cut ſhort the vnpleaſant date of his wearie life, and ſo preuent the inſuing ignominie of his future times: where wée muſt now leaue him a while in his follie, till the proceſſe of our Hiſtory bring vs thither againe.</p>
