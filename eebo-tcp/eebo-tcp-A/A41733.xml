         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THe Courtiers Manual Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> which is here preſented to the Reader, as it is an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the works of that judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and learned Spaniard <hi>Baltazar Gracian;</hi> ſo it carries in its own Title an abridgment of it ſelf, as not onely pointing at the ſubject it treats of, but alſo the perſons for whoſe uſe it is deſigned.</p>
            <p>Oracles are the glimmerings of a ſupernatural light, which do rather dazle than illuminate thoſe who are not both attentive, and ſharp ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And therefore the Maximes
<pb facs="tcp:53792:3"/>
which here bear that name, are not calculated for all degrees of Men, nor for all ſorts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings. There is an art of ſhort ſpeaking, no leſs than that of ſhort hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and both are obſcure, but to the intelligent and thinking, who may draw conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from both. It's an old ſaying; <hi>A word's enough to the Wiſe;</hi> and he that cannot crack the ſhell, and taſte the kernel of a ſentence, though he may be wiſe in his own Eyes, will never be reckoned ſo in the judgment of Sages. A Proverb patly applied and well underſtood, makes a deeper impreſſion upon the minds of underſtanding men, than a lank declamation adorned with all the Poſies and Flowers of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. This made the learned and diſcerning Authour affect a certain vigorous laconiciſm in all his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that made him highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:53792:3"/>
by the greateſt men of his own Countrey, and of Strangers alſo who underſtood his language, though the French Authour <hi>Des Entretiens d' Ariſte &amp; Eugene,</hi> a leading Critick accounts him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, and by conſequent <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſlateable;</hi> but whether he be ſo or not in this tranſlation, it is left to the judgment of the Reader.</p>
            <p>It may be made a Probleme, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by ſome, whether <hi>The Art of Prudence,</hi> be at this time ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably or not tranſlated and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Engliſh; ſeeing to inſtruct and not to inſtruct, has great affinity with the anſwering and not anſwering a fool in his folly, according to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and all the World are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that there is a vaſt number of more than ordinary fools, and mad men amongſt us at preſent. The title and deſign of the Book, I think, may ſalve the doubt; for
<pb facs="tcp:53792:4"/>
it is <hi>the Courtiers Manual Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> not of him onely who has the honour to be actually in that ſtation; but of others alſo, who by knowing, and reflecting upon the tranſactions of the world, may be capable, if not to ſerve the Publick, yet to live like men in their generation, and to ſuch it cannot be unſeaſonable, if they have the ingenuity to act according to its maximes, ſeeing in ſo doing they will find by experience, that when once the ground is well known, one may hit the Jack with a Boul that runs ſtreight, if it be their cuſtome to bowl ſo, as well as with that which fetches the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs by its biaſs; and that a man may be a Politician ſucceſsfully, and with applauſe, without forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the rational Rules of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Religion, for the deceitfull Sophiſtry of Cunning and Artiſice, which commonly ſoon or too late
<pb facs="tcp:53792:4"/>
ſhews its own perniciouſneſs by the fatal diſappointments of thoſe that practiſe it. For the unintelligent and head-ſtrong <hi>Mobile,</hi> that makes the greateſt part of Mankind, they have nothing to doe with this Book; <hi>Odi profanum vulgus &amp; arceo:</hi> The Authour wrote not for them, well knowing that their inveterate folly is not to be cured but reſtrained; and that as it is very eaſie by force of words and long-winded Cant, to preach them out of their ſenſes, ſo it is as impoſſible by ſhort docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſentence them into their Wits and good Manners again, as to cure a Chronical Hypochondriarcy by an Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or a ſpell of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s or <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Morals. To theſe Animals then for whom the Bit and Bridle is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, the Diſcipline of the Whip is the beſt Doctrine, and nothing of this nature can be ſeaſonable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable,
<pb facs="tcp:53792:5"/>
but as it may influence thoſe of the ſmaller number, who are their Riders, and ſpur them at their pleaſure; Now if theſe be ſo mad as to run upon precipices, and ride over Rocks, thoſe Maximes can in this onely be unſeaſonable; that they ſeaſonably taught them, what too late, and unſeaſonably they were convinced of.</p>

               <p>Are two Qualities wherein the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a Man conſiſts. To have one without the other, is to be happy but by halves.

Not to declare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, is the way to hold minds in ſuſpence, eſpecially in matters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which are the object of univerſal expectation. That makes every thing to be thought a myſtery, and the ſecret of that raiſes veneration. In the manner of expreſſion one ought to have a care not to

be too plain: and to ſpeak with open heart is not always convenient in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Silence is the Sanctuary of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. A reſolution made manifeſt was never eſteemed. He that declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is obnoxious to Cenſure: and if he ſucceeds not, he is doubly miſerable.

               <p>It is not the Guilder but the Adorer that makes the God. A Man of Parts had rather meet with thoſe who depend upon him, than that are thankfull to him. To keep People in hope, is Civility; to truſt to their Gratitude, Simplicity. For it is as common for Gratitude to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, as for Hope to be mindfull. You get always more by this, than by the other. When one hath once drank, he turns his back upon the Well: ſo ſoon as the Orange is ſqueezed, it's thrown upon the ground, When Dependance ceaſeth, there's an end of Correſpondence, and of Eſteem alſo. It is therefore a leſſon of Experience, that a Man ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour always to render himſelf uſefull, nay even to his Prince; though he muſt not affect an exceſs of ſilence, to make others overſhoot themſelves, nor for his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt render another man's evil incurable.</p>

               <p>Man's life is a conflict with the malice of man himſelf. An expert man for Weapons uſes the ſtrategems of intention. He never does what he ſeems to have a mind to doe. He takes an aim, but that is to deceive the Eyes that look upon him. He blurts out a word in the air, and then does a thing that no body dreamt of. If he come out with a ſaying, it is to amuſe the attention of his Rivals, and whilſt that is taken up in conſidering what he drives at, he preſently acts what never came into their thoughts. He then, that takes heed not to be impoſed upon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the cunning of his Companion by good reflexions. He always underſtands the contrary of what one would have him to underſtand, and thereby he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcovers the falſifie. He lets the firſt paſs goe, and expects the ſecond or third with a good guard. And when afterwards his Artifice is known, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines his diſſimulation, making uſe of truth it ſelf to deceive by. To change his cunning, he changes his ground and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53792:20"/>
battery. His Artifice is to have no more Art, and all his ſubtilty is to paſs from Diſſimulation to Candour. He, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it with a piercing Eye, knowing the Arts of his Rival, ſtands upon his guard, and diſcovers darkneſs under a veil of light.

For this great Precept, ſays he, <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> got the Reputation of the chief of the Wiſe Men. And, indeed, it is the chief of Precepts.

                  </gap>ins for him that ſhall put it in practice? For to know things, and not to practiſe them, is not to be a Philoſopher but a Grammarian.</p>
               <p>In all things the circumſtance is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as the ſubſtance, nay, and more. The thing that firſt preſents to us, is not the eſſence, but the appearance. By the outſide we come to the knowledge of what is within. By the bark of the manner we diſcern the fruit of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: inſomuch that we judge of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom we know not by their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The way and manner is that part of merit which moſt affects the attention. And ſeeing it is to be acquired, he that is without it is inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>Truth has force; Reaſon authority; and Juſtice power: but they are without luſter if the gracefull way be wanting; as with it every thing is ſet off with more advantage. It makes amends for all things, even for the defects of reaſon; it guilds ſlights, paints deformities, hides
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53792:21"/>
imperfections, and in a word, diſguiſes every thing.</p>
               <p>Great Zeal in a Miniſter; Valour in a Commander; learning in a Scholar; Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a Prince; are not enough, unleſs theſe qualities be accompanied with that important formality. But it is in no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment more neceſſary, than in Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Command. To be humane rather than deſpotick is in Superiours a ſingular way to engage. To ſee a Prince make Superiority yield to Humanity, obliges Subjects upon a double account to love him. He muſt reign in the firſt place over the wills of men, and then over the reſt. Conciliate to thy ſelf the good will, and even the applauſe of all men, if not out of inclination, at leaſt by art. For they who admire, mind not whether thy way be natural or adventitious.</p>
               <p>There are many things which are worth but little in themſelves, and yet are eſteemed for their manner. By the help of that old things become new, and return into faſhion. If the circumſtances be of common uſe, they palliate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthneſs of Antiquity. The reliſh of men advances always, and never recoils. What is paſt takes not, and nothing but what is new pleaſes it. Nevertheleſs, a little change may beguile it. Circumſtances
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53792:22"/>
make things grow young again, they cure them of the muſty ſcent, and the mouldineſs of <hi>Too often,</hi> which is always intolerable, and eſpecially in imitations, which can never riſe neither to the height, nor Novelty of the Original.</p>
               <p>This is ſtill more obvious to be ſeen in the functions of the mind. For though things be very well known, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to raiſe the Appetite, if the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Hiſtorian hit upon a new way of ſaying or writing them.</p>
               <p>When things are exquiſite, they cloy not, though they be even ſeven times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. But though they be not tedious, yet they are not admired. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary to ſeaſon them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the end they may excite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Novelty careſſes and charms the Palate. And objects are renewed merely by changing the Ragoe, which is the true art of pleaſing.</p>
               <p>Two men ſhall ſay the very ſame things, and yet the one ſhall pleaſe, and the other by the ſame means offend. So important it is to know the way <hi>how!</hi> So uſefull is a gracefull manner, and ſo hurtfull an unſeemly! Now if the want of a manner be ſo remarkable, what muſt that be which is actually bad, and deſignedly offenſive, and eſpecially in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53792:22"/>
thoſe that hold a publick Poſt? Thy Clowniſh Air is but a ſmall defect, ſaid a Wiſe Man, and yet it is enough to make all people diſguſt thee. On the contrary, an external agreeableneſs promiſes a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of mind; and beauty vouches for good humour.</p>
               <p>The gracefull manner ſo guilds and ſets off a <hi>No,</hi> as to make it more eſteemed than an ill ſeaſoned <hi>Yea.</hi> It ſo skilfully ſugar's over truths, that they paſs for blandiſhments: and ſometimes when it ſeems to flatter, it undeceives, by telling People not what they are, but what they ought to be.</p>

               <p>Never to ſpeak in Superlatives, is a ſign of a Wiſe Man. For that way of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king always wounds either Truth or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

So that if merit anſwer not the value that is ſet upon it, as it commonly happens; general opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts againſt the impoſture, and makes the flatterer and flattered both ridiculous. And therefore a prudent man proceeds

with a cloſe rein, and chuſes rather to offend by giving too little, than too much. Excellence is rare, and by conſequent the value of it is to be well weighed. Exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration is a kind of lying: by Exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration one gets himſelf the reputation of a man of bad diſcerning, and which is worſe, of little judgment.</p>

               <p>This is a certain unaccountable force of Superiority that ſprings from the Nature, and not from the Artifice, nor affectation of him that has it. Every one ſubmits thereto without knowing how, unleſs it be that one yields to the inſinuating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the natural authority of another. Theſe Paramount Genies are Kings by merit, and Lions by a privilege that is born with them. They command the Heart and Tongues of others by a ſecret Charm, that makes them be reſpected.

This Empire, ſaith the Authour, in the Chapter <hi>Del ſenorio en el dezir,</hi> &amp;c. is skotched out by nature, and finiſhed by art. All who have that advantage, find things ready done to their hands. Nay, Superiority it ſelf facilitates all things to them, inſomuch that nothing puzles them, but in every thing they come off with Honour. Their ſayings and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem as great again as they are. An ordinary thing hath even appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, when ſeconded by that Empire. They who want that Superiority, enter diffidently upon affairs: which takes from them much of their gracefulneſs, eſpecially if it be obſerved. From diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence immediately ſprings fear, which ſhamefully baniſhes aſſurance; and by conſequent action and reaſon looſe all their luſtre. That fear ſo abſolutely Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizes over the mind, that it deprives it of all liberty. Inſomuch that reaſon is at a ſtand, words are frozen, and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remains under an interdict.</p>
               <p>The Aſcendant of him that ſpeaks, gains him at firſt the reſpect of him who hears. It makes the greateſt Critick give attention, and Sovereignly ſways the conſent of a whole Company. It furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes expreſſions, nay, and ſentences to the perſon that ſpeaks: whereas fear
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53792:33"/>
choaks the words. Timidity is ſufficient to chill reaſoning: and though it could overflow with a Torrent of Eloquence, yet the great cold of fear will put a ſtop to its courſe.</p>
               <p>He that with Native Authority enters into Converſation, has reſpect at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion before hand: But he who comes to it with fear, accuſes himſelf of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and confeſſes he is overcome: for which diffidence of mind he is deſpiſed, or at beſt not much eſteemed of others. The truth is, a wiſe man ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and particularly when he is not acquainted with his company. He firſt tries the foard, but eſpecially if he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that it is deep.</p>
               <p>Though it be both Civility and Duty to qualifie this imperious boldneſs, in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Princes and great men; yet one muſt have a care of falling into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of diſcompoſing baſhfulneſs. There it is that a man ought to keep a mean betwixt boldneſs and confuſion, that he may neither be diſagreeable nor ridiculous. Let neither thy fear be ſo great, as to make thee loſe aſſurance; nor thy boldneſs ſo ſawcy, as to forget reſpect.</p>
               <p>That Superiority gliſters in all ſorts of people, but much more in great men. In
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53792:34"/>
an Oratour it is more than one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: It's eſſential to a Lawyer; In an Ambaſſadour it is a glorious Quality; and a victorious Attribute in a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but in a Prince it is the Ornament of perfection. It raiſes the price of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions; and reaches even the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which is the throne of comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the gate alſo in ſuch a manner, that the ſteps of a man are the ſignatures of the character of his heart; and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons delineate theirs by a noble way of acting and ſpeaking. For ſublime actions are of double value, when they are accompanied with majeſty.</p>
               <p>Some are born with an univerſal power in all that they ſay and doe. One would ſay that nature had made them the elder brothers of mankind. They are deſigned to be Superiours in all things, if not in Dignity, at leaſt in Merit. A ſpirit of Dominion exerts it ſelf in them, even in their moſt common actions. All obey them, becauſe in every thing they excell. They rob the hearts, and ſo at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the maſters of others; for their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity is large enough for all things. And though there may be others ſometimes that have more learning, nobility, nay, and vrtue; yet ſtill they get the better on't by an Aſcendant, that gives them the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53792:34"/>

               <p>Is the effect of a happy quickneſs which is no more puzled at any thing, than as if nothing happened fortuitouſly: Some after long plodding, are ſtill miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Theſe are Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies that doe every thing well upon the ſpot, and all things ill which they have premeditated. What they hit not upon at firſt, they never hit upon. Such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have great Reputation, becauſe by the quickneſs of their thoughts, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their enterpriſes, men judge their capacity to be Prodigious.</p>
               <p>Promptitude, ſaith the Authour, in his <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> Chap. <hi>Tener buevos repentes,</hi> is the Mother of good Fortune. Unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated hits proceed always from a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown mind. <hi>And ſome lines after.</hi> If eſteem be due to all that is pertinently done or ſaid, a pat expedient found out at the nick, deſerves applauſe. Readineſs and ſucceſs give a double value to things. Some think much, and nevertheleſs ſtill fail; and others ſucceed in all things, without thinking on them before. The quickneſs of wit ſupplies the defect of a deep judgment. What offers at firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates conſultation. There is nothing caſual for ſuch men, inaſmuch as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind ſtands them in ſtead of forecaſt. <hi>Extemporaries</hi> are the gentile
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53792:41"/>
feats of a good diſcerning, and the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of admiration. Ordinary actions unpremeditated, make a greater ſhew than high deſigns that have been concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>And a page after.</hi> One ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary hit was enough to procure <hi>Solomon</hi> the renown of being the wiſeſt of men. By one word he rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more redoubtable, than by all his power. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſerved to be the elder Sons of Fame, the one by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking himſelf to cut the Gordian Knot; and the other by ſaying when he fell, <hi>It is a good ſign that</hi> Africa <hi>is under me.</hi> Two <hi>Extemporaries</hi> were as good to both, as the Conqueſt of two parts of the world.

               <p>If a ſudden repartee hath always been plauſible, a prompt reſolution deſerves well to be applauded. A happy promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the effects, ſhews an eminent activity in the cauſe. Promptitude in conceiving, is a ſign of ſubtilty, and a readineſs in finding out good expedients, is a proof of Wiſedom ſo much the more to be eſteemed, that there is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt vivacity and prudence, and betwixt wit and judgment.</p>
               <p>It is a perfection no leſs neceſſary than ſublime in Generals of Armies, and brave

               <p>But it becomes Kings better to think, becauſe all their actions are eternal. They are to conſider for many, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have need of much Auxiliary Prudence, that they may ſecure the publick repoſe. They have time, and their Beds, where they let their reſolutions ripen. They ſpend whole nights in thinking, that they may ſpend the days in ſafety. In a word, they labour more with the head than with the hands.</p>

If ſubtilty reign not, it deſerves, at leaſt to accompany thoſe who reign. The ordinary ſayings of a King are Crowned points of Wit. The treaſures of Princes often fail; but their witty ſayings are everlaſtingly preſerved in the repoſitory of Fame. Brave men have gone farther ſometimes with one word, than with the force of their Arms, Victory being the ordinary reward of a ſhot of wit. The King of Sages, and the wiſeſt of Kings, acquired that reputation by the ready ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, which he found out in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all differences, which was to plead for an Infant.

               <p>If a man enter the houſe of Fortune by the gate of pleaſure, he comes out commonly by the door of vexation. It is greater art to get out happily, than to enter it with popular applauſe. It is the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53792:44"/>
ordinary lot of fortunate people to have moſt favourable beginnings, and then a tragical end. Felicity conſiſts not in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the applauſe of the people at ones entry: for that is an advantage which all that enter have. The difficult matter is to have the ſame applauſe at ones <hi>exit.</hi> You ſee but very few who are regrated. It ſeldom happens that they who go out, are accompanied with good fortune. For it is her pleaſure to be as ſurly to thoſe that go, as ſhe is civil and careſſing to thoſe who come.</p>
               <p>The ſame applauſe, ſays he in his <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> Chap. <hi>Hombre de buen dexo,</hi> that one hath had in the beginning, makes the murmuring the greater at the end. The fronts of Offices are all magnificent, but never the back parts, entries into Dignities are Crowned like Victories, but the goings off are attended with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>What ſtrange applauſes to an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that begins, whether becauſe of the pleaſure that people take in changes, or of the hopes that every one hath to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particular favours! but when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, alas, what ſilence! nay, and ſilence would ſtand in ſtead of a favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation too.</p>
               <p>Prudence applies it ſelf wholly to end
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53792:44"/>
things well. It is far more attentive how to come out, than in liſtening to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of an entry. A vigilant <hi>Palinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> governed not his Veſſel by the head, but by the ſtern.

The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that Roman for beginning and ending was excellent, who ſaid that he had obtained all Dignities before he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and had left them all, before they were deſired by others.

The former gain the good will of all, becauſe they are managed in ſight of all people. The other are more majeſtuous, and as ſuch, attract more veneration: but becauſe they are undiſcernable, they are the leſs applauded to. Amongſt Princes, the victorious are the more celebrated: and hence it is that the Kings of <hi>Aragon</hi> have been ſo famous, by their titles of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, Conquerours, Magnanimous. Let a man of merit, if he would eterniſe his memory by general applauſe, chuſe then ſuch employments, wherein every one hath ſome knowledge, and all have a ſhare.</p>

Some, ſays the Authour in the eighth Chapter of his <hi>Heroe,</hi> prefer difficult employments before others that are more plauſible, the admiration of ſome choice men being more charming to them, than the applauſe of a great many in the crowd. They call plauſible enterprizes the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the ignorant. The truth is, few men know the difficulty and excellence of a great undertaking; but ſeeing theſe are ſublime ſpirits, for all they are ſo few, they fail not to put them in vogue. What is plauſible is eaſily known, it familiarizes it ſelf to the ſenſes; but then the applauſe it receives, is ſo much the more vulgar, that it is univerſal. The daintineſs of the ſmall number carries it over the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the vulgar. Nevertheleſs, it is the character of a fine wit, to bribe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon attention by the charm of plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: ſince eminence dazling the Eyes of all, ſettles Reputation by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. We muſt eſteem what moſt eſteem. The excellence of plauſible actions is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous: whereas thoſe which are above the ordinary reach, are never ſo evident, but that they are ſtill very metaphyſical, being no ways illuſtrious but by the Idea's that men conceive of them. I call that plauſible which is acted in view, and to the ſatisfaction of all people, and hath
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53792:48"/>
always reputation for a baſis. Whereby I exclude ſome employments that are as void of credit, as they are full of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. A Comedian is rich in applauſes, but poor in eſteem. In the functions of the mind the plauſible hath ever had the honour. A polite and ſmooth running diſcourſe tickles the ears, and charms the underſtanding: on the contrary, a dry, bombaſt, metaphyſical expreſſion offends or cloys the hearers. And in his <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> Chap. <hi>Hombre de buena election:</hi> There are, ſaith he, employments, the chief exerciſe whereof conſiſts in chuſing, and which depend more upon others, than upon the practiſer: as are all ſuch whoſe end is to teach and pleaſe. Let the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour then prefer plauſible arguments. The Hiſtorian mingle the pleaſant with the uſefull: and the Philoſopher the ſpecious with the ſententious. Let them all ſtudy to fit the univerſal reliſh of others; which is the true method of chuſing. For it is the ſame as in a Feaſt, where the Diſhes are not dreſt for the palate of the Cooks, but of the Gueſts.

               <p>Sometimes we are to rememorate, ſometimes adviſe. There are many who fail to doe things which would be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe they thought not of them. Then it is that a good advice is in ſeaſon, to make them conceive what is important to be done. It is one of the greateſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of a man to have a preſent mind to think on what he hath to doe, for want whereof many affairs miſcarry. He then that comprehends, is to carry the light; and he that needs to be lighted, ought to make application to the other. The firſt ought to be ſparing, and the other dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. It's enough for the former to clear the way for the latter. This is a very important maxime, and profitable for him that inſtructs: and in caſe his firſt leſſon be not ſufficient, he ought with pleaſure to proceed. Having once conquered the <hi>Nay,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53792:49"/>
he muſt dextrouſly catch hold of a <hi>Yea.</hi> For it often happens, that nothing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, becauſe nothing attempted.</p>

               <head>Not to be of the humour of the vulgar.</head>
               <p>He is a great man that gives no admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to popular impreſſions. It is a leſſon of Prudence to reflect upon ones ſelf, to know ones own inclination, to prevent it, and even to goe to the other extremity, that one may find the poiſe of reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt nature and art. The knowledge of ones ſelf is the beginning of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are ſome Monſters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, who are now of one humour, and by and by of another; and change their opinions as their humours. They engage in quite contrary affairs, being always hurried away by the impetuoſity of that civil torrent, which not onely corrupts the will, but alſo the knowledge and judgment.</p>
               <p>A great Capacity (ſaith the Authour in the Chapter, <hi>No rendirſe al humor</hi> of his <hi>Diſcreet)</hi> is never carried with the flux and reflux neither of humours, nor of paſſions. It is always above that clowniſh immoderation. Many ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53792:50"/>
ſuffer themſelves to be tyrannized over by the predominant humour. They maintain to day what they contradicted yeſterday. Sometime they ſtand for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſometimes they trample it under foot. There is no reſt for their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is the height of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. You cannot take them in a good ſenſe, becauſe they have none. Yeſterday and to day they differ as much as black and white: and then having been the firſt to contradict themſelves, they contradict all others. When once we underſtand their depraved mind, it is beſt to let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in their own confuſion. For the more they doe, the more they undoe.</p>
               <p>It is the ſign of a rich ſtock of ſenſe, to know how to prevent and correct ones humour, ſince it is a diſeaſe of mind, wherein a wiſe man ought to govern himſelf as in a diſtemper of body.</p>
               <p>There are ſuch far gone impertinents, that they are always in ſome humour; always galled with ſome paſſion; inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to thoſe who have to doe with them, perpetual Enemies of converſation and civility, who have no reliſh of the beſt things; more incurable than ſtark fools. For with a little compliance theſe are wheedled, and thoſe grow worſe by it. There is nothing to be got of them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53792:50"/>
by reaſon, for having none themſelves, they'll receive none from others.</p>
               <p>But if a man ſometimes fall into a paſſion, and that but rarely, and for a great cauſe, that will be no ground to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of a vulgar humour. For never to be angry, is to be always a Beaſt. But a conſtant bad humour, and towards all people, is inſupportable Clowniſhneſs. Anger, which makes the ſlave, may ſtill be a ſawce for a free ſtate. But he that is not capable of knowing himſelf, will be ſtill leſs of correcting himſelf.</p>

There are ſome who have always a <hi>Nay</hi> in their mouth. <hi>No,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways their firſt anſwer, and though they chance afterwards to grant all that's deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they have no thanks for it, becauſe

of the unſavoury <hi>No</hi> that went before. We muſt not refuſe point blanck, but make our denial be taken down by little ſips, if I may ſay ſo.

The <hi>too much</hi> is always irkſome, and in humour it is unſupportable. It is a kind of madneſs to hunt after vexations. And ordinarily ſuch is the way of carriage, as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is in which one acts. Our actions take the character of the humour we are in when we doe them.</p>

ſwoonings of our Reputation. He that can make a ſacrifice of his will, is Lord over himſelf. (To dive into the will of another, is a mark of a ſublime wit: to be able to hide ones own, is to get the ſuperiority over another. To diſcover ones thought, is to open the gate of the fort of the mind. Here it is that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Enemies give the aſſault, and moſt frequently with ſucceſs too. When once the paſſions are known, all the avenues and Sally-ports of the will are known, and by conſequent it may be commanded upon any occaſion.) A complete man muſt then in the firſt place apply himſelf to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of his paſſions, and then to the diſſembling of them ſo artfully, that no ſpie can ever be able to unmask his thought.

The beſt way to have Friends, is to make Friends. All the good we have in this life, depends on others. We are to live with our Friends or Enemies.

Good will facilitates all things. It ſuppoſes not always that there is wiſedom, diſcretion, goodneſs, and capacity in the object; but it gives them. It never ſees faults, becauſe it avoids ſeeing of them. Commonly it ſprings from a material Correſpondence, as being of the ſame Nation, Countrey, Profeſſion or Family. There is another kind of affection more formal and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for it is founded on obligations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation or merit.

The heat of contradiction animates or raiſes to life infamies which were dead: it digs up again the filth, which time had almoſt conſumed.

For as it is the ſoul of beauty, ſo is it the ſpirit of Prudence, as it is the principle of gracefulneſs, ſo is it the life of valour. In a Captain, it goes hand in hand with bravery; and in a King with Prudence. In the ſhock of a battle, it is no leſs conſpicuous in its aſſured and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted air, than in the skill of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling arms, and in reſolution.

               <p>Not according as occaſions preſent, but by foreſight and choice. A life that hath no intermiſſion, is painfull, like a long way, where there is no Inn. Variety well underſtood makes it happy. The firſt period ought to be ſpent in ſpeaking with the dead. We are born to know, and to know our ſelves: and it is by Books that we truly learn that, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come complete men. The ſecond ſtation is to be allotted for the living, that's to ſay, that we ought to ſee what is beſt in the World, and keep a regiſter of it. [All is not to be found in one place.

live. A life without reſts is a long way without Inns. Nature hath proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the life of man according to the courſe of the Sun; and the four ages of life according to the four ſeaſons of the year. The Spring of man begins in his Infancy. The flowers of it are tender, and the hopes frail. It is followed by the hot and exceſſive Summer of Youth, every way dangerous, becauſe of the boyling bloud, and the frequent erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of paſſions. The Autumn of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Age comes next, crowned with the ripe fruits of mind and will: and then at length the Winter of old Age, wherein the leaves of vigour fall; when the rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of the veins freeze; Snow covers the Head, when the Hair and Teeth are gone; and when life trembles at the approaches of death. <hi>And a page after.</hi> It was a piece of celebrated wit in that gallant Perſon, who divided the Comedy into three days, and the voyage of life into three ſtations. The firſt he employed in ſpeaking with the dead; the ſecond in converſing with the living; and the third in entertaining ones ſelf. Let us explain the riddle. I ſay, he gave the firſt term of life to Books. He read them, and that was rather a pleaſure than a toil. For if one be the more a man, the more
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53792:120"/>
he knows, the nobleſt employment will be to learn. He devoured Books, which are the food of the Soul, and the delights of the mind. It's great happineſs to meet with the beſt on every ſubject. He learn't the two univerſal Languages, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Spaniſh, which are now a-days the Keys of the World; and the five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to wit, the Greek, the Italian, the French, the Engliſh, and the Dutch; that he might make his profit of all the good that is celebrated in them. After that, he bequeathed himſelf to that Grand-mother of life, the Wife of the Mind, and the Daughter of Experience, plauſible Hiſtory, I mean that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and inſtructs moſt. He began with the Ancients, and ended with the Modern, though others take the contrary courſe, chuſing his Authours, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the Times, the Dates, Centuries, and Ages; ſearching into the cauſes of the growth, fall, and revolution of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, and Re-publicks; the number, order, and qualities of their Princes, their Actions in Peace and War. He walked in the delicious Gardens of Poetry, not ſo much to exerciſe himſelf as to play there. Yet he was not ſo ignorant, but that he knew how to make a verſe; nor ſo unadviſed, as to make two. Amongſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53792:120"/>
all the Poets he gave his heart to ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Horace,</hi> and his hand to ſubtile <hi>Martial:</hi> which was to give him the Laurel. To Poeſie he joined ſavoury Humanity. Then he proceeded to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and beginning with Natural, he acquired the ſtructure of the Univerſe, of the marvellous being of Man, of the properties of Animals, and Plants, and in fine, of the qualities of pretious Stones. But he took more pleaſure in Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which is the food of real men, as that which gives life to Prudence: and he ſtudied it in the Books of the Wiſe and Philoſophers, who have compiled it to us in Sentences, Apophthegms, Emblems and Apologues. He knew both Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphies, the material and formal, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Earth and the Sea; diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the Elevations and Climates, the four parts of the world, and in them, Provinces and Nations: that he might not be one of thoſe Ignorants and half Beaſts, who have never known what it is they tread upon. Of Aſtrology he knew as much as Wiſedom ſuffers to be known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In fine, he crowned his Studies by a long and ſerious application to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Holy Scriptures, which is the moſt uſefull, univerſal and pleaſant ſtudy for men of judgment. So that Moral
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53792:121"/>
Philoſophy rendred him Prudent; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Knowing; Hiſtory, Diſcreet; Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Ingenious; Rhetorick, Eloquent; Humanity, Polite; Coſmography, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent; and the ſtudy of Holy Scripture, Pious and Devote.</p>
               <p>He employed the ſecond part of his life in Travelling, which is the ſecond happineſs of a man that's curious, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making good uſe of it. He ſought and found all that was beſt in the world. For when we ſee not things, we enjoy them not fully. There is a great deal to be ſaid betwixt what one imagines, and what he ſees. He takes more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in objects who ſees them but once, than he that ſees them often. The firſt time one is contented, at all others he is tired. The firſt day, a pretty thing is the pleaſure of him who is the maſter of it; but after that, it affects him no more than that of a ſtranger. He ſaw the Courts of greateſt Princes, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent the Prodigies of Nature and Art in Picture, Sculpture, Tapeſtry, Jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He converſed with the excellenteſt men of the World, either in learning, or any thing elſe, whereby he had the means of obſerving, cenſuring, confronting, and putting the juſt value upon all things.</p>
               <p>He ſpent the third part of ſo fine a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53792:121"/>
life in meditating upon the <hi>much</hi> which he had read; and the <hi>more</hi> which he had ſeen. All that enters by the door of the ſenſes into this Haven of the Soul, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded at the Cuſtom-houſe of the mind, where every thing is Regiſtred. There it is that things are weighed, judged, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and the quinteſſences of truths drawn. Ripe age is deſigned for contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. For the more ſtrength the Body loſes, the more the Soul acquires. The balance of the ſuperiour part riſes as much, as that of the inferiour falls. At that time men judge of things in a far different manner. Maturity of age ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Reaſon, and tempers the Paſſions. From ſeeing, one becomes intelligent; from contemplating wiſe. The Crown of a Prudent Man is to be a Philoſopher, by drawing from all things, in imitation of the laborious Bee, either the honey of pleaſant profit, or the wax that may ſerve to make a Torch to undeceive him. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy is nothing elſe but a meditation on death. It is good to think on it many times before, that one may ſucceed in it at the laſt.</p>

For they ingage Civility by making that a debt, which ought to be the cauſe of their thankfulneſs. Thus they change the obligation from paſſive to active, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better Politicians than Grammarians. That, in reality, is a great dexterity: but it would be a greater ſtill to ſee into it, and to baulk ſuch a fooliſh bargain, by giving them back their Civilities, and every one re-taking his own.</p>

               <p>Man, becauſe of the dignity of his Nature, thinking that he ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, ask't <hi>Jupiter,</hi> how long he was to live, <hi>Jupiter</hi> made anſwer, That when he reſolved to create all Animals, and then man, he had propoſed to allow eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them thirty years of life. Man was ſurprized to hear that ſo wonderfull a piece of Workmanſhip, as he was, had been made to laſt ſo ſhort a time, and that his life muſt paſs like a ſlower. He thought it ſtrange, that being ſcarcely come out of his Mother's Womb, he was to enter into that of the Earth, without enjoying the pleaſant ſtate, wherein he was created. I beſeech thee then, ſaid he, O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> (if it be ſo that my deſire be not contrary to thy Decrees) that ſince all the Animals unworthy of thy favours, have refuſed twenty years of the term of life, which thou haſt given them, being ignorant of the good thou didſt them, as being deſtitute of reaſon: it would pleaſe thee to grant them to me, that I may live them in their ſtead, and that thou mayſt be better ſerved by me. <hi>Jupiter</hi> finding the deſire reaſonable, allowed it: ſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lived his own thirty years, he ſhould
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53792:140"/>
begin to live, firſt, the twenty years, that the Aſs yielded, on condition that he ſhould perform all its duties, in labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, carting, drawing, and carrying to the Houſe all that was neceſſary for Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. That from fifty to ſeventy years of age he ſhould live the twenty years of the Dog, barking, and growling, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many troubles, and no pleaſure in any thing. And that at length from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty to ninety he ſhould accompliſh the years of the Ape, in imitating the defects of Nature.

               <p>That Talent gives luſter to all others, every thing hath its time, and that time is to be watched. For every day is not a day of triumph. There are ſome men of a particular Character, in whom little appears to be much, and the much makes them admired. When excellence concurs with ſtallage, it paſſes for a Prodigy. There are oſtentative Nations, and the Spaniſh with the firſt. The ſhew ſtands in ſtead of much, and particularly, if reality vouch for it. Heaven, which gives perfection, beſpeaks oſtentation; for without it all perfection would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſtraint. Art muſt goe along with Oſtentation. The excellenteſt things depend on circumſtances, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent are not always in ſeaſon. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Oſtentation comes unſeaſonably, it ſucceeds ill. Nothing admits leſs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, and that's the rock that Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation always ſplits upon, becauſe it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders near upon vanity, and vanity is very ſubject to contempt. It hath need of great moderation, that it may not be offenſive. For the too much of it hath
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53792:141"/>
already diſcredited it amongſt men of parts. Sometimes it conſiſts in a dumb Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and in ſhewing perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign. For a wiſe diſſimulation makes a plauſible Parade; the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation exciting curioſity the more. Its greateſt art is, not to ſhew all its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at once, but by degrees, and as if one were a-painting of it, to diſcover it the more. A lovely pattern ought to oblige men to ſhew ſomewhat ſtill more lovely, and the applauſe given to the firſt piece, makes the Spectatours impatient to ſee the reſt.</p>

Heaven that hath beſtowed this upon me, hath in like manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented me with the other. What would reality ſignifie to me without ſhew? Politicians now a-days moot nothing elſe, but that the greateſt Wiſedom conſiſts in making it appear. To know, and to know how to ſet it off, is doubly to know. For my own part, I would ſay of Oſtentation, what others ſay of good fortune, that an ounce of Oſtentation is better than pounds of capacity without it. What ſignifies it, though a thing be excellent, if it appear not? <hi>And two pages after.</hi> It is a politick Probleme,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53792:142"/>
whether or not reality be better than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. There are things great in themſelves, which appear not, and others that are inconſiderable, which appear much. So great effect produces the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or wanting Oſtentation. There are men in whom the little makes a great ſhew, and whoſe <hi>much</hi> is a ſubject of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Theſe are men of Parade; for when excellence and appearance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, they form a Prodigy. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we have ſeen eminent perſons, who have not appeared to be one half of what they were, for want of the dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Oſtentation. It is not long ſince, that a great Man, who in the field drove all before him, being called to a Council of War, was afraid of every body. He, that was ſo proper for action, was not at all for ſpeaking. Oſtentation gives a true luſtre to Heroick Qualities, and, as it were, a ſecond being to all things: that's to ſay, if reality vouch for it. For without merit, it is but a vulgar cheat: it ſerves onely to manifeſt defects, and by conſequent to beget contempt inſtead of applauſe. Some make a great buſtle to get out and appear upon the Theatre of the World, and all they doe is to publiſh the ignorance, which retirement civily concealed. But that is not to make Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53792:148"/>
Vanity is inſupportable every where, but here it is flouted at. Theſe little Piſmires of honour go a-begging the glory of great exploits. Shew as little as thou canſt thy moſt eminent qualities. Reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to doe, and leave it to others to talk of it. Give thy good actions, but ſell them not. Golden Pens muſt never be hired to write upon dirt; which is an Eye-ſore to all men of ſenſe. Strive ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a <hi>Heroe,</hi> than to ſhew it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, (ſays he in the Chapter of his <hi>Diſcreet,</hi> entituled <hi>Hazaſleria)</hi> pretend to moſt buſineſs, who have leaſt, becauſe they go a-hunting after occaſions, and magnifie them. They ſet a great value upon things that are worth leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They make a myſtery of every thing, and the ſmalleſt matter is to them a Prodigy. All their affairs are the prime tranſactions of the world, and all their actions exploits. Their whole life is a train of Miracles, to be publiſhed by the Trumpet of Fame. They have nothing that's common, every thing is ſingular in them, whether it be Valour, Knowledge, or Fortune. All vanity is juſtly recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned foppiſh, but bragging is intolerable. Wiſe Men make it more their honour to be great, than to appear ſo. But theſe men reſt ſatisfied with the bare appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53792:148"/>
To love to appear is ſo far from being a mark of ſublimity in them, that on the contrary it is a demonſtration of a low mind, ſince the leaſt thing appears as much to them as the greateſt. Pride is offenſive every where, but chiefly here. They meet with contempt where they look for eſteem. When they fanſie to themſelves that they will be admired, they find themſelves expoſed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of all men. Their vanity proceeds not at all from the greatneſs of Soul, but from the lowneſs of Heart, ſeeing they aſpire not to true honour, but onely to ſhews; not to real exploits, but to brag of them, without doing them. There are others, who would ſeem to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miniſters, great men for magnifying objects, there is no buſineſs ſmall as to them, of Atomes they make a great duſt, and of a little a great noiſe. They give themſelves out for men overwhelmed in buſineſs, and by conſequent, deſirous of repoſe and leiſure. They ſpeak onely by myſtery, their leaſt geſture is a ſubject of Divination. They make great excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and then, that they may the more ſurprize, ſtop ſhort, like to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines of <hi>Gianello della Torre,</hi> of as great noiſe, and as little profit. There is a great deal of difference, nay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53792:149"/>
betwixt great <hi>Doers,</hi> and great <hi>Talkers.</hi> For the more brave actions the former doe, the leſs they affect to ſpeak of them. They are ſatisfied to doe, and leave it to others to tell what they have done; and though others ſhould be ſilent, yet the things themſelves would ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak. The ſecond ſell at a dear rate, what others give <hi>gratis.</hi> They publiſh it with ſound of Trumpet: and for want of Pens enough amongſt thoſe of Fame, they hire golden Pens, (that's to ſay mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Pens) to make them write dirty Characters. <hi>And then he concludes in theſe terms.</hi> The Pens of Fame are not of Gold, becauſe they are neither to be ſold nor hired: but they have a better ſound than the fineſt Silver; they are of no value; but they beſtow it upon merit.</p>
               <p>To this may be added what <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid one day to a young <hi>bragadocio,</hi> who alledged to him the multitude of his buſineſs: <hi>That it became him well to ape the Woman.</hi>
