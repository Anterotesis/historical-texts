         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:48658:11"/>
that which ſeemeth to be the moſt peculiar and proper ſin of theſe times, <hi>deſpiſing dominion, and ſpeaking evil of dignities.</hi> The truth of all which, although in the general it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, yet in the particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof is bandied like a tennis ball by Chriſtians of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral profeſſions againſt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, none daring to let it reſt on their ſide, leſt withal they ſhould be forced to confeſs a loſs. Which though it may appear to be an argument of that generous diſpoſition which the very name and title of a Chriſtian ſeems to bring with it, poſſeſſing them that profeſs themſelves ſuch, with a general averſneſs to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any thing as juſtly laid unto their charge, which they
<pb facs="tcp:48658:12"/>
ſuſpect may barr them of that claim: yet I cannot conceive it altogether to agree with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, or rather ſincerity, by which the ſpirit of truth may be diſtinguiſhed from the ſpirit of errour, whoſe property it is to make men willing to confeſs the truth, although it be againſt themſelves, and to acknowledge with <hi>St. Paul,</hi> that they <hi>can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth,</hi> 2 Cor 13.8. For truth, as the God of truth, is but one, and can no more contradict it ſelf, then ceaſe to be: ſo that they who are once convicted of untruth, muſt of neceſſity either acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves in an errour, or elſe be left for ever inexcuſable, unleſs they can ſhew ſome ſpecial priviledge, by which they are
<pb facs="tcp:48658:12"/>
exempted from the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all mankind. In which reſpect, methinks, there is no equity at all in recriminations, unleſs the parties accuſed can as well acquit themſelves, as charge their accuſers. Which though ſome men may do ſufficiently in ſome particulars, yet that any man can do in all, I cannot eaſily believe, until I ſee ſome limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion put upon that general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciate of <hi>St. James,</hi> Jam. 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all</hi>: and that by the ſame authority, by which he ſpake it. So that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all partiality unto our ſelves, and prejudice againſt others, I ſuppoſe the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and indeed the onely ſure and certain means, to decide all controverted points, either of
<pb facs="tcp:48658:13"/>
opinion or practice amongſt men, purpoſely maintained and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, is to examine them how they agree with that which they pretend; and that which they pretend, with that which all good Chriſtians are agreed upon, the clear and undoubted principles of religion, ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that an ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may eaſily apprehend the meaning of them. I mean not ſo, that every one who hears them ſhall be effectually wrought upon both to believe them, and obey them, or be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned ſo, as to ſee evidence of truth in every concluſion, that in direct form of argument may be deduced from them: but ſo, that he agrees with others, in the
<pb facs="tcp:48658:13"/>
general ſence and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that what is contrary thereunto cannot be truth. In which regard, though many men have done worthily in confirming the truth, and convincing gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, yet I conceive the moſt effectual means to reduce them that wander from the errour of their wayes, is to repreſent unto them apparent evidences of their own inconſtant contradictions, and the irreconciliable inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of their own opinions and practices. For who ſhall juſtifie him that is condemned of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Or, what exception can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man take to his own evidence? <hi>Out of thy own mouth will I condemn thee,</hi> ſaith our Saviour in the parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.22. and, <hi>Thou
<pb facs="tcp:48658:14"/>
that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf</hi>? ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.21. Such an argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> although it be not alwayes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to confirm what men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake themſelves to maintain, yet may it be very available to convince their opponents, either of errour, or enormity: which as I conceive there is no man but is ſubject to, ſo hardly can I think any man ſo unreaſonable, but in his more retired thoughts he will acknowledge it unto himſelf, although peradventure, if not modeſty, yet pride will make him unwilling to confeſs it unto others. To ſet ſuch men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves, and bring them to take notice of that which their own deceitful hearts would fain conceal from them, I have
<pb facs="tcp:48658:14"/>
taken this pains. Wherein I ſhall have this advantage, that if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not any thing to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of others, yet I my ſelf in private may make uſe of it. For firſt, by this I hope it will appear, that the courſe which I have held (whatever ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs it may meet with for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) was not unadviſedly and raſhly undertaken, but upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration; and that I could not with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, alter my practice, unleſs I had been ſufficiently convinced of errour in mine opinion. And ſecondly it may be that which I ſeek to teach others, I may have occaſion to learn my ſelf, or at leaſt many times to renew the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it. And I ſhall take it thankfully from them, that
<pb facs="tcp:48658:15"/>
will favour me ſo much, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of mine own contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they finde me in any. Which that I may expect, with all the freedom that I can from a perſonal ingagement, I make bold to continue the uſe of the ſame borrowed name, under which I have formerly ſhadowed my ſelf.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48658:20"/>
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. He ſaith, <hi>Some indeed preach Chriſt even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will.

For all ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts.</hi> Whereby it appeares, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> not onely thought it poſsible that ſome men might, but likewiſe found it by experience true, that many men did propoſe unto themſelves one end in pretence, and another in truth. Nay, that which is yet more miſerable, mens own deceitful hearts many times are apt to carry them away with a falſe perſwaſion of their own ends, and make them think they ſeek indeed the glory of God, when in truth it is but their own repute and credit amongſt men.</p>

                  <p>For your own, as it concerns you moſt to be well aſſured of the truth of your intentions, ſo the means are more certain, if you will deale ſincerely with your ſelf in the uſe of them. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal is to beg of God, that he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover you unto your ſelf, as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.2. <hi>Examine me, O Lord, and prove me, try my reins and my heart</hi>: and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And ſee if there be any wicked way in me.</hi> As it is he that knoweth, ſo it is he that <hi>declareth unto man what is his thought. Am.</hi> 4.13. And if you be not willing to have your intentions thus tried and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto you by him, but dig deep to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48658:21"/>
hide your counſels from the Lord, you have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that you heart goes about to deceive you, and that you purpoſe ſomething elſe then you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. Subordinate unto this may be your examination and tryal of your ſelf in two particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if your pretended end be that which you intend indeed, you will not reſt ſatisfied with any thing elſe, until you have attained it: nay rather you will be impatient of every thing (though otherwiſe good and convenient) that you think may intercept, or interrupt the accompliſhment of what you mainly deſire. Thus <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant ſhewed plainly, that he came not unto <hi>Labans</hi> houſe for entertainment, but diſpatch of his buſineſs, when he ſaid, <hi>I will not eat, till I have told mine errand. Gen.</hi> 24.23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if your pretended end be that which you intend indeed, you will reſt ſatisfied with the accompliſhment of that, although you fail of other things, which otherwiſe you might have had: nay rather you will be glad, and deſire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48658:22"/>
to be deprived of, or debarred from any thing elſe, (how good, or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſoever it may be) by looſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the fruition of your main intended may be furthered. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews plainly, that the propagation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Goſpel was his main deſign, when he ſaith, <hi>None of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry, which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God. Acts</hi> 20.24. Thus <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi> ſhewed plainly, that he was ſincerely indeed affected unto <hi>Davids</hi> ſafety, when he was content to have parted, not onely with the half of his eſtate, but even with the whole, unto his own treacherous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Ziba,</hi> ſo long as he ſaw the <hi>King come again in peace to his own houſe.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.30.</p>

               <p>FOr other mens intents, though you cannot ſo certainly know them, as your own, nor need alwayes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after them: yet, when they are of publick and common concernment, and are urged as motives to draw you into action with them, it behoves you to take heed, that your opinions of them be not lightly undertaken, but upon good ground of reaſon: which muſt be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that evidence you find of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood and probability (for abſolute aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured certainty there can be none) that what they pretend they purpoſely aim at, and intend indeed: and in the right apprehenſion, and application, of that evidence eſpecially conſiſts the exerciſe and uſe, of that ſound wiſdom and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion wherewith a good man guideth his affairs, as the <hi>Pſamiſt</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48658:23"/>
5. and whereby he is taught to walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and evenly, between that weak and ſimple partiality, which believeth every word, and that uncharitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, which not onely ſuſpecteth, but cenſureth alſo as unſound, the moſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſincere profeſſions. To lend you ſome light in making this diſcovery, let me commend to your conſideration theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that mens intentions are many times varied by the ſucceſs of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they alter their ends, as means, occaſions, and opportunities, either frown upon, or favour them. And ſo ſometimes that which was at firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as an end, comes afterward to be made uſe of onely as a means unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end. Thus the end that <hi>Abſalom</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when he ſent <hi>Joab</hi> unto <hi>David.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32. was the regaining of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers grace and favour, but afterwards he made uſe of that grace &amp; favour for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, the promoting of his treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intent of uſurping the kingdom, which it may be before he dreamed not of. And ſomtimes that which was at the firſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48658:23"/>
intended onely as a means unto a further end, comes afterward to be reſted in as intended it ſelf, without relation unto any other end. Thus <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten tribes intended, or elſe pretended, as the onely end they aimed at, the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their burthens lighter; and their revolt from <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> ſeemed onely as a means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs that end: but afterward they reſted in that, as if they had all that they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and never regarded to return again to their obedience upon any termes. And ſometimes men being croſt in the ends that they before intended, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcover the impoſſibility, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, or errour of them, utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and ſet upon others. Thus when St. <hi>Paul went to the high Prieſt, and deſired of him letters to Damaſcus,</hi> the end he intended was, <hi>that if he found any diſciples of the Lord, he might bring them bound unto Jeruſalem. Acts</hi> 9.1, 2. But when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the end he aimed at was the propagation of the Goſpel, and the confirmation of that faith, which once he had deſtroyed. If therefore you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48658:24"/>
would judge aright of other mens inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you muſt be careful to diſtinguiſh between their intentions that have been heretofore, and thoſe that are now, otherwiſe you may be much miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Secondly conſider, that the ſucceſs of mens actions many times either is, or may be, much different from the ends which they intend in them. Thus <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> brethren intended nothing leſs then his advancement in <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Pharoah,</hi> vvhen they ſold him to the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi>: yet God by that means brought it to paſs. And it may be the alteration of Religion to Idolatry was not intended by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten tribes, when they revolted from the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> at leaſt they made no ſhew thereof; but onely the making lighter of that yoak, which they conceived to be grievous and heavy; yet the change of the government quickly brought forth the change of the Religion too. Therefore you may be miſtaken, if you think that alwayes to have been the end intended in other mens actions, which you finde to be the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48658:24"/>
effect that followeth thereupon: or if you think, that ſuch an effect will never follow upon ſuch an action, becauſe it is not the end intended in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly conſider, that many men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, at the ſame time, in the ſame action, may notwithſtanding have divers intentions, and propoſe unto themſelves different ends. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Some indeed preach Chriſt even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will. The one preach Chriſt of contention, not ſincerely, ſuppoſing to add affliction to my bonds: but the other of love, knowing that I am ſet for the defence of the Goſpel.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no good conſequence to ſay, Such a man doth the ſame that other men do, therefore he aims at the ſame end with them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly conſider, that divers men imployed, at the ſame time, in different actions, may notwithſtanding aim at, and propoſe unto themſelves, one and the ſame end. Thus the thirty thouſand that lay in ambuſh againſt <hi>Ai,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> with the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that made as though they were beaten before the men
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48658:25"/>
of <hi>Ai,</hi> and fled by the way of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all intended the deſtruction of the City. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8. Thus <hi>Ittai,</hi> that would not be perſwaded to return into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but paſſed over the brook <hi>Kidron</hi> before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar,</hi> that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ark of God again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and carried there, and <hi>Huſha<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> the Archite, that returned to the City, and aboda with Abſolom, all intended <hi>Davids</hi> ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. Therefore it is no good conſequence to ſay, Becauſe this and that mans actions are different, therefore their ends are not the ſame.</p>

                  <p>How apt you are to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? My purpoſe is indeed to give you the beſt directions that I can, how you may judge of other mens intentions, and not be deceived therein: but firſt I thought it requiſite to let you ſee, how many wayes you may be miſſed, and what appearances you ought not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to give heed unto, as neceſſary evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to ground a certain reſolution on: although I deny not, but that they may give juſt occaſion many times to ſome ſuſpition, or ſurmiſe, eſpecially then when you plainly perceive them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto, or differing from that which is openly profeſſed and pretended. As if you perceive the ends which any man doth now pretend, to be different from thoſe which he formerly profeſſed to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48658:26"/>
intend, you may very reaſonably ſuſpend your reſolution, that he deals ſincerely now, untill you have more then his own bare word to warrant it. Thus when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was come to <hi>Heiruſalem,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to joyn himſelf to the diſciples, they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a diſciple, but <hi>Barnabas</hi> took him and brought him to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and declared unto them, how he had ſeen the Lord in the way, and that he had ſpoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> in the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; and then he was with them coming in and going out at <hi>Heiruſalem. Acts</hi> 9.26, 27, 28. So if you ſee the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of mens actions directly contrary to the ends, which they pretended to aim at in thoſe actions, and yet that they are well pleaſed with, and glad of ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, you may probably ſuſpect, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their pretences, the ends which they intended before, were the ſame with the effects that followed after. And on the contrary, if the ſucceſs of mens actions be agreeable unto the ends that they pretended, and yet they appear
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48658:26"/>
to be grieved with it, and diſpleaſed at it, you have then juſt cauſe to conceive, that either their pretences before were falſe, or elſe that their intentions are altered ſince. Thus <hi>David</hi> diſcovereth the falſehood of his feigned friends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his treacherous enemies, by their rejoycing in his adverſity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.15. And by their magnifying of themſelves againſt him, when his foot ſlipped. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.16. But <hi>Saul</hi> pretending that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in <hi>David,</hi> and meant his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement by the marriage of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deſiring no other dowry of him, but an hundred foreskins of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi> it plainly appeared, that he meant not truly, but diſſembled with <hi>David,</hi> in that he was grieved with his good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and was the more afraid of him the more he proſpered. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.12. &amp;c. So when you ſee many men at the ſame time, ingage themſelves in the ſame actions, you muſt have other reaſons more then their own profeſſions onely, to induce you to be of another opinion, or elſe you may very well ſuppoſe it probable, that the ends they aim at are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48658:27"/>
the ſame. Thus <hi>Sampſon</hi> would have the three thouſand men, that came to him in the top of the rock <hi>Etam,</hi> to ſwear unto him, that they would not fall upon him themſelves, before he would believe, that coming to binde him, as the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> did, they meant not to kill him too, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.12, 13. And when you hear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men profeſſing to aim at the ſame end, and yet notwithſtanding ſee that they engage themſelves in different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you may probably conjecture, if you ſhould give credit to their bare pretences, that you might be deceived.

                  <p>Firſt, I would have you, as much you can, to rid your ſelf of all partiality and prejudice, and when you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48658:28"/>
enter upon this enquiry, to do it with all poſſible indifferency. A preconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved opinion in the mind, like perſpective made of coloured glaſſe, will render e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing as like it ſelf as may be: and if before you enter into your enquiry, you entertain an opinion of other mens pretences, that they are either agreeable unto, or different from, the ends which they intend indeed, it will be a difficult matter to perſwade you to the contrary almoſt by any argument.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I would have you to take heed of truſting too much unto any one apparent evidence: for in conjectural caſes, where the reſolution muſt be ſwaied by the moſt probabilities, many circumſtances muſt concur, as ſeveral items, to make up the total ſum of that concluded argument, wherewith the mouth of contradiction may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48658:29"/>
perſwade you to it. For though diſtruſt as well as diſsimulation, be many times more agreeable to humane worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, then confidence and ſingle hearted ſincerity; which made him in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre ſay, <hi>Haud rectè facit, qui facile credit:</hi> yet the rule of religious piety, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity, is rather to bear, believe, hope and endure all things, then to be eaſily provoked to think any evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 5, 7.

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48658:30"/>
Our Saviour himſelf ſpeaking of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the father of lies, ſaith, <hi>He was a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. John</hi> 8.44. His meaning is not, that the devil can never ſpeak any truth at all, but that he cannot continue conſtant to that truth he ſpeaks: the truth is not in him, no more then he is of the truth: and the truth that he ſpeaks ſometimes, is an evidence againſt him, that at other times he lies. Thus the ſpirit that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to perſwade <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he might go up, and fall at <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> ſpake truth, when he ſaid, <hi>he would go forth, and be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of Ahabs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.22. But he quickly fell off again from that truth, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted <hi>Micaiah,</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> and pretended himſelf to be the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord. <hi>They went out from us,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. Paul, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us.</hi> 1 John 2.19. and Chap. 4.5, 6. <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48658:31"/>
world, and the world heareth them. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us: hereby know we the ſpirit of truth, and the ſpirit of errour.</hi> By this I ſuppoſe it may appear, that the beſt means to try the truth of other mens pretences, is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own agreement with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and how they keep conſtant to their own profeſſed principles: for if it appear, that indeed they contradict themſelves, and that there is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent contrariety between the ends that they pretend to aim at, and the principles upon which they ground their proceedings in action, as with relation to thoſe ends, they muſt of neceſsity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a falſehood in the one, or in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and either renounce their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſo condemn their own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or elſe, if they will ſtick faſt unto thoſe, and juſtifie theſe, you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that what ever they did before, yet now they aim at other ends than they pretend. For actions are never undertaken as means, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations unto ends, and it is impoſſible, that any man ſhould purpoſely perſiſt in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48658:31"/>
the uſe of thoſe as means, which he knows are deſtructive of the ends which he intends. This I ſuppoſe is that which <hi>St. Paul</hi> aims at, when he ſaith, <hi>If</hi> I <hi>build again the things which I deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a tranſgreſſor. Gal.</hi> 2.18. and I doubt not but it would have been as true, if he had ſaid, <hi>If I deſtroy again the things which I had built. A man that is an heretick</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject: Knowing that he that is ſuch is ſubverted, and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf. Tit.</hi> 3.10, 11. And though there be no note of connexion between thoſe two verſes, and the two former, yet it may not be amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Apoſtle hath placed theſe words next unto thoſe, wherein he had ſaid, <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works: theſe things are good and profitable for men. But avoid fooliſh queſtions, and genealogies, and contentions and ſtrivings about the Law: for they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and vain.</hi> As intimating, that the ſelfe condemnation of hereticks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48658:32"/>
in this, that the errors in opinion, and enormities in action, which they purpoſely maintain and practiſe, are contrary to, and inconſiſtent with the ends, which they profeſs to aime at, namely, the glory of God in their own and other mens eternal good, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual profit, <hi>that they may be made heires, according to the hope of eternal life,</hi> as he ſpeaks <hi>ver.</hi> 7. ſo that if you ſee men avow ſuch actions, allow themſelves liberty to keep ſuch courſes, and plead ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in their defence, as are contrary to, and inconſiſtent with the ends which they pretend, you have reaſon to ſuſpect their pretences to be falſe: if when that inconſiſtent contrariety is plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and made known unto them, they renounce thoſe principles, condemn themſelves for thoſe practiſes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves afterwards unto thoſe other courſes, which are undoubtedly available unto thoſe ends, you have good cauſe then to conceive, that what they profeſſed they purpoſely intended, and that in undertaking thoſe actions, and urging thoſe principles to ground them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48658:32"/>
on, they did but <hi>humanum pati,</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that common infirmity, which all mankind is ſubject to, <hi>errare, labi, decipi,</hi> and ſo deſerve rather to be cenſured of ignorance and miſunderſtanding, then of hypocriſie and diſsimulation. But if when the inconſiſtent contrariety of the means they uſe, and the ends they pretend to aim at, is evidently demonſtrated, and laid open before them, they either wilfully ſhut their eyes, and will not ſee it, or obſtinately perſiſt in their courſes notwithſtanding, you may then conclude (with as much certainty as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens intentions can be known with) that thoſe ends, which they intend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are not the ſame which they make ſhew of, and profeſs.</p>

                  <p>For the firſt, that there is cauſe to ſuſpect thoſe men of falſehood in their pretences, whoſe courſes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ends which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to aim at, you may ſee by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who blamed St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and withſtood him to his face, when he ſaw that he walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the Goſpel, and ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou being a Jew liveſt after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? Gal.</hi> 2.14. St. <hi>Peters</hi> behaviour in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing and ſeparating himſelf from the Gentiles for fear of the Jews, was in <hi>St. Pauls</hi> apprehenſion inconſiſtent with that Chriſtian liberty, which they both profeſſed to intend the maintenance of, againſt <hi>the falſe brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to ſpy out their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they had in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring them into bondage. ver.</hi> 4. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48658:33"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was to be blamed, as both diſſembling himſelf, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion unto others to diſſemble with him. If you ſay, that the diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation there was not in the end, but in the action: I grant it true, yet withal I may adde, that the diſſimulation was not of the action, but of the end. For the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is alwayes more apparent then the end, and there is greater cauſe to ſuſpect that which is ſecret, then that which is open. So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> might well ask St. <hi>Peter,</hi> why he did ſo, and could not be certainly aſſured, that he dealt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in publickly profeſſing the end with himſelf, untill he knew ſome other ſeeming reaſon, that miſguided him to take ſuch a contrary courſe of practiſe as he did.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, <hi>St Paul</hi> ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indeed to be zealous of the Law, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whilſt he was a Phariſee, in that when he was converted, and came to underſtand, that <hi>Chriſt was the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, Rom.</hi> 10.4. and <hi>that the Law of righteouſneſs was not to be attained unto by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48658:34"/>
the works of the Law but onely by faith. Rom:</hi> 9.30, 31, 32. he conferred not with fleſh and blood, which would have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him ſtill to have continued, as he had been formerly, exceedingly zealous of the traditions of his fathers, having <hi>profited in the Jews religion above many of his equals in his own nation,</hi> Gal. 1.14, 16. <hi>But what things had formerly been gain unto him, thoſe he counted loſs for Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. Not making <hi>void the Law through faith, but eſtabliſhing the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.31. Whereas the Scribes and Phariſees, and the reſt of the unbelieving Jews, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or made fruſtrate, and of none effect, the Commandment of God, that they might keep their own traditions: as our Saviour complains, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.6, &amp;c. and taxeth them expreſly of hypocriſie therein: which could not be aſcribed to any falſehood and diſſimulation in their actions (for what they practiſed they purpoſed, as well as profeſſed) but in their ends, which they pretended to be the ſtrict obſervation of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, but meant thoſe doctrines of their own, by which they taught men,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48658:34"/>
not to obey, but to tranſgreſs the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God; as there he makes it evident, by their falſe gloſs upon the firſt Commandment, and upon others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17, &amp;c. By vindicating of the Law from which he made it appear, that he came not to deſtroy, but to fulfil it. And therefore when the Jews accuſed St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he taught all men every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people, and the Law, and the Temple, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.28. he pleads not guilty unto all: that they neither found him in the Temple diſputing with any man, neither raiſing up the people, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Synagogues: but he openly confeſſeth, that after the way which they call hereſie, ſo worſhipped he the God of his fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets, and having hope towards God, which they themſelves alſo allowed, that there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.12, &amp;c. and <hi>Acts</hi> 25.8. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Law of the Jews, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Temple, nor yet againſt Ceſar have I offended any thing at all.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though <hi>Tertullus</hi> pretend, that when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48658:35"/>
they took him they would have judged him according to their Law, &amp; complain of great violence in the chief Captain <hi>Lyſias,</hi> when he took him away out of their hands, commanding his accuſers to come unto <hi>Foelix</hi> the governour to be examined, <hi>Acts</hi> 24, 6, 7, 8. Yet he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Annanias</hi> the high Prieſt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, that ſitting to judge him after the Law, he commanded him to be ſmitten contrary to the Law. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.3. And though he himſelf appeal unto <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I ſtand at Ceſars judgement ſeat, where I ought to be judged. And if I be an offender, or have committed any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, I refuſe not to die: but if there be none of theſe things, whereof theſe accuſe me, no man may deliver me unto them:</hi> yet he urgeth <hi>Feſtus</hi> his own knowledge for it, that <hi>unto the Jews he had done no wrong, Acts</hi> 25.10, 11. The reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did indeed, that which they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended to do: as appears by the like apologie, which he makes unto the chief of the Jews at <hi>Rome, Acts</hi> 28.17, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For the third, when <hi>Johanan</hi> the ſon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48658:35"/>
of <hi>Kareah,</hi> and the captains of the forces, and the people that were with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to pray unto the Lord for them, <hi>that he might ſhew them the way, wherein they might walk, and the thing that they might do, Jer.</hi> 42.2, 3. profeſſing that they would obey the voice of the Lord their God what ever it were, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells them plainly <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>that they diſſembled in their hearts,</hi> when they ſaid ſo: and their behaviour afterward made it plainly to appear, that he was not miſtaken, when they directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, not him alone, but themſelves alſo, and ſaid, <hi>As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee: But we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth of our own mouth, Chap.</hi> 44.16, 17. Thus our Saviour convinceth the Jews, that what ever they pretended, yet he knew that the love of God was not in them, becauſe he came in his fathers name, and they received him not, and yet were ready to receive another, that ſhould come in his own name, <hi>John</hi> 5.42, 43. That for all the great confidence in <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48658:36"/>
which they boaſted of, yet they believed him not in deed: <hi>There is one,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that accuſeth you, even Moſes, in whom ye truſt. For had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. ver.</hi> 45, 46.</p>
                  <p>By this you may perceive, how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is, that to clear the ſincerity of mens pretended ends, they ſhould order all their actions ſo, and eſpecially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch principles only to plead for them by, as that there may appear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant accord and uniformity between them all; and that the apparent contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and inconſiſtent contradiction of mens actions practiſed and ends preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (ſo long as thoſe actions are avowed and perſiſted in) is the moſt unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence that can be gathered, of falſehood and hypocriſie in that which they profeſs to aim at and intend.</p>

                  <p>I doubt not but there may, and I will give you Inſtances of ſome. One ſhall be this, If you ſee an underſtanding and conſiderate man, that is wont to do nothing but adviſedly (for there is no certain hold to be had of them that do all things as at random raſhly) making ſhew to intend ſome particular end, as conducible, or agreeable unto ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther general end, which you are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he ſtandeth engaged for, and really intends the accompliſhment thereof, you may well be perſwaded of the truth of that, as well as of this intention. But if there appear an expreſs contrariety, or inconſiſtent contradiction, between the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48658:37"/>
one end and the other, you may eaſily conceive, that the more particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended end (eſpecially if it be not of ſo great importance to the agent, as the other more general) is not really inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded indeed. Thus the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> general intended end being the oppreſſion of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and weakening them ſo, that they might ſubdue them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it might eaſily appear, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy they uſed, in ſuffering no Smith in Iſrael, was purpoſely intended, as they ſaid, leſt the Hebrews ſhould make them ſwords or ſpears: becauſe this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar end was both agreeable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable unto that general end. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.9, &amp;c. Thus <hi>Huſhai</hi> his faithful friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto <hi>David</hi> being generally known, and that he really intended indeed the ſafety of the King, it was weakly done of <hi>Abſolom</hi> and the men of Iſrael, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve at the firſt, without any other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence beſides his own teſtimony, that <hi>Huſhaies</hi> coming unto <hi>Abſolom</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely intended, as he profeſſed, to ſerve in his preſence, as he had done in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.16, &amp;c. becauſe it agreed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48658:37"/>
not with his other more general and more important end, and therefore might juſtly have been ſuſpected of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and diſſimulation.</p>
                  <p>Another ſhall be this, If you ſee an underſtanding man make profeſſion of propoſing ſuch an end unto himſelf, as you are ſure he knows well enough it is impoſſible for him to obtain, you may eaſily believe, that he intends it not: nay hardly ſhall you finde, that any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intends any end, of which he hath not ſome probability at leaſt to ground an hopeful expectation upon. Thus had not the Lord of purpoſe infatuated <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom</hi> and the men of Iſrael, to defeat the good counſel of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> that he might bring evil upon <hi>Abſolom,</hi> they might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſeen, that <hi>Huſhai</hi> intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs then <hi>Davids</hi> deſtruction, when he propounded the drawing of that city into the river with ropes, into which he ſuppoſed <hi>David</hi> might be gotten, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.13, 14. a project, if not altogether impoſſible, yet ſo improbable, that no reaſonable man could imagine he ever intended it indeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48658:38"/>But I will add no more concerning the diſcovery of other mens intended ends: becauſe as I ſaid before, there is no ſuch abſolute certainty therein, but that do the beſt you can, you may per-adventure be miſtaken, unleſs you had that extraordinary gift of diſcerning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whereof <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. which is not now adayes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, Therefore if you will, let us proceed unto your next enquiry, about thoſe actions, which are uſed as means, for the obtaining of thoſe ends, that are pretended.</p>

                  <p>NAy, one thing more before we proceed, I pray you give me leave to enquire further of you. Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for granted, that the ends which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48658:38"/>
men profeſs to aim at, are really indeed intended by them, yet that I ſuppoſe is not ſufficient to warrant them. For though no man I preſume will pretend, or can indeed intend any ends, but thoſe which either are indeed, or elſe at leaſt appear unto him to be good; yet many men I doubt are miſtaken in their own ends, and propoſe thoſe things unto themſelves to be obtained, which they ought not to ſeek.</p>

                  <speaker>Judg.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true as you ſay: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the end of every action, though laſt in execution, is firſt in intention, and conſequently holds a principal place in the affection of the agent, ſo the firſt and chiefeſt care, about both your own and other mens ends, muſt be to be rightly informed, whether they be good indeed or no. But for ſubordinate ends, becauſe in reſpect of thoſe that are ſupreme, they are but intermediate means, we ſhall ſpeak of them afterwards: and for the ſupreme end of all, you ſaid well at the firſt, that it muſt be the advancement of the glory of God, &amp; that nothing muſt be intended at all, but that which may
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48658:39"/>
be probably at leaſt ſubſervient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Therefore without any further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry let us take it for granted, that they who indeed propoſe unto themſelves the advancement of the glory of God, and they who profeſs and pretend to do ſo, are ſo far forth to be approved of: and they that ſo far neglect the glory of God, as either to propoſe unto themſelves, or pretend unto others, that they aim at ſuch ends, as are altogether contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or any way inconſiſtent with, the advancement thereof, are ſo far forth blame worthy.

                  <p>THe next thing that I deſire to be informed in, is the choice of the means, which I ſhould uſe, for obtaining of the ends, which I propoſe unto my ſelf.

                  <p>That rule may be generally true, and for the moſt part: yet it is ſubject unto ſome exceptions, and muſt be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with divers cautions, whereof I will give you theſe particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome means may be conducible unto the general ſupreme end of all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48658:40"/>
things, the advancement of the glory of God, which are not properly conducible unto ſome one particular ſubordinate end, which you may aim at as ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto the general. As for example, the advancement of the glory of God was the general ſupreme end that <hi>St. Paul</hi> aimed at in preaching the Goſpel, in preaching the Goſpel to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians freely, and in taking wages of the Philippians, he had divers particular ſubordinate ends, yet both ſubſervient unto the general, and as the partticular ends were divers, ſo the means he uſed to that purpoſe were different, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary. That the Philippians ſhould communicate with him, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning giving and receiving, he was well content, becauſe he deſired fruit that might abound to their account, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.15, 17. But amongſt the Corinthians he would be chargeable to no man, that he might cut off occaſion from them which deſired occaſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.9, 12. and being crafty might catch them with guile, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16. To preach the Goſpel freely at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and to take wages at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48658:40"/>
though alike conducible unto the ſupreme and general, had yet been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the particular ſubordinate ends, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> did aim at and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſome means may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conducible unto ſome particular ſubordinate ends, that are not alwayes conducible unto, but rather ſometimes deſtructive of the general ſupreme end. For inſtance, the advancement of the glory of God was the ſupreme end that <hi>St. Paul</hi> aimed at in Preaching the Goſpel: the preſervation of <hi>St. Pauls</hi> life and liberty was a ſpecial ſubordinate end ſubſervient unto that general: which both himſelf was careful of, and the Churches prayed for, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.6, 17, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 25.10, 11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 22. <hi>St. Pauls</hi> forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might in all probability have been a means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his life and liberty, but had been a means withal to prevent him of that opportunity which there was to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him, of advancing the glory of God, in being ſet for the defence of the Goſpel, which makes him ſo paſſionately
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48658:41"/>
put them off, who earneſtly beſought and would fain have perſwaded him not to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem. What mean you to weep and to break my heart, Acts</hi> 21.13. And himſelf profeſſeth afterward, that the things which happened unto him, had fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Goſpel. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſome means in the eye of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſence and reaſon, may probably ſeem to be contrary unto, or inconſiſtent with either the general and ſupreme, or particular ſubordinate ends, which men aim at, and yet may be requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be uſed, for the obtaining of thoſe ends, being ſpecially warranted to that purpoſe by Gods own direction. Thus to the end that God might advance his own honour, by delivering the Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites into the hands of the Iſraelites, <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deons</hi> army of 32000. muſt be reduced unto bare 300. by Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſome means in the eye of humane ſenſe and reaſon, may probably appear to be either requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or at leaſt conducible unto the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48658:41"/>
ends intended by them, which yet muſt not be uſed, as being either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unlawful, or by ſome ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from God prohibited. Thus the cutting off of <hi>Sauls</hi> life had in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility been a ſpeedy and effectual means of advancing the glory of God, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening <hi>David</hi> to the quiet poſſeſſion of the kingdom of Iſrael, whereunto he had been ordained by God, and anointed by <hi>Samuel</hi>: yet <hi>David</hi> neither dare himſelf ſtretch forth his own hand againſt the Lords anointed, nor ſuffer <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to ſmite him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.8, &amp;c. nay his own heart ſmote him, becauſe he had cut off <hi>Sauls</hi> ſkirt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. Thus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Gibeonites was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means to perfect the conqueſt of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet the children of Iſrael might not touch them, becauſe <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had made peace with them, and the Princes of the Congregation had ſworn unto them: although therein they had dealt unadviſedly, yea contrary to the general direction, which they had received from God himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2. and in ſundry other places: and though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48658:42"/>
all the Congregation murmured againſt the Princes for it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. Yea, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 400. years after, <hi>Saul</hi> in his zeal to the children of Iſrael and Judah, ſought to ſlay the Gibeonites, God puniſhed it in the dayes of <hi>David,</hi> with three years famine year after year, and God was not intreated for the land, till after that they had performed all that the King had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, according to the Gibeonites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. So to take the next way thorow the land of the Philiſtines, might appear to be a ready means, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods glory, in the ſpeedy performance of his promiſe to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in putting them into poſſeſſion of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the lot of their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: Yet becauſe God would have it ſo, they muſt be led about, thorow the way of the wilderneſs of the Red ſea, though there they wandered forty years together. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.17, 18. Nay, rather then go the direct way thorow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Edomites, without the Kings leave, he refuſing to permit them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, although they promiſed to behave themſelves peaceably, they muſt turn
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48658:42"/>
away from him, <hi>Num.</hi> 20. So long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had kings of their own, did God begin to teach his people what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect was due unto them. Yea, when one day, contrary to Gods appointment, they would go up that way, which the day before they had refuſed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to go, God puniſhed their preſumption, and ſuffered them to be chaſed by their enemies as bees. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.40, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.1, 26, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>By this I ſuppoſe it may ſufficiently appear, that your general rule for the choice of means to be uſed for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing of ends intended, is not ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, but that it may meet with ſome exceptions, and therefore the practiſe thereof may have need to be limited with cautions.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48658:43"/>
lawfulneſs of it, both in it ſelf and unto you. For you may not do the leaſt evil of purpoſe to obtain the greateſt good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5, &amp;c. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.7.

Therefore though the end be never ſo good, which is intended, though the means propounded ſeem never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and available unto that end, if you cannot uſe it without ſin, you muſt reſolve to let it alone; and that is, when in uſing that means, you ſhall do that, which is either unlawful in it ſelf, or elſe unlawful unto you.

By the judgement of all interpreters, I think it is agreed, that he doth not leave every man at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do what he liſteth, but directly requires, that every man be perſwaded certainly of the lawfulneſs of every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he undertakes. Which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of lawfulneſs (according to the ſcope of the Apoſtles ſpeech) muſt be extended not onely to the nature and eſſence of the action, but likewiſe to thoſe adherent circumſtances, the variety whereof may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48658:46"/>
alter the caſe: as upon what ground, to what end, with what intent it is done, and what the ſucceſs of the action either muſt, or may be. So that you muſt reſolve not to do any thing of which you are not fully perſwaded in your own conſcience, that it is lawful for you to do it; nor to leave any thing undone, whereof you are not fully perſwaded in your own conſcience, that it is not neceſſary to be done by you; whether ſimply in it ſelf, or <hi>ex conceſſo, rebus ſic ſtantibus.</hi> Not that the perſwaſion of your own conſcience is a ſufficient warrant to juſtifie you, either before God or man, for your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, which you are confident your ſelf is lawful, or for the leaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that which you are ſatisfied in your ſelf is not neceſſary. For that may be neceſſary to be done by you, which you are perſwaded is not, and that may not be lawful to be done by you which you are perſwaded is. But that your own conſcience, being a power eſtabliſhed by God in your ſoul, to judge between him and you, the voice there is a law unto you: which if you tranſgreſs, by doing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48658:46"/>
contrary thereunto, you are condemned of your ſelf; and if you neglect it, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing without the direction thereof, you overrun your warrant, and act without authority.</p>

And therefore when I

come to examine any action by the touchſtone of the Scripture, the ſoul whereof is the ſenſe and meaning of the words, and finde it ſo differently rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by divers, that both cannot poſſibly accord in one, what ſhall I doe?

                  <p>This I confeſs is a great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, &amp; ſuch as the conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may give men juſt occaſion to break out, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth, into this paſsionate exclamation, <hi>O ubi eſtis, fontes Lachryma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum? &amp; quid faciemus? quò ibimus</hi>?

But you muſt not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48658:48"/>
think it ſtrange, it alwayes hath been, is, and ever will be ſo: ſo long as men ſee, but as thorow a glaſs darkly, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect to know any thing perfectly, but onely in part. <hi>I Cor.</hi> 13.9, 12. And though ſome, in compariſon of others, may be men in underſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, even in himſelf, and in <hi>Apollo,</hi> to learn not to think of men above that which is written: that none of you, ſaith he, <hi>be puffed up for one againſt another,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. When therefore you meet with ſuch differences, remember that direction of St. <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1, &amp;c. <hi>Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits, whether they are of God,</hi> &amp;c. And the rule that he layes down to try them by, is their concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and agreement with undoubted truths. All things in Scripture are not doubted of, or drawn into diſpute: ſome things are ſo plainly and clearly laid down, that all men, by whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is received as the word of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon them. Let thoſe then be your ſcantlings of the reſt, and what you finde moſt agreeable to that, which is confeſt

by all, that cleave unto. As falſhood is alwayes inconſiſtent with truth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto it, as light is to darkneſs; ſo good and evil can no more cloſe, and be firmly united unto one another, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds unto duſt or dirt.

                  <p>That I will: and firſt for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of opinion. You know it is much

diſputed, between the Divines of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches and thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> how thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat:</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my body,</hi> muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: whether in reſpect of natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, or of ſacramental uſe. To try which of theſe is the true meaning of the words, bring them both to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principles, which no good Chriſtian doth or dare deny: that the body of Chriſt was a true natural body, conceived by the holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>: and that in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual body he was crucified, died, was buried, roſe again from the dead, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God. That interpretation, which accords with theſe and all other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, you may be ſure is true, as the latter evidently doth; and that which is contrary to, and inconſiſtent with theſe, or any other certain principles, muſt needs be falſe: as the later apparently is. And the like may be ſaid in other controverted points of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for matter of practice. It is diſputed between the divines of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48658:50"/>
reformed Churches, and thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> how that paſſage of <hi>St. Paul, Rom.</hi> 13.1, &amp;c. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers</hi> &amp;c. muſt be underſtood: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſubjection of all perſons and cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtical as civil, unto thoſe Magiſtrates, in whom the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority reſides, or of civil on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To try which of theſe is the true meaning of the place, bring them both to thoſe undoubted principles, which no good Chriſtian, no nor reaſonable man can deny, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</hi> and <hi>ſuum cuique,</hi> which we may ſee atteſted by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do you even ſo to them.

That interpretation, which accords with theſe principles, as the former doth, you may be ſure is true: and that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, and inconſiſtent with theſe principles, as the latter is, muſt needs be falſe: and the like may be ſaid in other caſes and queſtions.</p>

                  <p>The onely means I know to this end is to conſider theſe two things. Firſt, the cauſes and occaſions of ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as proceed from an extraordinary work of the ſpirit, have themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then ordinary in them: as in <hi>Gideons</hi> incounter with the Midianites, <hi>Judges</hi> 7. <hi>Jonathans</hi> with the Philiſtines, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. When the holy Ghoſt, in the book of <hi>Judges,</hi> had often ſaid, that the ſpirit of the Lord came upon ſuch or ſuch a one, or that God raiſed him up to be a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and that he judged Iſrael, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby an extraordinary, ſpecial, and immediate motion of the ſpirit of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48658:54"/>
God, whereby he was both ſtirred up, and warranted, to undertake that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, he addeth in the end, <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no King in Iſrael: every man did that which was right in his own eyes</hi>: as intimating extraordinary motions of the ſpirit to take place onely in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ordinary means. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the government was once ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we hear no more of that phraſe, to import an extraordinary motion of the ſpirit ſtirring any man up to undertake and exerciſe that charge. So ſince the ſacred volume of the Scriptures is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, for them that acknowledge the ſufficiencie thereof, to be the light of faith, and rule of life, either to expect in themſelves, or pretend unto others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelations now, is in effect as much, as to light a candle at noon day, and fetch water in a bucket from a ſpring to pour into, not a river onely, but the Ocean it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>If you ſpeak of ſuch ſpiritual bondage as is evil, and from which the liberty purchaſed by Chriſt hath ſet men free, all bond of conſcience is not ſpiritual bondage: for to be bound in conſcience to ſerve God in obedience, according unto his revealed will, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs, is not contrary, but ſubordinate unto ſpiritual liberty, the very end for which we are delivered out of the hands of our enemies, as <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 1, 74, 75.

                  <p>YOu ſaid even now, that ſome of thoſe, who take upon them to maintain the lawfulneſs of reſiſtence in this kinde, are conſtrained to fly to ſuch principles, as you conceive are either falſe in themſelves, or in the application of them tend to the utter overthrow of all good government, and to take away the very foundation of all humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

                  <speaker>Judg.</speaker>
                  <p>One is, that the ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in reſpect of thoſe that are under his authority, is <hi>major ſingulis,</hi> but <hi>minor univerſis.</hi> This I take to be falſe: for the ſupreme Magiſtrate, as ſuch, is <hi>Solo Deo minor,</hi> and unto all his ſubjects, not <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim</hi> onely, but <hi>conjunctim</hi> alſo, is in ſtead
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48658:64"/>
of God, who is greater then all. Another is, that the power of government is originally in the people, &amp; only derived from, &amp; intruſted by them, unto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate. This I am perſwaded is falſe: for the power of government is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally in God, derived from, &amp; intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by him, to the ſupreme magiſtrate, even then when the perſon, in whom that authority reſides, is deſigned by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as in elective governments, much more where the government is ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and hereditary. The holy Ghoſt in Scripture ſtyleth Magiſtrates the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God, and the ſervants of the Lord: but never that I know the miniſters of the people, or the ſervants of their ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Another is, that ſubjects have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the ſupreme Magiſtrate, which is of a far more excellent and high nature, then that intereſt, which the ſupreme Magiſtrate hath in his ſubjects. But this I am confident is falſe: for the intereſt, which the ſupreme Magiſtrate, as ſuch, hath in his ſubjects, is Gods intereſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not abſolute, as his is; yet ſuch as,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48658:65"/>
however limited, he hath for God, and unto him muſt be anſwerable for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof.</p>
                  <p>Another is, that <hi>Salus populi eſt ſuprema lex,</hi> which is a truth indeed, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: But being ſo applyed, as that the people themſelves, or any deputed by them, ſhall be eſteemed competent judges of what is neceſſary for their own ſafety, without the concurrence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, tends utterly, as I conceive, to take away all authority from him, yea to looſe the bands of all humane ſociety. For if ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall ſtand no longer bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obey their Soveraigns, then they themſelves ſhall eſteem it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and that it is not neceſſary to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the apprehenſion of the like neceſsity may as well warrant children to withdraw their obedience from their parents, ſervants from their maſters, yea equals their friendſhip and fidelity from one another. Yea, though the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be not really apprehended indeed, but only pretended, and this ſupreme law pleaded for it, and that ſubjects, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48658:65"/>
ſeverally or joyntly, may them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by any deputed by them, be Judges of that law, againſt, or without the approbation and allowance of ſupreme Authority, <hi>actum eſt de imperio,</hi> the Magiſtrate muſt hold his eſtate but of courteſie, at the will and pleaſure of the people: for when ever they have a minde to diſobey, and finde themſelves in caſe to make their party good, it is no more but to pretend an extraordinary caſe of neceſſity, and then they have their commiſſion to ſhew, from <hi>Salus populi eſt ſuprema lex.</hi>

                  <p>What ſay you then to the caſes of non-age, natural diſability, or captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, by which there is a neceſſity, that his Authority, for the time, ſhould be managed by others?</p>

                  <p>To this I could ſay, firſt, that God himſelf then declares the neceſſity, and not the people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the neceſſity, in ſuch caſes, reſpects not the people immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but the ſupreme Magiſtrate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Authority of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48658:66"/>
ſupreme Magiſtrate, in ſuch caſes, is not managed againſt him, but for him.</p>
                  <p>But I would rather ſay, that in ſuch caſes the known laws of each particular ſtate, rather then general rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and analogy, are to be reſorted to, and conſulted with. For in many caſes, the general rules of reaſon and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy may indifferently be urged on either ſide: and ſupreme Magiſtrates, as well as their ſubjects, will plead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes, and the neceſſity of their own ſafety, both for their own and for their ſubjects ſakes.</p>
                  <p>Another is, that ſubjects are not at all obliged to their ſupreme Magiſtrates, but under condition, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far forth only, as they govern aright; and that <hi>ceſſante conditione ceſſat obligatio.</hi> But this, if generally underſtood of all, as well paſſive as active obedience, I preſume is falſe: and if it be ſo meant, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects themſelves ſhall have authority, without the conſent of ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to determine the rectitude, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity of their government, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to yeild, or withdraw their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48658:66"/>
obedience, why may not the ſame be ſaid of all inferiours to their ſuperiours, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to parents, ſervants to maſters? <hi>Ego te meum dici tantiſper volo, dum quod te dignum eſt facis.</hi> And what then ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all humane authority?</p>

                  <p>And what ſhall become of all the propriety, and liberty of ſubjects, if they may not lawfully defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by force of arms reſiſt the unjuſt violence of their governours, and remove them, or conſtrain them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their courſes? Yea, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come even of the law of nature, which teacheth not onely reaſonable men, but even brute beaſts, to defend themſelves, and the things they enjoy, againſt rapine and ſpoil? Much leſs may we think, that God would have whole nations left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of means, or lawful liberty by thoſe means, to defend themſelves from the violence of particular men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing their authority, and making their own wills and pleaſures only the rules of their Government. What is this elſe, but to let looſe the reines to a licentious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded ſway of arbitrary govrenment,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48658:67"/>
and to teach ſupreme Magiſtrates, that they may do what they liſt?</p>

                  <p>I ſee you would fain draw me to declare my ſelf, and to tell you what I think of the lawfulneſs, or unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſubjects reſiſting, and by force of arms defending themſelves againſt ſupreme Magiſtrates, and thoſe that are put in Authority by them. But in vain: for I told you before, that I will not, and indeed cannot well tell what to reſolve of the queſtion in general, unleſs ſome ſuch particular caſe were propounded, as whereof all the ſeveral circumſtances might be ſeriouſly conſidered, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together. Yet for your argument, how ever the queſtion in general may ſpeed, I preſume it is ſuch, as will not ſtand under that weight you ſeek to lay upon it. For firſt, it may eaſily be retorted thus, What ſhall become of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, propriety of prerogative, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Soveraignty, of ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, if ſubjects have Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Sovereigns actions tyrannical unjuſt, and violent, and then have lawful liberty to right, or rather to revenge
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48658:67"/>
themſelves, and by force of arms depoſe their Sovereigns, or conſtrain them to govern ſo as pleaſeth them? Yea what ſhall become of the law of nature, which teacheth not onely reaſonable men, but even brute beaſts, not to break order by reſiſting, where they are to be ſubject, not to permit themſelves to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, where they ought to be obeyed? Much leſs may we think, that God would have ſupreme Magiſtrates, who bear the image of his Majeſty, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern for him, left to the diſcretion of their people, and deſtitute of means or lawful liberty by thoſe means, to compel them unto, and keep them in order, and to puniſh them for their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, when they perceive them minded to make their own wills and pleaſures onely the rules of their ſubjection. What is this elſe, but to let looſe the reins to a licencious, unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſway of arbitrary diſobedience, and to teach ſubjects, that they may do what they liſt?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the bounds and limits, both of the rule and government of ſupreme
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48658:68"/>
Magiſtrates, and of the ſubjection and obedience of the people, that are under them, are ſet and determined by laws. Firſt, by the law of God; I mean as it is revealed in his written word. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the law of nature, I mean as it is imprinted in the minds of men, and there diſcovered by the light of reaſon. Thirdly by the law of nations: I mean thoſe common rules and principles of commerce and ſociety, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agreed upon by all men. Fourthly, by the proper and peculiar laws of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular ſtate, whether fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, or additional, agreed upon, or made by the ſupreme Magiſtrate, either by the advice, or with the conſent of the people. By all theſe laws the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, both of ſupreme Magiſtrates, and of their ſubjects, the preeminence, prerogative, majeſty, ſoveraignty, and Authority of the one, the liberty, rights, and priviledges of the other, are both defined, and defended: and unto them the defence of theſe, and their propriety in theſe, doth of right belong unto whom the defence of thoſe laws doth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48658:68"/>
belong: and that is unto them that bear the ſword, as having it put into their hands by God; and thoſe that are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by them that bear it, ſupreme Magiſtrates I mean, and thoſe whoſe Authority is derived from them. Of whom if it were granted, that their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might not lawfully by force of arms reſiſt them, yet would it not follow, that therefore they might do what they liſt, and had the reins of an arbitrary government left in their hands: for they woud be no leſs bound by all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of laws before named, then if their people had lawful liberty in their own hands, to puniſh them for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe laws. Which liberty when they aſſume unto themſelves, and plead for as lawful, they ſeem at leaſt to lay aſide the condition of inferiours, and to change places with their ſuperiours- For ſubjects, as ſubjects, can no more exerciſe the ſword of juſtice, by any authority of their own, not derived from their Sovereigns, then ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as ſuch, can be accountable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, but to God himſelf, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48658:69"/>
of that authority, which as his immediate Vicegerents and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes they have from him. And this is a ſtronger tie upon ſupreme Magiſtrates, to keep them within their bounds, then any in the world beſides can be. For the force of arms, that their ſubjects can prepare agaiſt them, they may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture provide for the defeating of: but to fall into the hands of the living God is a fearful thing, againſt which there is, there can be no defence. The leſs then that ſubjects are allowed to right themſelves againſt their Sovereigns, the more God himſelf is intereſted on their behalf, to revenge their wrongs, and his own, upon them that abuſe his Authority. This made <hi>David,</hi> that he would not uſe the power which he had in his own hand, to right and revenge himſelf upon <hi>Saul,</hi> but left it to God, as belonging to him. <hi>The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge me of thee; but mine hand ſhall not be upon thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.12. Nor would he ſuffer <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> that was willing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to do it: <hi>for who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can ſtretch
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48658:69"/>
forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed, and be guiltleſs? As the Lord liveth, the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to dye, or he ſhall deſcend into battel, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Some, I know, anſwer, that <hi>David</hi> might lawfully have ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> and that his forbearing to do it was for example ſake, leſt others in imitation of him ſhould have been encouraged to kill Kings: and that it was <hi>ſingulare &amp; heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum exemplum, quod hoſti pepercit, vitandi ſcandali cauſa.</hi> But this anſwer ſeems to me to contradict, both it ſelf, and the text. To contradict it ſelf: for that which is done for example ſake, and to avoid ſcandal, is neceſſary to be done, and to do otherwiſe is unlawful: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according unto this anſwer, if for nothing elſe, yet for example ſake, and to avoid ſcandal, <hi>David</hi> might not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have ſlain <hi>Saul.</hi> To contradict the text: for <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who</hi>? that is, <hi>none can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed and be guiltleſs. David</hi> could not have lawfully done that, which at leaſt in his own opinion, no man could do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48658:70"/>
and be guiltleſs. But I pray you let us leave this queſtion: which hath been ſo often, and ſo much diſputed by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines, againſt Anabaptiſts and Papiſts, yea by the moderater Papiſts themſelves, againſt thoſe of their own profeſſion, that call themſelves Jeſuits, and are indeed the moſt notorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries of the Chriſtian world, that it is hard to ſay any thing now to the purpoſe, which hath not been already ſaid.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs I did it purpoſely: not to avoid that <hi>odium</hi> and prejudice which many men are too apt to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt all thoſe, whom they think to caſt ſcorn upon, when they call them Monarchiſts, or Royaliſts: for I have long ago learned to eſteem all unjuſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and uncharitable cenſures, worthy onely of neglect.

                  <p>If you think ſo, you are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for theſe examples ſerve ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove the neceſſity, and excellent uſe of this caution: which is general, and reſpects not thoſe directions alone, which are given by ſpecial and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate revelation from God, but likewiſe thoſe, which are guided by general rules recorded in his written word: the truth whereof is no leſs certain, being rightly applyed unto particular caſes now adayes, then if God himſelf from heaven ſhould utter them, as is evident by that compariſon, which <hi>St. Peter</hi> makes between the word of peophecie concerning Chriſt recorded in Scripture, and the voice from heaven, which they heard when they were with him in the holy mount, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. and by that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48658:73"/>
which our Saviour in the parable ſaith to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. and more plainly to the Jews, concerning the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his own words, <hi>John.</hi> 5.47. And according unto this rule, when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the ſpirit of the ruler riſe up againſt thee: leave not thy place: for yielding pacifieth great offences. Eccl.</hi> 10.4. how contrary ſoever that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection may ſeem to the wayes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom, yet it is better to obey God, by humble ſubmiſſion to, then men, how wiſe ſoever they may ſeem to be, by obſtinate opoſition of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority; according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Solomon. Eccl.</hi> 8.2, &amp;c. So the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular practice of paſſive obedience, in ſuffering wrong patiently, is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto the will of God, and a better means to advance his glory, and credit the Goſpel of Chriſt, by putting to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men, and winning them that obey not the word, then to reſiſt, and defend our ſelves by force againſt the conſent, and without the warrant of thoſe, in whom the ſupreme authority on earth reſides:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48658:73"/>
and is ſo warranted to be, by thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules, that are given to this purpoſe, by <hi>St. Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, from the eleventh verſe of the ſecond to the end of the fourth Chapter: and by <hi>St. Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1, &amp;c. and in ſundry other places: though worldly-wiſe men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with fleſh and blood, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reply, as many of our Saviours own diſciples did, upon another occaſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.60. <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> though they ſhould break out into open blaſphemy, and ſay as it is reported ſome have done, that paſſive obedience is aſſive obedience. Of whom I doubt not but I may truely ſay, as <hi>St. Peter</hi> doth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 3. <hi>They bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, and their damnation ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth not.</hi>

Thus they of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and they that were of <hi>Pauls</hi> company, though they earneſtly deſired, that he would
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48658:74"/>
not go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuppoſing that his tarrying from thence might be a means to preſerve his life and liberty, yet when they ſaw that he would not be perſwaded, as not willing to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or deprived of that opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which there he might have, to do God better ſervice, in teſtifying the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the grace of God, they <hi>ceaſed, ſaying, The will of the Lord be done. Acts</hi> 21.14. On the contrary, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour began to ſhew to his diſciples that he muſt go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there ſuffer and be killed, <hi>Peter</hi> in kindneſs would counſel him better, as he thought, ſaying, <hi>Be it far from thee, Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee:</hi> but he receives this ſharp reply, <hi>Get thee behinde me, Satan, thou art an offence unto me: for thou ſavoreſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men. Mat.</hi> 16.21, 22, 23. And afterward, when he would needs be as buſy with his ſword to defend, as before he had been with his tongue to diſſwade his maſter from danger, he meets with the like reproof again, not without a ſevere commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of revenge for his raſhneſs, <hi>Put up
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48658:75"/>
again thy ſword into his place: for all they that take the ſword ſhal periſh with the ſword, Mat</hi>: 26.52. <hi>St. John,</hi> the diſciple whom Jeſus loved, who leaned on his breaſt at ſupper, hath it, <hi>Put up thy ſword into the ſheath, John</hi> 18. As if he knew, that a ſubjects ſword out of the ſheath was not in its place, unleſs by Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it had been called forth. And our Saviour, as if he himſelf had been bound in conſcience to make reſtitution for the wrong that his ſervant had done againſt his will, heals the ſervants ear that <hi>Peter</hi> had cut off: and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a kinde of leave asking, <hi>Suffer ye thus far, Luke</hi> 22.51. And yet I preſume no Chriſtian dares deny, but that in the exerciſe of that authority, which <hi>Peter</hi> then did offer to reſiſt, there was male-adminiſtration in the higheſt degree. If ever power were abuſed, it was when Chriſt himſelf was apprehended by it, yet in Chriſts own quarrel, againſt the officers of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> Chriſt himſelf ſaith to <hi>Peter, Put up thy ſword into his place, into the ſheath.</hi> Not that our Saviour wanted power to make his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48658:75"/>
party good: for he adds in the next verſe, <hi>Thinkeſt thou, that I cannot now pray to my father, and he ſhall preſently give me twelve Legions of angels</hi>? but, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>verſe.</hi> 54. How then ſhall the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be? The preſervation of Chriſts liberty and life, was in it ſelf a good end, and a good particular ſubordinate end, ſo long as it ſerved for the advancement of the glory of God, the general ſupreme end, that is ſo long as his hour was not yet come, and ſo long he himſelf provided for it: but when the Scripture was to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which had ſaid, he ſhould be numbered amongſt the tranſgreſſours, and make his ſoul an offering for ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, &amp;c. when God was to be more glorified by his death, then he would be by his life; then neither o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor himſelf, muſt any longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe for his preſervation, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. No, not though he were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked unto it, not onely by one of the malefactors, that was hanged, and by the ſouldiers, that crucified him, but likewiſe by the rulers, and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48658:76"/>
people generally; and that with the ſtrongeſt inducements that invention racked on the rules of art could reach unto. He ſaved others, let him ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, If he be the Chriſt the ſon of God. Let Chriſt the King of Iſrael deſcend now from the croſs, that we may ſee and believe. This one, How then ſhall the Scripture be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be? is an argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them all, which Chriſt himſelf cannot anſwer any other way, but by obedient ſuffering. And that he did it, not for our ſakes onely, but for our example alſo, St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us plainly 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>

Our Saviour of himſelf ſaith, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finiſhed the work, which thou gaveſt me to do, John</hi> 17.4. and to his diſciples, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48658:77"/>
before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father, which is in heaven. Mat.</hi> 5.16. So to the end that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may ſhine as lights in the world, St. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction to the Philippians is, <hi>Do all things without murmurings and diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: that ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of God, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe nation, Phil.</hi> 2.14, 15.

                  <p>It is true, that God, who in the creation brought light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea made all things of nothing, can when he pleaſeth bring good out of evil, and raiſe honour to himſelf out of thoſe very actions, whereby he is moſt of all diſhonoured.

And if this were a ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for a man to do any thing amiſs, that God will work himſelf honour out of it, the ſame plea might ſerve to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any the moſt hainous offences, and enormous crimes, that the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can ever deviſe to tempt men to.

                  <p>The fourth is this. What ever means is effectually conducible unto the ſupreme and general end of all things, if withal it be deſtructive of, or inconſiſtent with, the particular ſubordinate end, for which you ſtand ingaged, you muſt reſolve to let it alone, and not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it, unleſs the particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate end it ſelf be ſuch, as may be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48658:79"/>
forborn, without any hinderance at all unto the general ſupreme end: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that means be ſo neceſſary, that the general ſupreme end cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without it by any other means. Thus for them that preach the Goſpel to live of the Goſpel, is effectually conducible unto the advancement of the glory of God: who hath ordained, that he <hi>that is taught in the word ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him that teacheth him in all good things, Gal.</hi> 6.6. But for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to take wages of the Corinthians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom he conceived it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to preach the Goſpel free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was, though not unlawful in it ſelf, yet ſo unfit for him, that he reſolves <hi>it were better for him to die, then that any man ſhould make his glorying void.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 15. I will onely adde one caveat more, and then I think I ſhall have ſaid all that is neceſſary for the reſolution of your ſecond queſtion, and that ſhall be this. What ever means you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, or is offered unto you, as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually conducible to any end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well, whether there be not ſome
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48658:79"/>
other effect, of another nature and of more important conſequence, likely to follow thereupon, rather then run the hazard whereof, it were better to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the uſe of the means unto that end, and wait the opportunity of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, that may not be ſubject to the like inconvenience. Thus <hi>Amaziah,</hi> intending war againſt the Edomites, thought it a good means to ſtrengthen himſelf, by hiring 100000. mighty men of valour out of Iſrael for 100000. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of ſilver: but being warned by a man of God, that the aſſiſtance of the Iſraelites was like to bring a curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole deſign, he rather choſe to looſe his 100000. talents of ſilver, and ſeparate the army of Iſrael to go home again, then run ſo great an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, as by retaining them he ſhould have done. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. Thus <hi>Achiſh,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were confident enough of <hi>Davids</hi> fidelity, and thought that he and his men might do him good ſervice in his wars againſt Iſrael, yet when he was put in minde, that <hi>David,</hi> for his own intereſt, was likely to be an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48658:80"/>
to them in the battel, ſends him away. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29. So though <hi>David</hi> had a minde to go forth with the people to battel againſt <hi>Abſolom,</hi> yet was he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded to tarry in the city, when he underſtood that it was better, and that the loſs of half the people would not have been a matter of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as the hazzard of his perſon onely. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.2, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>WOuld you have men make no difference then between the opinions and practiſes, of thoſe that are generally known to be orthodox, honeſt, and religious, and thoſe whoſe credit hath already been crackt, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to juſt exception for errors and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities, whereof they may be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently convicted?

                  <p>Yes I deny not, but there is a great difference to be made, between the opinions and practiſes of men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently vertuous or vitious indeed; yea, if they be but generally reputed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eſteemed ſuch: but that difference muſt reach no further, but unto the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion which we have of them, not to the final reſolution, whereupon we muſt ſettle, and ſet up our reſt. The conſideration of the perſons, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or practiſes they are, may give us juſt occaſion to ſuſpend the cenſures, which at firſt we may think them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, until we have further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and tried them. Or rather indeed for the honour that we owe to truth and holineſs, and the deteſtation which we ſhould have falſhood and wickedneſs in, we ought to do ſo. But when it comes to the upſhot, that we are to reſolve which ſide we will ſit down upon, or as our Saviour ſpeaks of the choice we would make between two maſters, whether we will hate the one, and love the other, or elſe hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other, then the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48658:84"/>
adherent circumſtances of the perſons muſt be wholly laid aſide, and the things themſelves muſt be conſidered, as they are, or as they ought to be: otherwiſe we may be much miſtaken. An hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yea a grain of wheat is no leſs good corn, becauſe it is covered with an heap of chaffe, and tares are tares, although they be ſhed amongſt good ſeed. Dead flies will ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour, even in the oyntment of the Apothecary: and a jewel of gold ſhould not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, although it be found in a ſwines ſnout. But it may be you look for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples rather then ſimilitudes: and the holy Ghoſt in Scripture hath furniſhed us with thoſe, as well as theſe. That mirrrour of divine, and miracle of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom <hi>Solomon,</hi> even he whoſe name was called <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> beloved of the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. yet loved many ſtrange women, who when he was old turned away his heart after other gods, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.1, &amp;c. Even <hi>Peter,</hi> that made that famous confeſſion concerning our Saviour, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the ſon of the living God,</hi> and received from him that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48658:85"/>
excellent atteſtation, <hi>Bleſſed art thou Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bar: Jona, for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven</hi>: ſhortly after preſuming to adviſe his maſter, as he ſuppoſed for his own good, receives this ſharp reproof, <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan, thou art an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unto me: for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men, Mat.</hi> 16.16, &amp;c. And though he ſeemed to be a pillar, yet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaw that he was to be blamed, made no ſcruple to withſtand him to his face, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9, 11. It were eaſie to be almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in inſtances of this kinde: and to confeſs the truth, it is a more ordinary thing to finde a little folly in him, that is in reputation for wiſdom and honor, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.1. then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in them, that are notoriouſly evil, any thing worthy of praiſe and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet we are not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of examples to that purpoſe. Even <hi>Balaam</hi> that loved the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. yet bleſſed Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael more then once, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. and 24. <hi>Ahab,</hi> that did ſell himſelf to work
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48658:85"/>
wickedneſs, and did very abominably in following idols, yet took ſo to heart the judgements threatened againſt him and his houſe by the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, that he rent his clothes, and put ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth upon his fleſh, and faſted, and lay in ſackcloth, and went ſoftly,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25, &amp;c. Yea upon <hi>Elijahs</hi> motion, he ſent unto all the children of Iſrael, and gathered the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> together unto mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and permitted them by <hi>Elijahs</hi> direction, to be apprehended and ſlain, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.20, &amp;c. <hi>Jehu</hi> took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his heart: yet he deſtroyed <hi>Baal</hi> out of Iſrael, and did well in executing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.28, &amp;c. Even <hi>Pilate,</hi> that condemned our Saviour, and <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him, and one of the thieves that was crucified with him, teſtified his innocence. Yea the Devil himſelf acknowledged Chriſt to be the holy one of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.34. and <hi>Paul</hi> and his companions to be the ſervants of the moſt high God, and the Goſpel
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48658:86"/>
which they preached, the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.17. So hard it is, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſsible to finde any wiſdom or goodneſs upon earth ſo pure and perfect, but that there may be obſerved in it ſome courſe allay of errour, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or evil; which ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with no more reſpect, then poyſon in a golden cup: and ſcarce is there any man ſo deſperatly given over to a reprobate mind, but that in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or other, at leaſt now and then, ſome beams of truth, and ſparks of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, may be diſcovered in his words and actions, which ought no more to be rejected, or deſpiſed, then pearls in a dunghil to be troden under foot. And though it be true, which you alledg, <hi>that every tree is known by his own fruit: and that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh</hi>: to which you may add that of St. <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Doth a fountain ſend forth, at the ſame place, ſweet water and bitter? Can a fig-tree bear olive berries? either a vine figs? ſo can no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both yield ſalt water and freſh.</hi> Yet withall you muſt remember what the

Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things, and deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who can know it? Jer.</hi> 17.9. and St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>If a man think himſelf to be ſomthing, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf. But let every man prove his own work, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf alone and not in another.</hi> A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man hath not one fountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in him, but two; a fountain of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a fountain of grace: and that of nature is never ſo quite dried up in this life, but that it will ſometimes be dropping, if not pouring out ſome of its own ſalt bitter water. And though unregenerate men be not trees of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that planting of the Lord, which bringeth forth ſpiritual fruits of grace, yet many times there may be gathered from them thoſe bloſſoms of truth, and buds of moral obedience, which a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſervant of God, for the matter of his opinions and proctiſes, need neither be aſhamed, nor afraid to uſe: and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought them, as metal, to the royal ſtandard of the word, and tryed them there, if the fault appear to be want of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48658:87"/>
weight or fineneſs onely, he may let them paſs for good bullion, though not for currant coin. And if every tree be known by his own fruit, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to look upon the fruit, but we muſt taſt it too, that we may know what kinde the tree is of. And when we have all done, it is not the taſting of ſome fruit alone, that can aſſure us the reſt, that comes from the ſame tree, is all of the ſame kinde, unleſs withal we can certainly tell, whether the ſtock and branches all grow naturally of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, or have been graffed on: Nay rather, by the different taſt of the fruit, we may perſwade our ſelves, that either the ſap is not the ſame, wherewith it was nouriſhed, or not alike conveyed unto it.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48658:88"/>
you muſt not follow a multitude to do evil; no, nor abſtain from doing good, though it be to avoid the ſociety of a multitude of evil doers otherwiſe. A multitude of honeſt well meaning men may be led aſide, out of the wayes of truth and holineſs, into the by-paths of errour and wickedneſs, by the ſubtil ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of a few deceivers: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf doth not alwayes work ſo powerfully in the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but that ſome good opinions and practiſes may be retained, even amongſt whole multitudes of them. Thus for the former, ten of the twelve men, that were ſent to ſearch the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> bringing up an evil report of the land, which they had ſearched, ſet all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the children of Iſrael on murmuring; ſo that <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> could not ſtil them: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the greater number; nay God himſelf took part with the two againſt the ten, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. and 14. Two hundred men out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that went in their ſimplicity, and knew not any thing, were drawn into action of rebellion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48658:88"/>
againſt <hi>David,</hi> by his traiterous ſon <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom: and the conſpiracy was ſtrong,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>for the people increaſed continually with Abſolom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11, 12. One Benjamite, a man of <hi>Belial, Sheba</hi> the ſon of <hi>Bichri,</hi> with a blaſt of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and a words ſpeaking, draws all the men of Iſrael, to go up from after <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> to follow him: even then, when they were in the heat of their quarrel with the men of Judah, for pretending more intereſt in <hi>David,</hi> then themſelves were willing to acknowledge that they had, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. and 20. When <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> withdrew, and ſeparated himſelf, fearing them that were of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the other Jews diſſembled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with him, inſomuch that <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo was carried away with their diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation: yet <hi>St. Paul</hi> withſtood him to his face, and ſticks not to ſay plainly, that he was to be blamed, and that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, &amp;c. So for the later, The Phariſees, though hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and ſuch as had made the word of God of none effect by their traditions:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48658:89"/>
yet in the point of the reſurrection were ſo orthodox, that in behalf thereof they make a party for <hi>St. Paul</hi> againſt the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducess, Acts</hi> 23.6, &amp;c. Thus <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, have accuſers face to face, and have licence to anſwer for himſelf, concerning the crime layd againſt him,</hi> Acts 25.16. and verſe. 27. <hi>It ſeemeth unto me unreaſonable to ſend a priſoner, and not withal to ſignifie the crimes laid againſt him.</hi> Though the Romans were in other things given up unto a reprobate minde, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. yet this care in the publick adminiſtration of juſtice, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, not upon ſuſpicions or ſurmiſes, but <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the leſs commendable in them, or neceſſary to be practiſed by others. For as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>When the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, theſe having not the law are a law unto themſelves. Which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts: their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48658:89"/>
mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> Therefore, as it followes verſe 27. <hi>Shall not uncircumciſion, which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee who by the letter and circumciſion doſt tranſgreſs the law?</hi> And as our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.41, 42. threateneth the Jews, that <hi>the men of Nineve, and the Queen of the ſouth, ſhall riſe up in judgement with them, and condemn them; becauſe they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and ſhe came from the uttermoſt parts of the earth, to hear the wiſdom of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> yet they neglected and regarded not him, though greater then <hi>Jonas,</hi> and greater then <hi>Solomon.</hi> So if we take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to be more ſincerely affected unto truth and holineſs, then other men are, and ſuffer our ſelves, in matter of opinion or practiſe, to be overſwaied &amp; carried away with partiality and prejudice, that we would rather ſell the truth, then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the diſpleaſure of them, whoſe perſons we have in admiration becauſe of advantage; and hazard the comfort of a good conſcience, by neglecting the diſcharge of the neceſſary duties, that we owe to others, rather then incur an

            <p>ALthough, when I penned the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent diſcourſe, in the year 1642.

Therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to endeavour the prevention, or diſcovery, of ſuch deceits, both in my ſelf and others, by a brief and plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of what I thought conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in divers particulars of important concernment relating unto matters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and practiſe, I reſolved to do it in the mildeſt, and moſt familiar manner that I could, even ſtriving to decline the ſpeaking out of thoſe concluſions, the premiſes whereof I ſtudied to fortifie as ſtrongly as I could, and bring mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be guided by their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather then their judgements to be ſwaied by their affections. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to imitate the practice of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> who ſaith of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. I <hi>pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, &amp;c. <hi>Though I be free from all men, yet have I made my ſelf ſervant to all, that I might gain the more,</hi> &amp;c. Or rather to obey thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the holy Ghoſt, by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48658:93"/>
one in the ſpirit of meekneſs</hi>: and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>The ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men; apt to teach, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves.</hi> But now (<hi>Apr.</hi> 5. 1662.) conſidering what groſs impieties have been practiſed, what devilliſh doctrines have been divulged, what horrid villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been acted amongſt us, ſince that time: eſpecially in the moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable murther of our moſt gracious Soveraigne King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, with all the circumſtantial aggravations of it, the antecedent preparations thereunto, the concomitant adjuncts, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent effects thereof: as <hi>St. Paul deſired to be preſent with the Galatians, and to change his voice, becauſe he was in doubt of them, Gal.</hi> 4.20. being <hi>afraid of them, leſt he had beſtowed upon them labour in vain, ver.</hi> 11. and threatened the Corinthians, <hi>that if he came again he would not ſpare,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. So intending to make that diſcourſe more publick by the preſs, which for almoſt twenty years ſpace hath paſſed thorow many private hands, in written copies onely, I finde my ſelf much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48658:93"/>
though not to alter any thing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in it, yet to change my voice, and to ſpeak out the exorbitancies of the three great wheels, upon which the motions of all our miſeries have turned, Popery, Presbytery, and Popularity, (rightly underſtood, as I have ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, with relation to their rebellious principles, opinions and practiſes) ſo loud, as that thoſe who are deafeſt, if withal they be not dead in thoſe treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, might be awakened to repentance, and thoſe that have yet any kindneſs for them, might be aſhamed of their own inadvertency, when they ſhould hear them apparently convinced of notorious guiltineſs, in thoſe four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which in that diſcourſe I have endeavoured to diſſwade men from, falſe pretences and principles, factious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and partiality. But conſidering withal, that much hath been done to that purpoſe already by others, eſpecially in the Myſtery of the two Juntoes, and the Hiſtory of Independency; and conceiving it very difficult at leaſt, if not almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to uſe ſharpneſs, and ſpeak bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48658:94"/>
againſt thoſe enormities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without a particular reflexion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome mens perſons, which would be a likelier means to alienate their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to rectifie their underſtandings, I ſet down my reſt upon my former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and have altered nothing, either in reſpect of the notions or expreſſions, from that which I had written at firſt. Nor will I now add any thing more, but only a ſerious admonition, and earneſt exhortation, unto all them that have read, or ſhall read that diſcourſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how much it concerns them to take heed, that preſumptuous ſins have not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them, and that they may be innocent from the great tranſgreſsion of Self-contradiction: which firſt or laſt will be ſure to bring with it ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: to beware of giving credit unto falſe pretences, of building their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon falſe principles, of giving enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment unto any unjuſt, uncharitable prejudice againſt, or too indulgent parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality towards others. Eſpecially to take heed, that they do not pull down more by their practiſe then they build up by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48658:94"/>
their profeſſion, nor by their actions bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter up and underprop the very ſame things, which by their opinions they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to demoliſh and pull down. For mine own part I think, that of the three great wheels, upon which, as I ſaid before, the motions of all our miſeries have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is not eaſily to be reſolved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popery have been more beholding to Preſbytery, or Popularity; Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Popularity, or Popery; Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Popery, or Preſbytery: or which of the three is the greateſt enemy to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Chriſtian Principality and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy. But, oh, what a ſtrange kinde of Self-contradiction would it be, if thoſe that profeſ they love and honour them both, and do it indeed, ſo really and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, that they would not ſpare their eſtates to do them good, nor fear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture both limbs and lives in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſhould yet in the courſe of their converſations fight againſt them, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately diſobeying their holy, juſt, and good Commandments, and not theirs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone but Gods alſo? Out of queſtion, an Orthodox Libertine, a Schiſmatical Saint,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48658:95"/>
an holy heretick, a covetous conformiſt, a proud Prelatiſt, a riotous Royaliſt, are all of them equally contradictions <hi>in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto,</hi> and each of them as odious in the ſight of God &amp; of all good men, as any of the reſt: what ever ſucceſs they may have for a time, at laſt they will finde that prediction of our Saviour true, <hi>Every plant that my heavenly Father hath not plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhall be rooted out. Mat.</hi> 15.13. And that cenſure of St. <hi>Paul</hi> will one day fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon them all, <hi>Therefore thou art inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: for wherein thou judgeſt another thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt thyſelf: for thou that judgeſt, doſt the ſame things, Rom.</hi> 2.1. When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had grievouſly ſinned, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.8. God in the indignation of his anger deſpiſed the King and the Prieſt, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.6. Nor is it only violent reſiſting the power of Governours, but obſtinate diſobeying their authority alſo, that tends to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving their people of them; and may be, if not the means whereby, yet the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe for which God may be provoked ſo to puniſh them, subjects ſometimes may ſay of their Soveraign,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48658:95"/>
as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, though not in the ſame ſence, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.5, 6. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſsions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every man to his own way, and the Lord hath layd on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> Great need we have all therefore to take heed, that none of us preſume to keep a courſe in any ſin, for fear leſt by that we ſhould, though but unwittingly againſt our wills, take part with our profeſſed enemies, Rebels and Traitors, to deprive both our ſelves and others of that happineſs, which we might all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in the proſperity and peaceable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of thoſe higher powers which would be the miniſters of God to us for good, if we did well; to whom we muſt be ſubject, not for wrath, but for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake; and for whom we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>firſt of all to make ſupplications, prayers, interceſsions, and giving of thanks; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty</hi>: which then onely we can hope to do, when (as the ſame Apoſtle beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48658:96"/>
the Epheſians, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1, &amp;c.) <hi>we walk worthy of the vocation, wherewith we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love: and endeavouring to keep the unity of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the bond of peace. When we are no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lye in wait to deceive; but ſpeaking the truth in love, grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt</hi>: to whom be honour and power everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Amen.</hi>
