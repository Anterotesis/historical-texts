         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And suppose also that they who for reproaching the Prelates (for making the innovations for which his Gr: in this speech pretendeth some reasons and warrants) an intention to introduce popery, were to bee esteemed libellers by the foresaid law and ordinance, and that it were inconsistent with Episcopall dignity to forbeare to take notice of such libellers, and to forgive them; yet all they could in reason have craved for punishment of them, was, that such punishment should be inflicted on them as the law maketh Papists (and such as usher in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery) obnoxious unto;

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> libello imponeretur;</q> And seeing in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland there is no law that punisheth Papists criminally or maketh their Religion (much lesse the ushering of it in) a crime, so as albeit it were true, that the Prelates did not only usher in, but were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves content to professe Popery with as much passion as they have commanded the observation of Popish Ceremonies, and manner of Church-government, they could not for that by any English law be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> punished with either Pillory or prison, it followeth consequently that the defendants for charging the said Prelates with the ushering in of Popery (though falsely) could not (lawfully) for that be punished ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Pillory or prison.</p>
            <p>But suppose finally that there were either reason, or some law in England, (without making Popery a crime, or the ushering in of it any fault) to make the speaking or writing of Prelates, apparent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to introduce it, to be libelling and subject to such punishment as the Statutes ordaine for libelling against K. or Qu.
