            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head type="sub">Godwin verſus Sir EDWARD HALES, Baronet.</head>
            <p>THE Plaintiff brought an Action of Debt againſt
the Defendant for 500 Pound, and declares the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
was admitted ſuch a day to be Lieutenant of
a Foot Company; which Office the Plaintiff avers to
be an Office of Truſt, within the 25 <hi>Caro.</hi> II. and
that the Defendant held the ſame Office for above 3 Months, and
he did neither in the next Term, nor 3 Months after the grant
of the ſaid Office, take the ſeveral Oaths, nor Subſcribe the
Declaration, according to the ſaid Statute, and yet he did continue
in the ſaid Office; and that the Defendant, at the Aſſiſes held at
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was Indicted for neglecting to take the ſaid Oaths,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95471:3"/>
and there was <hi>Legitimo Modo Convictus,</hi> as by record of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
may more fully appear; and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> entitles himſelf
to the Sum of Five hundred pound forfeiture, given by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
to any that will Sue for the ſame.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Defendant</hi> Pleads, that the King after his admiſſion
into the ſaid Office, and before three Months were ended, did by
his Letters Patents Diſpence with, Pardon, and Diſcharge the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant</hi>
from taking the Oaths, and Subſcribing the Declaration,
according to the Statute, and off and from all Crimes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
incurred, or to be incurred, by the virtue of the ſaid
Statute, and that the King did grant to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that he
ſhould hold the ſaid Office, as though the Statute had never been
made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this Plea in Bar the</hi> Plaintiff <hi>Demurred, and the</hi> Defendant<hi>joined in the Demur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtions are two, 1. Whether the <hi>Defendant</hi> ought to
have pleaded this Pardon and Diſpenſation to the Indictment, or
whether he may not plead it in Bar to the Action?</p>
            <p>2. Admitting he may plead it to the Action, whether it be a
good Bar, and whether the King by his Prerogative may diſpenſe
with the Statute?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Northey,</hi> who argued for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Point.</note> held that the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>
may not be permitted to plead this Matter in Bar of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe he ought to have pleaded it to the Indictment, and
he having not pleaded it then, the Law will conſtrue it to be
waving of it, as the Caſe in <hi>Brooks Abridgment,</hi> Charter of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
15<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That in Caſe of an Indictment for Murther, one that
has pleaded not Guilty, cannot plead the pardon after, unleſs da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſince this Plea of not Guilty. So 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Crooke,</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. in a <hi>Fire
Facias,</hi> if the <hi>Defendant</hi> appears, and has a Releaſe, and does not
plead it, he has loſt the benefit of it, and ſhall not be releaſed, by
<hi>Audita Quieta;</hi> now the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhall not be permitted to plead
it againſt the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> no more than he could have pleaded it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King; for this Action is in the nature of an Execution
upon a Judgment, and may be likened to this Caſe; an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator
<hi>de foins non,</hi> by 17<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Car. Secundi</hi> 2. is enabled to ſue forth
Execution upon a Judgment, recovered by an Executor of the firſt
Teſtator, and the Statute doth put the Adminiſtrator in the ſame
Caſe as the Executor was; and the <hi>Defendant</hi> in that Caſe can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no other matter againſt the Adminiſtrator, than he could
have done againſt the Executor, neither can he avoid this Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by any Plea that he might have pleaded to the Firſt Action:
And if this <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhall be received to plead this Plea now, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95471:3"/>
will falſifie the Indictment, that was found againſt him; for if the
offence be pardoned, he ought not to have been Indicted: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this Defendant may well plead this Plea, yet I hold it no
Bar to the Plaintiff's Action.</p>
            <p>I do allow that the King may Diſpenſe with ſeveral Penal Laws
in ſome Caſes,<note place="margin">2. Point.</note> but that Prerogative of the King is bounded, ſo
that with ſome Statutes he cannot Diſpenſe, as wherein the
Subject is intereſſed, as in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Inſtit.</hi> (135) So the King cannot
Licenſe a Man to make a Nuiſance or Commit a Murther, as
11<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Henry 7th.</hi> 11. 12. And that this is an Act wherein all the
Subjects have an Intereſt, I humbly ſubmit to the Judgment of
the Court.</p>
            <p>The King cannot Diſpenſe with the Statute 31 of <hi>Eliz. Cha.</hi> 6.
againſt Simony, nor with the Statute 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 1. againſt Buying
and Selling of Offices, as appears by the 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Inſtit.</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>a.</hi> 30.
<hi>Inſtit. 154. 20. Crooke 385. Hobart</hi> 75. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Inſtitu. 234. a.</hi> A Man
that is Diſabled by Law to take ſuch an Office, the King cannot
Capacitate him; as if the King ſhould grant to one to ſell an Office,
within the Statute <hi>Ed.</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. and to another to buy that Office, theſe
Grants would be void, as in <hi>Vaughan</hi> 534, in the Caſe of <hi>Thomas</hi>
and <hi>Sorrel,</hi> there are ſeveral Caſes put, wherein the King cannot
Diſpenſe with a Statute.</p>
            <p>Now by this Statute that we are upon, it is Enacted, that every
Officer ſhall take the Oaths, that every Perſon that does neglect
it, ſhall be diſabled to hold the ſaid Office, now this Act does
not work upon the Taking, but upon the Holding, and if
ſuch Conditions be not performed, he is thereby rendred uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to hold his Office, and the King can never Enable a Man
whom the Law hath Diſabled, 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Inſt.</hi> 154. But I foreſee the Caſe
in 12 <hi>Cook</hi> 18. will be objected againſt me, where it is ſaid, that
no Act of Parliament can bind the King from any Prerogative
which is ſolely and inſeparably annexed to his Perſon, but
that he may Diſpenſe with it by a <hi>Non Obſtante,</hi> and the Book
doth inſtance in the Caſe of Sheriffs upon the Statute 23 <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
6. which does Enact, that all Patents made or to be made
of any Office of a Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for term of years <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within
any County of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> and ſhall forfeit 200 Pound, yet
ſaies that Book, the King may Diſpence with that Statute, and
Cites 2 <hi>Henry</hi> 7. 66. to be there ſo adjudged by all the Judges
of <hi>England,</hi> and that this is the only Authority that ſeems to
countenance this Caſe, but this is the Opinion only of my
Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> for the Book which he Cites and depends upon, was
never adjudged, as appears by <hi>Brook 5. pt.</hi> 45. 109. and what was
ſaid in that Caſe, was only ſaid by one Judge, and never judicially
determined, nor ſo much as ſpoken to by any other Judge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95471:4"/>
the foundation that my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> has laid failing, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure
muſt needs fall, and ſo with Submiſſion, that ſingle
Opinion in 12 <hi>Cook, folio</hi> 18. is not Law; but admitting the Caſe
to be Law, that can be no rule to guide this Caſe by, for that
Statute was made, rather to deprive the King of his Power of
makeing Sheriffs, and ſo conſequently commanding his Sheriffs
not to ſerve him, than to Diſable the Subject, and thereby reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the King's Prerogative, which is ſo inherent in him; but by
the Statute 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. 2. the Prerogative of the King is not touched,
for the King may grant the Office to any of his Subjects, and it is
only a direction to the Subject to qualifie himſelf for the King's
Service, and if he be uncapable to ſerve the King, 'tis through his
own fault and neglect, and may be puniſhable for the ſame, as in
Caſe of Sir <hi>John Reade</hi> in 27 and 28. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. in the Exchequer, he
was made and Sworn Sheriff of <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> and neglected to
take the Oaths according to this Statute, by reaſon of which the
Office became void, and afterwards there was an Information
Exhibited againſt him upon this Statute we are now upon, for
neglecting to take the ſaid Oaths, and executing his Office, and
upon this Convicted and Fined, and the Court was of Opinion that
no Subject could put himſelf out of a Capacity to ſerve the King,
but for ſo doing he is puniſhable, and in the Law of the Sheriffs the
Diſpenſation is in the Patents, but in our Caſe the Diſpenſation
is after the Patent, and ſo a difference between the two Caſes: And
for theſe Reaſons, I pray your Lordſhips Judgment for the
Plaintiff.</p>

               <head type="sub">Sir Tho. Powis the King's Sollicitor, Argued for
the Defendant.</head>
               <p>And as to the firſt Point,<note place="margin">1. Point.</note> that ſuppoſing the Defendant ought
to have pleaded the Diſpenſation to the Indictment, it does not
appear by this Record, but that he did; for the Declaration is that
he was <hi>Legitime Modo Convictus,</hi> and does not ſay whether he
Pleaded not Guilty, or how he Pleaded, and for any thing that
appears, he did plead it againſt the King, yet he may be admitted
to plead it againſt the Plaintiff who is a Stranger.</p>
               <p>If they ſtand upon this as an Eſtople,<note place="margin">2ly.</note> they ought to have relyed
upon it, and replied, that he had the Diſpenſation at the time of the
Indictment, and refuſed to plead it, for he that pleads an Eſtople muſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95471:4"/>
upon it, as the Authorities are which treat of Eſtoples, and
therefore as to the firſt point I think, with a ſubmiſſion, we have
very well pleaded the Pardon and Diſpenſation in Bar of the
Action.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond point,<note place="margin">2. Point.</note> whether the King can Diſpenſe with
the Statute or no? I humbly conceive, with Submiſſion, the King
may very well diſpenſe with the Statute; 'tis admitted that the
King may in many Caſes diſpenſe with an Act of Parliament, and
let us conſider why not this? It's well obſerved in 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Inſti. 496.
that the Kings Prerogative is as much the Law of <hi>England</hi> as any
other Law whatſoever; and the King may upon any Cauſe moving
him in reſpect of time, place, or perſon, by a <hi>Non Obſtante</hi> diſpenſe
with any particular Perſon, and that he ſhall not incurr the penalty of
the Statute. 7. <hi>Cooke</hi> 36, 37. <hi>Vaughan</hi> 347. 333. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> 472. 473.
there <hi>Glanvell</hi> in his Argument doth admit a power in the King to
Diſpenſe with <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and yet he was no friend to the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.
Though the Conſent of the Lords and Commons be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the making of the Act of Parliament, yet it is the King
that gives the Sanctions to the ſaid Laws, and moſt of the Antient
Statutes began in form of Charters, as it appears in 8. <hi>Cooke</hi> 19.
and the Intents and meanings of Acts of Parliament are every day
by the Judges extended and changed, according to a better Rule
of Reaſon and Juſtice than the words will bear, <hi>Hobart</hi> 229. and
the Judges have an authority over the Statute-Laws, to mold them
according to the trueſt and beſt Senſe. <hi>Hobart</hi> 346. and Statutes
which have been made againſt common Right, have been conſtrued
void. 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Cooke</hi> 118.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a Diſtinction taken in our Books between</hi> Malum in ſe, <hi>and</hi>
Malum prohibitum.</p>
               <p>The former the King cannot Diſpenſe with, the latter he may;
as where the Statute generally prohibits any thing upon a penalty,
which was Lawful before, (the Subject receiving no injury by ſuch
a Diſpenſation) the King there may Diſpenſe with ſuch an Act.

<hi>Cooke 32. Vaughan</hi> 352, 353. 354. Now to apply the Caſes to
the Caſe in queſtion, this is <hi>Malum Prohibiter,</hi> whether is the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
any Damage to the Subject, if it were any wrong, it
were to the King himſelf, and ſure the King may very well Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with that which only relates to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95471:5"/>
I muſt diſtinguiſh between thoſe Acts of Parliament which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Property, and thoſe which concern Government; Acts of
Parliament which concern Property, the King cannot Diſpenſe
with; but thoſe which concern Government he may; and this
for the great Inconveniencies which may happen, or Urgencies of
State which may force him to it, and thoſe un-foreſeen at the time
of making the Law; for it may happen by a viciſſitude of times
thoſe Laws that were made for the preſervation of Government,
ſhould turn to the deſtruction of it, if the King could not Diſpenſe
with them.</p>
               <p>The Common Law in ſome Caſes does very much reſpect the
Prerogative, That it leaves the private Intereſt of the Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded,
and the King may Dig in any of his Subjects Land for
Saltpeter to make Gunpowder; now this Statute 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. was
made to diminiſh the Kings Prerogative, but to ſecure him from
his Enemies, and for the preſervation of the Government; and the
King is beſt Judge what will be moſt for his own ſecurity, and the
Governments preſervation. No Act of Parliament can diſcharge
the Subject from his Allegiance which he owes to the King, every
one is bound by his Allegiance to ſerve his Prince when he ſhall
be required. Therefore no Act of Parliament can diſable any man
to ſerve the King. But they object, that this Act doth make no
one incapable, but at his own Election.</p>
               <p>If this were ſo, it would be in the Election of ſome or all the
Subjects to incapacitate themſelves to ſerve the King, and the King
would be unſerved, for if it were not in the power of the King to
force the Subject, he would not (it may be not) be ſerved at all;
as in the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Read,</hi> Cited by the other ſide; he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to take the Oaths, and thereby the Office became void; ſo
that the next Elected might refuſe, and the next; in the mean
time the King's Service lies neglected, and no buſineſs of the County
can proceed for want of a Sheriff. To pardon Murther, is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
ſolely and inſeparably incident to the King, and may Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with Statutes reſtraining it, 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, <hi>Cook</hi> 18. He may Diſpenſe
with <hi>non reſidente, Hobart</hi> 146. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Inſtitute. 339. In 3. Inſti.
the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſpeaking of Acts of Parliament that were made to
reſtrain the King's power of pardoning Murther, ſays, that ſuch
Acts are good for Kings to follow, but not binding. <hi>Cook</hi> 18, 19.
There are ſeveral Statutes cited, with which the King by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
may Diſpenſe, as the Statute 36. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. which does
Enact, that no Man ſhall be Sheriff of one County two years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Yet it was adjudged by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> ſays
that Book, that the King may diſpenſe with it; the Statute of 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>.
of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 31. that no <hi>Welſhman</hi> ſhall be Juſtice, or other Officer
whatſoever in any part of <hi>Wales;</hi> and yet the King may Diſpenſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95471:5"/>
with it; the Statute 8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Rich.</hi> 22. and 33. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. 24. do Enact,
that none ſhall be Juſtice of the Aſſize in the County where he
was born, and yet the King with a Special <hi>non Obſtante</hi> may Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with that Statute; and in <hi>Plowden,</hi> 502. 13. the King may
grant to a Man to be an Eſcheater for Life notwithſtanding that
Statute.</p>
               <p>To anſwer the Statutes which have been Cited, which the King
cannot Diſpenſe with I ſay as to the Statutes of Simony and
Uſury, the King cannot Diſpenſe with them, but what is that to
this matter in hand? for there is no reſtriction of the Subjects ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but the King may have the benefit notwithſtanding. Then as
to the Statute 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 16. againſt Buying and Selling of Judicial
Offices, of which Statute there is a Clauſe in the <hi>1ſt.</hi> Inſtitu. 134.
That the King may not Diſpenſe with that Statute. There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between that Statute and this, for that does Enact, that if
any perſon ſhall bargain and ſell any Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall loſe the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all ſuch Bargains and Contracts ſhall be void, and
that he that ſhall give any Sum of Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for any ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be a diſabled perſon in Law, to Have, Occupy, or
Enjoy the ſaid Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Statute doth diſable the party upon doing ſuch an Act, to
take the Office, for the making the bargain is prior to taking the
Office, and thereby he is diſabled to take it, ſo that he can never have
the Office legally veſted on him, if the King cannot Diſpenſe with
a Conditional Subſequent, and ſo that does not come near this. And
for this Reaſon I humbly pray Judgment for the Defendant.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Then the Lord Chief Juſtice ſpake to this Effect.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ch. Juſtice.</hi> This is a Caſe of great Conſequence, but of as little
Difficulty as ever any Caſe was, that raiſed ſo great an Expectation,
for if the King cannot Diſpenſe with this Statute, he cannot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with any <hi>Penal Law</hi> whatſoever.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt point,<note place="margin">1. Point.</note> whether he ſhall be admitted to plead this
Diſpenſation, and Pardon to this Action of Debt (having not
pleaded it to the Indictment) and I think he may, for this Court
ſhall not be bound by the finding of the Jury below, for he (for
any thing that does appear) did plead it there, and the Jury might
have gone againſt the direction of the Court, yet that ſhall not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
us; but if the party has good Matter to diſcharge himſelf,
we may ſhew it; as if a man be Convicted of an Aſſault and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
againſt the Defendant, the Plaintiff may give the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
in Evidence, but yet he muſt alſo prove the Battery, or
elſe he ſhall not recover.</p>
               <p>And this being an Eſtople, it ſhall not bind, becauſe the Plaintiff
was not Party to the firſt Suit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95471:6"/>
As to the ſecond Point,<note place="margin">2. Point.</note> whether the King can Diſpenſe with
the Act or no, I think it a queſtion of little difficulty; there is no
Law whatſoever but may be Diſpenſed with by the Supream
Law-Giver; as the Laws of God may be Diſpenſed with by God
himſelf; as it appears by God's Command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to offer up
his Son <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſo likewiſe the Law of Man may be diſpenſed by
the Legiſlator, for a Law may either be too wide or too narrow,
and there may be many Caſes which may be out of the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
which did endure the Law to be made, for it is impoſſible
for the wiſeſt Law-Maker to foreſee all the Caſes that may be
or are to be Remedied, and thefore there muſt be a Power ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
able to Diſpenſe with theſe Laws. But as to the Caſe of
Simony that is objected by the other ſide, that is againſt the Law
of God, and a ſpecial Offence, and therefore <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> which I
do agree the King cannot Diſpenſe with the Act. And as to the
Caſes of Uſury and Non-Reſidence, thoſe Caſes do come in
under that Rule, that the King cannot Diſpenſe with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Subject has a benefit by them; for in caſe of Uſury the
Bond is made void by the Statute, and therefore if the King ſhould
Diſpenſe with it, the Subject would loſe the Benefit of the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Bond. And as to the Caſes of buying and ſelling of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which are objected, there is no need of reſolving, whether
the King could Diſpenſe with that Statute or no, becauſe the Party
was diſabled to take any ſuch Office by the Contract, and the Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
was attacqued by force before the Office was veſted, ſo that
the King could not remove the Diſability: and ſo I do agree it
would have been in this Caſe, if the Defendant had by his
neglect or refuſal to take the Oaths, rendred himſelf incapable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had taken the King's Diſpenſation, for the King's Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
coming before the Diſability attacked, it does prevent it.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of the Sheriff is much a ſtranger Caſe than this, and
comes up to it in every particular, for that Statute doth diſable the
Party to Take, and the King to Grant, and there is alſo a clauſe in
that Statute which ſaies, that the Patent ſhall be void, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
any <hi>Non Obſtante</hi> to the contrary, and there is a penalty
of 200 pound like to our caſe, and yet by the Opinion of all the
Judges of <hi>England,</hi> the King has a power of Diſpenſing with that
Statute, yet that Statute does expreſly ſay, the King ſhall not
Diſpenſe with it by a <hi>Non Obſtante;</hi> ſo if an Act of Parliament
had a clauſe in it that it ſhould never be repealed, yet without
queſtion, the ſame power that made it, may repeal it. Beſides
that Statute makes the Patents void at the time of granting them,
but by this Statute, the Patents are good at the time of granting
them, and continue ſo till the neglect to take the Oaths, for
doing of which the Patentee has three Months time; and if the caſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95471:6"/>
of the Sheriff be Law, as it hath been taken ever ſince <hi>Hen. 7th</hi>'s
time, and is cited for good Law in many of our Books; and never
till now queſtioned, for the common courſe and experience have
been according to it, then I defie all the World to ſhew me any
material difference between that and this, only that this is the
ſtranger caſe of the two in many particulars. But becauſe the caſe
has been denyed by the Plaintiff's Counſel, it does concern us to
take the Opinion of our Brethren, it being a matter of ſo great
conſequence in the Circuits; for if it be not Law, then there are
ſome Sheriffs that be not lawful, and ſo have not power to return
the Juries, and then we have no power to try and give Judgment
upon any Offenders; and it alſo concerns us who goe into our
Countries to take Advice of it, for if that caſe is not Law, our
Patents which are <hi>Non Obſtante's</hi> to 23 <hi>Henry</hi> 8. 24. may not be
good, and ſo we have no Authorities to go the Circuits, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will ask the Opinion of all the Judges as well in that caſe as
this.</p>
               <p>On Monday the 21 of <hi>June,</hi> after having conſulted with all
the Judges, his Lordſhip delivered their Opinions in open Court,
to this effect:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Arguments of this Caſe it did appear to us to be very plain,
but yet for the better Satisfaction of all People, both this Caſe, and
that of the Sheriffs, were put by me to all the reſt of the Judges, and
after ſome conference, ten of us did agree, that the Caſe of the Sheriff
was good Law: But they all declared there was no difference between
that and this; my Brother <hi>Powel</hi> at firſt doubted, but after concurred
with us in Opinion: But my Brother <hi>Streete</hi> yet continues his Opinion,
that the King cannot Diſpenſe with that Statute, but there being the
Opinion of eleven Judges againſt one ſingle Judge, We may very
well declare the King may lawfully Diſpenſe with that Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And we go upon theſe grounds,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are Sovereign Princes.</p>
               <p>II. That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are the King's Laws.</p>
               <p>III. That it is an inſeparable Prerogative in the King, to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with Penal Laws upon neceſſity and urgent occaſions.</p>
               <p>IV. That the King is Sole Judge in that neceſſity.</p>
               <p>V. That this is not in truſt given to the King, but 'tis the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Remains of the Crown, which never was nor can be taken
away from him.</p>
