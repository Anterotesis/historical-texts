         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat we the poor diſtreſſed Souldiery under the Parliaments Service in Ireland, having heretofore ſerved the Parliament under
the Lord Generall Eſſex, valiant Maſſey, and noble Sir William Waller, and the reſt, &amp;c. did in all faithfulneſſe, hardſhip and
deſperate ſervice as ever any, hazzard our lives and fortunes, and did according to order obey and disband then not ſo
much as doubting of all our Arreares, and now have almoſt ſerved you two years in all integrity and faithfulneſſe both Winter
and Summer, wet and dry, froſt and ſnow, having no other bedding then the bare ground for our beds, and the skies for our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
and when dry in the day and night, no other ſigne to drink at but the Sun and Moone, and nothing but water, having
no plenty, but cold backs, hungry bellies, and puddle water, and when ſore wounded, not a Surgeon to dreſſe us, or if a Surgeon,
no cheſt, nor ſalve, nor oyntments; and for bread many times not a loafe of two pence under ſix pence, and rotten cheeſe ſent not
fit for a dog, and for butter it went from London to Dover, and miſtook Dublin and went to Dunkirk, and for our new cloathes
all made of the French faſhion, and being too little for any of us, were carried for France to cloath them, hardly hats to our
heads but what our haire growes through, and neither hoſe or ſhooes, doublet or breeches, tearing our Snapſacks to patch a hole
to hide our naked and ſtarved fleſh, and our ſwords naked for want of ſcabberds: Thus with our backs without cloaths, and our
bellies without food, and not a penny to buy any thing, and the Kernes having burnt the corne and deſtroyed all fit for ſuccour,
we forced to march bare legged and bare footed, having neither fire nor food, we periſh in miſery, and our Commanders being
in a manner in the ſame caſe, having nothing but good words to pay us with, ſhewing us often your Orders upon Orders for our
pay, plentifully promiſing but not performing; and thus wee dropping downe dead daily in our marching, and ſo feeble and ſo
weak, being not able to fight or do any more ſervice without ſome ſupply, but all like to ſtarve and die in miſery, when all meanes
is anticipated, and the Tax of 60000. l. wholly ingroſſed by your Army from us, and your Souldiery quartered in Kings houſes,
and clad Gentile like, and fed in Free-quarter to the full, and lie in good beds, and take their pleaſure and eaſe in reſt and peace.</p>
            <p>We humbly deſire our hungry bellies may once be filled, and our naked backs be cloathed, and our legs and feet be hoſed and
ſhooed, and our Surgeons once more fitted, and all recruited with food to ſupply us once more, that we may go out again to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
that worke we have begun, and not to lie like Drones to eat up others meat, and we do not doubt, but with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
to give you a happy account of the Conqueſt of the whole Land, and ſhall ever pray for a happy Parliament.</p>
