            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Theſe things conſidered, and often rolled in my thoughts, I caſt about what was the fitteſt courſe to be taken for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's further Removes, and reduce him back to our Souls, and Aſſemblies; and I find that 1. God purpoſely removes to make us follow him,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hoſ. 5.15.</hi>
               </note> as a wiſe Nurſe doth by a weak Child. 2. He ſtops and halts, as in ſuſpenſe what to do, that he may both alarum us,

               </note> and afford us leiſure to conſider what courſe to take. 3. He makes a gracious promiſe, that if we do follow on to know the Lord,
<note place="margin">

               </note> his going forth ſhall be prepared as the morning. And 4. He complaineth that there is none that calleth on his Name,

               </note> that ſtirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take hold on God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to keep him from departing, or to fetch him back. Conſidering the Premiſes, I was deſirous in my poor meaſure, to promote God's work in the Souls of his People, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all that have any Intereſt in God, to improve it at this day for the preventing of his total Removal, and detaining of God with us; not as the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> beſieged it; and one of their Diviners told them, that it was
<pb facs="tcp:59151:8"/>revealed to him in a Dream, that <hi>Apollo</hi> their god was ſhortly to depart from them, thereupon they take the Image of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and bind it with a Chain of Gold to a Poſt, thinking thereby to detain him. No, no, we cannot force God againſt his will to tarry, but we are in obedience to God's command, and diſcharge of our duty, and in performance of the Condition of his Promiſe, to lament after the Lord with Prayers, Tears, Confeſſions, Reformations, pleading with God through the Interceſſion of his Son, for his Return, and Reſidence with us. While wicked <hi>Gadarens</hi> are by words and works bidding bleſſed Jeſus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of our Coaſts, it becomes us ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly to invite him, open the doors of our hearts to him, and give him free wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com, ſaying, <hi>Lord abide with us:</hi>

            <p>THe whole ſeries of the Hiſtory of the Times in which this Scripture was writ, take in ſhort thus: After the Judges in the preceding Book (ſo called) God raiſed up <hi>Eli,</hi> who was both a Judg and Prieſt, who though he was a good man himſelf, yet his Sons were prophane,
<note place="margin">c. 2.12-17.</note> and oppreſſed the People, by requiring both boyled-fleſh and raw for roaſting, abuſing the women that came to the door of the Tabernacle ſo that their ſin was very great, and of bad conſequence, for men abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the offering of the Lord. <hi>Eli</hi> being informed of his Sons profligate courſes,

               </note> too much indulged them, or too mildly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes them; Why do you ſuch things? too ſoft words for ſuch hard and hainous acts:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59151:11"/>there wanted deeds, he being a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ought to have puniſhed or remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them,
<note place="margin">c. 2.27.</note> if not put them to death: well, God ſends a man of God to <hi>Eli,</hi> [Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Elias,</hi> or an Angel, or <hi>Phinehas</hi> or <hi>Elkanah,</hi> I diſpute not] to rebuke and threaten him and his houſe, but he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming God inſpires and commiſſions young <hi>Samuel</hi> to give him a Sound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
<note place="margin">c. 3.18.</note> and warn him, as immediately from the Lord: the good old man falls under the Admonition though by a Child, but now the diſeaſe was grown paſt his curing, his counſel did no good, and he could not correct them,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> no doubt he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his fault, and ſince it will be no better he puts the matter over into Gods hands, let him do what ſeemeth him good: God can by his grace curb and cure them, or by his power he can cruſh and confound them, let him uſe his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I give my children into his hands, let my Lord get to himſelf a name of Glory by them or upon them, I freely ſubmit: a ſpeech becoming a man of God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Prieſt:well, God himſelf undertakes to deal with them; in the 4th Chapter the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Philiſtins</hi> joyn battel,

<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.9. v. 10.</note> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> animate one another, imagining, if they now prevailed, they conquered the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 10.</note> looking on the Ark to be <hi>Iſraels</hi> Idol, or at leaſt, that Gods power was tyed to it, after the conceit of Idolaters;
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.10, 11, 12.</note> they fight, prevail, kill, thirty thouſand <hi>Hebrews,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hophni</hi> &amp; <hi>Phinehas,</hi> take the Ark priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the tidings whereof broke <hi>Elies</hi> heart, then his neck,
<note place="margin">v. 18, 19.</note> brought pangs on <hi>Phinehas</hi> wife, and though ſhe was a mother, yet full of grief, which ſhe bequeathed to the world in the name of her ſurviving child, <hi>Ichabod:</hi> Well, the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> now lead <hi>Iſraels</hi> God in triumph, as they judg, they bring it to <hi>Dagon</hi> they God in <hi>Aſhdod,</hi> in reproach of the true God;
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.1, 2.</note> but the triumphing of the wicked is ſhort,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59151:12"/>though <hi>Iſrael</hi> be a loſer, yet <hi>Dagon</hi> and his Worſhippers are no gainers by the Ark of Gods preſence:
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Dagon</hi> falls on his face, proſtrated in homage thereto, beaten on his own dunghil; being crected again, his head &amp; hands were knockt off by another fall. So that now he had neither wit nor ſtrength to help himſelf the fair <hi>Venus,</hi> or womaniſh part was gone, the fiſhy part only is left; but this was but a ſport in compariſon of what befell <hi>Dagons</hi> Worſhippers,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.6.</note> for Gods hand was heavy on them all; <hi>Aſhdod</hi> or <hi>Azotus,</hi> as the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Boy carryed the Fox in his boſom till he ſtopt his vitals, ſo theſe, the Ark that was ſalutiferous to its obſervers, was mortife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to its contemners; even as the Lords Supper is profitable to due partakers, but unworthy receivers find it to turn to their judgment here,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> and damnation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Carnal hearts pretend a fond reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ordinances, but find the Lord a jealous God upon their perverting his inſtitutions or unſuitable carriage: <hi>Aſhdod</hi> was ſoon weary of Gods Ark, they hold a councel of their Lords: they poſt it away to <hi>Gath,</hi> which was their <hi>Metropolis,</hi> thinking belike, that to be a better air, or under a more benign influence of the ſtars:
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5.9.</note> But here alſo Gods hand was upon them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59151:12"/>with a very great deſtruction, they had painful and incurable Emerods in their ſecret parts; being weary of the Ark, they would ſhift it off to <hi>Ekron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 10.</note> but the <hi>Ekro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> were wiſe by others harms, and a conſultation was had to carry back the Ark into its place,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6.2.</note> for all the five citys of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> were ſharply puniſhed, thoſe ſeven months it was in their country. And they were weary of it; only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the Diviners how to ſend it back, they adviſed to ſend it with a treſpaſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,

<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6.12.</note> the Kine went ſtraight to <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> a city of the Levites, they rejoyced to ſee it coming, but though they offered a burnt-offering to the Lord, yet looking into the Ark, the Lord ſmote fifty thouſand threeſcore &amp; ten men with death; and they lamented it, &amp; cryed out,
<note place="margin">v. 19.20.</note> 
               <hi>Who is able to ſtand before this holy Lord God?</hi> But alas, they lament not their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg &amp; injury to the Ark, but the death of their People, imitating the <hi>Philiſtine (qui propter culpas non dolebant, ſed propter paenas
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59151:13"/>ululabant)</hi> they houled for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not kindly mourning for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: they reflect not on their own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, but transfer the cauſe to Gods holineſs: And now they alſo would be glad to be rid of ſo chargeable a Gueſt, and ſend meſſengers to <hi>Kiriath-jearim,</hi> to fetch it to them: who came and fetcht it.</p>

Nor what this Sanctifying <hi>Eleazar,</hi> or ordaining him to the Sacred Miniſtry: what this keeping the Ark is, that nothing be taken away, or no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comly thing be done to it or about it: nor why <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Son, and not <hi>Abina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> the father was imployed about it: whether <hi>Abinadab</hi> was old and decrepid, or dead, or buſie about houſehold affairs, or <hi>Eleazar</hi> was more holy, is not much material to inquire.

            <p>Take ſome general obſervations from the context thus explained:</p>
            <p n="1">1. God gives his People ſenſible tokens of his ſpecial preſence, viſible Ark, audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voice betoken ſpiritual inviſible grace; ſo the Ark, and, preaching.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God thinks good ſometimes to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcond and hide theſe tokens of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from a profeſſing people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This with drawing may be continued a long time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.3. ſo in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon Zoch.</hi> 1.13. in latter days, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God takes particular notice of the duration of his Churches affliction, in <hi>Egypt</hi> 400. years, ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Peoples Priviledges may be long removed before they be kindly ſenſible of their loſs, long before they recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When Gods Ordinances are but privately diſpenſed, it's a great loſs to the body of a People, ſuch as need them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59151:16"/>moſt have then leaſt of them:</p>
            <p n="7">7. Continuance in ſin prolongs delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and abſence of the Ark or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is an occaſion of continuing in ſin. Men do withdraw their hearts from God, that's ſinful; God withdraws helps from them, that's poenal; men repent not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily without helps; God denies helps, and is juſt therein.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Attendance on Ordinances raiſeth the envy of wicked men; this hath been the quarrel from the daies of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> ſucceſſively to this day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.5,

            <p n="9">9. One ſtirring active Inſtrument for God, may by God's bleſſing promote Repentance and Reformation amongſt a people. Oh what hurt may one ſinner do! So what good may one uſeful man do when God ſtirs up their hearts. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſets things a working, ſo <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Hag.</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p n="10">10.

            <p>Theſe I paſs briefly, and paſs on to the main Point from the laſt clauſe of the verſe [<hi>And all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the Lord.</hi>]</p>
            <p>They did not lament ſo much under their preſſing burdens, grievous oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> but after the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the Ark of the Lord, and the Lord of the Ark; for the recovery of God's gracious preſence, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tokens thereof; [<hi>lachrymis deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ſummam miſeriam Religionis &amp; Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae</hi>] they bitterly lamented the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Church and State, Religion and Polity. This, ſay Interpreters, is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable place, by reaſon of the general Converſion and Repentance of the whole People; we have ſcarce the like in all the Scripture, except <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>From the words then reſults this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when God's Ark is long obſcured, or Ordinances obſtructed, it becomes God's</hi> Iſrael, <hi>or profeſſing People, to lament after the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Serious lamenting after God is well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming thoſe whom God afflicts in the loſs of Priviledges.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59151:17"/>
            <p>The Text preſents to us, 1. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lamenting, God's peculiar People, theſe only love, and mind God's preſence, when the Lords and Cities of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> are weary of him and ſend him away, yea and the <hi>Bethſhemites,</hi> though a city of the Levites belonging to the Church of God, through their ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of matters ſend to get a releaſe, yet Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> will look after their God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here's the object they lament after; not peace, plenty, victory over enemies, but after the Lord, <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the object of their affections, 'tis him they love, and long for communion with, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, my ſoul thirſteth for thee to ſee thy power and thy glory ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Here's the Univerſality of theſe; all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> come; they that had wofully degenerated, and were gone after their Idols; what a wonderful act of Gods power and ſoveraignty was this upon their ſpirits? by this he manifeſts that he is the true God, and that <hi>Samuel</hi> was his Servant; the like ſee in <hi>Elijahs</hi> prayer, preaching, Sacrifice and ſucceſs of all 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.21, 37, 39.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Here's the manner and nature of the Peoples repentance, they lamented after the Lord, which is a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive word, and I ſhall open it anon.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this point I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this method.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shew how ordinances are obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, obſcured.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What's implyed in lamenting after the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How and why Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus lament.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Anſwer an objection.</p>
            <p>So make application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is it for ordinances to be either</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſtructed, or 2. obſcured, both which may be a great affliction to Gods People and oft occaſion a lamentation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Ordinances to be obſtructed is a prevention of the liberty of diſpenſation of them, and ſuppreſſion of its diſpenſers, by impriſonment, baniſhment, inhibition, or ſuſpenſion, as in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s daies, <hi>Jezabel</hi> cut off the prophets of the Lord, the reſt werehid by fifty in a Cave, and fed with bread and water, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.4. yea ſuch ſcarcity was there at that day, that <hi>Elijah</hi> thought he was left alone, 1, <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.10. Such as were left were latent, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59151:18"/>had indeed their lives, not liberties, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Word, or to celebrate God's Ordinances openly. It's true, Truth ſeeks not corners; yet publiſhers of Truth may be driven into corners. God's Candles may be put under a Buſhel; the Church's pleaſant things may be taken away; Sabbaths and ſolemn Aſſemblies may be forgotten in <hi>Zion,</hi> and the waies of <hi>Zion</hi> mourn, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.4, 7. The Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9. <hi>We ſee not our ſigns,
<note place="margin">Rev. 12.14. Rev. 11.7.</note> there is no more any Prophet</hi>—The Church may flee into a wilderneſs of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and perſecution, her witneſſes may be ſlain by a natural or civil death, ſome time or other theſe prophecies have an accompliſhment; <hi>Jeremah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> may both have their mouths ſtopped by their brethren, and God himſelf may be a little Sanctuary to ſuch as want the open Sanctuary-priviledges, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.15, 16. Goſpel-courſe may be ſtopped, obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> is putting believers on to pray for him that the word of the Lord may have free courſe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1. intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that it had met with a ſtop; by what? by mens rage, or the Devils ſubtilty, or both 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. forbidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles, and <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Satan</hi> hindred us. Some times the Devil ſtirs up men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59151:19"/>the courſe of the Goſpel. The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the Church in all ages will offer their Service to bear witneſs to this truth, that liberty of Ordinances is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times infringed, and ſo the Ark is retired into private; for where God hath a people they muſt and will worſhip God, and attend his Inſtitutions, if they cannot do it openly, they act more privately, as Chriſts Diſciples frequently met in houſes, in the night, the doors being ſhut, and that for fear of the Jews. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.19. And it may be that word in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.16. refers to ſuch a day, <hi>Bind up the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſeal the Law among my Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Ark &amp; Ordinances may ſomtimes be obſcured, as well as obſtructed; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the Purity, as the former, to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of God's Appointments. The light may be dimned, as well as diminiſhed. Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Glaſs obſcures the Light: So Humane Inventions corrupt God's pure Worſhip. <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Golden Calves hindered the purity of Ordinances; ſo that Religious People, and Prieſts, fled to God's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.13, 16. This defilement of Ordinances makes God's poor Children cry out, <hi>Death is in the Pot.</hi> Our Saviour ſaith of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Thus have you made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59151:19"/>the Commandments of God of none effect, by your Traditions, and therefore in vain did they worſhip God,</hi> Mat. 15.6, 9. God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions are ours, but men may mar and ſpoil them with their fond Additions, or Alterations, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.20. As <hi>for the beauty of his Ornament, he ſet it in Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, but they made the Images of their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and of their deteſtable things therein,</hi> (though they call and account them delectable things) <hi>therefore have I ſet it far from them.</hi> Men may be guilty of <hi>(crimen laeſae Majeſtatis)</hi> treaſonable practices, by adulterating the King's Coin, or ſetting their own ſtamp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by Clipping it. There's a ſad woe, both in the beginning, middle,
<note place="margin">Deut. 4.2. Prov. 30.6. Rev. 22.18, 19.</note> and end of the Bible, againſt thoſe that add to, or diminiſh from God's Word or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. It's a dangerous thing to think to mend what God hath thought good to enjoyn. Antichriſt hath ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted God's Worſhip (as well as Truths) that they that love their Souls or Safety, are called upon to come out of her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. God is a jealous God, and will not hold ſuch guiltleſs (<hi>i. e.</hi> will deal with them as guilty malefactors) as take his Name in vain. Nay, God bids men rather go ſerve their Idols, than pollute
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59151:20"/>his holy Name, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.39. Yea ſome Shepherds alſo are ſaid to tread down with their feet the reſidue of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and ſoul the Waters with their feet; ſo that God's Flock is in danger of pining, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.18. God's Children know how to avoid a ſinful Separation on one hand, and a Communion that neceſſitates them to ſin, on the other hand; there's danger of both extreams. Poor ſcrupulous tender Conſciences are too apt to run into the former, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous Spirits are too apt to run into the latter for by and baſe ends. Sometimes the latter falls out as well as the former, that godly Miniſters and Chriſtians muſt either ſin, or ſuffer; and to a conſcientious Soul, the caſe is ſoon determined; and hence it comes to paſs that their Perſons and Ordinances with them have been forced into retirements. The Witneſſes will rather chuſe to propheſie in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth with purity,
<note place="margin">Rev. 11.3.</note> according to God's Will, than live in the greateſt pomp and ſplendour in betraying the Truths and Appointments of God, by Superſtition or Idolatry, to gratifie the fleſh, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the humours of men: They judge it ſafer to be baniſhed from the Altar, than bring ſtrange fire to it; they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59151:20"/>think it ſafer to venture on mens diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, (though the Furnace be heated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times hotter) than caſt themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dreadful vengeance of the great God, by ſinning againſt him, and provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eyes of his glory. They reſolve to ſtick to the Ark, though in <hi>Abina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>'s houſe,
<note place="margin">Rev. 14.4. Rev. 12.4.</note> and follow the Lamb whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goeth, rather than be dragg'd down to ſin and Hell with the Dragon's Tail: Though Perſecution at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the former, as in the <hi>Marian</hi> daies, and Preferment wait on the latter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. General Head to be explained in the Text and Doctrine, is, what is this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting after the Lord? The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> comes from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>quieſcere,</hi> the ſame word with <hi>Noach,</hi> which ſignifies reſt; <hi>They reſted after the Lord,</hi> it's in <hi>Niph.</hi> which encreaſeth its ſignification, and notes theſe ſeven things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They inclined after the Lord; they had wandred away from the Lord, and never thought after him; they had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide after vain things, but now they begun to hearken after <hi>Samuel</hi>'s preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and begun to look about them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they were doing, had a months mind (as we ſay) after God, and his ways and worſhip, and a heart to inquire after
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59151:21"/>the Lord, is a good ſtep; as it's ſaid of the men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> their hearts inclined after <hi>Abimelech,</hi> or to follow him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.3. It's well ſo, for when people ſtand ſtill, poſe themſelves, what have we been doing? have we done well or ill? what courſe is beſt to be taken? and begin to have ſome inclinations after God more than formerly, this is the firſt ſtep.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were ſetled, eſtabliſhed after the Lord; they ſtaggered formerly, were but in ſuſpence, wavering, like the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>'s double-minded man,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.18.</note> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way to take, like thoſe in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. Why halt ye between two Opinions? one while leaning to <hi>Baal,</hi> another while to God, reeling like drunkards, halting like lame men, whoſe Leggs are not equal, fluctuating to and fro with divers thoughts: But now this people is firm, well reſolved, with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart determined to cleave to the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. The trembling Needle fixeth towards its center; the Tree is rooted; the Will is bowed; the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſetled; the Conſcience reſolved; nothing ſhall obſtruct their courſe; they have ſet down the Staff, and ſay as <hi>Ruth</hi> to her Mother-in-law, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59151:21"/>from following after thee, for whither thou goeſt I will go,</hi> &amp;c. So theſe, though they had been haeſitating and doubtful what to do, yet [<hi>jam in Dei obſequio gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum figunt ſtabilem &amp; certum</hi>] they get a ſure footing in their motion God-wards.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They were congregated and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled after the Lord; ſo ſome read it; they now begin to flock like Doves to their windows, they troop after him, [<hi>collecti ſunt poſt Dominum</hi>] Jer. 3.17.— <hi>All Nations ſhall be gathered to it, to the Name of the Lord God; yea</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall go with</hi> Iſrael, <hi>v.</hi> 18. See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.45. They had been broken, now they are united. Some went after ſome mens commands and examples, ſome after others; but now the great God makes an Act of Uniformity and Unanimity, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. <hi>In that day there ſhall be one Lord, and his Name one:</hi> One So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Commander, one Way, one Worſhip. That great God doth not only injoyn one thing, but doth joyn them in one bond and mind. Oh happy day! when the Grace of God heals the breaches that are in mens ſpirits, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the Church!</p>
            <p n="4">4. They groaned, complained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned themſelves in their following the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59151:22"/>Lord, as a Child followeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Father, and as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> followed his Wife <hi>Michal,</hi> weeping behind her to <hi>Bahurim,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.15, 16. or as <hi>Micah</hi> followed the <hi>Danites</hi> that took away his Idols, crying after them; they ſaid, <hi>What aileth thee?</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Ye have taken away my Gods—and what have I more? and what is this that ye ſay unto me, What aileth thee? Judg.</hi> 18.23, 24. <hi>q. d.</hi> You could not have done me a worſe turn; lay your hands on your hearts, ask your ſelves whether any loſs can parallel this, of loſing ones God! You need not be inquiſitive for a reaſon of my ſollicitude and complaint, when all good is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this chiefeſt good, whether real or imaginary. Thus, this people la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, laid to heart this great evil of God's departure, the which no temporal good can compenſate or countervail.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They called, cryed, and ſhouted after the Lord, by earneſt prayer and ſupplication; ſo the word imports ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſighing; <hi>Let the ſighing of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner come before thee,</hi> Pſal. 79.11. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it's rendred [<hi>inclamarunt</hi>] for lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the voice, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.18. not only their hearts cryed unto the Lord, but tears run down like a River day and night:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59151:22"/>Yea, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Ariſe, cry out in the night pour out thine heart like water; lift up thy hands towards him:</hi> Yea, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.8. She did both cry and ſhout, not that God is deaf, or buſie, or purſuing enemies, or ſleepy, and muſt be awaked,
<note place="margin">1 King. 18.27.</note> as <hi>Elijah</hi> ironically twits <hi>Baal</hi>'s Worſhippers with their God, but for our own ſakes, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the honeſty and zeal of our hearts, and as a gracious diſpoſition to which mercy is promiſed. Hence it was that when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cryed, and their cry came up unto God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.2, 3. Crying is the Accent of Prayer. A crying Prayer ſounds loud in God's Ear. The tender Mothers bowels make her look back on her crying Child. God loves to be called back by a fervent affectionate Prayer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They betook themſelves to the Lord, [<hi>Receperunt ſe ad Dominum</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> by faith, by repentance, covenanting with God, returning from ſin, having recourſe to God by a ſincere Reformation, and without this all the former were inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant; but thus did the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to <hi>Samuels</hi> command, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in this <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 3. If ye do return with all your heart to the Lord, then put away the ſtrange Gods, and prepare
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59151:23"/>your hearts unto the Lord, and ſerve him only, and they did ſo, <hi>v.</hi> 4. This was their beſt way of lamenting after the Lord: No coming after God with a lye in our right hand, or our Idols in our hearts; if we do, God will ſpurn us back into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, for nothing keeps perſons at a diſtance from him, but ſin; they that hold faſt ſin &amp; pretend to follow God do either run from him, or follow him with a Sword in their hand to wound him, but ſuch as caſt away their abominations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord aright and ſhall overtake him; this is the method preſcribed by God himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>If thou wilt return O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>faith the Lord, return unto me, and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of thy ſight, then ſhalt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, &amp; thou ſhalt ſwear the Lord liveth.</hi> Then, and never till then are Souls fit to joyn in covenant with God when they are divorced from all beſides.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They were acquieſcing in, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfyed with the Lord; this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of this word, [<hi>Chald. quieti fuerunt poſt cultum Domini</hi>] their hearts were abundantly quieted in the manner of Gods worſhip, and much more in the object of their worſhip, and in the union of their hearts to God, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59151:23"/>communion with him; no Satisfaction like this. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Return unto thy reſt Oh my Soul, Pſal.</hi> 116.7. No ſuch reſt, as God is, who is the Souls only Center and Sabbath, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.25. I <hi>have ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the weary Soul, and I have reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed every ſorrowful Soul:</hi> As God reſts in his Love to his Saints, ſo they are well ſatisfied with their choyce of God, and look not out other ways, or beyond him for any contentments to their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Thus then theſe good Souls, theſe lamenting penitents, might ſay, Alas we have been like wandring ſheep that have gone aſtray, every one wandring in his own way, or as a bird wandring from its neſt, or as Prodigals from our Fathers houſe, but now, now at length by <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Prophecy we are throughly informed that God is the true God, that this his preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Worſhip is of his Inſtitution, and the mean of communion with him. At our firſt hearing this man of God we were touched, and began to incline towards him, at laſt came to fixed reſolution to follow the Lord in this his way, we were aſſembled together to this purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned our ſtate in the loſs of ſo dear a friend, cryed after him, Put away our Idols and luſts, returned to the Lord by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59151:24"/>faith and repentance, and now we ſee it's not in vain, it's good, yea very good for us thus to draw near to God, we find, full content in him, we find the injoyment of him a full recompence for all this pains in a mournful purſuit of him: We have found him, at laſt we have found him, &amp; happineſs in him, he is come whom we ſought, we need not look for another, we care not for any other. We fear nothing ſince we we have found our God.</p>
            <p>From hence we may diſcern,

               </note> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the ſame word in <hi>Heb.</hi> ſignifies both to repent and to comfort, to mourn and to ceaſe mourning, to lament and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, for as true comfort belongs only to penitent Souls, ſo ſorrow is the porch and inlet to joy; none are exalted but they that are firſt caſt down, none bring forth the bleſſed babe of joy but ſuch as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in the pangs of ſorrows, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.21.

            <p>This is the ſecond general head, what is implied in this Lamenting after the Lord.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59151:24"/>
            <p n="3">3. Another head in the preſcribed method is the Reaſons why it's ſo fit that Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> or profeſſing People ſhould thus lament after the Lord, when Gods Ark is obſcured or his Ordinances ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. In confirmation of this Point, I muſt demonſtrate,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they muſt lament after the Ark of the Lord. 2. After the Lord of the Ark, Briefly for both theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> or profeſſing People muſt lament after the Ark <hi>i. e.</hi> the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord, when obſcured, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Ark or Ordinances of the Lord are a Peoples greateſt glory, their beauty, ſtrength &amp; honour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is <hi>Iſrael</hi> better than other Nations, then by having Ordinances of God among them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſhewed his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation—q.d.</hi> This, this is that that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts <hi>Iſrael</hi> above all other Kingdoms, that they have the viſible tokens of Gods preſence, which is a peoples only glory; ſo faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>To the Iſraelites pertain the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, the Service of God, and the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59151:25"/>Promiſes.</hi> This is <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Heritage, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and a rich one it is: hence when the Ark was taken, <hi>Phinehas</hi>'s Wife breathed her laſt, with that heaviſom Ditty, <hi>The Glory is departed from Iſrael, for the Ark of God is taken,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the obſcuring and obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ordinances is an heavy Judgment, worſe than all other Plagues, both abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conſidered in it ſelf, and compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, if it be compared with other Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. God threatens to do by <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as he did by <hi>Shilo, Jer.</hi> 7.14. How that was this context ſhews. And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.21. <hi>I will prophane my Sanctuary, the excellency of your ſtrength.</hi> Many other threats ſpeak God's hot diſpleaſure in this caſe, and the evil is greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it reacheth to the Soul, which is the beſt part of man. Hence <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>Behold the daies come, ſaith the Lord, that I will ſend for a Famin in the Land,</hi> (which ſurely is a dreadful Judgment, worſe than the Sword, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.9. But what a Famin?) <hi>Not a Famin of Bread, or a Thirſt for Water, but of hearing the Words of the Lord:</hi> This, this is the foreſt Judgment; this Judgment on the Soul is the Soul of Judgments, when poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are in danger inevitably to die and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59151:25"/>be damned in Hell without means or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. <hi>Where no Viſion is the people periſh, Prov.</hi> 29.18. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe there's much advantage in the injoyment of Ordinances: Herein conſiſts the Kingdom of Heaven; ſo is the Preaching of the Goſpel frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and this Word is the Word of the Kingdom, and Goſpel of the Kingdom, becauſe it is an introduction or means to enter Perſons into the Kingdom of Grace, and ſo of Glory; and that's a dreadful Threatning, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. <hi>Therefore ſhall the Kingdom of God be taken from you, and be given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> If any ask me, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>What advantage hath the Jew?</hi> (ſo the profeſſing Chriſtian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel-diſpenſation) <hi>or what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is there of Circumciſion, or of Spiritual Priviledges?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>much every way, chiefly becauſe that unto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God,
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.22.</note> and ſo Salvation is of the Jews;</hi> as our Lord faith; even ſo thoſe that have Goſpel-Ordinances, have great helps for the converſion, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſalvation of their Souls;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 11.10.</note> for Chriſt hath ſet up his Enſign among them for Souls to flock unto. Theſe are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59151:26"/>Wells of Salvation,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 12.3. &amp; 25.6. &amp; 66.11. Mat. 16.9. Iſa. 60.1. Act. 14.27.2 Cor. 3.8.2 Cor. 6.2.</note> a Feaſt of fat things, breaſts of conſolation, where Souls may milk out, and be abundantly delighted, here are the Keys of the Kingdom, by which Heaven-gates ſtand open continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; the door of Faith, the miniſtration of the Spirit, the day of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is not all this worth lamenting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord to enjoy? then what is?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe this is the character and property of a Child of God to lament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ark and Ordinances of God. <hi>I have,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, loved the habitation of thy houſe, Pſal.</hi> 26.8. Therefore makes this his [<hi>unum magnum</hi>] one Thing which he deſires of the Lord, <hi>to dwell in the houſe of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 27.4. Two things put on a Chriſtian Spirit to lament after God for the Ark; 1. His Principles; 2. His Experiences. 1. He hath a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Principle, an enlightened Eye to ſee what others cannot diſcern; the Chriſtian calls ſuch places and waies, <hi>Beer-la-hai-roi,</hi> as <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The Well of him that liveth and ſeeth me.</hi> So the Chriſtian ſees God's way in the Sanctuary;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.14. Pſal. 27.4. Pſal. 60, 24.</note> there he beholds the beauty of the Lord. <hi>They have ſeen thy goings, O God, even the goings of my God, my King, in the Sanctuary.</hi> Yea the devout Soul
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59151:26"/>hath a ſtomach and taſt ſuitable to what he meets with in the Ordinances of God, Faith, Love, Deſire, Joy; as new-born Children have a natural inſtinct to their Mothers Milk for conſervation of life, ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. The Saints as new-born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby. The Law of God ingraven in his heart, bears proportion to the Word he hears opened by Miniſters, Chriſt within him (by his Spirit and Graces) as the hope of Glory, prompts him to a love and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, in the holy Supper, and all other his Inſtitutions. 2. Add to this the frequent Experiences the believing Soul hath had of the ſweetneſs of Divine Grace in Ordinances, which cannot but ſet him a longing for the like Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2. <hi>My Soul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty Land, where no water is, to ſee thy power and thy glory ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> So <hi>Song</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſt; yea, he brought me into his banquetting houſe, and his banner over me was Love.</hi> No wonder if ſhe was ſo ſick when ſhe wanted him.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59151:27"/>
            <p>This leads me to the next Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Chriſtians muſt lament after the God of Ordinances, or God in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>The Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>lamented after the Lord.</hi> Why?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God is infinitely more worth than all Ordinances; his preſence is prizable for it ſelf. The Ark is but to be eſteemed for his gracious preſence; <hi>In his favour is life, Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>His loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs is better than life, Pſal.</hi> 63.3. This is the marrow of Heaven, the want of this is Hell. <hi>Woe alſo be to them when I depart from them, Hoſ.</hi> 9.12. And this the Child of God knows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God purpoſely withdraws that men may lament after him; as a Mother ſteps out of the Child's ſight, that it may ſee ſhe's gone, and cry after her, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face; in their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe due lamenting after the Lord may fetch him back; he purpoſely hovers, waits and expects, that his people ſhould call him back by their prayers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, moanings; not as though God were moved, or changed by mens piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful complaints and out-crys, but that ſuch an earneſt lamenting qualifies the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59151:27"/>ſubject, capacitates for mercy, and puts Souls into the condition of the promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12, 13. <hi>Then ſhall ye call upon me, and ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. God bleſſeth his People uſually in and by Ordinances, with his beſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.3. There the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the bleſſing, <hi>Even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> Eph. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>in heavenly (places,</hi> things, means) <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> It would be needleſs to reckon up all the bleſſings that our dear Lord conveys to his People by Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that it becomes us to lament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord for, in his Appointments; (for now I joyn them together.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes God gives outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings with his Ark. So the Lord had bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Houſe of <hi>Obed-edom,</hi> and all that pertained to him becauſe of the Ark of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.12. The Goſpel of Peace oft brings outward Peace and Plenty, though through the corruption of mens hearts it ſtirs up oppoſition occaſionally.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the chief bleſſings are ſpiritual,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59151:28"/>as, Converſion of the Soul to God, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, effectual Vocation; ſo that it may oft be ſaid, as of <hi>Zion,</hi> This and that man was born there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.5. So alſo increaſe of grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>We all with open face, beholding as in a Glaſs</hi> (this broader Glaſs of Ordinances, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Glaſs of private Duties) <hi>the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory (i. e.</hi> from grace to grace) as by the Spirit of the Lord, or of the Lord the Spirit [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:] Beſides, Ordinances diſcover, and help to cure thoſe foul ſpots that are in the face of the Soul, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.23, 24. Sanctuary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcoveries reſolve many intricate caſes in the providences of God. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>v.</hi> 17. Here alſo the hearts of God's People may be abundantly ſatisfied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. for here's goodneſs from God to do it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. Ordinances are [<hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les gratiae</hi>] Channels through which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace and Influences flow to Souls, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.12. Theſe diſplay Chriſt; open Goſpel-priviledges, Promiſes, Terms of Salvation, are as the gate of Heaven; well then may, and muſt the obſervant belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, lament after both the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, and God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59151:28"/>
            <p n="4">4. Head is an Objection, which may be framed againſt all I have ſaid. You'l ſay, What's all this Canting for? How doth it concern us? Have we not publick Ordinances? Doth not the Goſpel flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? Is there not excellent Preaching in Publick Places? The generality have no reaſon to complain, ſince we have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates, a glorious Church, Learned Preachers; nay, others that pretend Tenderneſs of Conſcience; theſe do complain before they are hurt; Have they not their Separate Meetings in a Publick way without diſturbance? Little reaſon have any to make this ado in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting: What cauſe have you to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>I anſwer as <hi>Cleophas, Art thou only, a ſtranger in</hi> Jeruſalem [in <hi>England</hi>] <hi>and haſt not known the things which are come to paſs there in theſe days?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 24.18, 19.</note> If you ask what things?

            <p n="1">1. Are all congregations, ſupplyed with able faithful Miniſters? God forbid I ſhould condemn all, or cenſure any; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God there are ſome gracious men in publick ſtation, whoſe main deſign is to win Souls to God: but Oh how ſmall is their Number; I would rather you read an account of this in <hi>Ichabod;</hi> or five groans of the Church writ by a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Miniſter <hi>A.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59151:29"/>3000 raw young heads, that teach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have learned, 1500 debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters, many factious men, ſome illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate trades-men, Simoniſts, Pluraliſts and Non-Reſidents particularly deſcribed; God knows whether theſe things be true; but it's well if many have not cauſe to complain as our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.36. Who when he ſaw the multitudes, he was moved with compaſſion on them becauſe they fainted and were ſcattered abroad as ſheep having no Shepherd; you know what follows: If all publick places were well ſupplyed there would be leſs need of us: If there were no need, we ſhould be glad of a <hi>Superſedeas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet is there not work enough for all the Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> if all were faithful, conſcientious, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeriouſlly to the work of God; Oh how many thouſand ignorant Souls to be inſtructed! Obſtinate,
<note place="margin">See Ezek. 34.4.</note> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, careleſs to be quickened, weak to be ſtrengthned, wandring to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; ſurely they that know any thing of the worth of Souls, of the work of the Miniſtry, and of the importance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot but bitterly lament that ſo little is done for ſaving of ſinners, and that there are ſo few to lay out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59151:30"/>or that do actually or effectually, the work of faithful Paſtors, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and edification of ſinners Souls: If every Miniſter in <hi>England</hi> were gracious, and had an hundred perſons under his cure and charge, he would find it as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to manage as a Phyſician, dealing with ſo many patients under ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes <hi>:hic labor, hoc opus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Is not the liberty that ſome take in their diſpenſing Ordinances under many diſadvantages? Are they not ſubject to fines, confiſcations, impriſonments, baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cenſures, and all have not equal op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of feeding Chriſts flock, where there is as much neceſſity: What liberty is taken, it's but ſtoln, and upon cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie; ſtill they are expoſed to the rage of malevolent ſpirits, and under the laſh of the Law, and cenſures of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Zealots, that adventure further than their more prudent Brethren; yet ſtill the Candle is under a buſhel, and they that need it the moſt, have leaſt ſhare in it, and are glad they are out of the ſound of it, and are furniſhed with ſtones enow, even from preſent conſtitutions, to caſt at ſuch as would diſturb them in their career of ſin, and poſting to Hell; and they whoſe Eyes are opened to ſee the

            <p n="4">4. Are there not ſad ſymptoms upon us of a departing Goſpel? It would not now be ſeaſonable to enumerate the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks of God's taking away his Ark and Ordinances.

            <p n="2">2. Where are the Souls that ſtir up themſelves to take hold of a withdrawing God?
<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.7.</note> Some I hope there are that ſtand in the gap, but oh how few, and how faintly! Where is there a <hi>Moſes,</hi> to hold up his hands, a <hi>Joſhua</hi> to fall at God's feet, a <hi>Phinehas</hi> to execute Juſtice? God ſees that there is no man,

            <p>But may not the Innocent deliver the Iſland? May not the poor wiſe man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the City? Are not Saints Prayers effectual? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes. But where are they? The old Stock is worn out, and few new ones come in for a ſupply.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59151:32"/>Strong Torrents are carried by the dead Sea into the Ocean of Eternity; and new Springs are yet rare and faint. Where ſhall we find <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Spirit doubled on ſucceeding <hi>Eliſha?</hi> Though a Kingdom may have much Treaſure in it, yet if Trade ceaſe, no Bullion or Merchandiſe be imported, it will decay, becauſe it ſpends upon the old Stock. This is our caſe, old Saints are worn away, few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts fit to plead with God, come in their room. And this is the Devils deſign, to wear out the Saints of the moſt High, and extirpate the genuine Seed of <hi>Jacob.</hi> But alas! <hi>By whom ſhall</hi> Jacob <hi>ariſe? for he is ſmall.</hi> His face waxeth pale, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of late loſt ſo much good blood.

Doth not this bode evil? Is there not in them, even in them, ſins enow to weaken and evacuate their own Prayers? Alas! What Diviſions, what Decaies, Deadneſs, Unproſitableneſs! The Old Puritan-Spirit is gone; we are wofully degenerated: Profeſſors are grown like the world: How unlike are

Abraham <hi>is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of us,</hi> Iſrael <hi>would not acknowledge us for their genuine Seed.</hi> But may we not think our diſeaſe is grown ſo ſtubborn and inveterate, that no Doſes will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Diſeaſe, though [<hi>ultimi conatus</hi>] theſe hard ſtruglings of Nature may maintain Life for a ſeaſon? Judgments have been prorogued upon the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers interpoſing importunity, three years longer, but beware the forth. God's Patience hath bounds; his Spirit will not alwaies ſtrive. We look like a people ripe for ruine. However <hi>Noah,

            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59151:33"/>
            <p n="2">2. Is not the God of Ordinances much removed from amongſt us? And is not he worth lamenting after? God makes gradual removes.
<note place="margin">Amos 8.9.</note> It's true, ſometimes the Sun ſets at noon-day; yet ordinarily the Sun leaves the Horizon by ſenſible declinings.
<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.3.</note> The glory of the Lord goes up from the Cherub, to the Threſhold of the houſe,
<note place="margin">c. 11.23.</note> thence to the middle of the City, thence to the Mountain.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly mention four Removes which our Lord hath taken from us: By way of Query.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is not reſtraining grace much gone from amongſt us? Some perſons in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times were wont to be civil, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and in many things conformable to the letter of the Word; but now God hath caſt the Reins in their necks, and they get the Bit of Conſcience betwixt the teeth of ſenſual affections, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinning, and there's no hoe with them; they run mad in their own waies; petty Oaths of Maſs or Troth, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence to Dam me, and full mouth'd blaſphemies; tippling to down-drive Drunkenneſs, and open reeling; wanton dalliances to defended Adulteries; ſquib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Strictneſs, to open perſecution of all that looks like ſeriouſneſs; from queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59151:33"/>Divine Providence, men advance to avowed Atheiſm, and open defiance of Heaven. Some men are given up to ſuch ſins as are not fit to be named, and which themſelves formerly would have bluſht at the mention of; and if any had predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their committing them, would have ſaid as <hi>Hazael, Is thy Servant a Dog?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 8.13.</note> Sinners that uſed to walk under a Vail or Mask, now go bare-fac'd, and men glory in their ſhame.
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> Many abhor So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Juſtice, Temperance. We over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the deeds of the wicked; the Moral Heathens would be aſhamed of us. Men work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs: Yea, if they court God in a few formal Prayers, they think they are delivered to do all theſe abominations; as though they had got a Popiſh Indulgence and Diſpenſation to ſin. As <hi>Breerwood</hi> in his Enquiries tells us, The common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think they do the Prieſt a kindneſs to find him work by new ſinning to get pardons. Yea,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.4.</note> ſome think ſtrange at others, that they are not as bad as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:

               </note> And is not this matter of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, to ſee the Earth thus for ſaken by a righteous God, and poſſeſſed by ſo many Bears, Lions, Tygers and Goats? that men are grown Wolves, yea Devils
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59151:34"/>to each other! Is it not time to lament after that God that gives up men to ſuch profligate and prodigious courſes as haſten their own damnation, and <hi>England</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation? Is it not time to ſeek God till he come and Rain Righteouſneſs upon us? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is not converting grace much withdrawn from the Ordinances of God? And doth not this call ſenſible Souls to lament after the Lord?
<note place="margin">Rev. 6.2.</note> Time hath been that our Lord hath mounted his white Horſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.5.</note> and hath bent his Bow, and ſhot his Arrows of Conviction, and made them ſharp in the hearts of the King's Enemies,
<note place="margin">Song 3.11.</note> and cauſed people to fall under him, going forth conquering; hath had his Crown ſet upon his head by the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But alas! now the Church hath a miſcarrying Womb,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.1. 49.4.</note> and dry Breaſts. Miniſters cry out, <hi>Who hath believed our Report?</hi> I have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain. God doth not go forth with his Word as formerly. The Apoſtles were Fiſhers, incloſed many at a draught; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters Hunters, ſhout and run all day, and catch but one or two, and well too. It's worth a whole lifes pains. Though it cannot be denied, God's deſpiſed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have now and then ſeals of their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59151:34"/>Miniſtry to God's glory, their incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and the ſtopping of the mouths of ſlanderers. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is built even in troubleſom times: The Goſpel is not bound, though Miniſters be. Men civilly dead, may convey ſpiritual life. God hath not left his Servants without ſome Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Conſciences and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Hearers, that God is in his Ordinances of a truth. But alas! how few gleanings hath our dear Lord, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the full Vintage Satan gets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men? We take theſe firſt fruits thankfully till the full Harveſt come. Let Miniſters and People lament after the Lord, that he would fill his Houſe with glory, haſten the day of his Power, to make People chearful Volunteers in the Lord's Warfare. Oh that more might knock at our doors with a [<hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>] <hi>Where is the Lord God of</hi> Elijah? Lord, cloath thine Ordinances with thy Power. When ſhall <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod bring forth ripe Almonds? Lord, let the Children of the Covenant own the God of their Fathers, and be ſprinkled with Covenant grace. Lord, break up that bleſſed Writ of Electing Love, in converting grace. Let Sermons be ſeconded with power. Make thy Word the Arms of God unto Salvation.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59151:35"/>
            <p n="3">3. Doth not God much withdraw from the Societies of his Servants? Is there to be ſound that entireneſs, ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faithfulneſs amongſt God's People to each other as in former daies? Is there not much pride, worldlineſs, decay of love to God, abating ſpiritual zeal for God, ſuch as was in the daies of old? Alas! we have reaſon to think the Spirit of Prayer is much withdrawn; that cloſe walking, that diſtance from appearances of ſin, that entireneſs for God, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearedneſs and uſefulneſs of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, as is wont to be.

<note place="margin">Song 5.7.</note> that they find them out, wound them, take away their vail from them, expoſe the Members of the ſame Church, as if they were factious, traiterous, or hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and will hold no communion with them that have much charity for them, and purſue them with intreaties to beg their conſent to walk with them towards Heaven, and joyn in God's work for winning of Souls; and alas, they brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat them, and ſeem to deny them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to worſhip the ſame God, own the ſame Bible, or partake of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saviour: If this be not for a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, what is?

How long ſhall intangling Orders for decency rend the bowels of thy Church? When ſhall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to Chriſt's Laws ſuffice?</p>
            <p>It's ſure a matter of lamentation that the

Lord open mens Eyes, heal our bleeding wounds, and bring back that antient Chriſtian Spirit of Love, and Peace, Charity &amp; Humility.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Once more; Is there no cauſe for Gods Children to lament after the Lord for his return to their Spirits? Is not God much withdrawn from the hearts of his People?

It's much to be feared there's a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral decay of grace, or damp in point of exerciſe on the Spirits of living Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: it's well if the Bridgroom find not even the wiſe Virgins aſleep.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59151:37"/>People, and be hardened in their ſinful ways.</hi> Alas, where ſhall Gods tender Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Children hide their faces when their brethren prophane Gods holy Name, and men ſhall ſay, <hi>Theſe are the People of the Lord, and are gone forth out of his land, Ezek.</hi> 36.20. Theſe are your Praeciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſcrupulous Zealots that will not do as others; now they ſhew that they are a pack of Hypocrites. This cuts deep, and wounds to the heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to communion with God, Gods People of old could aſſert it with a [true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] however carnal men ſcorn it now, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Not only in that ſecret, eſſential funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental communion whereby grace is maintained in its being and life, but that ſweet, ſenſible, Soul-refreſhing fellowſhip that gives grace its activity, &amp; maintains intercourſe betwixt God and the Soul in duty: But alas! have not Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cauſe to complain as the Church, that God withdraws himſelf;
<note place="margin">Song 3. 1. c. 5. 6.</note> She ſeeks him but finds him not, in publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in ſecret Duties, in communion of Saints, Gods Children complain with <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 23.8, 9. <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59151:38"/>perceive him,</hi> &amp;c. He looks Eaſt, Weſt, North, South but in vain; This is ſtrange that God who is every where ſhould be found no where—but though the Child of God be aware of Gods gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Omnipreſence, and feel his common Providence, yet is not ſatisfied without his ſpecial preſence, and gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; And miſſing this, he hath reaſon to lament after the Lord when he hides himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to aſſurance, ſettlement and comfort ſometimes Gods Children are left to a ſad, unſatisfyed and doubting frame, full of fears, troubles, jealouſies, are much in the dark in point of ſtate; this is a very general complaint at this day. Many have blurred their evidences by ſins, or careleſneſs, and cannot give any diſtinct account how their principles are ſtated, what condition their Souls are in, are damped and daunted as to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, title to the promiſes, hopes of Heaven; Have not theſe great cauſe to lament after the Lord? And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe muſt ſay as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.8.—12. <hi>Make me to hear joy and gladneſs, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce; reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and uphold me with thy free
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59151:38"/>Spirit:</hi> O my God!
<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.6.</note> My Soul is caſt down within me, one while I argue with my own heart communing, expoſtulating challenging, charging my Spirit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, I can do no good with it, other whiles turning me to God, but ſtill I am reſtleſs, cannot be quiet, but am toſſed with tempeſts, and not comforted. Well,
<note place="margin">Jon. 2.4.</note> I am determined to look towards Gods holy temple, and caſt my ſelf at Gods feet in the vertue of that promiſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord; his going forth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as the morning, and he ſhall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the Doctrinal part, and the clearing of an objection.</p>
            <p>All the Application I ſhall make of this point ſhall only be of Exhortation, to put us all upon this ſo ſeaſonable and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a duty of lamenting after the Lord; the Ark of the Lord and the Lord of the Ark.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this, I ſhall do theſe four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Propound ſome Motives and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to preſs this duty upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſcover what ſort of Perſons
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59151:39"/>are concerned thus to lament after the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lay before you ſome Helps to carry on this work of ſerious lamenting.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Propound ſome Cordials to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our hearts till we overtake the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Motives to perſuade, prevail with our hearts to practice this duty, once at laſt; and indeed it's a very ſad conſideration that this People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were twenty years before they began to feel their feet, or come to themſelves. This ſhall be the</p>
            <p>Firſt Argument, That a profeſſing People may lye long under dreadful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual judgments without a ſenſible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; It was ſo with them here, it's well if it be not ſo with us: And this ſenſleſs frame is greater evil than any other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But how comes it to paſs that men may be ſo long ſenſeleſs and not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the Lord all this while?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. From the nature of ſin; ſin is of an hardening, ſtupifying, bruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nature, when men fall into ſin, their hearts are hardened by it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. Sin is of a cold congealing nature, it freezeth the Soul, rocketh conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59151:39"/>and like the Fiſh <hi>Torpedo,</hi> that diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its benumming poiſon through the hand, arm, and creeping at laſt to his heart, kills him; ſo doth ſin. It's not to tell how <hi>David</hi>'s ſin rockt him aſleep, and led him on to other ſins, till it indangered his Soul's ſleeping the ſleep of death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the worldly enjoyments men have in room of Ordinances; as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in <hi>Babylon</hi> being well ſettled in their conveniences, forget God's Appointments, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> comes [not] into their mind, while their enjoyments afford con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Yea, though ſome returned, they can ſleep quietly in their Cieled houſes, while the Houſe of God lies waſte, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.4. God's Ark is forgotten, when mens private Cheſts are full. Perſonal comforts thruſt our ſpiritual, as the Sun Beams eat out the Kitchin fire.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the want of quickening Means in the want of Ordinances. When the Prophets are dead naturally or civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their Monitors to duty are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9. <hi>We ſee not our ſigns; there's no more any Prophet, neither is there any among us that knoweth how long.</hi> When men want an <hi>Haggai</hi> or <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah,</hi> they lie ſtill aſleep, for want of awakening Helps. It's <hi>Samuel</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59151:40"/>this lamenting after the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the withdrawings of God's grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.18.—<hi>Quicken us, and we will call on thy Name.</hi> As long as God turns his back on us, we ſhall be ſo far from kindly lamenting after him, that we ſhall turn, go back from him. <hi>My Soul fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth hard after thee, Pſal.</hi> 63.8. How comes that to paſs? why, <hi>Thy right hand upholdeth me.</hi> It's God that gives a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting heart, a lamenting Soul. Oh what are we if God leave us to our ſelves! Study theſe cauſes of ſenſleſneſs, and let our Souls be aſhamed. Tremble at theſe cauſes, and their effects; bewail ſin; ſettle not in worldly injoyments; beg quickening helps, and above all, Divine grace for our aſſiſtance in lamenting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord. This is the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God's Profeſſing People may, and muſt ſtir up themſelves to lament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord. All men have rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Gracious Souls have ſpiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſloth kills both: Self excitation is poſſible, and a furtherance to this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation after God. Men as men have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and Conſcience is the Candle of the Lord,
<note place="margin">Prov. 20.27</note> ſearching all the inward parts of the belly, by ſelf-reflection, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the want of God and goodneſs, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="61" facs="tcp:59151:40"/>for evil, putting on to what is good; if you follow it not as far as it leads you, you wrong it, rebel againſt its Maſter, and deprive your ſelves of further helps: Contradict this Preacher in thy boſom at thy peril. Means intervene betwixt a man's can, and his cannot; if thou canſt not move a ſpiritual ſtep, thou muſt move a natural ſtep after the Lord; if thou canſt not create a new heart,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.31.</note> yet thou canſt and muſt endeavour to make thee a new heart, and a new ſpirit. If thou be not able to do God's work, thou muſt be doing thy own work; bemoan thy ſelf, tell him what an unruly Bullock thou art, and deſire him to turn thee, and then thou ſhalt be turned.
<note place="margin">Jer. 31.18. Iſa. 64.7.2 Tim. 1.6. Pſal. 62.5. Eph. 5.14.</note> Stir up thy ſelf to take hold on God. Stir up the Gift of God in thee. Charge thy ſelf as <hi>David, My Soul, wait thou only upon God. Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light. Awake, awake, put on thy ſtrength, oh</hi> Zion! <hi>put on thy beautiful Garments, oh</hi> Jeruſalem!—<hi>ſhake thy ſelf from the duſt;—looſe thy ſelf from the bands of thy neck, oh Captive Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of</hi> Zion! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.1, 2. Now at laſt God expects you ſhould labour to work your hearts to a diſcovery of your miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the neceſſity you have of God, of his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59151:41"/>preſence and Ordinances. You may rouze your ſelves to this work, you muſt, and if you do, God will help, if not, your deſtruction will be of your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This lamenting after the Lord and his Ark hath been the practice, and is the true Character of God's Children. <hi>Eli's</hi> heart trembled for the Ark of God.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.13, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas</hi>'s Wife thought it not worth the while to live when the Ark was gone: <hi>I will wait on the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and will look for him, Iſa.</hi> 8.17. This was when it was ſaid, <hi>Bind up the Teſtimony, ſeal the Law among my Diſciples, v.</hi> 16. Yea, if you would ſeek and find God, ſeek not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Spirits—<hi>but to the Law, and to the Teſtimony, v.</hi> 19, 20. For, ſhould not a People ſeek unto their God? Sirs, ſhew what you are, and act as you ſeem: If you be God's Children,
<note place="margin">Jer. 17.17.</note> run weeping af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Father; cry after him, and ſay, <hi>Be not a terrour to me.</hi> Yea, why ſhouldeſt thou be as a ſtranger in the Land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aſide to tarry for a night? Lord, art not thou in the midſt of us? We are called by thy Name, leave us not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8, 9. <hi>Be not thou far from me,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.11, 19.</note> O Lord, for trouble is near, for there is none to help.</hi> Oh!
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59151:41"/>where is that antient ſerious Spirit of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting after the Lord? Where are thoſe genuine workings of Child-like bowels after ſuch a Father? What's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that ſighing frame of heart, that Spirit of Adoption, that God's Children of old were indued with? It's well if new Notions do not drive out that old Spirit of lamentation. Shew you are Saints by this, as thoſe few declared themſelves <hi>Saul</hi>'s faithful Souldiers whoſe hearts God had toucht,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.26. &amp; 13.7.</note> following him tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or trembling after him. So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>They ſhall walk after the Lord; he ſhall roar like a Lion, when he ſhall roar, then the Children ſhall tremble from the Weſt.</hi> Obſerve it, God's roaring in terrible threatnings or executions, drives not God's Children from him, but to him, only they come trembling, appealing from God to God, from an avenging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice offended, to tender Mercies through the Merits of Jeſus. Learn this Myſtery an Chriſtian Property.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is no controverted Point, but a granted duty on all hands, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading to: Who dare contradict it? Yea, who dare diſpute it? What excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can any bring againſt this, of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting after the Lord? I challenge any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59151:42"/>Caviller to produce any ſhew of reaſon againſt either branch of it; either as to the Ordinances of God, or God in his Ordinances. I think all Parties are agreed in the Theory. Oh that all were alſo agreed in the practice of this duty! what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſputes men make about other Rules, or Canons of practice, methinks there ſhould be none about this. <hi>Let us therefore; as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if in any thing ye be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you; nevertheleſs, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame thing, Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. Whence I diſcern, 1. That it's a vain praepoſterous thing for perſons to ſpend time in diſputing about abſtruſe and dark Points, while they neglect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous and palpable duties. 2. The only way to get Unity in leſs material Truths or Duties, is conſcientious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of what is neceſſary and indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I may truly ſay, that nothing is more likely to make us cordial Friends; than the practice of the Duty in my Text; when <hi>Judah</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſrael</hi> fall a weeping and ſeeking the Lord then they go together.
<note place="margin">Jer. 50.45.</note> How amicable doth converting grace make thoſe that were at deadly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59151:42"/>feud?
<note place="margin">Mal. 4.6.</note> for Repentance turns the hearts of Parents and Children to each other. Alas! till our faces be ſet towards the Lord, our backs will be on each other, and we ſhall ruſh with fury one againſt another: But if we agree in this beſt act and object, we ſhall agree amongſt our ſelves: Lamenting together would clear up our eye-ſight, and beget an harmony of hearts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Other perſons in all other caſes do lament after the Objects that their hearts are ſet upon. <hi>David</hi> followed his dead Friend <hi>Abner</hi> with ſorrow, and bitterly lamented his dead Son <hi>Abſalom.</hi> The Companions of <hi>Jephthah</hi>'s Daughter yearly lamented her. Yea <hi>David</hi> much lamented <hi>Saul</hi> (though his Enemy while living) and his ſworn Brother <hi>Jonathan, Jeremiah</hi> lamented for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and all the ſinging-men, &amp; ſinging-women ſpake of <hi>Joſiah</hi> in their lamentations to this day. Yea, they made them an Ordinance in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.25. And which of you are ſo hard-hearted, but you would lament a dead Friend, or Brother, Siſter, Wife, Child, Parent? And canſt thou not find in thy heart to ſpend ſome ſad thoughts on thy departing Lord, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſad Hearſe of deceaſed Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59151:43"/>Ah carnal hearts! Ah hard hearts Wo be to ſtupid wretches! Shall a poor Idolatrous <hi>Micah</hi> cry out after his Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim? And ſhall we let the only true God go with ſilence and dry eyes? Is not our God worth lamenting after? Will even careleſs women lament at laſt for the teats,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 32.12.</note> for the pleaſant fields, for the fruitful vine? And ſhall not Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lament for thoſe full breaſts of Goſpel ordinances? Shall not Children cry and long for the ſincere milk of the word that they may grow thereby?
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> If you were ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, you would cry out, my Father, a little bread to an hungry Soul, my Mother, let me ſuck thoſe breaſts of conſolation: I am pining, languiſhing, famiſhing to death, let me be nouriſhed to eternal life.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If we lament not after the Lord and his Ark, he will go yet further from us, if not totally leave us. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch ſymptoms of Gods taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Candleſtick, and leaving us to the Idolatry, and Cruelties of Popery, in this Kingdom, ſince the Reformation as there is at this day: horrible Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Atheiſm preparing for it, our ingratitude for prevention thus long, the general Antipathy to a Sound Miniſtry,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59151:43"/>a Spirit of giddineſs to entertain the moſt ſenſeleſs fopperies, a mincing ſome groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Popiſh doctrines by pretended Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, humane Inventions coyned in dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt times of Popery retained, Courts, Fees, Officers, Ceremonies; Popiſh names places, Cuſtoms defended; Want of Sympathy with our ſuffering bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren abroad in that kind; attempts for Reformation not ſucceeding oppoſed: Inſtruments reſerved, prepared for Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; denying plots as clear as the Sun; Preferring Popiſh Tyranny before Chriſts Government; moſt debauchery in ſome that ſhould be beſt; Popiſh Emiſſaries ſwarming; Popiſh Families increaſing; Honeſt Miniſters much laying aſide Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Antidotes; fearleſneſs in many, unpreparedneſs of all for ſuch a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; impreſſions on many of Changes; Freedom of Ordinances to lay in for a ſtorm; unprincipled profeſſors muſt paſs an Ordeal-Tryal; judgment beginning at God's houſe; Choyce ſtakes taken out of the hedg, tranſplanted to Heaven; Witneſſes prophecying in Sackcloth; muſt be ſlain, the Whore muſt ſit as a Queen, and ſee no loſs of Children; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt muſt render himſelf more cruel and odious, to ſtir up Kings hearts
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59151:44"/>againſt the Church: indifferency of great potentates in the cauſe of Religion, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for outward ſecurity, the compaſs that moſt ſtear by; Chriſt's intereſt is low in Proteſtant Countries; God's laying them under ſevere rebuke by his immediate hand; Little notice taken of providences, no publick faſtings and humiliations, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer guilt of blood unwiped off; Such things as theſe ſpeak black ſhowrs of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh darkneſs and barbarous ſhowrs of blood; God almighty prevent; But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe things call for bitter lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Lord; either to prevent them or prepare our hearts for them, or both. I ſhall add,</p>
            <p n="7">7. There is no way to bring our Lord or his Ark back to us, but this courſe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting after him. God hath withdrawn himſelf purpoſely to make us follow him mourning; And he ſeems to ſtand ſtill and hearken what we do in this caſe <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>I hearkened and heard</hi> ſaith God, <hi>but they ſpake not aright:</hi> What was that? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly repenting of their ſins, &amp; lamenting inquiries after God; And <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. If God can but hear perſons bemoan them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, follow God, deſire the Lord to turn them, and turn to them, ſee what kind language he gives them, <hi>ver</hi> 20.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59151:44"/>
               <hi>Is</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear Son? Is he a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Child; for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him,</hi> ſaith the Lord. God doth carry in this caſe as a loving Father, being provoked to Whip or leave his offending Child, looks back on his ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, broken-hearted lamenting Child, ſaying, Alas, my Child what ails thee! What's the matter with thee? What wanteſt thou? Doſt thou want an heart, to repent, friendſhip with me? Doſt thou lament ſo ſadly after reconciliation with me, and return to thee? I am glad of it, that was all I aimed at; I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mine end; come, come, thou art welcome to me, come my dear; my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Child, let me wipe thy blubbered cheeks, and kiſs thee again; I am glad my rod and anger work ſo kindly, I will return to thee with love and ſweeteſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces: Thus doth our Lord return with loving kindneſs and mercies, and they ſhall be as if he had not caſt them off: There's no way probable or poſſible to bring God or his Ark back but this, and ſhall we not take this courſe? It's true its a doubtfull and dangerous caſe, we are not certain he will return, but yet there's a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59151:45"/>May-be, a who can tell in it: We are ſure, running from him, and ſinning againſt him, with an hard-heart, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly rob us of him, and ruine us, but we have loſt more labour to leſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore let us turn to the Lord, with all our heart, with faſting, with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; with mourning, <hi>&amp;c. Joel</hi> 2.12, 13. and then ſay, as Gods directs them, <hi>v.</hi> 14. Who knoweth if he will return and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and leave a bleſſing behind him, even a meat-offering and a drink-offering unto the Lord our God? Oh how well doth God take ſuch a carriage! How willing is he to return back to us! Only he expects we ſhould be ſenſible of his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, and bitterly lament after him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If we do not lay to heart the loſs of God's Preſence and Ordinances, God will make us to lament upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: If he deſign us good, he will pinch us till we feel, and cry out, if not, we ſhall be left to lament hopeleſs, and helpleſs in Hell torments. If we will not lay to heart ſpiritual Judgments, God threatens to ſend a Curſe upon us, and to curſe our bleſſings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. How? why, if men prize not their Temple Priviledges, God can blaſt the fruits of the Earth, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.9. <hi>We looked for much,

<note place="margin">Lam. 1.3.</note> If men will not lament the Ark's Captivity, God will make <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> go into Captivity. If men lay not to heart the mourning waies of <hi>Zion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 1 4, 6.</note> God hath a way to make them go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength before the purſuer. Men can well diſpenſe with the loſs of the pleaſant things of the Sanctuary,

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We have heard that God is with you, with his Apoſtles by ſtrange ſigns, gifts, miracles, holineſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; What appearances of God for you, by you, in you; You may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn in with ſuch as God thinks fit to own, and communicate himſelf to; I am convinced from the bright beams of Goſpel-light, and from the powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and convictions of the Spirit, that this is indeed the way of God. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to inquire after God in it, and joyn with them that travel in it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venwards: Thus much for the ſecond head, who are the Perſons concerned in this work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Head is the helps and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59151:64"/>in this lamenting after the Lord. What courſe ſhall we take both to perform this duty aright, and to obtain what we lament after, <hi>viz.</hi> either the God of Ordinances, or the Ordinances of God?</p>
            <p>Here I might repeat what was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Explication, by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were inclined after the Lord. It were well if poor Sinners would but ſtop their vain career, ſtand ſtill, pauſe upon it, bethink themſelves, have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency God-wards; this is the firſt ſtep to Repentance. <hi>See Jer.</hi> 8.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Settled after the Lord. Oh that men were well reſolved upon good grounds, that their hearts were well fixed, inflamed, deſigned for God! as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

They put away the ſtrange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord, and ſee the bleſſed effect, his Soul was grieved for the miſery of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and he delivers them. No way like this.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They acquieſced in the Lord, were fully contented and ſatisfied with the Lord, both as to the object of worſhip, and manner of worſhipping: And oh for ſuch a frame as that! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.13. <hi>O Lord our God, other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over us, but by thee only will we make mention of thy Name, i. e.</hi> by thy Precepts, according to thy Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will we worſhip thee; our fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee ſhall be no more taught by the Precepts of men;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.13.</note> we will worſhip thee only in thy own way; and by thee <hi>i. e.</hi> in thy ſtrength, by the aſſiſtance of thy grace, thou alone ſhalt be the Author and object of our love, deſire, pleaſure and delight.

            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:59151:65"/>
            <p>Theſe are the Duties implied in the Text ſpread before you, required of us all in this World, work of lamenting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord.</p>
            <p>But to help our hearts to, and in the due performance of theſe required Duties, I ſhall propound ſome qualifications, as ſo many Directions to carry on this work ſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p n="1">1. See to your State and Principles; except you be related to God, you'l not lament after him, nor be much concern'd about him, or his Ark, whether going or coming. Relation is the foundation of Affection. A Child will cry after his own Father. Now God is not our Father ſince the Fall, till Regeneration make a real, and Adoption a relative change of our State; and when we have received the Spirit of Adoption, then, never till then, ſhall we cry, <hi>Abba, Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15. They only will cry after God that love him, fear him, honour him, as a Father, with a filial Affection, and they only ſhall be entertained by him; as for others, he owns their out-crys no more than the howlings of a Dog. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine your State God-wards! Hath Converting Grace under Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces changed your hearts? Hath the Spirit
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59151:66"/>awakened your Conſciences, convinced you of your undone State by Nature, transformed you by the renewing of your Minds, tranſlated you out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into light? deal faithfully with your Souls in this caſe; you come into the World with your backs turned upon God, and you will never lament after him without a turn: Yea naturally there's an enmity and antipathy in our hearts to God and his waies. Hath God cruſhed and conquered that, and planted right Principles in you, to incline you to him? if yet you find not a Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a new Nature begot in you, flatter not your ſelves, you will rather run far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him, than lament after him. Let your Souls be chiefly concerned for this firſt, then for the reſt. Union pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes Communion: A real Title is ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to laying Claim: A Principle of Grace is before an actual exerciſe of it: There muſt be life, before there can be any deſire of, or nutrition by food. I have no hopes of prevailing with graceleſs Souls to lament after God, till they have life and breath, voice and lungs, except for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, for company, or for carnal ends, which is inſignificant. Oh for grace, truth of grace, &amp; a reality of intereſt in Chriſt,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59151:66"/>and all the Priviledges he hath purchaſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inform your ſelves throughly of the terms we ſtand in with God. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the Lord carries towards us, as to our particular Souls, and the Nation in general. We ſhall never lament after him till we ſee him withdrawn. Ignorance of the State of things with us keeps Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſenſleſneſs. What the Eye of (bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or mind) ſees not, is never laid to heart: Make ſome collections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of things at this day: Yea, make compariſons betwixt former and preſent Times. What think you? Hath not God manifeſted himſelf more in his Providences for us, than of late? Have we not reaſon to take up the Church's complaint, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1—9. or to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate as <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 6.13. Oh my Lord! If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his Miracles which our Fathers told us of? I have told you how much reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace is withdrawn from many; how rare Converſion is by Ordinances; how much God hath withdrawn both from the Societies and Spirits of his Servants. I ſhall not trouble you with repetitions; look over theſe things, compare them with what you ſee and obſerve, and if
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59151:67"/>you find the Lord as formerly, be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; if otherwiſe, be humbled, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after him. It's to be feared, that if you be obſervant diſcerning Chriſtians, you'l yet find out more than hitherto hath been mentioned, both demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's remove, and Prognoſticks of future removes. The moſt excellent and eminent Servants of God pluckt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death from amongſt us, and God ſaith, <hi>They are taken away from the evil to come, Iſa.</hi> 57.1. The Spirit of Giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Atheiſm and Idolatry ſpreading at a ſtrange rate, beyond all parallel. Other things I might mention, but I leave them to your inquiry: Only there's one Text methinks is aſtoniſhing, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Three Shepherds alſo I cut off in one month, and my Soul loathed them, and their Soul alſo abhorred me.</hi> It's one of the ſaddeſt words in all the Bible. Whether they were good or bad Shepherds that were cut off, it's dreadful that it hath no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect than mutual abhorrency. Oh that this were not our caſe! We lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der woful fruits of God's loathing us, and it's well if men do not loath him. A Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of oppoſition to Godlineſs is the ſad fruit of Divine dereliction, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth greater Spiritual and Temporal
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59151:67"/>Plagues. Hence he adds, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Then ſaid I, I will not feed you, that that dieth, let it die, and that that is cut off, let it be cut off, and let the reſt eat every one the fleſh of another.</hi> They ſhall have no Goſpel-Paſtors to feed their Souls; that's a Spiritual Plague which fell on the Jews for rejecting Chriſt. They ſhall devour one another with curſed rage and malice, as in ſeditions, conſpiracies, or in their neceſſity of food by the terrible Famine. Thus the Jews were deſtroyed in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>'s miſerable Ruin. The like Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks are upon us. Lord prevent the fame effects, and awake our hearts to uſe God's appointed Means for prevention.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make diligent inquiry into the Reaſon of our preſent and approaching calamities. Is there not a cauſe? Surely <hi>affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth trouble ſpring out of the ground.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5.6.</note> Sin is the Mother and Nurſe of ſorrow. Is not God bringing our iniquities upon us? Doth not our own wickedneſs correct us, and our backſliding reprove us? Doth not this Rod ſay,
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.19.</note> 
               <hi>Thy ways and thy doings have procured theſe things unto thee, this is thy wickedneſs, becauſe, it is bitter, becauſe it reacheth unto thine heart,</hi> or Soul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.18. Let Miniſters and People, lay their hand on their heart, and ſearch
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59151:68"/>our Conſciences &amp; Converſations? Is it not I that ſhut out Miniſters, as the good Woman ſaid, I broke my Miniſters Leg; My pride, unteachableneſs, unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, formality, neglect of duty, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurings and uncharitableneſs, ſenſuality &amp; worldlineſs, hypocriſy and lukewarmneſs, vain glory and mindleſneſs of Gods glory and my Souls eternal good; theſe, theſe made all the excluding, baniſhing, fining impriſoning Laws that ever came out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God's Servants; Theſe chiefly have broken all aſſemblies, ſcatterred meetings, armed all the Officers, retarded our deliverance: By our ſins are our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſtrong, and the hands of our friends weak:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peccatis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris fortes ſunt Barbari.</hi>
               </note> Alas! It's my own iniquity that hath brought us, low, ſet back a good work, baniſht God, lift up the right hand of our enemies; Nor is it the Sins of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, but profeſſors, <hi>Of the Rock that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat us we have been unmindful, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten God that formed us,</hi> Deut. 32.18, 19. <hi>Therefore, when the Lord ſaw it be abhorred us, becauſe of the provoking of his Sons and of his daughters,</hi> Oh our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ingratitude, rebellion, covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our ſins have reached to heaven; therefore our judgments are unparallel'd. We may ſay as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Under the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59151:68"/>whole heaven hath no: been done, as hath been done upon us:</hi> It's well if we have not reaſon to add alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>That all this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer!</hi> [<hi>Heb. intreated the face</hi>] <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities and underſtand thy truth:</hi> It's true, we have prayed, but it's well if we have ſo prayed. Is not the accurſed thing to be found amongſt us to this day? We have been long in the fire, but are we cleanſed? Alas, alas, May not that ſad complaint and charge be brought in againſt us, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.28, 29, 30. <hi>They are grievous revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, walking with Slanders, braſs and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, they are all corrupters, the Bellows are burnt, the Lead is conſumed of the fire; the Founder melteth in vain, for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are not plucked away, Reprobate Silver ſhall men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them.</hi> Oh that this were not our caſe, and that Character alſo given of that profeſſing people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.3—7. But I ſhall leave Chriſtians to this heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work, beſeeching, requiring and charging all perſons to deal faithfully with their own Souls; find out the <hi>Achan</hi> that troubles the Camp, <hi>ſtone it;</hi> Caſt lots to find the <hi>Jonah</hi> that raiſeth this tempeſt, caſt it over-board, confeſs,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59151:69"/>bewail, reform, get pardon of Sin, and who knows but we ſhall have a calm?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Get your hearts ſenſible of the evil of God's departure from us: Otherwiſe you will not think it worth the while to ſpend time in lamenting after him: Come to an heart, an houſe, a ſociety, a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or the nation, and make inquiry, is God there? If it be anſwered, no, he's gone in whole or in part, what's then left that's good? Surely if God go, all good goes, and all evil comes, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.3—6. Now for a long ſeaſon <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been without the true God. and without a teaching Prieſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law [whether this was under <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> and his Succeſſors, or ſome other time] and in thoſe times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the Countreys—For God did vex them with all adverſity. Mark it, when God goes, all evil comes. They that were without the true, pure, publick Worſhip of God, and with a ſtanding Miniſtry, to teach publickly, plainly, powerfully, but had in their places, falſe Prophets, lying Rabbins, or graceleſs Loyterers, and it may be the People lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have it ſo. No wonder if they had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59151:69"/>Civil Diſcords, Forein Invaſions, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Diſſentions, all things going to wrack, ſetting up one Ruler againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo joyning in Parties, Factions, uſing barbarous cruelties, imbroyling all in ſad contentions, imbruing their hands in one anothers blood: When God goes he breaks down the hedg of his protecting providence,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 80.12, 13.</note> ſo that the Boar out of the Wood waſts his Vineyard.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.6, 7.</note> Then it's eaten up, trodden down, it ſhall not be pruned nor digged, but there comes up Briars &amp; Thorns, yea he commands the clouds that they rain no rain upon it; what then will become of it! Surely the incloſed Vineyard of the Church ſoon becomes a a wild Common of barbarous Infidels: When God removes his Candles, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes,
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.5.</note> but when he removes Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks alſo, <hi>Mahomet</hi> fills up the room: The famous <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches are a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtance: If the ſun ſet, night comes on: If the King be abſent, what Court can be kept? If Chriſt ſtay not where's the Church? If God ſhould leave his glorious manſion in heaven; It would inſtantly become a dark dungeon of hell: Yea if God depart from a People as a friend, he comes againſt them as a dreadful foe: If he go away he tears as a Lion;
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.14.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59151:70"/>as a Moth: If he hide his face in Love, he comes in wrath, and fury to ſlay them,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28.15.</note> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.5. <hi>Saul</hi> was in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plight when God was departed from him, and the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> were upon him. Yea, if God depart the Devil comes. When the good Spirit went from <hi>Saul,</hi> an evil Spirit from the Lord troubled, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14, 23. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> was from God, as framing his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, commiſſionating him to puniſh <hi>Saul,</hi> but his wickedneſs and malignity in his deſigns and actings from himſelf: Oh how glad is the Devil to take up that room that God leaves? truly then ſaith the Lord, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Yea woe alſo to them, when I depart from them:</hi> There's a wo of ſinning, and ſuffering attends God's departure: Whither will not men run when God forſakes them? If the hand withdraw, the ſtaff falls; if the glaſs without foot be not held up, it falls, and breaks, and the liquor Spills, the very beſt man is no more dayly, but as the Lord makes him: <hi>Sampſon, David, Peter,</hi> will fall if God go: Much more they that have no hold of God, or God of them in a covenant-way, they'l not ſtop till they commence at the height of Sin and fall into the depth of Hell! <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.17.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59151:70"/>
               <hi>My God will caſt them away becauſe they did not hearken to him:</hi> Hoſ. 7.13. <hi>Woe unto them, for they have fled from me, yea deſtruction to them, becauſe thay have tranſgreſſed againſt me: Yea everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and from the glory of his power.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 8.9. Were we kindly affected with all this, we ſhould lament after the Lord: We have reaſon to tremble, left it prove our caſe, and removing his ordinances is a great ſtep to all this: And if we knew what it meant, we ſhould with old <hi>Eli</hi> have <hi>trembling hearts for the Ark of God,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Study the advantages and benefit of having God preſent with us; as fear of evil is one motive to avoid it; ſo a deſire of the contrary good, adds wings in ſeeking earneſtly for it. When God goes, all good goes: So when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns or continues with a People, they enjoy all good, inward, outward. The People that have God with them, have a ſtrong Guard to defend them, a wiſe Guide to direct them, rich Grace to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, high Honour to advance them, full Reſt to content them, an abundant Reward in the enjoyment of him: They have enough, they need no more. <hi>Happy

Yea, it becomes every one to ſtudy the uſefulneſs of God's Ordinances, that their hearts may be ingaged to, and inlarged in lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Ordinances of God? Both theſe are larger Subjects than I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure, to explain the advantages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59151:71"/>to a People by the preſence of the Ordinances of God, or the God of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. You muſt look on the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as fruits and tokens of God's ſpecial favour, for all have not the Ordinances of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his Statutes and his Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael; <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; and as for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they have not known them.</hi> That this Sun-ſhine of Goſpel-Light is on one place, and not on another, proceeds from diſcriminating Providence, who ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours for the Goſpel to be brought to them.

Oh that you knew what helps Ordinances are to promote God's work in our hearts, in begetting and increaſing Faith, Repentance, Love, new Obedience; this is that clear Chryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs through which we may ſee the face of God,

Oh that your eyes were opened to ſee the neceſſity, excellency, utility of God's Ordinances! I am very confident, that if your Souls be as new born Babes, you will deſire after the ſincere Milk of the Word, if ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3. As for others that want ſpiritual life and light to diſcover and feel the marrow of Ordinances, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they ſlight or deſpiſe both the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments themſelves, and ſuch as long for them, and lament the want of them; and therefore I urge this, that you learn by your own experience the ſweetneſs and advantage of enjoying the preſence of God in the Ordinances of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Get and maintain publick Spirits. Oh take heed of private Spirits, to look only after your own concerns, and worldly Intereſts!

Well then, my advice is, that you chiefly mind the Intereſt of our Lord in the World; and put as great an accent on this in your prayers, as if it were your own caſe; and indeed it is your own: Your little Boat hangs on the great Ship; but all judge not ſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are few lamenters after the Lord: But if you would look on <hi>Zion</hi>'s caſe as your own, and ſo carry it as having yours really involved in that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, it would be both an help and ſpur in your lamentings.

            <p n="4">4. The laſt I ſhall briefly hint at is, ſome Cordials which may ſupport and bear up our hearts till our Souls overtake our dear Lord, or he turn again to us, in our lamentings after him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Lamenting Souls after the Lord are moſt likely to be the remnant eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in approaching Calamities:
<note place="margin">Zeph. 2.3.</note> Theſe have the Mourners mark on them, and ordinarily are left, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 6. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. <hi>But they that eſcape of them ſhall eſcape, and ſhall be on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains like Doves of the Valleys, all of them mourning every one for their iniquity.</hi> If Land-deſtroying Calamities come, you are likelieſt to ſurvive and be a holy Seed for ſtoring the Church in future times.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You may be the Inſtruments to prevail with the Lord for keeping in the midſt of us: Yet there's a poſſibility; <hi>Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him? Joel</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14. There's yet a may-be in it, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.15. <hi>Hate the evil, and love the good, and eſtabliſh Judgment in the Gate; it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59151:77"/>may be that the Lord God of Hoſts will be gracious unto the remnant of</hi> Joſeph. God hath condeſcended to his Peoples ſupplications, why not yours? The poor wiſe man hath delivered the City;
<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.15. Job 22.30.</note> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent may deliver the Iſland. <hi>Lot</hi> ſped for <hi>Zoar, Abraham</hi> for <hi>Lot,</hi> yea very far for the Cities of the Plain. Make a tryal; and what comfort will it be to you, if your lamenting Prayers turn the Scales for God's ſtay with us!</p>
            <p n="3">3. However, you may ſtay him with your own Souls; Is that nothing? God is as willing to be friends with us, as we can be to deſire it, and much more, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.5. Or, <hi>Let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with me;</hi> and he ſhall make peace with me; And is this nothing? Oh what is God's preſence worth! How have <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Job, Heman,</hi> and all the Saints prized it? Do you not want it? <hi>Follow on to know</hi> [and own and acknowledge] <hi>the Lord, and you ſhall find his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he will come to you as the Rain, Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. Your Fleece ſhall be wet when others are dry. If you cannot obtain mercy for others, yet as <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 14.14.</note> you may deliver your own Souls by your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59151:78"/>
            <p n="4">4. Yet the Lord hath not forſaken us; he is yet in the midſt of us by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providences and Influences; he hath been hitherto prevailed with, though he threatned us to leave us, and we had cauſe to fear Execution; his Candleſticks are fixed, and Candles are ſhining, though not all in their proper Sockets, but under a Buſhel: This is an incouraging mercy, our God hath not forſaken us. Yea now for a little ſpace grace hath been ſhewed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to eſcape, and to give us a Nail in his holy Place, that our God may lighten our Eyes, and give us a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving in our bondage, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.8, 9. It was not our deſervings that hath kept him with us; no, no, Iſrael <hi>bath not been forſaken, nor</hi> Judah <hi>of his God,—though their Land was filled with ſin againſt the holy One of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.5. What's the reaſon then that God is not quite gone? See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22. <hi>For the Lord will not forſake his People for his great Names ſake, becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his People.</hi> The Argument holds for us, and it's ſtill in force; bleſſed be God he hath not caſt us off as yet, and the Covenant with Anceſtors ſtill holds good, as in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.23.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59151:78"/>
            <p n="5">5. God ſeems to be in ſuſpenſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould leave us or no, to draw us on in our lamentings after him; juſt as he expreſſeth himſelf in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee</hi> Iſrael? <hi>How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>How ſhall I ſet thee as Zebbim;</hi> ſtrange Language ſpoken by the infinitely wife and immutable God; As though he were puzzled and knew not what to do. Surely this is ſpoken after the manner of men, &amp; ſpeaks God loth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, for indeed it is his ſtrange work; <hi>q. d.</hi> the ſeverity of my threats call on truth to make execution, <hi>ſed quomodo hoc à me impetrabo?</hi>] But how ſhall I prevail with my ſelf to do it? The glory of my Name, free-grace, and conſtant love to my Covenanted people get hold on my wrathful hand when ready to ſtrike the fatal ſtroke, the righteouſneſs of a Judg ſaith, ſtrike; The bowels of a Father ſay, hold; And when God thus deliberates, it is to ſtay and ſee if his People will get hold of him, by faith and prayer: Is not this his carriage towards us in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? certainly the Lord comes and goes as if he were loth to puniſh us, and is not this a very great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us to lament after him? Since
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59151:79"/>he looks back, as a Mother to her Child, with a wiſhly eye, as if he had not the power to go, as if he ſhould ſay, call me back and you ſhall have me, my heart is towards you, though I am forced to turn my back on you, you ſhall have me if you will lament Evangelically after me.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You have good company in your lamenting after the Lord, though there be too too many vile Atheiſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched wretches that ſay to God, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, cauſe the holy one to ceaſe from the midſt of us,</hi> yet there are mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Zion</hi> that are very importunatly crying and lamenting after the Lord, with all their might ſeeking to fetch back the Ark: Though they be few compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and though deſpiſed, and poſſibly hid in corners, and as little taken notice of as thoſe ſeven thouſand in <hi>Elijah's</hi> days,

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59151:79"/>There is a communion of Saints in prayer, though unknown to each other: And I can ſay it, for your incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Oh ye praying mourning Souls, that you are not alone, God hath thouſands in theſe Nations that have been hard at it many years, and preſent circumſtances do quicken their crys; Our danger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth our pangs, and thoſe advance our crys; be not diſcouraged, you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſiſtants; A threefold cord is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily broken, God hath ſome Children to cry after him from all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and though many of the old ſtock of weeping Souls are worn out, yet ſome wreſtling young ones are planted in their room, ſome begotten in the bonds of the Goſpel, for the word of God is not bound, though Embaſſadors be. <hi>Zion</hi> hath been built in this troublous time. And I think it may be truly ſaid, that as the Ark hath more viſible followers, ſo more ſincere la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters after it, then when it was taken out of its publick ſtation, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> of old ſaid, ſo it muſt be acknowledged that the more God's field is cut, the more graſs Springs up.</p>
            <p n="7">7. God hath a dear and tender reſpect to ſuch as lament after him for the Arks ſake, and will do them good upon that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59151:80"/>very account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.6. <hi>pray for the peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they ſhall proſper that love thee.</hi> They ſhall not only proſper and prevail for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but God will proſper them in other reſpects, in their graces, in comforts, yea oft in worldly concerns: A publick Spirit is a perſonal gainer; God never ſuffers ſuch to be loſers by him, that deny themſelves for him, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I will gather them that are ſorrowful, for the ſolemn Aſſembly, who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.22.</note> Such as ſtudy Gods intereſt, have the Lord to ſtudy their intereſt? If we put our ſhoulder to bear his burden, he will bear both us and ours. <hi>Conſider now,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>from this day and upward from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Temple was laid, conſider it,—From this day will I bleſs you, Hagg.</hi> 2.18, 19. How much doth God value and how fully doth he reward an eſteem for his Worſhip! God builds their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that have but a good will to build his houſe; As in <hi>David:</hi> Thus our Lord bids us prove him by our obedience, and ſee if he will not open the windows of Heaven and pour down a bleſſing, <hi>Mal.</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:59151:80"/>3.10, 11, 12. Who would not then own and lay to heart <hi>Zions</hi> caſe?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Lamented for Ark and Ordinances will be the ſweeteſt and moſt profitable when returned and injoyed. None will ſo gladly welcome the Ark, &amp; improve it as they that moſt deeply laid to heart its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval. Such will be like hungry ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, lay to hard when they can get to this. Soul-refreſhing food; a thirſty Perſon will prize and improve a little Water: <hi>David</hi> never ſo gredily longed for God's Preſence and Ordinances, as when he was in a dry and thirſty land where no water was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>The full ſtomach loaths the honey-comb,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1.</note> but to the hungry Soul every bitter thing is Sweet:</hi> Oh what pantings? As the Hart chaſed panteth for Water-Brooks! You'l gain more days preaching then, then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in many days.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Souls that lament after the Lord ſhall injoy him immediately in the end: in Heaven you ſhall need no Ordinances, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22. I ſaw no Temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it,
<note place="margin">Rev. 22.4. 1 Cor. 13.12. 1 Joh. 3.2.</note> for you ſhall ſee his face immediatly and no more through a Glaſs darkly, yea you ſhall ſee him as he is, which cannot but felicitate Souls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59151:81"/>therefore its called the <hi>Beatifical viſion.</hi> Oh what a day will that be? You ſhall not then need to fear any diſturbance from men nor Devils, but his Servants ſhall Serve him, and his name ſhall be in their foreheads; There's no more skulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ing into corners, nor meeting in the night for fear of mens Laws, and perſecution. Yea the more you lamented after the Lord and his Ark the more ſhall you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your joy in the Lord: The more your ſorrows abound, the more will your comfort abound; The lower the Ebb, the higher the Tide: You that loved <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be glad with her, yea, you ſhall rejoyce for joy with her, all ye that mourned for her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.10.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In the mean time God himſelf will ſupply the want of Ordinances; the great God will be a little Sanctuary in the want of other means of Worſhip;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 11.16.1 Sam. 30.6. Hab. 3.16.</note> he himſelf will ſupply that defect. <hi>David</hi> could incourage himſelf in the Lord his God; <hi>Habakkuk</hi> rejoyce in the Lord, when deſtitute of outward comforts, yea and in the abſence of external Priviledges. What want you from Ordinances, that the Alſufficient God cannot ſupply you with? light, love, warmth, ſtrength, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of doubts, ſatisfaction of your
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59151:81"/>hearts; God is all in all, and all without all theſe helps. O Friends! (though you may not chuſe to be without means of Grace, becauſe they are God's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted waies of conveying himſelf to us here, yet) you muſt be content to be without them, when Providence cuts you ſhort of them, and ſay in this caſe as holy <hi>David,</hi> (with which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Subject,) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. <hi>Carry back the Ark of God into the City, if I ſhall find favour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it and his habitation; but if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee, behold, here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi>
