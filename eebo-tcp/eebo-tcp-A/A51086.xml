            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Modeſt Anſwer To a Printed Pamphlet, Intituled, A SPEECH Lately made by a NOBLE PEER OF THE REALM.</head>
            <p>JUſt and Worthy (with all Commendations to be Recorded to Poſterity) are the Endeavors of the Honourable Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and many other true Patriots, to deliver this, and ſucceeding Ages, from that unſupportable Yoke of Slavery, which that State-Policy call'd <hi>Popery,</hi> impoſes on all its <hi>Devoto's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not at all queſtion but this was the main Deſign of a Speech lately made by a <hi>Noble Peer</hi> of the Realm: Yet if I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to ſhew that the means which he adviſeth are ineffectual to obtain this End, I hope I ſhall not be accounted <hi>a Papiſt in Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,</hi> or guilty of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> ſince the <hi>Noble Peer</hi> hath been pleaſed to make this Challenge, 
  <q rend="margQuotes">If any can anſwer or oppoſe Reaſon to what I ſay, I beg they would do it:</q> 
Wherefore, to gratifie this <hi>Noble Peer's</hi> deſire, I (in all humility) offer to ſome of his Propoſitions, a few modeſt Anſwers.</p>
            <p>Truly I think the <hi>Noble Peer</hi> is very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in the Preſident of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, (whom he is pleaſed to ſtile a Wiſe and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Prince;) and yet in this Reign it was, that <hi>Fire and Fagot</hi> were firſt uſed againſt <hi>Diſſentérs in Religion</hi>: But however, the <hi>Chronicles</hi> we (of the meaneſt Rank) uſe, do not afford this Preſident. <hi>Baker</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tells us, <hi>That he connived at the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dukes of</hi> Aumarle <hi>and</hi> Exeter, The one was accuſed for ſpeaking againſt his Title to the Crown; the other for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his Father: And he adds the Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe he had profeſſed Enemies enough, and had no mind to make ſuch of them, who (at the leaſt) pretended to be his Friends</hi>:</p>
            <p>But to grant what the <hi>Noble Peer</hi> deſireth:</p>
            <p>Was there ever any Prince ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that hath oftner changed his Miniſters of State, than our preſent Gracious King? And this ſome men knew to their ſorrow, who, when they were at the Helm, thought it very unreaſonable that every Month ſhould produce new Stateſmen; For by this method before any one could underſtand the <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> and able to give Counſel, he ſhall be ſent diſcontented into the Countrey; and the ill conſequences of diſcontented Stateſmen, who is ignorant of?</p>
            <p>After our <hi>Noble Peer</hi> hath paſt a very wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſmart Reflection on the <hi>Ladies at Court,</hi> he paſſes to the next Paragraph, where we have theſe words,
  <q rend="margQuotes">We muſt neither have Popiſh Wife—nor any new Convert.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What is meant by the firſt I cannot gueſs, unleſs with our New State-Officers, we are to have a New Model of Religion; If by <hi>New Converts</hi> be underſtood ſuch, who abominating the Superſtition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are come over to our Church; I much wonder this <hi>Noble Peer,</hi> who is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great Patron of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> ſhould forget what great Influence, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Honour and Rewards (in this Life) have upon the minds of men, and how hard a thing it is to perſuade a man to forſake theſe, though it was to embrace a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, where by one Party he is diſeſteemed, diſreſpected by his Prince; by the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be loaded (though falſly) with the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominies of an Apoſtate; Schiſmatick, and what not? Is this the way to gain Converts to the true <hi>Proteſtant Catholick Religion?</hi> That is, The Religion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as at preſent it is Eſtabliſhed by Law.</p>
