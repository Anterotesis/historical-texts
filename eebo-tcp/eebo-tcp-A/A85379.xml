         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To this end, there was a ſtrong party of Horſe went out from Northwich upon Satturday night laſt, upon their firſt comming there, who gave them an Alarm. The next day being the Sabbath, could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155778:3"/>
not be obſerved, it being the worke of the whole day to prepare for our defence, and how to annoy our enemy; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom I went out upon Sunday in the afternoone, with betwixt two and three Troops of horſe, and betwixt two and three Companies of Dragooners, who went neere to Middlewich and gave them an Alarm there; but without any intention to aſſault them in their quarters, they being very ſtrong in Foot, and well armed, and we had no Foot at all then there, our greateſt care being to preſerve the Country from plundring, and let the enemy know we durſt looke them in the face, and come even to the very doore. This evening, March the 13. being Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, we reſolved and concluded to meet the Nampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Forces the next morning, who were appointed to come unto us by ſix of the clock in the morning: But we were in skirmiſhing and fight neere foure houres before they came in to our aſſiſtance; during which time they playd full upon us with their Cannon, but without any ſucceſſe at all, there being onely one or two men hurt, but not mortall. During which time our Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers (whereof we had not above 200 Muſqueteers, our greateſt force of Foot being at Namptwich) beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves very gallantly, and made good three paſſages, and kept the enemy in play, till the Nampt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Forces came in to our aſſiſtance, who came on ſo reſolutely, and with ſuch undauntedneſſe of ſpirit, even to the amazement and admiration of the enemy, whom they beat from their works, and from their Cannon. And as they entred one end of the Town, our Souldiers entred the other end with no leſſe courage and reſolution.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE hold it convenient to give you a true Relation of the paſſages concerning the Kings Forces, and their appearing againſt the Towne. On Saturday laſt they marched from <hi>Oxford</hi> and thoſe parts, and on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the greateſt part of them came to <hi>Thame:</hi> on Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day all their forces were drawn neer to this Town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one mile and two miles of the place, and ſhewed as if they would have fallen upon us that day, but they ſpent that day in viewing of the Town, where to make their beſt aſſault, and interpoſing betwixt us and the Chiltein parts of our Countrey, to hinder their aſſiſtance of us, where we had ſeverall skirmiſhes without any loſſe; The Earl of <hi>Carnarvan</hi> commanded a great body of horſe, and marched all Sunday night to <hi>Wendover,</hi> where he hoped to have taken one of our Troops of horſe, which we had drawn thence ſome few hours before, but they plundered that Town, and the adjacent towns, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many outrages beſides as we are informed. On Munday night the whole forces quartered within a mile or two of this Town, and the next morning their horſe drew towards us, almoſt within Cannon-ſhott, and wee expected every houre when they would fall upon the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155778:4"/>
Town, and our horſe drew into the field towards them, and the forlorn hopes fired one upon another often, but they being much too ſtrong in horſe for us, we drew our horſe into the Town, preparing for their aſſault, but whilſt we looked for their approach, they drew away towards evening on Tueſday, and in ſtead of Souldiers turned Sheep-ſtealers, for they have plundered all the Towns hereabouts, of all their goods and houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff; they have taken and driven away all their Horſes, Beaſts and Sheep, and in this iniquity have herein onely dealt equally, that they have not ſpared thoſe who are accounted their own friends: they ſpoiled and tore in pieces the inſide of divers fair houſes, and beſides the corn they ſpent upon their Horſes, they ſpoiled and ſpilt very much upon the ground, and threw it about the fields, and what goods they could not carry away, they cut in pieces, and threw about the fields and high-wayes as they went; they have not onely taken away the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which ſhould now plow our grounds for ſeed, but they have cut in pieces their Horſe-harneſſes, and things belonging to the plough, as if they meant to bring the Kingdom to deſtruction in an inſtant. And we muſt be bold to ſignifie unto you that theſe cruelties are not acted by mean ones; for the Commanders herein, as we are informed, were, Generall <hi>Ruthin,</hi> the Princes <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> Lord <hi>Grandiſon,</hi> Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Gerrard,</hi> with many others of their great ones; the Forces they came with, were all they could get together, not leaving men enough to relieve their Guard in <hi>Oxford;</hi> their Forces were, as we collect by all our diſcoveries, about Six thouſand, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured us in their thoughts before they came neer us;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155778:5"/>
but God diſcouraged them from aſſaulting us, which if they had done, they would have found it a hot ſervice; for our ſouldiers and Country-men within the Towne were very bravely reſolved to defend the place, though much inferiour to them in number, beſides the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſtrength ſent unto us by his Excellency the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> whoſe care of us, and conſideration of the State, in ſecuring this place, is never to be forgotten; for his Forces came to us much ſooner than we could expect; and had the enemy ſtayed but few hours longer, we had given them battell in the field: But it was not Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the troubles of the time ſhould ſo end, as yet we muſt expect his further pleaſure.
