            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Mortality</hi> of the last

the <hi>Corruption</hi> of one, shu'd be the
<hi>Generation</hi> of another.</p>
            <p>I make them <hi>short,</hi> because I would
have them read; and <hi>easie,</hi> because
I'd have them understood; and writ them
onely for mine own, and my Friends
Recreation; not for the <hi>Criticks</hi>
nor <hi>Vulgar;</hi> for those who are <hi>too
wise,</hi> or who are not <hi>wise enough:</hi>
And as I writ them, so I publish them
onely for my <hi>Friends,</hi> and shu'd be sorry

other.</p>

whatsoever was wanting else, to
render it every waies accomplisht, when
<hi>Lucina</hi> presently was dispatcht to earth,
to assist at the nativitie of this illustrious
Child, whom <hi>Iupiter</hi> was pleas'd parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to honour, by breathing into
it a spirit of his divinest air, (For
though all, he inspires be celestial and

those whom he favours most, mean time

other Ladies (for the most part) are
all outside, and nothing else, and when
you have seen but that you have seen

soul and mind, nor could an Angel in
a mortal body, be more spiritual then
she, nor have more interior graces and
perfections.</p>
            <p>For her exterior then I will only
say that <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> never agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
better, 'ith composition of any one,
giving her a beautious mind in a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

her as <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>fair,</hi> to see (when she sees
any one in misery,) how tender and

            <p>Nor has <hi>Fortune</hi> been wanting to
make her as <hi>great,</hi> as <hi>fair,</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> none
ever better deserving it, by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her mind, nor comporting better
with all states and conditions, whilst
none ever carryed it higher in <hi>adversity</hi>
nor lower, and more humbly in <hi>prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
so counterpoising either, within
her self, when others are all without
themselves, or too much deprest with
the one, or elated with the other. To
which supream heighth of wisdom, since
she could not attain, without as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream

            <p>For which, I need only remit

as little derogate from others, as mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

               <hi>ALmighty God,</hi> having blest you
with such a son, as a more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Nature can hardly be: you do
wisesly, and like a pious mother indeed,
to take care betimes of his Education,
without which Parents do but half their
duty, and leave with all the better half
undone; for <hi>Education</hi> is not only a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Nature, but also a perfectioning
of the first, and that which whilst their
birth makes them only children, does
make them <hi>men.</hi> You are to consider
then how that mother does nothing,
who only brings children into the
world, unless she takes care they should
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40607:20"/>
live well, whilst they are there, by
which she makes both her self and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
happy, for a good child is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of the mother, and a good life the
happiness of the child.</p>
            <p>This being so, if you but examine
well, what 'tis that makes that almost
all our youth now adaies, have so little
sence of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> you will
find that 'tis only because they are not
traind up enough in the principles of
<hi>either,</hi> whilst they are young.</p>
            <p>For the Age proper for their <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
being chiefly their first fifteen
<hi>years,</hi> or their <hi>Infancy, Childhood,</hi> and
<hi>Adolescence,</hi> or <hi>Youth;</hi> in which the main
business ought to be, the removing of
<hi>Vice, Error</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> from their
<hi>souls</hi> and <hi>minds.</hi> You shall find that
whilst their Parents take care only of
the two <hi>last;</hi> the first which ought to be
the <hi>principle</hi> is wholly neglected by <hi>them</hi>
&amp; left undone: They never considering
that <hi>man</hi> is like a <hi>Garden,</hi> where it is

with them.</p>

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
who give them suck, As soon as they
arive unto the second year, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
should provide them of some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<hi>Governant,</hi> who may carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their natural inclinations, either
to <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> and cherish the one, and
correct the other, as they shall see occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Some may say now; this is too soon to
begin with them, and that children can
apprehend nothing yet: But they who
say so, rather want apprehension; For
when is the time <hi>(I pray)</hi> to bow and
bend a <hi>Tree,</hi> to rectifie it and make it
st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ait? Or make a <hi>Garment</hi> take a good
fold or pleyt, but when it is first put on?
And for their apprehensions of things
we see, they can be affraid of <hi>Bug-bears;</hi>
rejoyce when you tell them they shall
have somewhat they are delighted with,
and love those who give it them: Which
being so, why may they not at those
years be taught to fear <hi>vice,</hi> to delight
in <hi>vertue,</hi> and to love <hi>God?</hi> if they
were but prudently represented to their
imaginations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40607:21"/>
Let them be taught then to fear no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bug-bear</hi> but <hi>vice,</hi> (especially that
which they shall see them most inclin'd
unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and when they see them delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with any thing, either of <hi>fair</hi> or
<hi>sweet</hi> &amp;c. Let them tell them 'tis <hi>God</hi>
who gives and sends it them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
cry out, Oh <hi>how Good!</hi> How <hi>fair,</hi>
how <hi>sweet</hi> is <hi>God!</hi> &amp;c. By which
means they shall imprint in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
minds, a dear and affectionate love
of him; after which it would be easy to
to make them do whatsoever they shall
understand to be most pleasing to him,
and abstain from doing whatsoever
may be displeasing to him on the
contrary, under which notions they
may represent both <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>vices</hi>
to them as they shall see occasion.
This if their first <hi>Tutors</hi> or <hi>Governants</hi>
would but do; Their second <hi>Tutors</hi> or
<hi>preceptors</hi> would more easily do the rest:
of whom I will only say that you are to
chuse him more for <hi>prudence</hi> then for
<hi>learning;</hi> more a <hi>Gentleman</hi> then a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi>
and one that has more studyed <hi>men</hi>
then <hi>Books.</hi> Mean time let him so season
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40607:21"/>
what he teaches him with sweetness,
(the common bait of children) as so
he may be delighted with learning it.</p>
            <p>Above all, let him be a <hi>Religious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man</hi> for he is to inform his manners
as well as his understanding; and more
<hi>souls</hi> for want of <hi>good Tutors,</hi> then Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for want of <hi>good Midwives,</hi> in these
latter <hi>Times</hi> have perished and been cast
away.</p>
            <p>For the ordering his studies in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
I say nothing more, But let his
Rule be <hi>ne quid nimis</hi> to study nothing
too much, for learning consisting either
in <hi>words</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> of which the first has
no depth, and the last no bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to study

but condenses the thought which
is only for your melancholy School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
a <hi>Gentlemans</hi> thoughts should be

they be not so to <hi>God,</hi> in whom (as the

            </p>
            <p>Neither let any imagine that this sort

Sir C. B.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the choice of a VVife.</head>
            <p>OF all worldly things, the choice
of a wife is that which requires
the longest deliberation: for <hi>diu deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berandum
est quod statuendum est semel.</hi>
We are long to deliberate of that which
we can onely choose but once: and
and when all's done, <hi>Fortune</hi> will have
a main hand in it: or to speak more
Religiously, <hi>Almighty-God.</hi> Whence
'tis said, that Marriages are made in
Heaven. 'Tis the part of a Wise man
then, to leave as little in it to <hi>Fortune</hi>
as he can; and of a Religious, as much
as he can unto <hi>Almighty God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst all the requisits of Marriage,
<hi>Beauty</hi> is the most fragile, and deceives
the expectation most, both because the
one expects to find the same Adoration
when a Wife, as when she was a Mrs
and t'other finds not their Wives such
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40607:23"/>
               <hi>Goddesses</hi> when marryed, as they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
before they marryed them.</p>
            <p>To marry for <hi>Beauty</hi> onely, is to buy
a House onely for the outside, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering the Conveniences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and <hi>Age</hi> or a little sickness takes that
away and them, and there's an end of all
the delight you had. Whence 'tis no ill
distinction, that a woman exceeding
fair, is better for a Mrs. then a Wife,
If she be but moderately handsome it is
enough, so the rest be supplyed by the
<hi>Beauty</hi> of the mind; the one being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the pleasure of the first day, tother
of all your life.</p>
            <p>Of all things, Complacency is the best
Cyment of affection, and similitude of
humour and disposition; for <hi>similis si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili
gaudet,</hi> All Likes do love their
Like, and hate the contrary; unless
perhaps some humours in them, may be
too predominant; and then a little of
the contrary would be a good Allay,
as Mirth to Melancholly, or a placid
or Patient humour, to a Harsh or Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick
disposition.</p>
            <p>With handsomness of Body, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40607:24"/>
good disposition of mind, the <hi>Goods</hi> of
Fortune make no ill composition, so
they be not the principal ingredient, for
so <hi>Love,</hi> would wholly degenerate into
<hi>interest,</hi> and men would look on their
wives no otherwise then <hi>Farmers,</hi> on
their Cattel, only considering how much
they are worth in the <hi>Market</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else.</p>
            <p>I need not give you a <hi>Caveat</hi> not to
marry with any of condition much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
your self, for you are too wise I
know to be fool'd by any such fond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
nor is there any danger of your
marrying much above your self, since we
have few nobility so high, into which a
<hi>Gentleman</hi> of your birth and fortune
may not aspire to match without ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>This is all <hi>Sir</hi> that ocurs to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

'tis that, which <hi>humanity</hi> binds us

               <p>It were a blessed life, f the wheels

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40607:29"/>

their Gallants come fawning and fiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

whilst they bark and bite at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

               <p>This, if her husband knows not,
'tis an unpardonable fault, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in him; if he does, 'twere no
compliment, nor fondness in him, but
a Just esteem of his own Happiness,
to say as often as he sees her, <hi>O my

It is a <hi>Mirrour,</hi> representing passed

of affairs in <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>Heroick Persons</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is not like <hi>Philosophy,</hi> to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

nothing differs from an <hi>Epitome;</hi>) nor
like <hi>Poetry,</hi> nor <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> all garnished

and <hi>Orations;</hi> (the one being a
cloathing too plain and simple, the other
too light and flaunting, for the dignity
and gravity of <hi>History:</hi>) But it is rather
to be represented like a <hi>Grave Matron,</hi>
rich, not gawdy; fashionable, not fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical;

            <p>To write of Actions only, differs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

were counted <hi>Prophets;</hi> and as <hi>Poetry</hi>
was the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Gods,</hi> so <hi>Musick</hi>
was the <hi>Accent</hi> in which they spoke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Musick</hi> was then but simple, and had
no more variety in <hi>Singing,</hi> then had
the <hi>Voice</hi> in speaking; it being only an

a speaking <hi>Harmony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst they remain'd thus united, all
those miracles were effected by them, as

miracles and wonders since they were

            <p>That which first separated them, was,

            <head>OF NOBLE
WOMEN.</head>
            <p>I Know not under what <hi>Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
I was born, that it has alwayes
been my <hi>Fortune</hi> to live amongst
the best and noblest of <hi>woman-kind;</hi>
but I am sure, she'as been a happy and
<hi>fortunate</hi> one for me; for there I have
seen nothing but <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi>
there as in a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> I have liv'd,
protected from the <hi>Vices</hi> of the Time;
and there (if any where) I have found
that saying true, That if <hi>vertue</hi> could be
seen with mortal eyes 'twould ravish all
with <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deny not, but <hi>vertue</hi> may likewise be
found 'mongst <hi>men,</hi> but 'tis an <hi>Austere</hi> and
<hi>Rigid</hi> one, not much different from that
which you shall find in <hi>Cells,</hi> and <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
rather deterring with its <hi>rigour</hi> and
<hi>austerity,</hi> then any ways attracting with
<hi>sweetness</hi> and <hi>gentleness;</hi> besides, 'tis a
quarrellous and contentious one, that
would force every one to its opinion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40607:41"/>
and for my part, like him in the <hi>Fable,</hi>
if the <hi>Sun</hi> by its <hi>sweetness</hi> and <hi>Gentleness</hi>
cannot do it, the <hi>wind</hi> certainly by
<hi>Rufling</hi> and <hi>blustering,</hi> never shall.</p>
            <p>Now amongst them, (on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
you find nothing but <hi>sweetness</hi> and
<hi>gentleness,</hi> accompanied with such aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Gravity,</hi> as whilst they
attract to a certain distance, they
there suspend you with <hi>Reverence</hi> and
<hi>Admiration;</hi> nor needs there any frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
looks to do it, since as one said well,
<hi>Beauty</hi> is <hi>Regnum sine satellitio,</hi> a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that needs no force to guard it: if
it guard not it self, all other force is vain;
and frowning and ill looks will never
do it. With good Reason then, they
make all <hi>vertus</hi> of the Feminine Sex,
since <hi>vertue</hi> in a fair Body, as <hi>Virgil</hi> says,
is alwayes most grateful and becoming;
and it implies a certain Congruity, that
the richest <hi>Iewels</hi> shu'd be conserv'd in
the fairest <hi>Cabinets;</hi> besides, there is a
kind of necessity, as well for nobility
of <hi>Form,</hi> as <hi>bloud;</hi> To be <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Vertuous,</hi> not to degenerate from the
<hi>stock</hi> and <hi>origine</hi> from whence they
came.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40607:42"/>
This Testimony then, I will give of
the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Them,</hi> That I never saw
greater <hi>Innocence,</hi> higher <hi>Honour,</hi> more
<hi>Vertue,</hi> nor truer <hi>Chearfulness</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: and above all, none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

which, all the rest would easily fall
to ruine, and decay, like buildings, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their foundation. Mean time, I deny
not, but there are many to be found who
are not so; but then they are no

            <p>WHen any hide their <hi>Vices,</hi> I shall
never seek to discover them; and
a well-palliated <hi>Vice,</hi> shall pass for <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>

<hi>glory</hi> in them, and discover them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they must pardon me, if I take

be ashamed of; and seek <hi>Fame</hi> from that,
which would be anothers <hi>Infamy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are few so mad, to <hi>Glory</hi> in
their <hi>Corporal</hi> infirmities; and if they
do, their <hi>Cures</hi> may well be dispaired of;
yet thât these do in their <hi>spiritual</hi> ones,
and never perceive how miserable they
are, nor know they the whilst, what
harm they do to others: for to <hi>do</hi> ill

               </gap>y) goes no farther then
ones self; but to <hi>speak</hi> of it, is a <hi>spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sin,</hi> and one knows not how far it
goes: 'tis like <hi>oyle,</hi> which easily insinuates
self into others minds, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40607:43"/>
so spreads and dilates it self, as the
stain of it can ne're be wholly taken out
again.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Weapon-salve</hi> cures at distance,
so do those <hi>discourses</hi> wound, and they
raise up more <hi>Spirits</hi> with them, like
ignorant <hi>Conjurers,</hi> then they can lay
again.</p>
            <p>Amongst the rest, <hi>lascivious</hi> speeches
are the most dangerous of all, for such
is mans proneness to <hi>lust</hi> and the <hi>Lubrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of his mind; as 'tis well compared
to <hi>Ice</hi> about the brink of some <hi>precipice,</hi>
which of it self is so <hi>slippery,</hi> as they can
hardly abstain from falling in; but when
you add the <hi>Impulse</hi> of others, 'tis in a
manner impossible.</p>
            <p>Such then I shall avoid, as publick
<hi>Impoysoners,</hi> or as those infected with
the <hi>Plague,</hi> who long to communicate
their contagion to others; and there is
nothing more infectious, then such mens
company.</p>
            <p>Above all, I can least suffer them, when
they talk profanely of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
and 'tis but the duty of every
<hi>Christian</hi> to reprehend them for it; for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40607:43"/>
as he shu'd be counted no good subject,
who could hear the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>State</hi> ill
spoken of; so shu'd he be no good <hi>chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
who could hear the like of <hi>God</hi>
and of <hi>Religion;</hi> and this is that which
renders the state of such as these more
desperate and deplorable, and wholly
exempts them from the General pardon
of other sinners; for if he who <hi>excuses</hi>
his fault, redoubles it, he certainly who
<hi>Glories</hi> in it, renders it a hundred times
more <hi>inexcusable</hi> then before; for by the
first, he only <hi>offends God;</hi> but by this he
<hi>Braves</hi> him too; and the first may be
repented of, and so forgiven; but in
this they are so far from repenting it,
and consequently of being forgiven, as
they declare a will of committing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

then he, who durst be damn'd:</hi> And though
we are not lightly to judge so of any

<hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>Irreligious,</hi> 'tis much to be
feared, that they are in a damnable state;
for there are two things conducing to

               </gap>alvation, a <hi>Good Life,</hi> and <hi>Good Religion;</hi>
and the one without the other, nothing
avails us, (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayes) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the attaining of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40607:44"/>
For the <hi>first,</hi> our Rule is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>
of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> which
whosoever transgresses, is in danger of
damnation. For the <hi>second,</hi> the <hi>Evangil</hi>
of our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> tells us, that out of
his <hi>Church,</hi> there is no Salvation.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>first</hi> there is no doubt; since e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the very <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves by the
only light of <hi>Nature,</hi> held absolutely
necessary for a <hi>Good Life,</hi> the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of all that <hi>God</hi> has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us: for the <hi>second,</hi> there is much
doubt even amongst <hi>Christians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Some holding they may be sav'd
in all Religions, as well <hi>Christian,</hi> as <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
or <hi>Pagan,</hi> &amp;c. And if so, what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our <hi>Saviour</hi> to have come into the
world to teach us a new <hi>Religion,</hi> since
there were old <hi>Religions</hi> enow in the
world before?</p>
            <p>Others again are of opinion, That in
all <hi>Christian Religions</hi> they may be sav'd,
at least; and if so, what needed the <hi>Holy
Scripture</hi> so nicely to distinguish betwixt
the <hi>True Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Herisies,</hi>
pronouncing all <hi>Hereticks</hi> infallibly
damned, or such as adher'd to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40607:45"/>
opinions, against the Generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ones of the <hi>Church?</hi> which being
so, <hi>Theotima,</hi> all who have any care of
their <hi>salvation,</hi> besides living well, are
to endeavour to follow the <hi>Religion</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
instituted by our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi>
and to insist on the foot-steps of the
ancient <hi>Christians</hi> to find it out; which
however obscur'd by length of time,
may yet by those who diligently seek,
be easily discovered.</p>
            <p>Since then our <hi>Saviour</hi> has said, that
<hi>Seducers</hi> should come, but that his
<hi>Church</hi> should never fail; Let us not
hearken to these new start-up <hi>Teachers,</hi>
crying out, here is <hi>Christ,</hi> and there is
<hi>Christ,</hi> so long, till they make many
doubt whether there be any <hi>Christ</hi> or no;
which is all the fruit of their <hi>new Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines,</hi>
to make people doubt of the <hi>old,</hi>
and be certain of <hi>nothing;</hi> nor will there
ever be an end of them, till they return
into the <hi>old</hi> again: For if it be lawful for
any <hi>man</hi> to begin a new Religion, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will presently start up, and cry,
<hi>Why not I, as well as he?</hi> and so they will
at last increase to Infinite. As we tender

then our salvation, <hi>Theotima,</hi> let us hold
firm unto the <hi>old,</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi>
himself has instituted and taught us, who
sayes of himself, That he is the <hi>Way,</hi> the
<hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Life;</hi> the <hi>Way,</hi> in which
we cannot err; the <hi>Truth,</hi> by which we

            <p>YOu are the first, <hi>Theotima,</hi> who

too much discouraged before, by the
<hi>Libertines</hi> of the <hi>Time,</hi> who make no

Tongue? when I shall find <hi>opportunity,</hi> I
shall not be wanting to it; but for <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,</hi>
this is not a <hi>Time</hi> nor <hi>Place.</hi> There
are <hi>spiritual Books</hi> enow already, unless
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40607:46"/>
they were better followed; and enow of
<hi>Religion,</hi> unless they were better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
Mean time, I thank you for the
good opinion you have of me, to think
me capable of so good a work; whilst
some are so <hi>scrupulous,</hi> as they should
think <hi>themselves</hi> damned, if they should
but <hi>laugh;</hi> and have so little scruple on
t'other side, as to think <hi>me</hi> little better,
because I am not as <hi>melancholly</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>I thank <hi>God,</hi> I have always been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

constant to my first <hi>principles,</hi> as you will
see by these <hi>pieces</hi> which I send you here;
which though they are not so <hi>spiritual</hi>
as you desire, tend towards it, yet at
least, in a <hi>moral</hi> way; and credit me, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima,</hi>
We have as much need now of
