            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

in my prayers to God, for the increaſe and continuance of Gods graces beſtowed vpon your Honour, for the good of our Church and Common-wealth: And (I hope) you haue learned, that continuance in well-doing, getteth the greateſt praiſe and prize with God, and all good men: And my particular prayer ſhall be, that ſtill you may exceede your ſelfe, in the performance of all Chriſtian duties, to God, our Prince, and Countrey; euer tending to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which leadeth to eternall life. Moreouer, let your Honour be throughly perſwaded, that God will haue all his children humbled here, before they can aſpire to the top of the higheſt glory (which they hope for) hereafter; and that the way hereunto is rightly to know our ſelues by our fraile condition and mortall eſtate. May it pleaſe you therefore (with other ſorts and rancks of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) to take ſome view thereof in this Diſcourſe: Feare not (Honourable Sir) to read ſome lines thereof at your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the receipt whereof (I doubt not) will proue more wholſome then toothſome to the fleſh, which ſtill would make vs play the Gyants againſt our God; yet mortified it muſt be in ſome meaſure: For as raw fleſh is not fit for the ſtomacke; no more are vnmortified men for God.

                     <p>Mans ſoule by creation, had Reaſon and Will, (as it <label type="milestone">

Thus God doth humble all his creatures to exalt himſelfe, euen to teach them this; not to goe from him of whom they had and haue their goodneſſe, nor to truſt vnto themſelues, though by creation good, yet ſubiect to decline.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi> then, although he was created in goodneſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> yet was he made but changeably good: for ſuch was the goodneſſe and inclination of his will to obey God, as might be altered and changed by force of temptation. The cauſe of this mutability was, that the creature righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by creation, may remaine eternally, and conſtantly righteous; two helpes or fauours of God are neceſſarily required: Firſt a power to perſeuere in goodneſſe; for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13172:22"/>
without this power the creature of it ſelfe ceaſeth to be good: the ſecond is, an act or deede, and that is the will to perſeuere, or perſeuerance itſelfe: This alſo is requiſite with the former;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> for God giues not onely the power, but alſo the will and deede: and the creature doth not the good which it can doe, vnleſſe God cauſe it to doe the ſaid good; both which helpes the good Angels haue, and therefore keepe them ſtanding: now <hi>Adam</hi> receiued the firſt of God, but not the ſecond; for beſides the goodneſſe of his will, he receiued of God a power conſtantly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere in goodneſſe, if he would: yet the act of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance was left to the choiſe and liberty of his owne will.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> In nature it ſelfe, this truth appeareth. God we know creates the eye, and puts into it the faculty of ſeeing; yet withall he addes to the eye neceſſary helpes by the light of the Sunne; but for the act of ſeeing, it is left to mans choiſe, for he may ſee if he will, or if he pleaſe he may ſhut his eyes. Againe, the Phyſition by Art procures an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: this done, he prouides conuenient foode; yet for all this, the patient may eate if he will, or otherwiſe may abſtaine.</p>

                        </note> that he receiued ſufficient for the perfection of his nature: that is, for the full obedience of the will of God, and for the attaining of euerlaſting happineſſe, if he would not haue bin wanting to himſelf, but he receiued not ſufficient grace, which might cauſe the immutability of his nature; neither was it of neceſſitie to be giuen (as I haue already ſhewed) to a creature. A Goldſmith intends to make a Iewell of ſingular price and value, he compounds it of gold, pearles and precious ſtones; when hee hath brought it to perfection, he doth not put this propertie to it, that if it fall, it ſhall not be bruiſed or broken. Now God created <hi>Adam</hi> in all perfection, and gaue him power and abilitie to continue in the ſame, if he would: yet did
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13172:22"/>
he not put vnto his nature this condition, that it ſhould be vnchangeable, when it ſhould be aſſayled by the force of outward temptation.</p>
                     <p>By this we ſee the weakeneſſe of the excellenteſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> in it ſelfe, without the grace of God. <hi>Adam</hi> could fall of himſelfe, but he could not ſtand or riſe againe: he could not auoide the leaſt aſſault of euill, no further then he was helped by the grace of God. We are to God as the ſicke man to his keeper, who ſaith, Take me vp and I will riſe, hold me and I will ſtand, helpe me and I will goe, &amp;c. Which muſt make vs to renounce our ſelues, and cleaue to God, wholly depending vpon his gratious prouidence and protection in all our actions and attempts. God (I confeſſe) could haue made our firſt parents of ſuch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable nature, that they could not poſſibly haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away, but it was not expedient that they ſhould be ſo made, becauſe then the obedience of man ſhould ſeeme to haue beene forced (as it were) and ſo not ſo acceptable vnto God.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> And albeit the body of man being made of duſt and earth, and himſelfe in reſpect of his ſubſtance and beginning was mortall: yet if he had preſerued the holy ſpirit of God within him, and giuen him the vpper hand, this ſpirit of God, which by ſinne he vanquiſhed, had farre ſurmounted all that was mortall in him.</p>
                     <p>And to end this point. As Sathan tempted <hi>Adam,</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> proue God a lyer, and to bring him to diſhonour,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.4.5.6.</note> and ſo became the inſtrument of mans damnation. So alſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> tempted himſelfe to taſte the fruit, which (as he thought) would make himſelfe as God. Now God moſt iuſtly ſuffered him to be tryed by this meanes, to make a way for his iuſtice, in the condemnation of the reprobate, and an entrance for his mercy in the ſaluation of his elect; for if there had beene no fall of man, God ſhould haue manifeſted himſelfe neither iuſt in condemning ſome, nor mercifull in ſauing others, which very much would haue obſcured his glory, and altogether depriued him of his praiſes amongſt the ſonnes of men, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>For although the iſſues thereof be in the hand of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and that it is his handmaide to execute his will (as hee alſo fetters the very Diuels themſelues,<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.20.</note> who can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him,) yet all the creatures that God did make, were very good; and as he is the very goodneſſe it ſelfe, ſo nothing but good proceedes from God. Since therefore Death and the Diuell be enemies to God and goodneſſe, deſtroyers, and corrupters of Nature, which he hath made; they are none of his creatures; hee is neyther their author, nor they of his off-ſpring. All things which were made, were made by the word,<note place="margin">Ioh 1.2.3.</note> and all things which were made by the word were exceeding good:<note place="margin">Gen. 1.31.</note> Euill then in generall, and Death in particular, which is euill in it ſelfe, were not made of God; and nothing can be good, without the ſoueraigne goodneſſe, which is God himſelfe. And whereas good is not, there is euill; which in effect is nothing elſe, but the priuation of good, as death is the want of life, and blindneſſe the want of ſight. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine) thou haſt not made death,</hi>

                     <p>And albeit that Death proceeded of the Diuell (as wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> haue heard) yet is it alſo attributed vnto man himſelfe, to leaue him inexcuſable, as plainely appeareth by <hi>Paul</hi> his compariſon betweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Adam.</hi>

Therefore wee may conclude, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Sathans enuy, lying, and other euill attempts, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all to mans deſtruction, hee may be called (as hee is indeede) the author of death: yet in regard of mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in tranſgreſſing Gods Law, Death may duely be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to himſelfe, although there were none other cauſe:

truſting too much to himſelfe, and leauing Gods Law, and not vſing, but rather abuſing, the meanes that God had giuen him, hee might haue fallen from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo intangled himſelfe in the ſnare of death and condemnation. So that in this ſuppoſition, the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the Diuell is not ſimply the cauſe of ſinne and death; the Diuell (as yet) not falling from God, but remayning in his nature an Angell of light. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath hee ſuch power (as I haue proued) ouer the will of man, to bowe it as hee liſteth, to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Therefore once againe to conclude this poynt, not onely the Diuell, but euen our firſt Parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, were the firſt cauſes of Sinne, and ſo of Death.</p>
                     <p>Although indeede (to ſpeake properly) an euill thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> hath no cauſe efficient, but rather deficient.<note place="margin">

Death is a priuation of life, onely hauing a name, and no nature or ſubſtance; God therefore made it not: for whatſoeuer hee made, had an eſſence, and a kinde of ſubſtance; Death there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being nothing but the abſence of life (as hunger the want of meate, thirſt of drinke, darkneſſe of light, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe of fruit, pouerty lacke of riches, &amp;c.) is nothing but in name, and ſo no creature of God. The deficient cauſe therefore of Sinne and Death, is the Diuell and Man: the Diuell by ſuggeſting, Man by obeying, both their actions not vrged of God, but voluntary of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Now how iuſtly Death was deriued from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his heires, will better appeare, by the ſucceeding inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſinne, to all his poſteritie and race. For God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his gifts and graces vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> vpon condition, that hee ſhould conuey them to his ſeede, if hee himſelfe by obedience would haue kept them, but God meant not to giue them to his poſteritie, if hee by his rebellion and vnthankfulneſſe ſhould raſhly looſe them, as hee did. <hi>Adam</hi> therefore falling from God, was iuſtly depriued of theſe his graces and gifts, and as a iuſt puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon his ſinne, did in equitie alſo depriue his whole poſteritie of the ſame. God could (I confeſſe) haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued <hi>Adams</hi> ſeed from his pollutions: but it made more for his glory, that it might be knowne what we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what by Grace.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Furthermore, as in murther, when the hand onely ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, the whole man offendeth; ſeeing that the Law ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth not the parts from the whole: ſo <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe to whole mankinde, though all ſucceeding natures are but part of him. For as a Riuer poyſoned in the Well-ſpring or fountaine, ſo was the nature of man altogether corrupted in our firſt Parents: corrupt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, corrupt Children. Hee was no priuate but a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon, and generall head of all mankinde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſinne was not proper onely to his indiuiduall ſubiect, but reall and hereditary to all his Sonnes: the euill and puniſhment, whereof (by reaſon of Nature and Law) ſucceeded by right to all his brood. For as the Law of God was giuen to <hi>Adam</hi> and his heyres, euen firſt and

laſt: ſo was the firſt breach thereof vniuerſall, and all in him did plucke and taſte the forbidden fruit, to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe woe.

As euery man dieth of his owne diſeaſe, and yet it may be he had the contagion from another, ſo for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, as it was imputed vnto vs, we die, and yet not for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne alone, but for our owne; for in vs there is the very matter of corruption.</p>
                     <p>It is all one as if a man vpon eaſie conditions ſhould gaine an high eſtate to him and his for euer, and yet ſhould wittingly and wilfully forfeite it againe to the owner; who would either moane the heire, or blame the giuer?

Thus Gods grace moſt iuſtly fayling the ſoule, it falleth to ſinne and declineth to naught; which proneneſſe of euill is our naturall ſickneſſe, which we call <hi>Originall ſinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that the ſoule of man is not now created with that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> ſtrength to perſeuere in goodneſſe, and reſiſtance of

euill, and other excellent graces which it ſhould haue had, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned: and albeit it be pure and vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as it proceedeth from God; yet is it no ſooner ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the body, but it is preſently polluted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen as the pureſt wine and beſt quinteſſence, when it is powred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a filthy pot, poyſoned and vnſauory, doth in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment looſe their naturall taſte and tallage: ſo doth the ſweet ſoule looſe her fragrant ſmell of grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo ſoone as it is ſent into this filthy veſſell, the body of ſinne.

                     <p>As man therefore in his nature conſiſteth of two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> parts, a humane body, and a diuine ſoule, which vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together make but one perſon; ſo there is a Death of the body, and a Death of the ſoule, and a death that is common both to body and ſoule. Death then in it ſelfe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13172:31"/>
is not onely a killing of the body, but alſo a ſlaying (as it were) of the ſoule;<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> not onely a ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, but a diuiſion and cutting off both of body and ſoule from God. Hence it appeareth that Death is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: firſt corporall, ſecondly ſpirituall, and thirdly a death common both to body and ſoule; and all theſe kindes due to all men (without exception) for all haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and are deſtitute of the grace of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 3 23.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This corporall Death (which I ſaid to be a ſeperation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the ſoule from the body) is likewiſe called the firſt Death: And ſpirituall Death (which is a renting of the ſoule from God,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.11.</note> who is the life thereof) is alſo called the ſecond Death: Both corporall and ſpirituall, or the Death that is common both to body and ſoule (which is an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diuorce both of body and ſoule from the vnion and fellowſhip of God) is alſo called eternall death, which is inchoatiue in this life <hi>(for they that beleeue not are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already)</hi> and compleate in the life to come,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.18.</note> when (after the reſurrection of the body) both body and ſoule ſhall euerlaſtingly be ſeperated from the Lord of life,<note place="margin">Acts 3.15.</note> which is alſo common to all, by reaſon of ſinne, yet not preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ouer Gods elect, iuſtified and freed from it by faith in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Death therefore in a word, is nothing elſe, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from life; the life of the body is the ſoule, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body is Death. And as the ſoule is the life of the body, ſo the life of the ſoule is God; therefore the going and departing of the ſoule from God (to cleaue to ſinne and Sathan) is the death alſo of the ſoule. The ſinfull ſoule dies not becauſe ſhe turnes to nothing, but in that ſhe dies to God, and liues to ſinne: for how can the ſubſtance thereof periſh, ſeeing it is the ſoule that giueth life; he that receaueth the ſoule receaueth life, and when the ſoule departeth, life flyeth away: The ſoule therefore is life, and how can it die, which is oppoſite ſo directly to death it ſelfe? For as Snow can endure no heate, but preſently it melteth, and as the Sun
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13172:32"/>
in his brightneſſe can receaue no obſcuritie, but diſſipates and diſpels all darkenes by his cleare and chriſtall beames: and as the coldeſt and hardeſt Ice (at the approach of the fire) is turned into water; ſo the ſoule (which is the fountaine of life, and authour of mouing) is not capable properly of death, nor can poſſibly die. Therefore the ſoule of man being immortall ought to be well ordered, and heeded, leaſt the Immortality to ioy, ſhould turne to Immortality of ſorrow. The death of the body is not the death of the ſoule, but onely a ſeuering or parting of the ſame from the body: As in taking of a Candle out of a Lanthorne, we may take the light out, and not put out the Candle, and the Lanthorne is full of darkeneſſe, by reaſon of the light remoued, yet the Candle caſteth her light more cleare and bright: euen ſo, the ſoule departing from this body of clay, liueth and moueth afterward more freſhly and bleſſedly.</p>
                     <p>The ſoule then dies not becauſe it is vtterly aboliſhed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> but becauſe it is, as though it were not, &amp; it ceaſeth to be in reſpect of righteouſnes, and fellowſhip with God: for this is the death of all deaths, when the creature hath ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being ſtill in it ſelfe, and yet for all that, is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all happy and heauenly ſocietie with God.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13172:32"/>
diſſolution of Gods worke, the power of the diuell, the ſtrength of Gods wrath, and the very kingdome of hell. The death of the ſoule is to ceaſe from righteouſneſſe, and quite to be ſequeſtred from the life of God. This is called the firſt death, in reſpect of time, going (as I ſaid) before the ſecond, which is the compleate death indeede: for as the ſoule (as we haue heard) is the life of the body: ſo God is the life of the ſoule, and his ſpirit is (as it were) the ſoule of our ſoules: the want of which communion brings nothing elſe but endleſſe and eternall death.</p>
                     <p>Without God there is no life, therefore <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah</hi> departing from God, departed from their life, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> although their ſoules were not preſently ſeperated from their bodies, yet being gone from God their life, they lay as it were buried in their bodies, as dead carkaſes in the graues, as alſo their bodies themſelues euery moment were mortall. <hi>Sinne</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bernard) went before, and Death followed at the heeles</hi>: which if Man had preuented, death had not entred: He would not be ruled by God, and ſo was made vnable to rule his body. Thus by ſinne he loſt his life, &amp; found out death. As his ſoule could not be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from God his life, but by ſinning;<note place="margin">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13172:33"/>
ſhall be called a ſpirituall body, not in ſubſtance, but in qualitie; becauſe in the reſurrection it ſhall be quickened by the ſpirituall power of Chriſt: So a man that hath but ſimply a ſoule (if hee haue not the true ſoule of the ſoule, which is the Spirit of God, to quicken and reuiue it) hee is but a meere naturall man, and muſt needes be damned.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, as a body raiſed vp and quickened by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the power of God, can neuer dye againe: ſo the ſoule of a faithfull man, being a ſpirituall ſoule (hauing once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the earneſt of Gods Spirit, and a meaſurable power of true Sanctification from the holy Ghoſt) can neuer dye. Now the life of Gods Spirit hath three degrees in Gods elect: Regeneration in this life, when we are renued in our affections, and doe feele a true change of minde within vs: the ſecond after this life, when the ſoule ſhall be ſeparated from the body, which being once (as it were) releaſed from the fetters of the fleſh, ſhall ſwiftly take her flight to heauen; and then ſhall the ſoule liue indeede a heauenly life, being altogether freed from the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Diuell, and all allurements of the fleſh. But the higheſt degree of all, of the ſoules eſtate, is, at the generall day of reſurrection, when the world, with the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhall paſſe away like a cloud, and be ſodainely wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp like a ſcrole: for then both the body and ſoule of man ſhall not onely enioy the preſence of God, but liue alſo with him for euer in heauenly bliſſe.</p>

                     <p>Gods hand (ſaith one) may a man eſcape, but for Deaths dart no man can ſhunne it.

and policie, may ſerue our turne; but as for Death, it can neyther be baniſhed with power, bought with money, nor eſcaped with flying away, nor preuented with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, nor turned backe with policie. All (I ſay) without redreſſe, muſt haſten vnto Deaths home. Hee therefore that thinketh it ſtrange to dye, forgetteth himſelfe and his owne nature, complaineth of the God of heauen, that ſuffered him to be borne a man, and not an Angell.</p>
                     <p>Death is the common road-way of all the world, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> is no by-paths any nearer, or nearer way; no, not for Kings and Emperours themſelues. What worlds of men are gone before vs? yea, how many thouſands out of one field? How many Crownes and Scepters lye pyled vp at the gates of Death? Men are here as in a voyage, the which wee muſt one day finiſh: yeſterday we came into this vale of teares, and to morrow (if our Maker will) we ſhall goe out. One goes before, another followes: one man rots in the graue, and makes it empty, that he which is yet aliue, may haue place therein. Or if we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here long, yet can wee not eſcape; for that all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men are encloſed in Deaths Parke. Whether wee goe ſoftly, or runne ſwiftly, whether wee dye willingly, or end our dayes grudgingly (when the appointed time is come) wee muſt yeeld our ſelues to the Law of Death. Doe wee flye? Death yet followes vs, and catcheth vs behinde; in retyring backe, ſhee approacheth neare vs; turning from her, ſhee ſurpriſeth vs ſodainely, and ceaſeth not like a greedy Beare, and hungry Lyon, vntill ſhee hath broken our bones, and torne our fleſh in ſunder.</p>
                     <p>Death equally drags away all men which haue beene,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> are, or ſhall be: We are diſtinguiſhed by times, but made equall in the Iſſue. Some are ſent before, others come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but all goe the ſame way without exception. In all theſe reuolutions of humane things, there is nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine but Death, and yet euery one complaineth of that which neuer yet failed any. Wee dye hourely, and as we grow our life decreaſeth: for what is the beginning of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13172:37"/>
Youth, but the death of Infancie? the entrance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood but the end of Youth? and what is the beginning of to morrow but the death of to day? Wee are no ſooner entered into the earth, but wee are conſtrained to returne to the earth againe, as it were from one ſepulchre to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; euen from the wombe to a beginning to liue and die together: ſo as the moſt part of the time Death giues vs no warning, but by the blow it ſelfe. Many thinke they neuer dye, but when they yeeld vp the laſt gaſpe of Death, but if wee marke it, wee dye euery day and moment: for our very liuing (as I ſaid) is a continuall dying; wee no ſooner ſet a ſtep into life, but wee enter a ſtep into death. Of our life all the time paſt is dead, the preſent liues and dyes at once, and the future likewiſe ſhall periſh. The time paſt is no more, the future is not yet, the preſent onely is and no more. This whole life (I ſay) is but a death. It is like a candle lighted in our bodies; in one the winde maketh it melt away, in another blowes it cleane out, ere halfe it be burned; in others it endureth vnto the end: but looke how much ſoeuer it ſhineth, ſo much it burneth; her ſhining is her burning, her light a vaniſhing ſmoake, her laſt fire her laſt wyke, and her laſt drop of moyſture: So is it in the life of man; his life and death are all one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But how ſhould man be ignorant of his death, vnto whom all creatures and actions preach his mortalitie? We ſee it by experience, that all earthly things haue their end: our yeares are limited, God hath meaſured out our months;<note place="margin">Iob 14.1.</note> the daies of our liues are dated, how long wee haue to liue: ſo that the firſt leſſon that we haue to learne, is to think of our end. We ſee that the longeſt day paſſeth, and the night ſucceedeth; how Sommer followeth Winter, and Winter Sommer: the Sunne hath both his riſing and his ſetting, his ſhining and his ſhading: the Spring couers and cloathes the ground with fruits; Sommer ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Harueſt gathers them, and Winter ſpends them. Thus one thing followes another, and both one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13172:37"/>
and another paſſe ſwiftly to their end. The generation of one thing is the deſtruction of another; and the death of one thing is the life of another. Firſt is our generation, then our conception, after comes our birth in wonderfull weakeneſſe. The cradle at the firſt is our caſtle; when we are crept out of that, we come to a little ſtrength, yet long is the time ere we come to our ripeneſſe. And here, behold, we neuer continue in one ſtate; for as our ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed at the firſt, ſo by little and little it diminiſheth at the laſt: as Youth ſucceedeth childehood, and age youth, ſo childehood, youth, and age haue all their end.</p>
                     <p>Wee ſee by obſeruation that the freſheſt and ſweeteſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> flower ſoone fadeth: our garments waxe olde, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo gay: our buildings become ruinous, be they neuer ſo ſtately: and as our life is vpholden by the death of Gods creatures; ſo death ſhall be the end as well of vs as of them. The Sunne towards his ſetting, and the Moone towards her wayning haue dimmer beames and light. And this is the vniuerſall ſentence of the world, and Gods decree (which needes muſt ſtand) that all things flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall fade, all things of force and might ſhall be fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, all great things leſſened, and ſo by little and little (being weakened) ſhall at the laſt diſſolue into the firſt ſubſtance and matter whereof it came; as the cloudes in the skie, into dewes and ſhowers, Ice and Snow into water; all earthly things that are of the earth ſhall turne to earth againe, and they that are of the waters ſhall turne into the ſea:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> So ſhall <hi>Adam</hi> (being duſt) to duſt againe returne with all his brood.</p>
                     <p>The law of Nature (eſtabliſhed amongſt all nations and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> people of the world) is this, that all men come into the world with condition to retire out of it againe. He is no great man (ſaith one) that thinketh it a great matter for Trees and ſtones to fall, and for mortall men to die. <hi>I knew</hi> (ſaith <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> hauing intelligence of the death of his ſonne) <hi>that hee was mortall and ſubiect to die:</hi> For as it is impoſſible for any man to die that liued not before;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13172:38"/>
ſo none can poſſibly liue that ſhall not die hereafter. Our life is as a garment that weares of it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe; for we weare out our life in liuing; the more we liue, the leſſe we haue to liue, and ſtill approach nearer death: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we are cloathed with, is a mortall and periſhing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe: our garments weare vpon our backs, and we in our garments; they are eaten with mothes, and wee with time. So in our meates (as in a looking-glaſſe) we may learne our owne mortalitie: for let vs put our hand into the diſh, and what doe we take, but the foode of a dead thing, which is either the fleſh of beaſts, or of birds, or of fiſhes, with which foode wee ſo long fill our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, vntill they themſelues be meate for wormes? All this we ſee by experience, we feele it and we taſte it daily: we ſee death (as it were) before our eyes: we feele it betwixt our teeth, and yet can wee not caſt our accompt, that we muſt die.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> There is no action without pauſe, no warre without truce; the weary workeman hath his day of reſt; Muſicke hath her ſtops, the Scriuen or his points: we do not alwayes eate and drinke, we doe not alwaies walke nor ſleepe; yea we doe not alwaies breath (although we cannot liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breathing) but concerning our life, there is no truce, no pauſe, no reſt, no delay, but hourely, yea euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all places, and actions, we haſten to our end.

They which come hereafter ſhall march vpon our graues, as we doe now vpon the ſepulchers of our fathers; they ſhall remaine in our houſes, as we doe now in theirs that were before vs; they ſhall poſſeſſe our goods, our lands, our gold and ſiluer, our Iewels and treaſuries, as we at this day enioy theirs whom we haue ſucceeded.</p>

From the wombe to our winding-ſheete our life is a warfare vpon earth; no age, no condition of life, no day, no night but brings his enemy with him, as well againſt the man of an hundred yeares olde, as againſt the babe new borne.</p>
                     <p>How full of ignorance is the time of our infancie? how light and wanton are wee, growing to be ſtriplings? how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> raſh and headlong in the time of our youth? how heauy and vnweildy when we come to olde age? What is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant but a bruit beaſt in the ſhape of a man? and what is a young youth, but (as it were) a wilde vntamed Aſſe-colt vnbridled? and what is an aged, heauy, and crooked old

He is forſaken of the world, his kinsfolk, friends, and acquaintance; his owne members and ſenſes faile him; yea, hee forſaketh (as it were) himſelfe, in that the very vſe of reaſon forſaketh him. Hee is accompanied with painfull aches, griefes, and diſeaſes: his company and conuerſation is comberſome in the Family where hee dwelleth. This is the marke (for ſooth) at which euery one ſhooteth, vpon which the eyes of all are fixed. This is the happy eſtate, ſo greatly deſired; this I ſay, is the end of the greedy ambition of long life.</p>

To conclude, childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is but a fooliſh ſimplicitie, Youth a vaine heate, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood a painefull carefulneſſe, and old age a noyſome lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing.

Thus one waue of trouble and affliction dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vpon another, vntill wee be arriued at the hauen of Death. Here, life is dying, and death liuing; whiles it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, it decayeth: all this preſent life is but a wiſhing of the future, &amp; a bewailing of the paſt, a loathing of that we haue, and a longing for that we haue not taſted, a vaine memory of the ſtate paſt, and a doubtfull expectation of the ſtate to come.

Why is a Clocke ſo often diſordered, and out of frame? the reaſon is, becauſe it hath ſo many wheeles and points of curious worke, that though it be made of Iron, yet euery little thing is able to diſtemper it; but how much more nice is the artificiall compoſition of our body, and how much more fraile is the matter of our fleſh, then is the mettall of a Clocke? Why then ſhould we wonder if ſome one point or other (among ſo many peeces) haue ſome impediment, by meanes of which defect this clocke of our life is ſtopped &amp; courſe ended? for what firmeneſſe can be in the matter of fleſh? or what ſtrength conſiſteth in ſuch a weake ſubiect?</p>

when the body that a fleſhly man makes ſo much of, his belly which he eſteemeth for his God, his mouth for whoſe delight the ſea and land ſufficed not, his fleſh that was wont to be cloathed with coſtly garments of ſilke and gold, curiouſly wrought, ſhall now ſodainely be haled into a filthy hole and pit, where it ſhall be trod vpon, yea, and eaten with wormes; where in ſtead of gorgeous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, he muſt now onely enioy his winding ſheete, and inſtead of his perfumes and maskes, filthy fauours and rottenneſſe and in lieu of his varietie of delicate diſhes, and ſeruing men to attend him, to haue a company and infinite number of crawling vermine, to feede vpon him: What man I ſay now liuing and enioying ſence and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but will maruell to thinke of the baſe condition that ſo noble a creature comes vnto? who in his life time had no fellow nor equall?

                     <p>The euerlaſting Iudge knew well enough what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he enioyned ſinfull man, when he ſaid, <hi>thou art duſt, and to duſt thou ſhalt returne</hi>: but what is this death and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the body, to the death and deformity of body and ſoule in hell? it is but as the byting of a flea to the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Scorpion; a ſhadow to the ſubſtance. If diſeaſes (which doe but make the way to death) be ſo dreadfull, what muſt the end and perfection of diſeaſes be? ſince as the diſeaſes are the malidies of the body, ſo Death it ſelfe the maladie of diſeaſe? for there are that feare not ſo much to die, as to be dead.

From this Death therefore there is no returne; it groweth by continuance, and by continuing groweth: from hell there is no redemption; It is a gulfe deuouring all things that come into it, neuer reſtoring any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; It is the pit of perdition, and houſe of deſpaire;

                     <p>Now therefore if a man would endure a great deale of labour, rather then abide the one in this life, how carefull and diligent ſhould we be to hate our ſinnes, and ſerue the Lord while we liue, rather then to incurre the other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and torments in the life to come? The wicked ſhall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13172:50"/>
be tormented for euer; ſo long as God is God, ſo long ſhall they burne in hell, neyther ſhall the tormenter nor the tormented dye, but both liue for euer and together eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.

He tooke our nature vpon him to take our part, <hi>that ſo hee might deſtroy (through death) him that had the power of death, that is to ſay, the Diuill:</hi>

                     <p>God is iuſt, and we hauing ſmitten his Maieſtie by our ſinne, muſt be ſmitten againe by his puniſhment: for hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is ſo to be mercifull, as that hee diſanull not his Iuſtice; and ſo to be iuſt, as that hee forget not his Mercy. Now to make a way to both: to appeaſe his wrath that his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may be ſatisfied; and yet ſo to appeaſe it, as his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may be magnified in forgiuing ſinne, it was neceſſary that there ſhould be a mediation. For if all the world ſhould be offered vnto God for ſatisfaction, it is nothing:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:13172:59"/>
for it is his owne, euen the worke of his hands; for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſinnes, there muſt be infinite ſufferings, and infinite ſatisfaction, and therefore he that muſt redeeme vs, muſt be an infinite Sauiour, euen God himſelfe (as wee haue heard,) yet man alſo he muſt be, euen a true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with man.<note place="margin">Eſay 7.14.</note> For how can there be ſatisfaction for our apoſtacie, but by our humilitie? or procurement of life, but by ſuffering of death? Now when God commeth to obay, hee muſt needes be humbled; and when hee comes to deſerue, he muſt needes ſerue; which God alone could not doe: and when he comes to dye, hee muſt needes be mortall, which God could not be: therefore hee was man to be bound himſelfe, and God to free others.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt thus fitted to be our Sauiour, proceeded to the worke of our redemption. Now in our ſins (from which hee ſaueth vs) wee muſt conſider three things: firſt, our diſobedience to the Law;<note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.&amp; 8.21.</note> ſecondly, our originall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thirdly, our condemnation for this corruption. The firſt of theſe is double, eyther in breaking the Law, or not fulfilling it: The ſecond is the originall cauſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, which is the euill inclination of our heart, and our corrupt affections: The third is the puniſhment of this diſobedience, hell fire itſelfe. Theſe being as three run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſoares, are healed and cured by three running ſtreames in Chriſt: For our rebellion to the Law is ſatisfied in him, who not onely paid the penaltie for that wee had broken it, but actually fulfilled euery poynt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the full. For the ſecond, which is our originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, wee haue the holineſſe and ſanctification of his nature, which was euer ſeperate from all vncleanneſſe: ſo that now in Chriſt our redeemer, our eſtate is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then euer it was in <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt creation; for though he was made good, yet was he changeably good (as hath beene ſaid before) but thoſe that are in Chriſt, are abſolutely good, and vnmoueable, euen as the ſtrongeſt

mountaines that cannot be ſtirred. Thirdly, wee haue Chriſt by his paſſion to deliuer vs from condemnation: Euen as in the ſacrifice vnder the Law, the blood of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent beaſt was ſhed for him that had ſinned, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily by ſinne deſerued to dye himſelfe; ſo we by the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſts blood that immaculate Lambe,<note place="margin">Eſay 53.5.

                     <p>But here obſerue the wonderfull wiſedome of God, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the worke of our redemption, prouiding ſuch remedy, which none could haue deuiſed but God alone: for what elſe is death but the power of the Diuell, and the vtter euerſion of all the world?

Gen. 1.3.</note> and admirable wiſedome of him alone, who calleth all things that are not, as though they were, bringing light out of darkneſſe, good out of euill, and death out of life? And ſurely, if all men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhould haue conſpired together in ſtudy and deuiſe to wiſh a plague to haue fallen vpon Diuell and Death it ſelfe, they could not haue determined ſuch another courſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> that their glory ſhould be their ſhame, their power ſhould be their plague, and their kingdom of pride their vtter confuſion.<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.22:</note> What could the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in all the hotteſt zeale he boare to God, wiſh more againſt the wretched reprobates, ſo traiterous to Chriſt his ſonne, and to his Goſpell, then to pray that their dainty tables might be as ſnares to take themſelues withall, and that

This fond conceit groweth and is grounded vpon ſelfe-loue, which alwaies hateth and abhorreth Death, to auoide the paine and griefe which otherwiſe it would conceiue.

By Faith indeede we take hold of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, we are reconciled vnto God: but of this wee cannot take hold, except withall, we apprehend the ſanctification of Gods ſpirit; for he was giuen to vs for righteouſneſſe, wiſedome, ſanctification, and redemption.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> Therefore Chriſt iuſtifieth none, whom he doth not alſo ſanctifie.
