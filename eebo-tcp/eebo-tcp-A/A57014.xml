            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Reply on behalf of the Preſent <hi>East-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to a Paper of Complaints, commonly called, <hi>The Thirteen Articles,</hi> delivered by their Adverſaries, to the Members of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe of COMMONS.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ARTICLE I.</hi> THat they did procure Illegal Commiſſions from the late King for Martial Law, whereby ſome Perſons have been Executed.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>ANSWER.</hi>HOW far a Power to grant Commiſſions of Martial Law in Foreign Plantations, in the Caſe of Rebellion, is by Antient Prerogative veſted in the Crown, is not fit here to be debated, much leſs determined; though the Author of this Article here preſumes ſo to do. But this is true, That the Commiſſion here ſtiled Illegal, was no other, than what hath been from time to time granted to the ſaid Company; more particularly, at its firſt Inſtitution in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> I. As doth appear by the Original Commiſſions ready to be produced.</p>
            <p rend="small">That the ſaid Commiſſion was grounded on the ſame Power with their Charter, and their Charter on the ſame Power with all the Charters of the reſpective Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> Upon which Charters, ſeveral Perſons have been Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted both by Civil and Military Judicatures, and never yet call'd in Queſtion; and is no more than what all the <hi>European</hi> Joynt-Stocks make uſe of in <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Governour of St. <hi>Helena</hi> cauſed to be put to Death two Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Commiſſion was obtain'd.</p>
            <p rend="small">What the Governour of St. <hi>Helena</hi> did before the Commiſſion arriv'd, was without the Order or Privity of the Company here, and ſo they not anſwerable nor blame-worthy for the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. II.</hi> That the Company did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, of the late King, the Ship <hi>Phoenix</hi> to be ſent to <hi>India,</hi> to ſeize the Ships and Goods of their Fellow-Subjects; And alſo gave Orders to the Commanders of their own Ships to do the ſame.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Fellow-Subjects here mentioned, are ſuch as did break in on the Trade of the Company, contrary to His Majeſties Charter, and are uſually ſtiled <hi>Interlopers.</hi> Now it being generally granted, and likewiſe declared by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe of Commons, <hi>That the</hi> Eaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>India <hi>Trade will be beſt manag'd by a Joynt-Stock, excluſive to all others.</hi> It's humbly ſubmitted to the Judgment of all Perſons unconcern'd, what other Meaſures the Company could have then taken, or can be taken for the future, by this or any other Company, on ſuch an Exigency, for the preſervation of the Trade to the Nation and themſelves, than thoſe which the Objection would render Criminal?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. III.</hi> That they did procure their late Majeſties Proclamations, for the putting the Powers granted to them by their Charters, in Execution, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all perſons from their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Settlements in thoſe Parts, to repair to the Companies Gariſons in <hi>India,</hi> or return home.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Article is no more, than that they did procure from their late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, their reſpective Proclamations for the Confirmation of their Charters, and putting the Powers therein given them, in Execution; which is uſual, and hath been the practice of moſt, if not all Companies eſtabliſhed by Charter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor was it ever until now objected as a thing Criminal ſo to do, nor had they done it now, but to reſtrain Interloping.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. IV.</hi> That they did in the two laſt Reigns, commence vexatious and chargeable Suits againſt their Fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Company being, as they humbly conceive, in Poſſeſſion of a Right, it was never yet accounted Criminal by any Perſons, to maintain that Right in <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. V.</hi> They have cauſed ſeveral Ships fitted and deſign'd for <hi>India,</hi> to be Illegally ſtopt; and alſo one Ship homeward bound, to be unladen at <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> In order to which, they procured a Letter from the late King, to the Judge of the Admiralty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to order the ſaid Cargoe there to be Landed.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to this, that, as is before hinted, in anſwer to the ſecond Article: It being generally agreed on, and declared by the Honourable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>That the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Trade will be beſt managed by a Joynt-Stock, excluſive to all others.</hi> It's humbly conceiv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, it was no ways Criminal, for them to apply to His then Majeſty, and His Courts of Admiralty, for ſuch aſſiſtance as that Court could afford them, to preſerve the Trade to themſelves, excluſive to others, according to their Charter. But as to any ſuch Letter, as is here ſuggeſted, it being matter of Fact, it muſt reſt upon them to prove it, by producing the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. VI.</hi> That the Company have expended great ſummes of Money, under the title of ſecret Services, and preſented to the two late Kings, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ten thouſand Guineys.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This were much more proper to be objected by the Preſent Members of the Company, than by thoſe, ſome of whom at leaſt wiſe were the chief Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it: And having ſince ſold themſelves out, would render the preſent Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Criminal, for thoſe very Actions which they committed, while Members of the ſaid Company.</p>
            <p rend="small">And as to theſe ten thouſand Guineys which were preſented to the late Kings, it was alwayes Paid into the Exchequer, for the Publick Service; and was at firſt introduced, not by the preſent Managers, but by ſome of thoſe, who as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, have ſold themſelves out, and do now complain againſt it. But it hath been ſince taken off by a Preſent of Seven Thouſand Pound <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tock in the ſaid Company, which his preſent Majeſty, whom God long preſerve, doth now enjoy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:35043:2"/>
               <hi>Art. VII.</hi> Some of the prevailing Members in the Committee, have ſold to themſelves great part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Goods, by Private Contract, to the Prejudice of the Buyers, and the Defrauding the other Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection likewiſe had been much more proper to have come from the Preſent Members, than from thoſe who had no Intereſt in the Company, when theſe Private Contracts were made: Nor were theſe Contracts ſo private, but firſt by the allowance of the General Court of Adventurers; and then Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, that ſuch Contracts were propoſed, and all Perſons, both Members and others, had full freedom to bid for the Goods intended to be Expoſed to Sale. And it is humbly conceiv'd, That it is the Property of every individual Perſon, and of all Communities, to diſpoſe of their Effects, as they do think moſt conducing to their preſent Advantage: Nor is it contrary to the Companies preſent Conſtitution. But if it be thought inconvenient for the future; This, as all other Regulations, is by the Companies Petition, humbly ſubmitted to the Honourable Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. VIII.</hi> They have not for many Years paſt made up their Books, and valued their Stock; although by the General Preamble, ſubſcribed by every Adventurer on his admiſſion into the Company, they are obliged ſo to do every ſeven Years: Whereby the late Managers have engroſſed a great part of the ſaid Stock, in oppoſition to the Intereſt of the Publick.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Obiection is not true in fact. The Company having made up their Books, and a Valuation of their Stock, in the Year 1685, which is yet within the ſeven Years. Nor is it true, as is further ſuggeſted, That the late Managers have thereby ingroſſed a great part of the Stock, in oppoſition to the Intereſt of the Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. IX.</hi> That they have of late made over-large Dividends, whereby they have not only divided their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but the very Stock it ſelf: And that it hath been urg'd (as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo to do) in their Publick Courts, <hi>That it was the only way, to put themſelves out of the Power of a Parliament:</hi>
            </p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Article conſiſting of ſeveral Particulars huddled up together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any due connexion, muſt notwithſtanding, to render the Anſwer to it intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, be brancht into ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p rend="small">As to the making the late Dividends, it was occaſion'd for want of Liberty to ſend out Shipping for <hi>India;</hi> The Company having made ſeveral earneſt applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the ſame, which by reaſon of the Preſſing occaſions for Seamen, to Man Their Majeſties Fleet, could not be obtain'd: And alſo they have had certain Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from <hi>India,</hi> that by reaſon of the <hi>Great Moguls</hi> Warring upon the King of <hi>Gulconda,</hi> and the grievous Famine and Sickneſs happening on the Coaſt of <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romandel,</hi> moſt of the Handicrafts-men being deſtroy'd, The Companies Agents and Factors could not procure Callicoes for their Money: By which ways the Companies Stock then lying dead, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> the ſaid Dividends were made; <hi>And not,</hi> as is falſly ſuggeſted, <hi>to put themſelves out of the Power of a Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that thereby they have not left a Fund ſufficient to carry on their Trade.</p>
            <p rend="small">But that by theſe Dividents there is not left a Fund ſufficient to carry on the Trade, is deny'd; and being matter of Fact, muſt reſt upon the Peruſal of the Accompts of the Companies, ordered, and intended to be delivered into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>But are become neceſſitated to Farm it out to their Fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p rend="small">As to the Permiſſion Ships, there was a neceſſity for it during the time of the War, when Trade might be carried on by private Management of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with leſs noiſe or notice taken of it, than could then be done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; But that being ceaſed by the Peace made, They are now reſtrain'd by the preſent Company, and therefore ought not to remain an Objection againſt them.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe to the <hi>Armenians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p rend="small">This was principally deſign'd for the encreaſing the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture; They being the only Perſons that can greatly increaſe the vent of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, by carrying it into the Upland and Northern parts of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Tartary,</hi> whereby new Markets for the ſame may be obtain'd. The Factors and Agents of the ſaid Company, being never able to penetrate ſo far into the Country; And by permitting them to ſend out, not only our Manufactory, but alſo Foreign Commodities, which uſed alwayes to go with the <hi>Caravans</hi> for <hi>Turkey,</hi> it would have brought great advantage to Their Majeſties Cuſtoms, and increaſed our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and may in time bring hither, all the Fine Callicoes expended in <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts, that uſed to go overland by the great <hi>Caravans,</hi> to the increaſe of our, and diminution of their Trade.</p>
            <p>And further, that they have permitted the <hi>Jews</hi> to Eſtabliſh themſelves in <hi>India,</hi> and made them a part of their Government there, which has in a manner, given them the intire Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Diamond Trade, to the great diſcouragement and loſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects.</p>
            <p rend="small">As to the <hi>Jews</hi> being permitted to ſettle in <hi>India,</hi> It is no more than what is done in <hi>England,</hi> and they may as well accuſe the Government here, as the Company there: And for their being part of the Government, it was admitted to them, as to all other Nations, thereby to encourage perſons of all Perſwaſions to ſettle among them, for the greater ſtrengthning of the Place, and increaſe of the Trade thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. X.</hi> That they have for many Years paſt carried on their Trade in an irregular manner, by ſending out Ships at improper ſeaſons, and keeping them abroad longer than was requiſite, by which miſmanagement, together with the War, they have occaſion'd the loſs of ſeveral conſiderable ſhips, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of ſome thouſands of Seamen and Souldiers.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The taking of Ships for a longer time than was formerly practiſed, was occaſion'd by the War with the <hi>Great Mognl,</hi> in which it was abſolutely neceſſary, to have a ſtrong force of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipping on the place, to ſecure the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt there, and if they ſtaid longer than the time limited in Charter-Party, it was their own voluntary action, they having it in their power by Charter-Party, to return.</p>
            <p rend="small">Nor was the loſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen more in proportion, than of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Country; there being then ſuch a Contagion in thoſe parts, as depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated whole Cities; nor can the Company be more Reaſonably accuſed for the death of their Seamen and Souldiers, than the Government of this City can for the loſs of its Members, in times of Contagion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. XI.</hi> That the Company have commenced an unjuſtifiable War againſt the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and under that</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The War with the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> was occaſion'd by pure neceſſity, and that neceſſity did ariſe, from the breaking in of the <hi>Interlopers</hi> upon them, in their Trade, when by dividing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>India,</hi> the Natives there took advantage of the ſaid diviſion, to extort very great, and moſt unreaſonable Sums of Money</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35043:2"/>
            <p>pretence, committed many great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations on the Subjects of that Prince;</p>
            <p rend="small">from the Company, contrary to their Phirmaunds given to them, as has been more at large demonſtrated by the Company in Print.</p>
            <p rend="small">Beſides, the War was neither commenced nor proſecuted, but by the <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Commiſſions</hi> of the late King under his hand. And it was alwayes believed, that the ſole Power of making War and Peace, was veſted in the Crown; ſo that this War (being commenced by, and under the then Soveraign Power of this Nation,) can't in Reaſon be accounted an injuſtifiable War, as is Objected.</p>
            <p>Whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are render'd in all Parts of <hi>India,</hi> odious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and eſteemed rather Pyrats than Merchants.</p>
            <p rend="small">As to that which is further Objected, <hi>That the</hi> Engliſh <hi>are in all parts of</hi> India <hi>render'd odious and contemptible by the War;</hi> the quite contrary is true: For ſhould they have tamely ſubmitted to theſe Exactions and Inſults, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to vindicate themſelves, they had then become abſolutely contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the Natives: VVhereas now by their endeavour to right themſelves, they have gain'd Reputation and Reſpect, more than any other <hi>European</hi> Nation in <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have been likewiſe guilty of a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious breach of Faith, by making Prize of divers Ships, to which they had given the protection of the Companies Paſſes. And alſo have ſeiz'd the Goods and Moneys, which were laden on Freight, on board the Companies own Ships, for which Bills of Loading are ſtill ſtanding out.</p>
            <p rend="small">As to the firſt branch of this part of the Objection, it's utterly denyed: For what Ships had the Companies Paſſes, were either not ſeiz'd at all, or upon their bringing up to <hi>Bombay,</hi> immediately diſcharg'd by the General.</p>
            <p rend="small">As to the firſt branch of this part of the Objection, it's utterly denyed: For what Ships had the Companies Paſſes, were either not ſeiz'd at all, or upon their bringing up to <hi>Bombay,</hi> immediately diſcharg'd by the General.</p>
            <p rend="small">As to the other part of this Objection, <hi>That they have ſeiz'd the Goods and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, which were laden on freight on the Companies own Ships, for which Bills of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are ſtanding out.</hi> It is anſwer'd; That if they mean by theſe Goods and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, ſuch as did belong to any <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> it is utterly deny'd; but if they mean the Goods and Moneys belonging to any of the Natives, then it is acknowledg'd, that there were 179 Bales of Goods, laden on the <hi>Emerauld Frigat,</hi> deſign'd for <hi>Perſia,</hi> which were afterwards put on board <hi>Charles the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> there being a neceſſity for the <hi>Emeralds</hi> going a Cruizing; and there being ſeveral other Goods, in the hurry of the <hi>Moors</hi> Invaſion, brought on board the ſaid Ship, and laid upon them: The <hi>Monſoons</hi> would not ſuffer them, when the <hi>Charles</hi> was about Lading for <hi>Europe,</hi> to meddle with her Stowage, and take them out; which was the Reaſon of their being brought for <hi>England:</hi> But they were accordingly taken notice of, in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Invoices to the Company; and a particular Account deſired to be kept of their Contents and Sale, to enable the Companies General and Council to account with the Owners; which is paid and done accordingly: It being ſo promiſed to the Owners from the beginning, and they were ſatisfied with it. <hi>For what Moneys were laden on the Companies Ships on freight, and ſeiz'd on,</hi> as is alledged by the Objection, the Truth thereof is no more than this, That there was ſome Money ſo laden detain'd at <hi>Bombay;</hi> but is actually reſtored to the Owners at <hi>Surrat,</hi> to their great ſatisfaction, which they have publickly acknowledg'd.</p>
            <p>That the Company did make War on the <hi>Mogol,</hi> without firſt having made Application to him for Redreſs of their Grievances.</p>
            <p rend="small">This likewiſe is not true in Matter of Fact; for they did make Application to himſelf, and likewiſe to his Miniſters, before the commencement of this VVar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Art. XII.</hi> That the Company firſt contrived to make Advantage, of the Credit and Friendſhip, which till that time, they had with the Natives, by ordering their Agents to borrow all the Money they poſſibly could.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is well known, that the Company have all along from their firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, borrow'd Money at <hi>Surrat,</hi> as they have had occaſion, and have as punctually paid it: And what Money, now ſaid in this Objection to be borrow'd, (which is nothing near ſo much as is alledg'd) was not done, as is here ſuggeſted, by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to make an Advantage, of the great Credit and Friendſhip our Nation had with the Natives,</hi> thereby to defeat them of it; but either is, or will be, as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually paid when due, as theſe Suggeſters pay their own Debts, and was never otherwiſe intended.</p>
            <p>That they are at laſt become ſenſible, and have ſupplicated that great Prince for a Pardon, which he has conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to grant them.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that theſe Perſons, who in their former Articles did accuſe the Company, for not having made their Application to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> for redreſs of their Grievances, do now in this criminate them, for having made their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him for a Peace; which they diſingenuouſly call a Pardon.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Art. XIII.</hi> That they did alſo upon moſt unjuſt and frivolous pretences, make War on the King of <hi>Syam,</hi> which occaſioned the Maſſacre of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Majeſties Subjects, and the ruine of ſeveral Families.</p>
            <p rend="small">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The VVar made by the Company on the King of <hi>Syam,</hi> was not made, as is here pretended, on moſt unjuſtifiable and frivolous Pretences, but upon moſt juſt and reaſonable Grounds: The Company having received moſt notorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, both in their Eſtates, and in the Perſons of their Factors, from that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>And now the before-mention'd <hi>Objections</hi> having received their ſeveral <hi>Anſwers;</hi> It is humbly ſubmitted to the Judgment of all unconcern'd Perſons, whether by them it is made clearly evident, that the Preſent Company are become a diſhonour to this Nation, a great Grievance to Their Majeſties Subjects; and that nothing but a New National Joynt-Stock, can retrieve and preſerve that Trade, from being utterly loſt to this Kingdom, as is ſuggeſted, in the Concluſion of the ſaid Paper.</p>
            <p>And whereas they have Printed the <hi>Phirmaund,</hi> or Patent lately Granted by the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> to the Company, from the ſtile of which they would inſinuate, that the Company have made a baſe and diſhonourable Peace: It is well known to all, who have obſerved the ſtile of the Eaſtern Princes, That it is no other, than what the ſaid <hi>Mogol,</hi> and others of the Great Eaſtern Monarchs generally uſe, in their Treaties, they make with their Neighbouring Princes: But for the particular Articles Granted to the Company for their Trade and Settlement, They are as advantageous as the Company could, or did deſire; and beyond what hath ever yet been Granted.</p>
