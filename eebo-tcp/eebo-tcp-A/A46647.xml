            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the booke called Icon-basilice was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth the Rebells guilt Suggested Suspitions to them of danger from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his late Majest: as formerly they apprehended from his life, striving, that he might not appeare to posteritie out of those ignominious Circumstances, which they had contrived in the murther of him, and thence their rigid Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after persons and Presses. Rebells rise by flattery, rule by force, and they, that made so many appeales to the people, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them now to know the groanes of a dead Martyr. Vpon the comming foorth of the booke, they found what they feared, that many, whose passion kept them from a right judgment in the heate of Action, saw their owne errours in that booke, and that the person, and cause of his late Majest: began to be more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vnderstood, and being not able to strangle it in the birth, they sought how to cast itt foorth to be destroyed, raysinge ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that it was not the worke of his late Majest: thinkeing to make men lesse intent on the booke, if the author were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, and that they might thereby take of all opinion of pietie, and wisedome from his late Majest: which might be collected from his writings, it being the Custome of Rebells to prevaile more by Calumnies vpon the disposition, then the Actions of Princes. They seeke to improve crueltie above nature for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by wicked hands destroyed the Lords anointed, they would deface the Memory of their owne vile Actions against him, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103102:4"/>
false Prophetts to curse him, &amp; they grudge at his Crowne in heaven, as they usurped that on earth. Its no new thing for persons of most eminent vertue to fall into the obloquy, &amp; suffer by the rage of the misled people, and therefore no wonder if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence finde an oratour to accuse it, &amp; Treason an Advocate, to defend it. Rebellion never wanted a Trumpet &amp; though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of it be in Caves, &amp; vaults, yet successe makes it outface the light. His Majest: booke hath passed the censure of the greatest part of the learned world, being translated into the most spred Languages, and strangers honour his Memory, and abhorre his murtherers, but such, as regarde not the al seeing eye of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their wickednes, despise the judgment of the whole world, and there is a man found out, that will breake downe the united reason of mankinde, &amp; he tells men, they must take his word above their owne, and all mens reason, this he vndertakes, that lookes on kings, as Ants, and the kings booke, as wanting all moment of Soliditie, and if, as he chose the Title of Iconocla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes he had written his booke in a Forraigne, or learned language, his vnfaith fullnes, and impudence would be as open, and odious as his vanitie is ridiculous.</p>
            <p>And though the exceptions against his Majest: booke fall away of them selves, and Traytours Apologies carry with them their owne Confutation, yet indignation at the shamelesse inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and vntruth of Iconoclastes provokes a just vindication of his late Majest: from the lewde slanders of the answearer. A Dumbe childe gott speech at the apprehension of an Injury to the father, and its a dead Loyaltie, that stands vnmoved at the cursing of a shimei, and those curses of shimei recorded in Scripture were lesse virulent, and more excusable, then this Authors language of his late Majest: through his whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, which is a Treason against God, and Man, Religion, Truth, and Iustice.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS First words are.</hi> To descant on the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of a person fallen from so high a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gintie, who hath also paid his finall debt to nature, and his faults, is neither of it selfe a thing commendable, nor the intention of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>That it is not a thing commendable is a greed by all, and that it is the intention of this Authors Discourse all men discerne by this very expression, and in every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod he insolently, and scorne fully speakes of the person of his late Majest: as fallen into that misfortune, and his whole booke is a continued Confutation of this false as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion. base natures delight in the misfortunes of persons in highest place: It is hatefull in any to descant on the misfortunes, of Princes, but in such, as have relation vnto them by service, or Subiection as this libeller to the late king is the Compendium of all vnworthynes, and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall insolence. Could he say <hi>his Majest: had paid his debt to his faults without descant on his misfortunes?</hi> But he giues timely warning, what is to be expected in his booke,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103102:5"/>
where like a shameles theife taken in the fact he denies what he openly acts.</p>
            <p>He saies it is not to get a name, for no man ever got ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by writing against a King, being strong in Legions, weake in Arguments.</p>
            <p>Some men have desired a name for Brutish arrogance against Princes, and that may be the Authors ambition, but however it have fared with others, that have spitt their venom in the faces of Kings, its certaine he hath lighted vpon the prediction of his owne successe, for he will gaine only in famy by this vndertaking. Never man found honour by raking in the ashes of dead Princes, but vnnatural crueltie seekes to Surfeit vpon the grave. This Author doth not only digg vp the bones of the dead King, but seekes to bring Destruction on al Kings, and bury them in the ruines of their Authoritie. depraved natures account the greatest wickednes the greatest glory, &amp; more honour to subvert humane Societie, then destroy a Single person.</p>
            <p>The first step, where by he mounts to Triumph over his sacred Majest: is for that he was a King, and that is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as proofe Sufficient, that he was <hi>weake at Arguments, Kings</hi> (he saies) <hi>being accustomed from the Cradle to vse their will only, as their right hand, their Reason alwayes, as their left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soe desperate is the wickednes of these men, that must vilifie the Ordinances of God for their defence. Had they matter of just exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his late Majest: they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, they would not draw matter of Reproach from his Office, and had they any feare of God, or reverence to man, they would not thus Lewdly traduce this greate Institution of God for the governing of mankinde the Kingly Office. God him selfe saies <hi>the Kings heart is in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103102:5"/>
hand of the Lord, and he turneth it as Rivers of water. That a wise Sentence is in the heart of the King,</hi> and yet this man pretends to expect beleife in his Calumnies vpon the late King, when hee affirmes the kingly Office to bee a cause of weakenes of judgment, and insufficiencie, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the promises of God in Scripture for assistance of Kings with his spiritt to meere Compliment, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly belying the many Monarchs of the world, that have beene as farr above others in Wisedome, as they have beene in power.</p>
            <p>Wee have lived to see that sore evill, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the pen of a King, and the wisest of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, <hi>to see Princes on foote, &amp; Servants on horsebacke,</hi> when the Licentious insolence of the meanest tramples vpon the Soveraigntie of the highest, and the basest of the people revile their King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He saies</hi> for their sakes, that have not more Seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered Kings, then in the gawdy name of Majestie, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, &amp; their doings, as if they breathed not the same breath with other men he will (for it seemes, <hi>he saies,</hi> a Challenge both of him, and his partie) take vp the gantlet (though a Kings) in the behalfe of libertie, and the common wealth.</p>
            <p>Loyaltie hath no friends, that so admire Princes, as if they breathed not common breath of nature, they wel know who hath said of Kings, <hi>I have said you are Gods</hi> &amp; the guilt of their sin, that disobey, or revile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet non are ignorant, that <hi>their breath is in their nosthrils, &amp; that they shall dye, as others.</hi> They, that are best instructed, &amp; most considerate give most reverence to Kings. They vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that Princes have greater promises of wisedome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; greater meanes to attaine it then others, &amp; that by obeying them humane societie is maintained, though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103102:6"/>

When Saul was made King of Israel, there were wicked men, that said, <hi>how shall this man save us,</hi> contemning his Authoritie, because he was taken from among them selves, &amp; in our dayes there is a Confluence of all the Rebellious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that troubled the world, pride of base people, and disdaine of all Authoritie. Because Kings are men, must they not therefore Rule? Must Gods vicegerents be despysed, because they are men?

how few, or none admire Kings, as if they breathed not the common breath of men, and how many forgett their dutie to them, that in Scripture are called Gods. the prevalence of corrupt nature is so farr above reason, that men are sooner infatuated by the plausible discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of ambitious aspirers to beleive absurdities making way for Rebellion, then mistaken of the nature of Kings by their sacred Title, or dignitie, for wee have seene men seduced to beleive they might make warr against the King, so as they said it was aganist his evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, and for King, and Parliament, that because the two houses sate by the Kings authoritie, therefore him selfe had none.

There are a great number, that since they have seene that booke thinke it had been a great losse to the world, if it had perished, &amp; yet they are farr from designe by it, and if it were published with any designe, it was an innocent one to publish what a murthered King, had left written of himselfe for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Actions, and cleering of mistakes.</p>
            <p>The designe is now the third time to corrupt the people to the dishonour of the present Government, &amp; retarde a generall peace so needeful to this afflicted nation.</p>
            <p>They cannot say any were corrupted, that followed their King, vnles the lawes, their legall oaths, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe corrupted them, for theis were the guides they followed, and the Rebells may rest assured, that if there were not these bonds vpon the loyall English, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Treatises, though never so excellent would little move them to the losse of life, and fortunes.</p>
            <p>For the dishonour of that, which he calls the present Government themselves have written enough, though the King, and his partie were silent. Their power was gotten by often repeated propositions, &amp; protestations, of affection, and loyaltie to his late Majest: which they never meant to performe, many false pretences to the people to defend the King, and established lawes, and Religion, breach of oaths, murther of the King, and of theis nothing can be denyed by themselves, and there is nothing can be said of any to dishonour beyound swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and fore swearing, Treason, and Murther.

            <p>His Majest: expected the vtmost of their malice after death vpon his name, as he had felt it in his life, and it was so farr from his desire, that mention of his deedes should be forborne, especially those his Enemies excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, that his endeavours were cheifely bent to make them manifest to the world with all the obiections, and invectives, that had been made against them, and time hath tought this Author, and others of his crew, that many have been convinced of the wickednes of theyr Rebellion, by the declarations, and replies they made against his late Majest: Truth feares nothing, but to be hidden, &amp; his late Majest: needed noe other Advocate, then the cleere discoverie of his deedes, that he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate was the greate wrath of God vpon the nation, where so many in the middest of so great blessings of peace, and plentie, as they enioyed vnder his Raigne, continued murmuring, and vnthankefull, and it is not the least signe of the heavines of his displeasure, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

The present age must nedes have a deepe sense of his losse, and posteritie, aswell, as strangers will wonder, when they reade his story, and finde such groundles slanders, and barbarous cruelties acted against so eminent vertue, and the confidence in obtruding such grosse absurdities, for reasons, as are vsed by this Author and others, wilbe the infamy of the present age, when such evident folly, and wickednes finde credit. Can any man be so stupid to thinke, that such wretches, as boast of their destroying the innocent, will cease to defame their memory? and that such, as had no mercie on their lives, will have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of their sufferings? That they, which suborned detractours, and raysed lewde reports to give colour to their crueltie, would have a tendernes to him they had tormented, and expresse no tendernes for their owne villanies?

            <p>Its too vnreasonable to bely the dead, and to affirme his Majest: to speake all evill of the Parliament, when he well knowes, that his Majest: speakes nothing of them, but what this breaker confesses to be true, and if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest: had spoken evill of a faction in Parliament, its too vnreasonable for him to censure it, who not only speakes evill of a faction in Parliament, but is the Advocate of those, that not only speake evill of them, but have des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed them. What if his Majest: had spoken evill of the Lords house, have this Authors Masters done lesse, that have taken it away?

And if the King reprehend, or reprove his subjects in the capacitie of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or otherwise, it is not only vnreasonable, but damnable for them to censure, and reproach him, and most detestable for every licentious Pamphletter to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, &amp; vilifie him.

Majest: to represent their evill Actions against him? The Parliament voted a Treatie with the King, and voted his concessions to be a sufficient ground for peace, the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler taxes that vote for folly, and falshood. The Army remove that Parliament, and call some Creatures of their owne the Parliament, and they together take the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King, and murther him notwithstanding this Treatie, and vote of Parliament. If it were the Parliament, that voted the Treatie, and the concessions to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for peace, they must be Traytours by the Parliaments Judgment, that dissolved them, and placed the name of Parliament vpon others, and this Author must speake more evill of them, then his Majest: doth, or more of his Masters, and might with farr more reason take on him the defence of the Tumults, as afterwards he doth, then the Parliament, for if the Parliament, may be modelled by Tumults, and are no longer a Parliament, then the leaders of the rabble, judge well of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then the King, in speaking any thing against the Parliament, doth no more, then this Author confesseth the Tumults may doe, and himselfe too.

            <p>In laying the ground worke of this horrid Rebellion, the Master worke men saw, that people are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht by degrees, and they cannot suddenly beleive absurdities, till their passions by Custome be made Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their reason, and confirmed in the pursuite of what was propounded to them, vnder pretence of their good. The people then held it a sin to offer violence to the person of their King, They thought they could not cut of the lappe ofhis garment. They held it odious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his person, and the Parliament had so often decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that kings, can doe no wrong, and that the law for bidds the speaking of it, that though the wickednes of some were enough confirmed to wish his destruction, they durst not say it, but pretend desire of Justice against other persons, and they resolved, as Assassines to stabb him, while they kneeled to him, and to betray him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing dutie, and loyaltie, vndermininge his authoritie, with aspersions on his evill Councellours, as they called them. And as then they laid faults vpon his Councellours,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103102:14"/>
that never acted, so now this slanderer will make the King guiltie of Actions, that were never done by him and vnder pretence of not sparing him in laying the guilt on him, that was properly his, seekes to lay all mens faults on him, and is as disloyall to truth, as Loyaltie.</p>
            <p>To acquit himselfe his Majest: needed to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for his adversaries by their declarations have done it, and they have acquitted his Councellours of these very Crymes they objected to them, for this Author wil have the faults they were charged with to be the Kings, and it is in his Language a Ceremonie to accuse men falsely, &amp; by forged Calumnies to seduce the people to the spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their blood, and hazard of their soules. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is the first, that sought to be beleived in an Apologie for falshood, and to defend the Parliament, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, sayes theise deceites, and lies were in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Its certaine the King endeavoured to vndeceive the people, that they might have knowne, that the malice of these Traytours was to himselfe, whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against his evill Councellours, &amp; this Author ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes traynes of Treason, framed of knowne vntruths to be only Ceremonies, and rankes the fifth, &amp; ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in the Ceremoniall law, &amp; as many of the rest, as the breach may be made serviceable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites. If the reproofe of evill speaking against Kings in Scripture be a Ceremonie, if dutie, and loyaltie be a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, if veracitie be a Ceremonie, what is morall in this Authors judgment? Those, whome he calls the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament vsed those impostures, vntill they had drawne the people to establish their owne slavery, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of those miscreants over them, and now they laugh at these miserable people, that thus beleived them, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103102:15"/>
they doe at the finesse of their fraudes, and despise the power of God, as they doe his Precepts. It is sufficiently evident to the world, what promises, &amp; professions those the Author calls the Parliament vented to make his late Majest: a glorious King, &amp; besides their legall oaths, they devised new protestations of loyaltie, and this the Author calls a Ceremonie to make the world beleive they were loyall to their King, for the Actions they intended nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded strong Charmes to delude the people, &amp; make them beleive those men loyall to the King, that raysed a warr against him. The Parliament in one of their declarations told the King, that if they should say, that the evill Acts they complained of were done by his Maj: they should speake contrary to the law, and the Testimonie of their owne hearts. In another, that they were ready to lay downe their lives, and fortunes, and spend the last dropp of their blood to maintaine his Crowne, and Royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in greatenes, and glory, and cast themselves downe at his Royall feete. What would he have the world thinke of this so stoutly acted vehemence only a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie? Certainly one of the most pernitious, that ever was practised, and an impudent defence suites well with a discovered falshood. They professe themselves Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to stage playes, but it is, that they might engrosse the trade to themselves, for their Pulpits, aswell, as Pamphlets sound principally this representation of passion, &amp; stage devotion, but it is a sollesisme in so greate an actor, as this Author, that speakes alowde, that all is but a Ceremonie, for he thereby gives the world to vnderstand, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the same falshood in his slanders, then the faction in Parliament vsed in their professions of dutie, and loyaltie.</p>

This course of his in laying the faults on the King he sayes is, that they, who from the beginning, or but now of late by what vnhappines he knowes not are so much infatuated not with his person only but with his palpable faults, &amp; dote vpon his defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, may have none to blame, but their owne folly, if they live, and die in such a strok'n blindnes, as next to that of Sodom hath not happened to any sort of men more grosse, or more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadinge.</p>
            <p>Wee have found many by hellish impulsion hating his Majest: person, and authoritie, and seeme not to thinke, that God hath given them vp to a reprobate sense, and strong delusion, &amp; would be thought to beleive all those, that love, or honour their King infatuated, and thence it is, that the Author knowes not by what vnhappines it is, that men are so infatuated, for he would have it beleived a greate happines to hate, and detest his King, to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach not only his person, but his office Persecutors endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make them vnhappy, on whome they exercise their cruelties, and they wonder at those, that run not with them to the same degree of wickednes, &amp; this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes it an vnknowne vnhappines, that men runnot from their protested, and sworne Allegiance, and loyaltie into so disperate a Rebellion, as he maintaines, he may well say he knowes not by what vnhappines it comes, but it is an vnhappines of greater wonder, that soe many should renounce the very names of loyaltie, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, make Rebellion the most renowned vertue, and this after soe many vowes, and oaths to the contrary, that men, who some few yeares since professed the greatest hatred of a Traytour to their King, should now thinke no man soe prayse worthy, nor any blindnes soe neere to that miraculous stroke of the men of Sodom, as that of the opinion of loyaltie.</p>

            <p>If this Author had intended a right information of men, as he pretends, he would not have played the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in every period, as he hath done in making Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raes, and goblins to affright men.

            <p>Its true, that the vertue, and worth of many injured persons, hath appeared more evidently after their death, and hath caused greife, and repentance in their Enemies moving revenge in those, that were seduced to destroy them, and the cruelties exercised on his late Majest: and his eminent vertues in his sufferings have manifested vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, how vnhappily they were mislead to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of a King, of so greate goodnes, and to place their confidence in such false, and bloody hipocrites. But he sajes those Apologies, and meditations are over late.

But would those Apologies, and meditations have been more powerfull, if sooner knowne?

For <hi>he sayes</hi> heere may be well observed the loose, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent curiositie of those, who tooke vpon them to adorne the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth of this booke, for though the picture in the front would Martir him, and saint him to befoole the people, the lattine Motto, which they vnderstand not leaves him as it were a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique contriver.</p>
            <p>The lattine being taken in the right sense, what roome had there been for this curious observation? And if they, which set foorth his Majest: booke had been cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, or stupidly negligent, the Author had detracted nothing from his Majest: It is not the picture but the crueltie exercised vpon him, that made him a Martir, and these miscreants are enraged to see their owne Actions in picture, which they shamed not to commit in the face of the world. The picture is farr short of the measure of his Majest: pietie, and sufferings, and wee may expect hard measure vpon the booke, when a picture in the front cannot escape the Image breaker. This Author its likely wrote from them, that vnderstood not lattine, that seekes to make the front, and lattine in the end so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when the front hath a picture in the posture of prayer, and the lattine in the end is applied to the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of prayer. If he had expected to worke on such, as vnderstood lattine, he would not have obtruded such an insignificant observation of misconstrued lattine. Doth the commendatious of a mans devotions shew him a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique contriver?</p>
            <p>They that published his Majest: booke are heerein free from that negligent curiositie, the Author would have seene by contriving a sense, which himselfe will not affirme to be theirs, which vsed the words, but his owne by a libertie of choice, where are different senses to be

            <p>Quaint Emblems, and devices begg'd from the old Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of fome twelf nights entertainment at white hall will doe but ill to make a saint, or Martir.</p>
            <p>The Traytours are loath to see the Emblems of their owne inhumane crueltie, and how insteed of harmeles Pageantry they erected the Theatre, of their Barbarous villanie at white hall. The wickednes of those, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired his Majest: may be shadowed by Emblems, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art, nor wit can fully expresse it. Bloody Massacres are the Pageantry of Tyrants, and the scritches of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs their Musique.</p>
            <p>If the people resolve to take him sainted at the rate of such a Cannonizing, I shall <hi>he sayes</hi> suspect their Calender more, then the Gregorian.</p>
            <p>He is very Kinde, that will suspect their <hi>Calender</hi> no more then the <hi>Gregorian,</hi> for that <hi>Calender</hi> which hath nothing peculiar, or notable, but the new account of the yeare is received by a greate part of the world for the truest, and if the Author have no greater aversion from the <hi>Calender</hi> he supposes, he is likely very neere the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife of it, but it seemes he had a minde to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite from the word <hi>Calender</hi> &amp; therefore produceth the <hi>Gregorian Calender</hi> of computation, insteed of the <hi>Calender</hi> of saints. The Authors Pageantry playing with a picture is not the way to vncannoinze a saint. The peoples opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Majest: sanctitie is not wrought by a picture, and if they have any esteeme of such representations of his sufferings their just passion condemnes this Authors malitious detractions.</p>

The Memoriall of the just shalbe blessed in despight of the malice, and scorne of men.

This Image breaker thinkes he may aswell vsurpe an Emperours surname, as his Masters their Kings power, and Estate, and while he magnifies the good Emperours corrects himselfe, least the people thence thinke on their reverence to their King. For he sayes <hi>the people exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and excessive in all their motions are prone oft times not to a Religious only, but to a Civill kinde of Idolatrie in Idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinge their Kings, though never more mistaken in the object of their worshipp, heeretofore being wont to repute for saints those

faithfull, and caragious Barons, who lost their lives in the field making glorious warrs against Tyrants for the common libertie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never time can better witnes this truth, then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that the people are exorbitant, and excessive in all their motions, nor ever man, that put pen to paper could more improperly lay it on their score, then this Author, that takes on him to defend the most exorbitant, and excessive motions of the people, that any Kingdome hath felt, the power of his Masters being founded on those motions, and if the people yet see not their errour, they cannot longer be deceived having such a Testimonie, as this Author a man without exception in that point, and its likely they begun to see, how they were made instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their owne slavery, that this Author gives so severe a Character of the people. If they be prone to a Religious Idolatric, as the Author sayes they are, they are very vnfit Reformers of the Church, and for that Civill kinde of Idolatrie in Idolizing their Kings, that is in an eminent degree of obedience, for such appeares his meanings, it wil never prove sin to them, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vice Rebellion is more frequent, and more dangerous to their salvation, and many will goe to heaven with this Civill kinde of Idolatrie, when Rebells, and despisers of Dominion wilbe excluded. The Author should have done well to tell, what this Civill kinde of Idolatrie is, if it differs from true, obedience, and whether it may not be given to others, aswell, as Kings. I beleive if there be such a Civill kinde of Idolatrie, the worst degree of it is in the reverence borne to King killers, and common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers of their Countrey, as the stories of all times testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Rebells never wanted pretentions, but libertie, and Justice were the common Maske of such Monsters, so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103102:20"/>
this man wil have the world beleive the pretences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, and that Rebellion was allwayes the lawfull side, and thence those faithfull, and couragious Barons, that had broken their faith, and Alleagiance to their King, Trayterously armed the multitude for private revenge, and ambition must be sainted, &amp; those whome the cleere evidence of law judged Traytours, and their warrs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion must be the patrons of common libertie. I thinke the Author will hardly finde a <hi>Calender</hi> of such <hi>saints,</hi> if he receive a <hi>Connonization at such a rate,</hi> it will deserve far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse credit, then the <hi>Gregorian Calender,</hi> but he is not like to finde a <hi>Calender</hi> of saints for his purpose, vnles it be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with such faithles Traytours. It hath been said of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, that they love the Treason, and hate the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, but these new Masters saint the Traytours, &amp; make Treason the Canon of their Religion. Some men have pitied men of parts, whose passions have carried them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnwarrantable Actions, but never till this age did Christians adore such saints. Rebellion is dearer to this Author, then Religion, and he will rather commend su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Actions of a blinde age, and the very dreggs of Popery against which he professeth so greate Zeale, then want an ingredient to the varnish of that horrid sin, and rather then that shalbe discountenanced, Popery, and Judaisme it selfe shalbe admitted. There were a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople, that Idolized Todes, and vipers and all venemous creatures, and these men have resumed that Idolatry, that will have the most cruell, and destructive impieties to make men saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He instances in two particulars</hi> Simon de Montfort Earle of Leicester against Hen. <hi>3.</hi> and Thomas Plantagenet Earle of Lancaster against Edward <hi>2.</hi>

For the first of these, he was by the Testimony of the stories of that age the most ingrate full Rebell, that any state hath harboured, a man overloaden with his Masters favours, matcht to his sister, instrusted with his secretts, and his forces, yet this man, whome neither benifitts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor trust could oblidge, nor keepe from thrusting the King from his Throne, &amp; assuminge the Government to himselfe for the common libertie, as the Author will have it, is enrolled for <hi>a saint.</hi> If there were any so <hi>exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, and excessive in their motions to saint</hi> such a faithlesse wretch, the Author will hardly finde any so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his Civill Kinde of Idolatry to their Kings, but whence comes Hen: 3: to be a Tyrant, of whome the stories report so much mildnes, and hardly so greate an errour, as the vnadvised advancement of that Rebell Montfort? But it is very vsuall with these men, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they finde an Example of <hi>Rebellion</hi> there the King is a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and all such Presidents, as were conveyed to our times to shew vs the mischeife, and wickednes of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> are produced, as authorities for the committing of it, and Garnetts straw wilbe a Miracle, and he a <hi>saint,</hi> &amp; the Assassins of Kings <hi>glorious Champions for common libertie.</hi> For the secound, the stories are very silent of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon libertie pretended by the <hi>Earle of Lancaster,</hi> or any Tyrany against that King, but it matters not what truth there be in an assertion so a King be made the Criminall, and though the mistake of such, as held the Earle of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster for some time a saint, were ridiculous to that very age, yet this Author will have it a lesse errour, then the keeping of the fifth Commaundement, and the people, that vsed <hi>a Civill Kinde of Idolatry</hi> to their good Emperour, that had the <hi>famous surname of Iconoclastes more mistaken in</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:103102:21"/>
the object of their worshipp, <hi>then such, as</hi> Idolized <hi>the</hi> super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Images <hi>he had broken, for the Author sayes</hi> they were never more mistaken in the object of their worshipp, then in the Civill Kinde of Idolatrie in Idolizing their Kings.</p>
            <p>Its apparent in the stories of our nation, that supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Churchmen had their hands in those <hi>Rebellions</hi> the Author mentions, &amp; therefore might induce the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant rabble to adore the Calves they had set vp, &amp; in our dayes wee finde they have successours, that teach the people <hi>doctrines of Devills</hi> and seduce them from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to those, that had the rule over them.</p>
            <p>Now with a besotted, and degenerate basenesse of spirit, ex, cept some few, who yet reteine in them the old English fortitude, and love of freedome, and have testified it by their matchles dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the rest embastardized from the ancient noblenes of their Aucestours are ready to fall flat, and give adoration to the Image, and memory of this man, who hath offred at more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fetches to vndermine our libertie, and put Tyrany into an Act, then any Brittish King before him.</p>
            <p>Its very strange, that <hi>all except some few</hi> are so besotted, as not to love libertie so naturall to man, and those, that have so contended for it, as the <hi>English</hi> nation, but if it were possible for Iconoclastes to deale faithfully, wee might have expected, that he would have told vs, what that libertie was the people loved not, which is the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of those ambitious Traytours, that now lord it over them, which are those few he mentions, whose match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse villanies have wasted more English blood in these few yeares, then all our Kings in their victorious warrs since the conquest. The people doubtles love libertie, but they finde themselves cheated of their just libertie vnder a lawfull King, and brought vnder the slavery of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103102:22"/>
many Tyrants who perswaded the poore people it was libertie to be without a King, though subject to the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious will of vpstart vsurpers, and why is it degnerate ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senes of spirit to vindicate their lawes, &amp; liberties against Tyrants, that have vsurped it, and revenge the fraude, &amp; iniury done them by deceivers, that vnder pretence of law, and libertie bereft them of both. The best of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi> pretence, which this Author defends is to fight for <hi>libertie,</hi> and if the people finde their libertie taken away, is it vnlawfull to resume it from Tyrants, and vsurpers, which this Author holds lawfullKings? Its true men were besotted with the name of <hi>libertie,</hi> and those Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banques infused the principles of <hi>Rebellion</hi> into the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople by telling there could be no libertie vnder <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> as if the nature of Governments were vnknowne till our time, and thence this Author writes, as if none, but besotted people should reade him. If these vipers had professed in the beginninge of their Rebellion, that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Monford, &amp; Thomas Earle of Lancaster had been saints,</hi> and that they intended to follow the Example of such Traytours, the people would not have been so besotted, the miseries brought on the Kingdome by such seducers being so largely delivred in story, but the people have now found by sad experience, that the leaders of the present disorders are the Progenie of those cursed Rebels, whose Actions made them odious to all posteritie, and dishonoured the times wherein they lived, and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would brand the whole nation making Rebellion their fortitude, and love offreedome, when its plaine to all readers, that those Rebellions were the scourge of the nation, which langiushed vnder the burthens, that were encreased by those, whome they followed against their kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:103102:22"/>
How the people have been <hi>Idolized</hi> by those <hi>Rebells,</hi> Tumults defended, and the power over their king pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the justification of this odious Rebellion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the declaration of those they call a Parliament, this Author frequently tells vs in this answeare, &amp; yet is soe carelesse of truth, or shame, as heere their reason, and affection are as contemptible, as their right in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and some few must raigne over them. The greatest vnhappines of the English nation hath been in the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of their kings, &amp; the greatest dishonour in the prevalcne of insolent, and sly Rebells, the noble blood of the most renowned persons being wasted in those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and Civilitie for many yeares destroyed. If we place vertue in the insolent attempts of Rebells against lawfull Princes, not only Christian fortitude, but morall vertue grow contemptible, &amp; rage, and venom will soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner get a saint-shipp, then Justice or innocence.</p>
            <p>If <hi>so many are so ready to fall flat to the Image, and memory of his late Majefl:</hi> as the Author sayes, his Masterts have cause to vse new principles, and as they fought against their king by faining a power in the people, so they must now lay fetters on them, and cast away the maske a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> to be vsed no longer.</p>
            <p>It was not a part of our liberties to be deprived of our king, nor to Rebell against him, such acts being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions not only to <hi>Christian,</hi> but <hi>English libertie,</hi> and such, as take that libertie to themselves, robb others of their just, &amp; lawfull <hi>liberties.</hi> Doe the present, or did ever Traytours give libertie to any, but their faction? And doe they allow them any more, then libertie at the will of the Commaunder? And if libertie be so precious to these men, why should John lilborne bemore restrained,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103102:23"/>
then Iconoclastes? And why should any be more Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall, that write, or speacke against an vsurped power, then they, that wrote against the knowne legall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Prisoners in Gayles hire persons of strong voyces to begg for them att the grate, and the Rebells have found this Authors rancour, and impudence so sublimated, as his falsities, and slanders were probable to infect the world, though to knowing, and honest men they sound the voyce of a Beast, and not a man; what one libertie of the English Nation is there now left? Doe not all men see, that their ridiculous howse, and state Councell act at the will of their sword Master, by whose act those Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are disposed of to signifie what he pleaseth? Doe not all men see, that the vse of the name libertie signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth nothing, but a sound to fill the peoples eares, and deceive their vnderstandinge?</p>
            <p>That Tyranny should be objected to the best King, in whose time fewer men suffred death, then in any time of like extent throughout all our Kings, shewes hellish rage, not common impudence. In his Raigne of sixteene yeares, vntill this abominable Parliament, one only Peere of the Kingdome suffered death, &amp; that not for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or offence against the Kings person, but for Crymes of another nature, a raritie in the stories of the best Kings, and yet so brutish is this man to say, that <hi>he hath offred at more cunning fetches to vndermine our liberties, and put Tyrany into an art, then any brittish King before him.</hi> Wherein should Tirany appeare, was there any violence vsed in taking away mens Estates? Can they object Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuousnes, or luxury to his late Majest: they have not yet pretended it, but they would make Tyrany by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, &amp; that Government which stands in their way
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103102:23"/>
must be called Tyrany, and the want of instances of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany makes them thus giddily stagger from side to side, and talke of <hi>offring at more cunninge fetches,</hi> what doth this signifie? Doth this Author thinke, that he wilbe beleived in his slanders of Tyrany, when all is resolved into <hi>offers,</hi> &amp; <hi>offers at cunning fetches,</hi> and all is only their malicious, &amp; inconsequent inferences? This Author well knowes this assertion of his, is so farr from truth, that he cannot name one Act of his Maj: wherevnto he, or his Masters have excepted, that wants Example of his best Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, so wide hath he opened his mouth in saying more then any <hi>Brittish King</hi> before him. And his late Majest: tooke not such Examples, as those men, that make Acts of violence, and Rebellion <hi>Examples,</hi> but such Actions, as were <hi>by Councell,</hi> and in the <hi>way of law,</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi> But this Author having so lately mentioned the old <hi>English fortitude,</hi> how falls he to name the Brittish Kings? If he intend the Kings, which the <hi>Romans</hi> found at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or which succeeded their departure, his comparison is not of any large signification, for the Catalogue is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short, and the Actions lesse, but perhapps he meanes to make <hi>Authenticke</hi> the story of <hi>Geoffry of Monmouth,</hi> where the Catalogue hath as litle truth, as the persons Actions, he doth not meane the <hi>Saxons</hi> to be <hi>Brittish Kings?</hi> If he doe, he will finde among them not only <hi>offers at fetches,</hi> but open rapines, and homicides, which when he thinkes on, what he hath written might shame him, if he could shame at any thing, and if he thought knowing readers would have the patience to pervse so much scurrilous language, and impudent vntruth, as he hath packt togeather in this booke, he would expect just reproach for offering at such a Comparison so imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103102:24"/>
if he intended such Kings only, as were properly termed <hi>Brittish</hi> in regard of discent, whose persons, and Actions are so inconsiderable, and so lewdely false. If he intend all others, that have Raigned in England, whose stories conteine so evident a refutation of his vntruth.</p>
            <p>In the first Parliament of King James, there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate touching the Kings Title, which he desired to have of <hi>greate Brittaigne</hi> in reguard of his Dominion over the whole Island, the lower howse then reputed wise, much opposed it, and would reteine the name of <hi>England,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which name they said their Ancestours had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. These men tell vs noe contentions are infallible, but the present, and they are in love with the name of <hi>Brittish Kings,</hi> of whome they know nothing, that the people may forget their English Kings, that made them famous.</p>
            <p>Wee reade of some in Scripture, that wrought mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife by a law, and this Author, that talkes of making <hi>Tyrany</hi> an art, strives to make Rebellion a law, and all Government a <hi>Tyrany,</hi> and having vndermined <hi>Monarc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hy</hi> with cantinge termes of <hi>Libertie,</hi> seekes to suppresse all <hi>Libertie</hi> by lawlesse power. He doth not wonder, though he pretend it at the change in the people, for the many odious lyes, and slanders his Masters have vsed of the King, the many promises they have falsified to the people, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual oppressions they exercise over them justly provoke hatred to such <hi>Tyrants,</hi> vnles the people were condemned to perpetuall stupiditie with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent slavery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rebells,</hi> whome this Author reports to be <hi>Sainted,</hi> though they objected misgovernment to their Kings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were so impudent to pretend their lawes slavery, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103102:24"/>
the present Traytours have improved all the impieties of former ages to extreamitie, and they call all the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England,</hi> for many hundreds of yeares <hi>Norman slavery,</hi> and will imagine a libertie that perisht by the flood, which they now resume. Their pretence of lawes is turned into sickely fancies of distempered braines, &amp; though the leaders are hardened by their confirmed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, the people begin to recover their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and see the <hi>cunning fetches,</hi> whereby they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined, and the Art, which Traytours vsed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them.</p>
            <p>Which low dejection, and debasement of minde in the people, he cannot willingly ascribe to the naturall disposition of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishman, but rather to two other causes.</p>
            <p>And <hi>is it a low dejection, and debasement of minde</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stue a mans selfe from a common cheate, or a malicious oppressour? Is it not <hi>dejection, and debasement of spirit</hi> to follow detected villaines, and common theeves? Is it the <hi>naturall disposition of an Englishman</hi> to betray, and kill his King, &amp; put his necke vnder the yoke of his inferiours? Is the <hi>English disposition</hi> so base, as to leave <hi>a King,</hi> and be subject to <hi>a Iacke straw?</hi> And is <hi>stupiditie the English dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> that can swallow any deceites, and abuses, though never so palpaple? Doubtles whoever lookes, what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was heeretofor lived vnder, &amp; what now, must needes conclude, that such, as willingly forsooke the on, and submitted to the other, expessed as <hi>low dejection, and debasement of minde,</hi> as ever the <hi>English nation</hi> shewed <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> and <hi>the many</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The first of his causes, whereto he ascribes this low dejection, <hi>he sayes</hi> is to the Prelates, and their fellow teachers, though of another name, and sect, whose pulpitt stuffe both first, and last hath been the doctrine, and perpetuall infusion of servilitie, and wretchednes to all the hearers.</p>

            <p>Of those Markes, which the Scripture gives for the Tryall of <hi>Hipocrites,</hi> what one doe these Rebells want, their pride in assuming holines to themselves, &amp; denying it to others, is held foorth by them on all occasions. <hi>Stand further from me, I am holier, then thou,</hi> was the old Jew, and <hi>Lord I thanke thee I am not, as other men, nor as this Publican</hi> was the reformed Pharisee, &amp; how impiously these Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours appropriate to themselves righteousnes, and selfe denyall, as if none, but Traytours could attaine the kuowledge of such graces? If <hi>righteousnes</hi> consist in <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming God, contempt of his ordinances,</hi> and <hi>scorning the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of his <hi>saints,</hi> these men may lay some claime to it, And if such, as <hi>deny</hi> not themselves the lives, and Estates of others, that <hi>deny</hi> not themselves any power, or pleasure they like, be the true <hi>selfe denyers,</hi> we cannot exclude this Author, and his Masters from attaining it? Doe these men imagine, that vsing the termes of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi> and <hi>selfe denyall,</hi> which they have made much in fashion, induces any man to thinke they esteeme it, whose whole endeavours are <hi>selfe seeking?</hi> Can they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any man, that when our blessed saviour would pay Tribute, though not due from him, that he might not give offence, that the <hi>righteousnes,</hi> which he commended to his servants was not only to deny Tribute, but to fight
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103102:26"/>
against those to whome it was due? Are they greater practisers of <hi>selfe deniall,</hi> that preach warr, and blood ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then obey, then those, that preach <hi>passive obedience,</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> rather then <hi>violence?</hi> Certenly the Alcaron Religion of these men, cannot entitle them to that <hi>Evangelycall vertue of selfe deniall,</hi> and their Actions being soe opposite to it, theit frequent vse of the word proves their confirmed hipocrisie, &amp; resolved impenitencie. He may well wonder, if such <hi>pulpit stuffe,</hi> and such lives, as he mentions should attract soe many from his old <hi>English fortitude.</hi> If he would have assigned a cause for such an eminent change, as he supposes, it should have been some way proportionable to the effect, and his best way had been to have advanced the knowledge, and subtile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and their fellow teachers, but madd men only will beleive him, when he sayes men grosse in their doctrines, and offenfive in their lives per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the most part from the olde <hi>English fortitude,</hi> this shewes only a will to rayle, not ane Argument to prove. It wilbe an hard taske for him to prove men the Tipe of worldlines, whome his Masters have stript of all worldly meanes of living, and exposed them, and their families to begg, or starve. Was there ever a time in any one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when soe many have endured the spoyling of their goods, &amp; vndergone soe greate povertie from plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, rather then renounce their faith, &amp; former profession, as the <hi>Prelates of England,</hi> and their <hi>follow tachers? hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi> and <hi>worldlines</hi> consist not with that condition, and in this Estate they cannot charge the <hi>Prelates</hi> with ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp; virulent language against their persecutors, as the Rebell Ministers vsed against their Governours.</p>
            <p>The people now discerne the difference betweene
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103102:27"/>
the <hi>Prelates</hi> humilitie, and the pride of their present Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posters, and that pride is lesse incident to just Titles, then vsurpations, and that popular insinuations never want am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and arrogance. The Bishopps eminent vertues, and sufferings are soe conspicuous to all men, as cannot be obscured by malicious detraction. But such, as make it their sin to preach <hi>passive obedience</hi> will judge Martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hipocrisie, and patience worldlinesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His next cause he attributes to the</hi> factious inclination of most men divided from the publique by serveral ends, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of their owne.</p>
            <p>Factious inclinations carry men to Rebellion, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and private ends divided from the publique are excentrique to lawfull Government. All changes proceede from these ends, and humours, and submission to Rulers is inconsistent with them. But the Author will have the resistance of parricide, and Rebellion an effect of factious inclination, as patience, and passive obedience to be a worldly doctrine; By his account Rebells only have care of the publique, and all that oppose them have ends divided from it. This humour of seditious Traytours hath been anciently discovered, and yet by the peoples vnhappy credulitie never prevented, &amp; thence it comes, that they complaine of faction, and innovation, while they are busie in contrivinge it. And it is noe wonder, that they, that have found soe many deceived by their dissembled passions, will offer such palpable absurdities to the people, that men oppose them for private ends, &amp; that themselves seeke only the publique, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by blood, and rapine they have got possession of all the wealth, &amp; power of the Kingdome, and treade all vnder foote, that had right to rule They say truly they seeke the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103102:27"/>
but all men see it is for their private ends, and ambition.</p>
            <p>At sirst noe man lesse beloved, noe man more generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, then was the King from the time, that it became his Custome to breake Parliaments at home, and eyther willfully, or weakely betray protestants abroade to the beginninge of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>He would prove the people inconstant, who doubts it? there hath been proofe enough of it in their wretched levitie tossed to, and fro by these Rebells. Bene facere, male audire Regium est, will not be denyed by Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clastes to be a knowne truth, and that it is the common lot of good Princes to be misreported. That his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest: suffered by the privy whispes of ambitious seducers to the credulous vulgar is easily graunted, but it was their ingratitude, not his merit, and the Authors <hi>lesse beloved and more generally condemned</hi> is a supposition voyde, of truth, as the Act it selfe was voyde of dutie, the causes he would have to be <hi>his Custome in breaking Parliaments, and betraying Protestants.</hi> Let vs examine what ground there was, for this aversion from the King vpon either of theis. There were in the time of King James, men, that made ill vse of Parliaments, and insteede of amending what was amisse strived to make the people beleive things were out of order, which they felt not, and to create discontents at the Government. This caused the breach of some Parliaments in that Kings time, his late Majest: finding the people possest with greate jealosies of his match with spaine, &amp; greate desires to breake the peace with that nation in order to the recovery of the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate became the instrument of setling a right vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge betweene the King, and his Parliament in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103102:28"/>
21. th. Yeare of his Raigne. Then was the Treatie of the match, and peace broken, the session of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to the greate joy of the people, and with their greate professions of affection to his late Majest: for soe happy a worke. King James was noe sooner dead, and his late Majest: by the Councell of the Parliament engaged in a dangerous warr, but the seditious contrivers, that had pretended such Zeale for the regaininge of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate, cast about how they might ruine his Majest: by that vndertaking, and in his first Parliament without res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their owne promises, his Majest: merit from them in procuringe their desires, or the publique necessities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully withdrew their assistance from him, and spread abroade rumours against his Government, and when he called a Parliament, the private annimosities, &amp; personall thirst of revenge in some men were entertained in the house of Commons, to exclude the consideration of the pressing necessities of his Majest: affaires, and forreigne agents had their fingers with these leaders in Parliament, to divert all supplies from his Majest: that both Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and all other his allies might be disappointed, and which by that meanes was effected. Its well knowne with what industrie, &amp; difficultie his Majest: in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his necessities advanct releife to the Protestants, and if they were betrayed, the Treason must lie on the Parliaments credulitie to those vnderminers, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke their King in the prosecution of that worke.</p>
            <p>To <hi>betray Protestants,</hi> theis Traytours know signifies much to the people, &amp; therefore they make it a reproach to their King against the knowne evidence of the fact, and all sense, and though they hipocritically pretend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> the world knowes, they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103102:28"/>
doe not asmuch, as give it a <hi>toleration,</hi> for the <hi>Protestants</hi> doe not account <hi>Iohn of Leidon, and the mad men of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Protestants,</hi> &amp; there is noe Religion, but theirs, now current in England.</p>
            <p>This Author sees the cleerenes of the proofe against their malitious allegations of <hi>betraying Protestants,</hi> and therefore descends a little in his termes, and sayes either <hi>wilfully, or weakely.</hi> Could he betray them by impotencie of force, or Councell? thats a new found Treason, that the minde intends not, but its too much respect to such an absurd Calumnie to give it an answeare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on,</hi> all men inveighed against him, all men except Court vassalls opposed him, and his Tyranicall proceedings.</p>
            <p>Inveighinge against the King was vnknowne in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land before such Monsters, as this Author were hatcht by Rebellion, and made their words accord with their Actions, when their lying, and hipocrisie could noe lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger serve turne. Before this time malecontents muttered their censures of Government, and people that beleived them, thought it their sin, and shame to inveigh against their King. Though discontents were nourisht among many, few, or none were soe impudent to inveigh. There is noe Courtier, whose observance to his Prince, or his flatterie of him can binde him to like vassallage, as he is, that serves Rebells by false, and impudent detractions of Rulers. Noe slave soe base, as he, that wilbe hired to murther the fame, and honour of others. There are some Courtiers among his new Masters, whose falshood to their true Master, and base observance of the Traytours to him entitles them to the worst of vassallage. This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor goes an ill way to prove Tyranicall proceedings, when he sayes they were soe opposed. Its strange a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103102:29"/>
should suffer himselfe to be opposed, and how were those Tyranicall proceedings opposed? he will say by disputes in Courts of Justice, &amp; was this Tyrany to admit contestations in ordinary Courts? There was never time, wherein there were not questions of right betweene King, and subject, &amp; is it Tyrany in a Prince to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in a Proces? And doth this Author hold malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and rumours notes of disgrace vpon King, or any other Magistrate? good Princes lives confute detrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and though the people for a time may be deluded, they will come to know a good King in his losse. Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious humours are an Epidemicall pestilence, whose vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence cannot continue.</p>
            <p>This full Parliament was at first vnanimous in their dislike, and protestation against his evill Government.</p>
            <p>This hath not the least colour of truth, and as there was never time, wherien somethinge was not to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, soe in the beginninge of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> there were things of that nature, but not such, as laid Cryme vpon his Majest: Government, nor did the Parliament judge soe, but all corruptions of Courts, Errours of Councell, ill successes of Actions are charged by this Author, as his Majest: ill Government, and every judgment of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in a particular case made a <hi>protestation</hi> against it.</p>
            <p>This Author cannot, but know, that the most <hi>vnami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous protestation,</hi> that ever the Parliament made was to defend the Kings person, honour, and Estate, and they, that made this <hi>protestation</hi> could not be <hi>vnanimous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing</hi> against his evill Government, nor in destroying both him, and it. They protested to defend the lawes of the land, one of which they declared to be, <hi>that the King could doe noe wrong, and that if they should say his late Majest:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103102:29"/>
did, they should speake against the law, &amp; the affection of their owne hearts.</hi> Can this Author finde any roome heere for an <hi>vnanimous protestation of the Parliament against the Kings ill Government.</hi> And yet these were made long after the beginninge of the Parliament, but they, that have noe conscience of speaking truth, have noe shame to be convinced of falshood.</p>
            <p>But when they, who sought themselves, and not the publique began to doubt, that all of them could not by one, and the same way attaine to their ambitious purposes, then was the King, or his name at least, as a fit propertie first made vse of, his doings made the best of, and by degrees justified.</p>
            <p>He is very industrious to finde out causes, why soe many would not be Traytours, why could he not fall into the consideration of the oaths of Alleagiance, &amp; supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, that all members of Parliament take at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance? why could he not thinke on the protestation themselves contrived to defend the King? how did he forget the Commaunds of obedience from God? If him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his Masters had not preferred their ambitious ends before their dutie to God, or man, if they had not thought all oaths, and vowes of noe obligation against their ends, they would never have attributed other mens desertion of their courses to proceede from <hi>ambitious ends,</hi> Could men, that saw these Traytours making such oaths, and protestations of loyaltie with a resolution to breake them, run without remorse with them? Could any, that retained any sparke of Religion, or morall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie concurr with such persons in their lewde courses? But all could not attaine their <hi>ambitious ends</hi> by the <hi>same way. What way?</hi> by destroying the King? wee are sure some have attained their <hi>ambitious ends that way.</hi> And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103102:30"/>
doth this Author thinke, that any men had higher <hi>ends of ambition,</hi> then they, that now have attained theirs? if he doe, he hath very few of his minde, how ever there was <hi>a way to ambitious ends,</hi> but it was not wide enough for all, and who had these <hi>ambitious ends</hi> they, that tooke the way, or they, that left it. They that had obligations of honour, and conscience for their wayes are vncharitably charged with <hi>ambitious ends,</hi> and they, that brake the bounds of dutie, and oaths to attaine their ends, are sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly pretended to seeke the publique.</p>
            <p>How the Kings name, and office hath been made a propertie, and all dutie, and oaths to him a Ceremony by the Traytours is knowne to the world. They have not spared any thing Religious, or Civill. They have made a propertie of the very name of God, of fasts, of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, of prayers, of preaching. They have made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of Justice, of Delinquents, evill Councellours? how often have they made the lords house a propertie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it the Kings hereditary Councell? how often of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie? And how frequently in this very libell doth he make a propertie of the name of Parliament. All men see there hath been nothing reall with them, but their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and crueltie.</p>
            <p>Which begate him such a partie, as after many wiles, and struglings with his inward feares imboldened him at length to set vp his standard against the Parliament.</p>
            <p>After many Messages to the Traytours, that possest both houses of Parliament. After many offers to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish his just rights to take away all jealosies, and feares of his power, which were then pretended. After many Remostrances, of the Calamities, that attend Civill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions. After the vndutiful rejections of al his motions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103102:30"/>
for peace. After the discovery of the vnsatiable ambition, and blood thirstie malice of the prevailing partie. After the violation of all priviledges of Parliament. After the compulsion of the better part of both houses to desert them. After the seizing of his Majest: forts, and Navy, and assuminge the Militia. After the longest, and most provokt patience, that ever King reteined, his Majest: set vp his standard against those Rebells, that tooke the name of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But Iconoclastes remember, you have heere vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded feares to the King, when you come to deny he had any. What wiles were vsed to seduce the people, what jealosies, &amp; ridiculous feares were blowne vp to disorder them is yet fresh in Memory, and he well observes the Kings standard at length set vp, for there was just cause to have done it long before, and much disadvantage to his Majest: by the delay.</p>
            <p>When as before that time, all his adherents consistinge most of dissolute swordmen, and suburb roysters hardly amounted to the making vp of one ragged Regiment strong enough to assault the vnarmed house of Commons.</p>
            <p>What time doth he meane the setting vp of the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard? If his Majest: had sooner declared against the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, he had not wanted a greater <hi>Regiment.</hi> And if he had intended to assault the <hi>house of Commons,</hi> those he had with him were enough to have done it, though those, that then sate had been <hi>armed,</hi> otherwise those members would not have been absent, when he eame.</p>
            <p>For the qualitie of the Kings adherents, as he Phrases it, the persons, that then waited on him were for the most part of better qualitie, then their Rebell Generall, whome now they adore. It was the art of one of the guides of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103102:31"/>
this Treason at that time to stile such, as were about the King <hi>Cavileers,</hi> as a name vnagreeable to the <hi>prickeard Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> whose supersilious demurenes made wry faces at such a name, it being the Custome of false Traytours to lay claime to those behaviours, that may hide their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wolvish disposition, and defame others to ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to themselves, and thence <hi>suburb Roysters,</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute swordmen</hi> became names for such, as followed the King to add terrour to the citizens of London, who have found more pride, crueltie, &amp; robbery among their schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall pretenders to pietie, then any such danger, as was threatned them from such, as followed the King.</p>
            <p>Though this breaker would destroy the reason, and sense of his readers, yet its impossible by such incoherent Arguments, as he produceth. Can he hope any man will beleive him, that such, as followed the King at that time to the lower house, were all, that tooke offence at the proceedings in Parliament, and that none els were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to assist the King against the inivries offred him? That were too vnreasonable considering the Actions both then, and succeedinge, and because he had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get more strength, therefore he could not? But if the number of them, that had a right vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Kings affaires were very small, doth it follow, that the contrary was the better because numerous? The Author refutes it himselfe in his next words, and surely the Argument is more strong against the cause he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that the people, that at first followed them have now left them, then the motions of the people carryed by rumours against their King in the beginning were of any Tyrany, or ill Government in him, for a people are easier stirred vp to follow an evill cause, then reduced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103102:31"/>
they have begun, and the qualitie, &amp; number of such persons, who have lost their lives, and fortunes in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Kings cause in regard of Estate, honour, and integritie, &amp; in Comparison of such, as Rebelled against him, might justly have withheld this Authors hand from objecting against their condition, for his owne partie must admire his impudence having such evidence of the fact.</p>
            <p>After which attempt seconded by a tedious, and bloody warr on his subjects, wherein he hath soe farr exceeded those his arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary violences in time of peace, they, who before hated him for his misgovernment, nay fought against him with displayed Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the field, now applaud him, &amp; extoll him for the wisest, and most Religious Prince, that lived.</p>
            <p>And let Iconoclastes shew other reason of this change, then the evidence of their former mistake. Could it be <hi>ambitious ends,</hi> that made men extoll him, whome they had offended, and that after his imprisonment, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After the defeate of his forces, &amp; noe expectation, but of oppression vpon all such, as expressed a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him? surely he hath abundantly requited his scornefull expression of his late Majest: ragged Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the beginning, that heere tells vs after all his los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and lowest condition, nay after death his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies changed their thoughts of him. <hi>Repentance</hi> is a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reproach among those Rebells, the preaching of that doctrine is worse to them, then <hi>passive obedience.</hi> That there were some, that hated his Majest: may be beleived, their tongues, and pens set on fire of hell have published it to the world. They that hate Christian vertues, hate such, as have them. They, that hate the ordinances of God, hate such, as are appointed to exercise them, But it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103102:32"/>
was only in some fiery schismatickes; whose pride disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with profession of humilitie, at first appeared in their petulancy against their teachers, and at last came to exalt it selfe above all, that is called God. These men perfectly hated the King, that hated all Government, and by this measure Iconoclastes would comprehend all such, as through credulitie, or errour at first fell into this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to beare Armes against their King. Doubtles, they, that after this tedious, and bloody warr became more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to his Majest: descerned not such excesses on his Majest: part, as this Author supposes, for that had not been an Argument for a change. Its manifest to all, that his Majest: Actions in this warr were noe other, then such, as the necessitie of that condition drawes with it, and which the noblest Enemies vse, &amp; his Enemies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce one Act done by him, which themselves did not avow, and yet he sayes in the warr he exceeded his Arbitrary violences in time of peace, and if wee take the word of Iconoclastes, they were not irregular, that the necessary Actions of warr did exceede, and by the way neither Iconoclastes, nor his Masters for their justification have produced one Act of Arbitrary violence against his late Majest: though they make outcryes of Tyrany, and violence to hide the vglines of their villany.</p>
            <p>By soe strange a Method amongst the madd multitude is a sudden reputation won of wisedome by willfullnes, and subtill shifts. Of goodnes by multiplying evill. Of pietie by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to roote out true Religion.</p>
            <p>But is it only the <hi>multitude</hi> he meanes, in whome this strange <hi>change</hi> is? that cannot be, for the severe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his Masters against eminent persons for deserting their side, their purging the Parliament, as they call it, &amp;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103102:32"/>
this Authors succeeding discourse denote others, besides the <hi>madd multitude.</hi> Its a strange Method, that the <hi>madd multitude</hi> should be moved to honour suffering vertue, which themselves had persecuted, were not the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without exception? And its not strange, that such, as knew not the King, but by the sly insinuations of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, should come to the knowledge of their Errours by his eminent vertues in his sufferings. The Method, that Iconoclastes calls strange, is certainely as strange, as the Method he takes to be beleived, for will any man give him credit, that after such an aversion, as he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the people from the King vpon the pretence of his imprudence, and vnsoundnes in Religion, the people should be drawne to an opinion of his <hi>wisedome by will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes. Of goodnes by multiplying evill. Of pietie by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to roote out true Religion.</hi> Though the people were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his late Majest: yet take them at the worst, if they had hated him, because they thought him evill, they would not be drawne to love him, because they found him soe. Its not strange, that the <hi>multitude</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cheated should be ashamed of their errour, and among other seducements, that cry of rooting out Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion made lowdest noyse in the beginning of this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and this Author, and his fellowes have vndeceived the people, for they <hi>have rooted out all Religion,</hi> and left nothing, that hath the face of it. Did the people expect, that all the cry, that was made of Religion was to bring in Arrianisme, Anabaptisme, Socinianisme, &amp; such sects, as they never heard of? was this the Religion they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fight for? Its not strange at all, that the <hi>mad multitude,</hi> who were inflamed with the reputation, and Authoritie of the Parliament comminge to see, that the

orders, votes, &amp; other Trumperie, with which they were led on, were only the contrivance of a factious crew, should abhorre them. That comminge to see the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliaments, and scorne of the peoples Power, which at first was preached to them over their King, they should bewayle their owne miserie, that was soe vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily brought on them by their owne precipitation. The proofes of his late Majest: wisedome, goodnes, and pietie are obvious to the meanest capacitie, and the sublimest vnderstandings have made his vertues, aswell, as his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes their wonder, and though wee have lived in an age, where prodigies of villany are every day acted, this Author is a wonder to wisemen, that makes a Method of lying, and dissimulation: But as the Government of hell is confusion, soe are the Arts and Method of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of that Enemy of mankinde, which confound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and sobrietie, and soe, as they may contradict truth, care not to contradict themselves.</p>
            <p>But it is evident, that the cheife of his adherents, never loved him, never honoured him, nor his cause, but as they tooke him to sett a face vpon their owne malignant designes, nor bemoane, his losse at all, but the losse of their owne aspiring hopes.</p>
            <p>Its evident the Author sayes it, and evident, that it is without ground, or colour of truth. would men, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved him, never honoured him, nor his cause, not only hazard, but loose thier lyues, &amp; fortunes in defence of him, and his cause, and that when the best successes they could hope for, could not equall the perils they ran? If there be either honour, or gallantry in any of those, that call themselves souldiers, &amp; Enemies to their King, and that Rebeilion hath not vnnaturalized them, they would hate such an impudent Parasite, that seekes to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103102:33"/>
please them with such impotent Calumines of persons (whose worth, and honour they have soe often tryed) because they were Enemies to his partie. What Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant designes would he have imagined, such, as noe man ever dreamt of? Doth not this man beleive, that his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders see, he followes the common places of detraction without respect to the proprietie of persons, or Actions? May not this language, that he vsed of any persons, that follow a partie? was there ever in the world an Example of a cause prosecuted vpon more disadvantage on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Kings partie?</p>
            <p>When a King is prosecuted by his subjects, Iconocla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes tells vs they that adheare to him doe it for <hi>malignant designes.</hi> Its certaine the Rebells had noe other, but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>malignant designes,</hi> and whence came malignant designes in such, as opposed them? Because they Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, other men had malignant designes, and if any had malignant Designes, &amp; secrett disaffections to the King, or his cause, doth he thinke it adds any weight to his slanders against the King? will he lay on him the faults of his partie? It seemes he thought some <hi>madder,</hi> then the <hi>multitude</hi> would reade his booke, otherwise such trash would not have been worth his binding vp, but he tooke this to make vse of his Greeke, how the Captive women seemed to lament Patroclus, though in truth their owne condition, and thats the best of his evidence for this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, and therefore he notes the booke, where it is.</p>
            <p>It must needes be ridiculous to any judgement vnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrald, that they, who in other matters expresse soe little feare either of God, or man, should in this one particular outstrip all Precisianisme with their Scruples, &amp; fill mens eares continually with the noyse of conscientious loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103102:34"/>
and Alleagiance to the King, Rebells in the meane while to God in all their Actions besides.</p>
            <p>It is ridiculous to any judgement vnin thrald, that such, as Rebell against their King should pretend they are not Rebells to God, and that such, as professe Precisianisme in crying downe dances, and May-games should expect to be beleived, that they feare God, or man, when in the meanetime they violate all oaths., and duty to God, and man. Have not this generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shewed to the world, that all their outward formalities were noe other, then the washing cleane of the outside of the vessell? Are such fitt judges of conscience, that pretended this Precisia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme he mentions, who made greate scruples, and cases touching Ceremonies, and make noe bones of robbery, murther, and Rebellion? It was our saviours judgement, that they which neglected the greater matters of the law were most properly Hipocrites. Notwithstanding their Precisianisme, that all men of any partie, or societie should be free from scandalous offences, where there are multitudes is without Example, and it could not be hoped in the best, and cleerest cause, that all, that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it should have sincere ends, but none could have lesse feare of God, or man, then he, that would make all guiltie of the Crymes of some, that for particular crymes of men will take the Devills office to accuse all their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He makes it not in among the number of scruples, &amp; cases, whether Rebellion be a sin, but holds it a cleere case to be none? And then why not Idolatry, adulterie, and what not? Its possible, &amp; probable to any judgment vninthrald, that some men may make scruples of some sins, &amp; are peccant in diverse others, and its farr from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have greatest remorse of sins, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103102:34"/>
of whose guilt it most evident to their consciences. But this Author doth not love the noyse of <hi>consciencious loyaltie,</hi> &amp; had rather noe <hi>conscience</hi> then any <hi>loyaltie.</hi> The particular Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of some, that followed his Majest: cause, and made warr against him by their sins have been lamented, and reproved out of Christian zeale, not hipocriticall austeritie, nor can any judgement from thence draw any conclusion against the cause they have followed, nor convince them of sinister ends in following it.</p>
            <p>But is not a Rebell to his King a Rebell to God? The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers among those Rebells have had a long heart rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Rulers, &amp; to take men of from being tender in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against their King, when ever they reproved any sin that terme of <hi>Rebellion against God</hi> came with it, insinuating a distinction of Rebellion against Princes, from <hi>Rebellion against God,</hi> yet Rebellion against Princes is a sin against God, &amp; they cannot free themselves of the greatest guilt of sin, that seduce men into it, &amp; handle the word of God deceitefullie, &amp; such, as open a gate to Rebellion against Princes by transferring the Terme from the most ordinary signification, and applying it wholy to the borrowed sense, seeke to get slaves to hell, not saints to heaven: These were the infusions of their ordinary lecturers, and serves aptly for the Rebell Politiques.</p>
            <p>Much lesse, that they, whose professed loyaltie, and Alleagiance led them to direct Armes against the kings person, &amp; thought him nothing violated by the sword of hostilitie drawne by them against him, should now in earnest thinke him violated by the vnsparing sword of Iustice.</p>
            <p>What meanes he in this? Is it much lesse ridiculous in these latter, then the former? The forme of his Period went, as if he meant to make a gradation to the greater, and I thinke he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, and an errour of the presse; for sure nothing is more ridiculous, then to thinke the King nothing violated by the sword of hostilitie, whome he meanes wee must guesse, for he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103102:35"/>
cannot name them, but by circumlocution. There is a greate difference betweene the <hi>sword of Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>the sword of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilitie,</hi> &amp; betweene the sword of lawles violence, &amp; the sword of justice, &amp; Christians never thought, that any sword drawne by subjects against their King did not violate their loyaltie, &amp; Alleagiance, much lesse, that their professed loyaltie, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagiance led them to direct Armes against the Kings person: If loyaltie leade to hostilitie, it were an ill foundation of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Truth is not lesse wounded by lying, then loyaltie by Armes against the King. Some doubtles foresaw not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of their beginnings, and being deceived by wrong principles fel into vnhappy conclusions, which they suspected not to follow from their premisses, but as they are deceived, that wil sever absurd conclusions from erroneous premisses, so are they, that wil hope to avoyde desperate consequents from ill grounded Actions.</p>
            <p>Doth Iconoclastes hold it necessary, that al they, that have fallen into an impietie, must be impenitent, and because they have been sinners, must they become Blasphemers, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stats? There have beene Examples of many Rebells, that yet abhord the shedding of their Kings blood. But Iconoclastes holds it a dishonour to be a smal villaine, &amp; he that wilbe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked must act Crymes of the highest degree, &amp; if he faile in the last Act, he must be thrust from the stage. The more impious the Actions of Traytours are, the more evident the guilt of them, the greater prayses they give them, and most magnifie that, which is most abominable, &amp; they stile their most outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious crueltie <hi>vnsparing Iustice.</hi> As they will spare noe mans blood to passe to their ends; soe they wil not be sparing in the Titles of their villanies; If this shameles man had not been sensible of the vinversall detestation of the fact, he mentions, &amp; that it was acted in defiance of Religion, law, &amp; Justice, he would never have chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>vnsparing sword
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103102:35"/>
of Iustice.</hi> If Rebels may judge of Justice, the cleerest Justice wil become the fowlest Cryme, &amp; the Justice that inflicts punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their Rebellion the greatest Tyrany; Lawes are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, where Malefactours have got the Tribunall. The <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparing sword</hi> of Rebellion will noe more appeare the sword of Justice, then the <hi>vnsparinge</hi> virulency of a lewde tongue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare a legall condemnation of a lawfull Magistrate. Is it <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparing Iustice,</hi> that gives the sword into every hand, that would kill, and reproachfull language into every <hi>false tongue?</hi> If there be offenders, they, that without authoritie take one them to punish, are more guiltie, then the offender: But wee may be assured, where Rebels, &amp; vsurpers are Judges, innocence wilbe the greatest Cryme, and horrid Murthers vnsparing Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he proceedes to say,</hi> which vndoubtedly soe much the lesse in vaine shee beares among men, by how much greater, and in highest place the offender.</p>
            <p>This neede explication. He spake but now of the <hi>sword of Iustice,</hi> and now sayes <hi>shee beares,</hi> this is fome new speculation. St. Paul sayes the Magistrate beares not the sword in vaine, and this man would have every man the Magistrate, and the sword borne without an hand to strike with it, &amp; Justice exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by a Metaphor. He makes <hi>Iustice</hi> some wandring spirit, that invisibly carries a sword. Whence comes the sentence of this <hi>Iustice</hi> from the mouth of the Cryminall, or the Judge? for by those motions both may lay equall claime to it, &amp; because justice ought to be administrated impartially, such, as are in highest place, &amp; from whome alone the administration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is derived to all others must be murthered by those that are subject to them? Justice hath noe sword, but the power of the lawfull Magistrate, which is called the sword of Justice from the Magistrates duty, &amp; becomes the sword of violence, &amp; murther in the hands of another, but the is men thinke they may vse the sword without a calling as preach, and administer
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103102:36"/>
the Sacraments vncalled. Would Iconoclastes be content, that the Bayliffe of westminster should draw the impartiall sword of Justice against his new Masters, that are in highest place?</p>
            <p>Els Iustice, whether morall, or politicall were not Iustice, but a false counterfeite of that impartiall, and godlike vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iustice</hi> cannot become <hi>noe Iustice,</hi> but the Acts of men may be just, or vnjust, as they follow, or forsake the Rules of <hi>Iustice.</hi> And what greater contempt of Justice, then to pretend it for the ruine of mankinde? What grater reproach to that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vertue,</hi> then to prostitute it to all the execrable Parricides of the world? Doth the Image breaker thinke, that having called it a <hi>Godlike vertue,</hi> he hath well defined it by King kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for that is the sense of his highest place? Its a part of his Method to insinuate an opinion of his esteeme of Justice by the prayse of it, &amp; that such, as he opposes were lesse Zealous of it, but his context shewes, that <hi>Iustice</hi> is defyed by him, and he seekes to wash the bloody hands of the worst of Traytours by casting their odious acts on his <hi>imaginary Iustice.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce comes I conoclastes to assume the expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a <hi>Godlike vertue,</hi> and is soe angry with Iconbasilice? Is there more warrant for his <hi>Godlike vertue</hi> of Justice, then for the <hi>Godlike</hi> office of Kings? And he is as much Iconoclastes of the one, as the other, for they, that will wrest the sword out of the hands of Gods vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents will not sticke to wrest that <hi>Godlike vertue</hi> to their owne impieties</p>
            <p>The only greife is, that the head was not strucke of to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and commoditie of them that held it by the haire.</p>
            <p>Doubtles they, that struke it of did it for their owne <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and commoditie</hi> without respect to Justice, or feare of God, and sure if some were greived, that it was not strucke of to their <hi>advantage,</hi> they, that strucke it of did it to that purpose, and to the fatisfiction of their owne crueltie, and laying the foundation of their Tyrany, this followes from Iconoclastes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103102:36"/>
for that <hi>commoditie,</hi> which some had, and others missed caused the Murther. <hi>They, that hold it by the haire, and they, that strucke it of have cause of</hi> greife, though Iconoclastes, and his Masters, that have, as they thinke the <hi>advantage, and Commoditie</hi> of it, now laugh at their partners, whome they put by, and at the wickednes they acted, and himselfe gives stronger evidence, that the ring-leaders of this horrid Rebellion sought their owne <hi>commoditie, and advantage,</hi> then can be supposed of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant designes</hi> in any of his Majest: partie.</p>
            <p>Which observation, though made by a common Enemy, may for the truth of it heereafter become a proverbe.</p>
            <p>Wicked Actions are not the lesse odious for Companie, and the observation, which it seemes he intends, that some of their partie, that now forsake them, were equally guiltie with them of the Kings death, will noe way excuse them, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that high degree of impietie. But why is the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator called a <hi>common Enemy?</hi> Why is he more an Enemy, then they, that reproach the present Murtherers, as much, as he? Their Enemies are now all man kinde, and such, as beleived not their intentions, nor Actions cannot be deceived of them now they are defended by this Author. If that observation <hi>become a proverbe,</hi> will not the wickednes of theis Murtherers become a Proverbe to denote the greatest degree of villany?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as to the Author of those soliloquies, where it were the late King, as is vulgarly beleived, or any secret Coadiutor, and some sticke not to name him, it can add nothing, nor shall take from the weight (if any be) of reason, which he brings.</hi> How the Champion traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his ground. At first he looked with greate scorne to have such an <hi>Antagonist,</hi> as a King, then he condescends <hi>to take vp the gantlet,</hi> then as an induction to his Trayterous reproaches craves excuse for <hi>not vsing Courts hip,</hi> &amp; now he makes a doubt, whether the King, or some <hi>coadiutor be Author of those soliloquies,</hi> and he sayes <hi>some sticke not to name him.</hi> Truly its noe secret, or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103102:37"/>
strange thing, that there be not men wanting, that would not <hi>sticke</hi> at any Action, or word against the King. Is it the neerer truth, when some sticke not to name the man, when Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clastes <hi>stickes</hi> not at soe many vntruths? He, that reades this Authors booke will rest assured, that he will <hi>sticke</hi> at the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of nothing, that may dishonour his late Majest: But its strange he thought his insinuation of any weight, that some <hi>sticke</hi> not to name him, when all men see the licence taken by so many lewde persons, &amp; noe restraint from saying any thing against the King, whereat should they <hi>sticke,</hi> their impudence is commended, and rewarded? Would they <hi>sticke</hi> at truth, thats out of fashion in the new state? But perhapps they <hi>sticke</hi> to name a man, least they have a conviction from him, or some els, that could discover the Circumstances about it. But since he makes a scruple, if there be not reason in the booke, why is he soe vnwilling to admit the King to be the Author, surely it were for his advantage to make the King author of such a booke, and if they were a <hi>Coadiutors,</hi> why doth he lay his weakenes, or errours, as he pretends vpon the King. The Author doth not add, nor take away from the reason in the booke, but the booke commends the Author, and shames the answeare.</p>
            <p>But allegations, not reasons are the maine contents of this booke, and neede noe more, then other contrary allegations to lay the ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before all men in an even ballance.</p>
            <p>The allegations in his Majest: booke are either such, as are only knowne to himselfe, or such, as were evident to all men by the light of reason, or notorietie of Actions. And Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clastes vainely flatters himselfe, that his contrary allegations wilbe of any weight to move the scale. Sober men take his ostentation of confidence rather as an effect of frensy, then a perswasion of reason, But through his whole booke he offers allegations against apparent rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:103102:37"/>
Though it were supposed, that the Testimony of one man in his owne case affirminge, could be of any Moment to bring in doubt, the authoritie of a Parliament denying a contrary allegation against this, would weigh downe the ballance in most mens judgment.</p>
            <p>The periuries, impostures, cruelties, &amp; devastations of those he calls the Parliament are soe knowne, &amp; common abroade, that the mention of them is a name of infamy, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all credit from their Actions. Their owne journalls tell the world, that they never speake truth, but for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and omit noe falshood, that will serve their turne. But doth Iconoclastes thinke any Parliament infallible, or that all men condemned by Parliament had Justice done them? He wil then finde, that they condemne one another, and for this last misnamed Parliament, their bloody executions have such apparent markes of Injustice, and crueltie, as themselves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it, vnles they will deny the records themselves have made, &amp; the Testimony of former Parliaments. There are in his Majest: booke many particulars, that the Parliament nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor could deny, and through the whole booke the Author hath produced few, or none of their denyalls. There hath been much vse made of the name of Parliament, but the Author must thinke he hath an inchanting pen, if after the murther of the king, abolishing the Lords house, plucking out the members from the lower house, prostituting the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Parliament to the lawlesse multitude, and packing the Roome with a few meane persons, eyther terrified by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, or flattered by promises, he can perswade any, that such a Company sitting on the vsuall seates of the lower house be the Parliament, he may as well give the name of Parliament to a Parish vestry, as that Convention, all the odds is the place of their meetinge.</p>
            <p>But if these his faire spoken words shalbe heere fairly confronted, and laid parallell to his owne farr differing deedes manifest, &amp; visible to the whole nation, then &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:103102:38"/>
His Majest: words he sayes are <hi>faire spoken,</hi> and will appeare sincere against al the fowle spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> words of this author to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them; And his actions are soe wel knowne to the whole nation, as he doth in vaine appeale to them, as witnesses of the truth of those false, and incongruous Calumnies, that he hath produced. His Majest: Actions being laid parallell to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors different expressions shew the lewdnes of the Libellers impudence, that will appeale for the truth of what he sayes to those, that best know the contrary, and in a case, where the evidence of the fact excludes all appeale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Author concludes,</hi> that wee may looke on them, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge shall persist to give to bare words more credit, then to open Actions, as men, whose judgment was not rationally evinced, &amp; perswaded, but fatally stupified, &amp; bewitched into such a blinde, and obstinate beleife, for whose cure he sayes it may be doubted, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any charme, though never soe wisely murmured, but whether any prayer can be availeable.</p>
            <p>If after the reading of this Authors booke any man thinke him a modest man, that he hath dealt ingeniously with his Majest: booke, or person, he may be sure, that such a person were not <hi>rationally evinced,</hi> but eyther maliciously <hi>prepossest,</hi> or stupidly <hi>infatuated,</hi> and neither vnderstood words, nor Actions, And this Author meanes not to cure, but to charme expressing his delight in the terme of <hi>murmuringe,</hi> which was the Custome of witches in their <hi>Charmes,</hi> never vsed by servants of God, though wicked men are compared to the deafe adder, whose eare is stopped to the <hi>murmuring Charmer,</hi> as theirs to the holy advice. But Iconoclastes may aswell hope to turne men into ftones by his absurd assertions, or into serpents by his lewde reproaches, as perswade men of his reason, or honestie. We know the <hi>prayers</hi> of the wicked are abominable, aswell, as their wilfull falhood, and slander, &amp; while he seekes to place those, that will not be led by him, among those that <hi>Charmes,</hi> cannot cure, nor <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> profit, declares his <hi>prayers,</hi> noe other, then Charmes, and himselfe a man, that can neither cure, nor pray, and sets prayer among those things he scoffes at, aswell, as the Titles of him, that is only to be prayed to.</p>

               <p>That his Majest: intention could be apparent to all knowing men, must have better Authoritie, then this Authors word to be beleived. His Majest best knew his own intentions, and ought to be credited against the Malicious conjectures of such, as seeke matter of slander against him to shelter their owne impieties, never King of England shewed greater affection to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then his Majest: and never King found greater ingratitude. His frequent coming to Parliaments in his Fathers Raigne. His many good offices done the houses, and the larg acknowledgments of their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him are vpon the Records of both houses. Vpon the death of his Father he instantly called a Parliament, seeking to continue the same vnderstanding betweene him, and his houses, as there had been in the time of his Father. He had then entred into a dangerous warr with Spaine vpon the Parliaments Councell, was in preparation of a greate fleete, stood charged with a greate debt left on him by his Father, besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des deepe engagements to his Allies abroade, the supplies the then Parliament gave him were two Subsidies, he then desired an addition

only of fortie thousand pound, which was refused him. If any man shall say now, that the King called not that Parliament of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, because he was discontented to be so dealt with by them, knowing men wil hardly beleive him, &amp; such men, as are justly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with factions in Parliament, might truly affect them, when they are rightly disposed, and this Sentence, which I conoclastes holds so inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious imports not that, which his false Augurie Prognosticates, for though his Majest: received provocations, and causes of dislike from severall Parliaments, it followes not, that he could have no intention to call one, when there was a probabilitie of removing the causes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer disorders, which his Majest: expresses in his ensuing discourse.</p>
               <p>The inclination of a Prince is best knowne by those next about him, or by the current of his Actions. These neerest this King were Courtiers, and Prelates, and it was their Continuall exercise to dispute, and preach against them.</p>
               <p>For the Actions of others Iconoclastes would thinke them a weake proofe of his intentions, though the persons were very neere him, and though there were preaching, and disputes against the proceedings of some Parliaments, its no proofe of the Kings intentions, nor theirs, that vsed them against the right vse of Parliaments, and the proceedings of some Parliaments might give just occasion to men to say <hi>the King (they hoped) would have no more neede of them</hi> and it is a very greate happinesse of any state not to neede them, the necessitie of them proceeding from want, and danger, and there was a time, when people held Parliaments a burthen to hem, and those in Parliament claimed it, that they were not bound to attend the Parliament above fortie dayes, and our owne stories tells vs of an <hi>indoctum Parliamentum, and insanum Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> And doth Iconoclastes thinke, that all such, as were out of love with such Parlaments had no affection to any.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>(he sajes)</hi> but the Coppy, which his Parasites had industriously ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his owne words, and Actions, who never called a Parliament, but to supply his necessities.</p>
               <p>Such, as have observed the inclinations of persons neere his Majest: finde non greater Parasites, then such, as proved Traytours to him, and Parasites are not wanting to other powers, as wel, as Kings, for we finde by this Author what men will do to please their Masters eyther by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitiousnes to their persons, or the performance of villanie against others. This Author spends his mouth in vaine following his common place of Parafites, and Courtiers, when the Actions he mentions are so farr from reflecting vpon his Majest: as they leave the blemish vpon the Relatour. That his Majest: had necessities, when he called a Parliament is knowne to all, &amp; the causes of them, but that he was ready all wayes to heare, and redresse the just greivances of his people could never yet be contradicted by the experience in any Parliament, al though the Author say, <hi>having Supplied these, he suddenly, and nominiously dissolved
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103102:39"/>
it without redressing any one greivance of the people.</hi> But if the Parliaments never presented to him on greivance to be redressed, which he denyed, where lies the ignominie? It seemes the Author takes not the petition of right to be of that nature, for that was graunted by the King, and that concession of his was then judged as greate an Act to the redresse of greivances, as ever King of England graunted his people. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest: summoned three Parliaments before the short Parliament at the beginning of these troubles, and in non of these were there any grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances presented by the Parliament to the King to be redressed, but that petition of right, vnles a Remonstrance against the Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham be reckned in that number, and if the people, had just grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to be redressed, they had just cause of complaint against those Conventions, and of late repentance for their credulitie, that depended so much on them, that so little regarded their Sufferings. If we looke vpon the length of time, wherein these Parliaments sate, wee shal finde sessions concluded, &amp; diverse good lawes made in the like space of time in the Raignes of former Kings, and whoever lookes to the journalls of the houses in these Parliaments of his late Majest: or whoever was present in them must confesse, that those, that governed in the lower house minded nothing lesse, then the redresse of greivances, or making of lawes, which were formally talked of to entertaine time, while pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate annimosities, and personall revenges were made the sole busines of importance, &amp; in the space of fower moneths no one greivance was prepared to be presented to his Majest: and Iconoclastes heapes vp vntruths without respect to the apparence of their detection, for this first Parliament was so far from being suddenly dissolved after the King was supplyed, that the greate Plague not permitting them to sit longer at west minster, his Majest: adiourned them to Oxford, and in ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Where was the <hi>Ignominie?</hi> Had not his Majest: a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall right to do it? And if the houses would not agree in the redresse of greivances, and supply of the necessities of the Kingdome, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance would prove ignominious, not their dissolving.</p>
               <p>Sometimes chusing rather to misse of his subfidies or to rayse them by illegall courses, then that the people should not still misse of their hopes to be releived by Parliaments.</p>
               <p>Iconoclastes in his Preface talked of laying parallel actions to words, and heere he vses words of actions, that never were, for among those Parliaments of his late Majest: where can he finde a number to make vp his <hi>Sometimes,</hi> vsing a language, as if the King had called as many Parliaments, as he had raigned yeares? And where can he finde, that the King chose to misse his subsidies, that the people should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103102:40"/>
by Parliaments. Two of the Parliaments are already mentioned. In the third, where he had non, he was so farr from chusing to misse of his subsidies, if he might have had them, that his reiterated Messages to the then house of Commons to prepare their greivances, that he migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And after the house of Commons had declared, that they would supply him <hi>in such a way, and in so ample a measure, as should make him safe at home, and feared abroade,</hi> they agreed vpon the number of subsidies, but voted, that the Bill should not come into the house, till their <hi>greivances</hi> were answeared. His Majest: sent them there vpon severall Messages to hasten them to present the <hi>greivances,</hi> which nothing wrought on them, but without any reason after long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they denyed to have the bil of subsidies brought into the house. Its wel known, that no Kingdome had lesse <hi>greivances,</hi> then that of England vnder his late Majest: And the people were perswaded into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of greivances, not by sence of Suffering, but the disputes of Pragmaticall Incendiaries, and they would have rested quiet, had they not been seduced by such Craftsmen, and there is no on thing, that this breaker can name for a <hi>greivance,</hi> which his Masters, that now Lord it, do not encrease.</p>
               <p>The first he broke of at his coming to the Crowne for no other cause, then to protect the Duke of Buckingham against them, who had accused him, besides other hainous Crymes, of no lesse, then poysoning the deceased King his Father.</p>
               <p>This Author takes himselfe not concerned in speaking Truth, for the publike Records of the Kingdome, and some late declarations of the pretended Parliament would have held his hand from this false as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, if he had valued Truth at the rate of perusing them, for the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> was not at all accused by the first Parliament of the King, nor in any Parliament for poysoning the deceased King. He might have found, that in the second Parliament of the King, Among other Articles against the <hi>Duke of Buckingham,</hi> he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for a <hi>Transcendent Presumption, and of dangerous consequence</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Phisicke applyed to the deceased King, but the malice of such, as hated the Duke of Duckingham did not extend to an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of poysoning the deceased King, yet the venome of Treason in this Author makes him madd, and say, that a fact <hi>of presumption, and of dangerous consequence</hi> was <hi>a poysoning.</hi> If such were the wisedome of a house of Parliament to call poysoning of a King, a presumption of dangerous consequence neither King nor people neede be troubled to want their Councell. This is the first instance, though not the first
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103102:40"/>
falshood of Iconoclastes, but to the matter of what he sajes in that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Parliament, wherein the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> was accused, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest: by Message to the lower house told them, he was well pleased they should proceede against the Duke of Buckingham they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly give vp their Articles to the Lords, the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> made his answeare, which was sent down to the Commons, who being vnable to reply to it, such, as then swayed the house contrary to the Councell of a greate number of the most experienced amongst them resolved to hinder al proceedings, and necessitate the King to a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Parliament. This is no secret, the journall bookes of that house sufficiently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>vince it.</p>
               <p>Still the latter breaking was with more affront, and indignitie put vpon the house and her worthyest members, then the former.</p>
               <p>This appeares not by his subsequent reason, but if this breaker had thought either the <hi>dissolving of Parliaments, or indignitie, and affront to members</hi> any offence, why does he take on him the defence of those, that have <hi>Ignominiously</hi> excluded the whole house of Lords, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Commons, and among them some, whome he termes the <hi>worthiest persons</hi> in the Parliament he speakes of, but his reasons, and narrations are of the same stuffe; And if any man compare the <hi>affronts,</hi> and <hi>indiginties</hi> offered his Majest: by some persons in parliament, and his proceedings against them, he will judge, that their provacations exceeded his passion, and their owne sufferings.</p>
               <p>In so much, that in the fifth yeare of his Raigne in a Proclamation he seemes offended at the very Rumour of a Parliament divulg'd among the people, as if he had taken it for a kinde of slander, that men should thinke him that way exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable much lesse inclined.</p>
               <p>What strawes this man pickes vp. If the King did seeme offended at a factious <hi>Rumour,</hi> doth it follow, that he held it a Scandall to act that, which was <hi>Rumoured.</hi> Because a King doth forbid <hi>Rumours</hi> of his intended Actions, doth he not therefore intend them? And must his Councells be the subject of common <hi>Rumour?</hi> It is a factious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to spreade a Rumour of a parliament, before the King please to declare it, and tends to the precipitation of his Councells by sedition. But as his premisses are <hi>(he seemes)</hi> so his conclusions are <hi>(as if)</hi> and men may as well beleive him on his bare word, as such inferences he appearing inexorable to speake Truth, or forbeare slander.</p>
               <p>And forbidds it, as a presumption to prescribe him any time for Parliaments that is to say, eyther by perswasion or petition, or so much, as the reporting of such a Rumour, for other manner of Prescribing was at that time not suspected.</p>
               <p>His Majest: therein forbad no more then the law forbidds, and accounts it a presumption to <hi>Prescribe</hi> him any time for Parliaments. But such, as have destroyed King, and Parliament would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103102:41"/>
have it esteemed strange, that they should not prescribe what they list, and the breaker, that would have the King <hi>Prescribed</hi> will allow non to <hi>Prescribe</hi> his now masters. His explanation signifies nothing, for doth he thinke, that the King ought to be petitioned, or perswaded by every on, that will, or that the spreading of a Rumour is a fit mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He endeavours to defame the King for restrayning popular licence, and Sedition, and when he seekes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Tyranny of his Masters, he reproaches the people with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, and violence; And the wayes of <hi>Prescribing</hi> by him mentioned were vnorderly, and by him particularised as Plausible, not sound, <hi>other manner of Prescribing was then not Suspected,</hi> he intends the force of a scotts Army, and though he commend that way of Prescribing, and attribute the calling of the Parliament to it, and accuse the King for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting it, yet he will charge the King with beginning the warr.</p>
               <p>By which feirce Edict, the people forbidden to complaine, as well, as forced to suffer began from thence foorth to despaire of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>The people have now greater cause to <hi>dispaire of Parliaments</hi> then ever they had in the time of his late Majest: for if these men prevaile, they are sure never to have more, for they professe to introduce a new form of Government which hath nothing of the Parliament of England &amp; however the people by seditious practices, or false apprehensions <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired of Parliaments,</hi> that proves nothing of his Majest: inclination, or aversenes to Parliaments. How an edict can be called feirce, where no punishment of the breach of it appeares to be denounced, nor any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie ensuing it, cannot be imagined, but its well knowne what Titles this Author wil give to any of his Majest: Actions respecting only the reproachfullnes of the Termes, not their proportion, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Where vpon such illegall Actions, and especially to get vast summs of mony were put in Practice by the King, and his new Officers, as Monopolies, compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive knighthoods, Coate, Conduct, and Shipmony, the seezing not of on Nabaoths Vineyard, but of whole inheritances, vnder the pretence of forrest, or Crowne lands, Corruption, &amp; bribery compounded for with impunities graunted for the future, as gave evident proofe, that the King never meant, nor could it stand with the Reason of his affaires ever to recall Parliaments.</p>
               <p>All the pretences of Tyranny, and oppression, wherewith the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells have sought to maske their disloyaltie are reduced to this on summe to get money. That Princes must have supplies from their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople for support of the Kingdome cannot be doubted, and where the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103102:41"/>
lawes have given the King a richt to demaund money of particular persons in certanie cases, or of the whole people, theis are no illegall exactions, but due debts. The King of England is entitled by law to diverse dues from his subjects, and of such things his learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and his Judges have the care, that he loose not his rights, and they are bound by oath to preserve them, &amp; if in any cases they saile in their judgment, their King cannot be guiltie of illegall exactions in follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their Councell, and of such nature are the particulars he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnles Coate, and Conduct money, which had been disbursed by the Counties for the present, where souldiers were raysed, and was of inconsiderable value and to be repayed, and only of practice in case of warr when necessitie requires greater contributions, and such Actions, as theis the best Governments could never avoyde, and those formes of Government, which theis Rebells Preferr before Monarchy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nairly practis, but they must supply with exclamations, what they want of matter, and having broken all bounds of dutie, Justice, and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they seeke to make the common meanes, which necessitie compells Governnours to vse for publique support, the height of oppression, and Tyranny. The vast summs received by all the wayes were farr short of that greate charge, which the Kingdome required, and of what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings had received in the like space, but inconsiderable in regard of the present exactions. He resembles the legal proceedings in cases of civil right to Nabaoths vineyard; so as al suites for recovery of deteined rights is the getting of Nabaoths vineyard, but they that by the blood of many Naboaths have gotten their inheritances would have Civill Controversies, not bloody murther the sin of Ahab. <hi>Corruption, and bribery compounded for</hi> with impunitie for the future is a denomination, which cannot be fixt to any Actions of Majest: That his Majest: hath a power to pardon was never denyed, and therefore no act of grace in that kinde can be illegall, but this, which they call corruption, and bribery was no other, then the fees, which some officers received, and were questioned to be above their due, &amp; had they been convict, their mulct was pecuniary, and due to the King. They vrged long Custome in their defence, and in a case of that nature, where only errour, not corruption, or bribery can be admitted, it was neerer to justice, then favour to forbeare prosecution; And as the fact was not illegal, so had it been, it was only theirs, by whose Councell it was done, and theis men, that professe such zeale against corruption, and bribery, pretend, that it was necessary to take away the starr chamber, where such Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were punisht, and from whence comes it, that it could not stand with his majest: affaires te recall Parliaments, when his Majest: desired to continue nothing, but what was necessary for the Kingdome?</p>

Parliament could save the people, it must necessarily be his vndoing.</p>
               <p>The King had no interest, but that, which was common to the people with him, and nothing, that was their interest could be opposite to his. The people were very farr from any such apprehensions of being <hi>Destroyed,</hi> or that they might not be saved without the <hi>Kings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing;</hi> And wherein could the King foresee his vndoing by Parliament, must he necessarily foresee, that a Parliament would follow Traytours against him? Or must he necessarily foresee that a Parliament would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake an illegall, and vn just power? Must he necessarily foresee, that a Parliament would produce a Rebellion, when no Action was desired to be continued by him, which was not according to law, nor any greivance duely proved vnredressed? But because in the Parliament, which he called a faction destroyed him, and hath vndone the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, therefore Iconoclastes would have it plainely to be foreseene. Such, as know the difference of the last from former Parliaments, know likewise, that it was not from the condition of the Parliament, but the conjuncture of affaires at the time of calling it, that produced those wicked effects filling the mindes of many with ambitious thoughts, and desire to lay the foundation of their private greatenes in the publique ruines. It is impossible, that the <hi>interest</hi> of a King can have an opposition to that of his <hi>people</hi> which is vainely fancied hy him, or that any thing by him alledged should worke such opposition. And although there have been disputes in Courts, and Parliaments touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profitts, and rights of the Crowne, yet before this Rebell ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, non were so shameles to pretend them causes of the subjects violence, and necessarily destructive to the King, or people, which had the people imagined would have been the issue of a Parliament, they would have had a greater aversion to it, then Iconoclastes supposes in his late Mejest: And as the preservation of the people is the Kings, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> so his preservation is theirs, which the people now finde to late, and could not foresee, that such, as made vse of the pretence of their interest, minded it least.</p>

               <p>Iconoclastes is very industrious to shew, that he can expresse the malice of his heart with his pen, and can give false denominations to Actions with greater confidence, then true, where it may advantag his Masters.

But not contented with the false appellations of his Majest: Civill Actions, he proceedes to defy, and reproach his Actions for preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and defence of his Kingdome, and calls it an injurious warr to resist an invading Enemy. That the Scotts were entred neere a hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mile into the Kingdome, at the time he mentions, he cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and to call the warr injurious on his Majest: part cannot come from any, that thinkes any thing injurious, that Rebells commit, or any thing just that Governours commaund. When any Actions are rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of his Majest: against the Scotts, the Traytours call them vnjust, and amplifie their slander with the Circumstance of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. When the Scotts offer obedience to the King, or he concurr with them, they decry such Actions, in respect they are of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, thus shifting, saying, and gainsaying to deceive the people. If there any yet remaine, that will trust such common Cheates. His col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that <hi>necessitie,</hi> and not choice brought the King to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followes not from any of his premisses. His Majest: doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>necessitie</hi> of his affaires from moving him to call the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: When he sayes, that <hi>be called the Parliament not more by necessitie,</hi> then his owne choice, doth he exclude <hi>necessitie,</hi> or affirme his owne choice only without consideration of Circumstances. Parliaments ought not to be called, but vpon greate occasions, and their too often Convention is a burthen, not an ease to the people, and such was the judgment of the late Parliament at the beginning. It is not new, that <hi>necessities,</hi> have caused Kings to call Parliaments, which yet was never made an Argument to prove their owne vninclination to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

That those <hi>twe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue subsidies</hi> were demaunded to maintaine Scotch warr hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of truth, it being not at al propounded; And as it had been a sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and perverse disposition to have condemned the warr against the Scotts, when they were in preparation to invade England, so it is as shamelesly said by Iconoclastes, that it was <hi>condemned and abominated by the whole people.</hi> Himselfe if a wicked obduration had not made him love lying, must have conffessed, that the late Earle of Essex, though afterward in Rebellion against the King, with greate demonstrations of Zeale, and affection to his Majest: went a Commaunder in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; And if we respect the qualitie, or number of noble, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons that engaged themselves in that first warr, our stories have rarely remembred an Army, that went into Scotland of greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eminent persons, so as Iconoclastes hath just cause to condemne, and abominate himselfe for the Lewdenes, and evidence of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and if the then Parliament had not been abused by some repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting his Majest: desires, the designes of such, as meant to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the breach of that Parliament had been disappointed, and the Calamities ensuing had been prevented; And as there were no greivances then in the Kingdome, but might admit longer delay of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, then the publique necessities of supply, so his Majest: might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demaund subsidies in the first place with promise to redresle their greivances afterwards; And Iconoclastes too late observes the order of that demaund of his late Majest: to be amisse, when the late Parliament graunted so many subsidies for the Scotts without expectation of any such promise.</p>
               <p>Which when the Parliament, who judged that warr it selfe on of their maine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103102:43"/>
greivances, made no haste to graunt, not enduring the delay of his impatient will, or els fearing the conditions of their graunt, he breakes of the whole session and dismisses them, and their greivances with scorne and frustration.</p>
               <p>That the Parliament judged that <hi>warr</hi> any of their <hi>greivances,</hi> that never mentioned it in their debates, or resolutions is fit for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Author only. But if the Parliament had judged that warr one of their maine greivances, the rest, whereof so greate noyse hath been made, will hardly be thought weightie. This warr was then new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun, the King had received no fupply from the people for the charge past, and could this be a maine greivance? Wee see at what rate this man makes greivances, and to what ordinary accidents he applies his exorbitant expressions. The then Parliament would not have been slow in his Majest: supply, if some false Ministers had not interposed, and some seditious persons had not plotted to impose a necessitie vpon his Majest: to dissolue the Parliament. They had not presented him any <hi>greivances</hi> and therefore there could be no such <hi>dismission with scorne and frustration,</hi> as he Phrases it. There were evident tokens of greife, and discontent in his late Majest: that he was necessitated to that act, but there was reioycing, and insolence amongst the turbulent Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for it.</p>
               <p>Much lesse therefore did he call this last Parliament by his owne choice, and inclination, but having first tryed in vaine all vndue wayes to procure mony, his Army of their owne accord being beaten in the north, the Lords petitioning, and the generall voyce of the people all most hissing him, and his ill acted Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Stage, compelled, at length both by his want, and by his feares, vpon meere extreamitie he summoned this last Parliament.</p>
               <p>This man acts the part of a Lord of misrule to stirre the passions of the people with taunts, and abuses, and for his over acted petulant scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilitie fitt to be whipped of the stage. If he had ever given proofe of his owne courage, hee would not thus barbarously reproach his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest: with feares, who was so well knowne to have hazarded his person in so many perills, and these Phrases are the froth of a base insultation, not the censure of a just Ennemy. But why for feare should the King summon a Parliament if he fore saw, as the libeller sayes it would be his vndoing? Could he have greater feares, then that? He hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced one vndue way of his late Majest: to get money for the warr against Scotland, &amp; therefore his repetitions import his impertinence, as well, as his malice but gaine no credit by their frequency. <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hissing,</hi> which the Traytours desired, had been as inconsiderable, and vndutifull, as his assertions are false, but as it no way contradicts, what his Majest: sayes, if the allaying of popular discontents, &amp; recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying mistakes were one end of calling the Parliament, so <hi>the petitioning of the Lords</hi> instructs all reasonable men to thinke, that <hi>feares and wants</hi> were not the <hi>sole cause</hi> of summoning that Parliament and that his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103102:44"/>
choice</hi> was not excluded. And as the <hi>beating of his Majest: Army</hi> had not so disabled him, but that they were in number, and courage superiour to their Enemies, so if his Majest: <hi>choice</hi> had not guided him, he might with lesse hazard in common appearance have tryed the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of a battell at that time, then he did at diverse tymes afterwards. That, which he sayes of the Armyes, being beaten of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord is little to their honour, if it were true, but infamous to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor being false, &amp; if there were any so perfidious to betray their own, and their nations honour vnto strangers, they could not be many, for its a knowne truth, that the most eminent persons in that service, and the greatest number of common souldiers served his Majest: afterward in his warrs, not only against the English Rebells, but the Scotts.</p>
               <p>And how is it possible, that he should willingly incline to Parliaments, who never was perceived to call them, but for the greedy hopes of a whole nationall bribe, his subsidies, and never loved, never fulfilled, never promoted the true ends of Parliaments, the redresse of greivances, but still putt them of, and prolonged them, whether, gratifyed, or not gratifyed, and was indeede the Author of all those greivances.</p>
               <p>It hath been already shewed, how his Majest: was perceived to call Parliaments out of his owne choice, and inclination, and it was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Majest: time, but in the time of Queene Elisabeth, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were said to be only called to give subsidies, there never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting malecontents, and slanderers of the Actions of Princes, and the case may be such, that subsidies may be the cheife motive, to call Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, considering the sufficiency of the lawes in force, and the small number of greivances complained of. Malitious detraction is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with absurditie, and Iconoclastes becoming a Champion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion reckons Tributes, and supplies of the soveraigne by subjects, which is their duty among the number of scandalous sins, and that which was practised by our saviour, and commaunded by his Apostles he calls nationall bribes. This braine sicke, and prophane Libelling can be acceptable to none, but such, as are delighted with the vnhappy distempers of Bedlam. He hath not so much passion to have greivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces redrest, as love to the word, because, as he thinkes, it imports mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter displeasing to the people, who yet are now satisfied, that those, which abused them by the frequent vse of the word greivances, never intended the remedy, but by multiplying complaints sought to leade them into discontents against the Government, whereby they might become Captive to ambitious vsurpers. That, which he sayeth is the true end of Parliaments <hi>to reforme greivances</hi> justly condemnes those, he now calls a Parliament, who, he well knowes sitt to no other end, but to encrease greivances, and in eight yeares time never redressed one. Though Kings take notice of greivances in Parliament, and take, order to redresse them, yet that cannot be called the true end of calling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103102:44"/>
for there are often occasions of calling Parliaments in respect of publique safetie against Enemies, and conspiratours, addition, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of lawes, publique supplyes, the <hi>redresse of greivances</hi> is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall to the Parliament, and the pretence of greivances hath proved the greatest greivance, that ever the people suffered, and his scurrilous objection of <hi>greedy hope</hi> to his late Majest: on whome malice it selfe hath not yet layd such a Cryme encreaseth the Libellers infamy, not the weight of his charge.</p>
               <p>To say therefore, that he called this Parliament of his owne choice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination argues how little truth, wee can expect from the sequell of this booke, which ventures in the very first period to affront more, then one nation, with an vntruth so remarkeable.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>venturing</hi> vpon an <hi>vntruth</hi> in the <hi>first period</hi> be an argument to expect little in the sequell of the booke, what may we expect of this Author, whose whole booke is a confutation of his <hi>first period,</hi> not to descant on the Kings misfortunes? That in seeking to disprove this first period adventured on so many palpable vntruths, and stickes not to pervert the very period it selfe, and affront not only more, then one nation, but all indifferent men? For if his Majest: had been necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either through the disorder of persons to dissolve Parliaments, or for beare them, he might yet call a Parliament by his owne choice, considering, that not the condition of Parliament, but the male volence of some persons were cause both of the dissolution, &amp; forbearance. The often Parliaments in Ireland, &amp; the precedent Parliaments in England to that, which he mentions, maintaine the truth of that <hi>first period</hi> against the many remarkeable falsities of this Image breaker.</p>
               <p>And presumes a more implicit faith in the people of England, then the Pope ever commaunded from the Romish laitie, or els a naturall sottishnes fitt to be abused, and ridden.</p>
               <p>Kings may expect credit to their words from their people, Rebells cannot though experience hath confirmed that if a greate part of the people of England had not followed them with a more <hi>blinde,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate <hi>beleife,</hi> then ever <hi>Romish laitie</hi> did their Pope, they could never have been ridden, and jaded, as now they are. And Iconoclastes could never presume the beleife of his extravagant assertions, if he thought not his readers of worse, then <hi>naturall sottishnes to be abused,</hi> for while they lye groveling vnder the Tyrany of their present oppressours, and lament the losse of their happines vnder the Kingly Government, this man will perswade them out of their sense, and memory.</p>
               <p>While in the judgment of wisemen by laying the foundation of his defence on the avouchment of that, which is so manifestly vntrue, he hath given a worse foyle to his own cause, then when his whole sorces were at any time overthrowne.</p>
               <p>Surely there wiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shewed as little reason, in judging an assertion, as knowledge in military affaires, that made by comparison of this period to the defeat of an army. If his Maj: have <hi>given so greate a foyle to his cause</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:103102:45"/>
by the first period of his booke whence comes the danger, that Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noclastes would prevent? Was this first period vnintelligible without his comment, and what is it to the Kings, cause, whether he called the Parliament of his owne choice, or not. Its very likely his <hi>wife men</hi> heere are the same with his <hi>wel principled men</hi> he mentioned els where, &amp; their principles, or impiety being the same with his, their judgment is as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, as their conscience, and as farr from wisedome, as the libeller from modestie, and if any had such a judgment, they might soone finde their errour, which all others descerne, and such a judgment were a greater foyle to their wisedome, then to his Majest: cause.</p>
               <p>They therefore, who thinke such greate service done to the Kings affaires in publishing this booke will finde themselves in the end mistaken, of sense, &amp; right minde, or but any mediocritie of knowledge, and remembrance hath not quite for saken men.</p>

               <p>He comes now to prosecute his Majest: discourse in pursucance of that period, and first to what his Majest: affirmes of Parliaments <hi>to have allwayes thought the right way of them most safe to his Crowne, and best pleasing to his people,</hi> he sayes we felt from his Actions what he thought of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, or of pleasing his people.</p>
               <p>The people feele now, that, which makes them confesse, that they had just cause by what they felt from his Majest: Actions to be well pleased with them, &amp; to beleive, what he affirmes heere to be his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Parliaments, and if any people were pleased with the ill way of Parliaments, they have seene their errour by the evill consequents, and now thinke the <hi>right way of them only most safe for the Crowne, &amp; them,</hi> and that nothing, but ruine to the Kingdome can be expected from disorderly Parliaments.</p>
               <p>He goes on to that, which his Majest: adds, that the cause of forbearing to Conveene Parliaments was the sparkes, which some mens distempers there studied to kindle. <hi>To this the libeller sayes,</hi> they were not temperd to his temper, for it neither was the law, nor Rule, by which all other tempers were to be tryed, but they were chosen for sittest men in their Counties to quench those distampers, which his inordinate doings had inflamed.</p>
               <p>Is the choice in Counties the law, and rule whereby rempers are to be tryed? And would the libeller have it beleived, that all such, as are chosen in the Counties, are of better <hi>temper,</hi> then the King. If choice be the <hi>law of temper,</hi> why doth he justifie those men, which have affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, scorn'd, and punished such, as have been chosen by the Counties?

We know what fires small sparkes kindle in greate Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and we have felt the flame of them like the sudden eruption of burning Mountaines, when all was quiet, and there were men, that studyed to turne the Parliament into confusion having not the temper to quench, but to enflame.</p>
               <p>Were these men, that were of the two Parliaments in the first yeare of his Majest: Raigne; The first called within two moneths after he begun, the second within twelue, <hi>chosen to allay those distempers, which his inordinate doings had inflamed,</hi> what were these <hi>inordinate doings, that could inflame</hi> so suddenly? We neede not argue this Authors credit from one vntruth, but he would obtaine some credit, if one entire truth could be found in him.</p>
               <p>If that were his refusing to conveene till those men had been quallified to his will, wee may easily conjecture what hope there was of Parliaments, had not feare, and his insatiate povertie in the middest of his excessive wealth constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him.</p>
               <p>His Majest: might with reason exspect, that many, who through errour had caused distempers, might returne to a right minde seeing his temper, and their little reason to desire such Parliaments, as make it their whole worke to divide the peoples affections from the King, and follow the Councells of such, as are malecontents for want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and if men had been quallified to his Majest: will, Parliaments would have had happier, successe, and the people pleased with their agreement, that now groane vnder the miseries of their division. But whence his insatiate povertie in the middest of his excessive wealth should constraine him is not vnderstood, wants, and wealth are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent. This libeller hath greate povertie of sense in the middest of his excessive expressions. He goes an ill way to prove that the King was so vninclined to Parliaments, and that povertie compelled him, if he had wealth certainly that would have kept him from hazarding a course so disliked. He shalbe rich, and poore, that some may contemne his povertie, others may grudge his wealth.</p>
               <p>The King hoped by his Freedome, and their moderation to prevent misvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings. <hi>To this sayes Iconoclastes,</hi> wherefore not by their Freedome, and his moderation.</p>
               <p>The Champion cannot fuffer a King to passe without signifying to him, that there is no difference betweene King, and subject. The King had resolved to vse <hi>Freedome</hi> in his concessions, and hoped they would vse <hi>moderation</hi> in their demaunds. This man would have him say, that they should vse <hi>Freedome</hi> in their demaunds &amp; he would vse <hi>moderation</hi> in his concessions, hath he not made it a proper speech? Will his <hi>wise,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103102:46"/>
and well principled men</hi> thinke him a fit Champion to breake Bell, &amp; the Dragon? But he gives a reason, why the King would speake sense, for <hi>he thought</hi> sayes he <hi>Freedome to high a word for them, and moderation to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He sayes <hi>the King still feared passion, and prejudice in other men, not in himselfe, and doubted not by the weight of his owne reason to counterpoise any faction, it being so easie for him, and so frequent to call his obstinacie reason, and other mens reason faction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had greate reason to feare passion, and prejudice in others, which he had so often tryed, and which they, that then feared not have since found true, and the concessions the King purposed, and performed might make him confident to counterpoyse any faction, but the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler will have it beleived, that he, which graunted more, then any of his Predecessours was obstinate, and they, that demaunded what former Parliaments thought vnreasonable, and impious, had reason. But the King was deceived, that had to doe with Monsters, not reasonable men.</p>
               <p>We in the meane while must beleive, that wisedome, and all reason came to him by Title with his Crowne: Passion, prejudice, and faction to others by being subjects.</p>
               <p>Kings have advantages above others for wisedome, and reason, they are assisted with diverse Councells, and in publique affaires reason must be presumed in Kings, and faction feared in subjects, nature being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to submit, and interests, and partialities incident to all greate Assemblyes, and the detraction from the wisedome of Rulers in the Rebells foundation, and a sure signe of corrupt intentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was sorry to heare with what popular heate elections were carryed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places.</hi> To these words of the Kings he sayes <hi>sorry rather, that Court, letter, and intimations prevailed no more to divert, or to deterre the people from their free election of those men, whome they thought best affected to Religion, &amp; their Countryes libertie, both at that time in danger to be lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were in danger to be lost by a Trayterous conspiracie with an invading enemy, but no other danger imaginable to any. There was never lesse cause to complaine of Court letters, and intimations, nor ever greater mistakes of persons chosen, the Countryes affections to Religion, and libertie making way for the insinuations of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall seducers, and had the Countryes knowne the dispositions of the men they chose, as their Actions have since discovered, they would not have trusted them with their Religion, and libertie, which they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103102:46"/>
have betrayed. This Image breaker declaimes against the violence, &amp; levitie of the people, and heere calumniates his Majest: for observing the popular heate, whereby elections were carryed in some places, it being a most knowne truth, that popular, heate is as frequent vpon such occasions, as any other, witnes the long annimosities between families, and the greate contentions, that arise from such Elections.</p>
               <p>Among the many clamours in the late Parliament, where malice was as busie, as this Author is now to finde out Court letters to divert, or deterre the people from free Elections, there was not one instance produced of such <hi>letters or intimations.</hi> How wickedly industrious many were to blow abroade jealosie, &amp; suspition of the danger of Religion, &amp; libertie, &amp; how causelessely the people in many places were drawne into passion by vaine surmises, is too well knowne, and it is too late, for the Image breaker to seeke to reduce the people into those misopini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they have detected by too deare bought experience, for they well see, that there was no way so certaine to endanger Religion, and libertie, as that they were seduced into, vpon pretence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them.</p>
               <p>And such men they were, as by the Kingdome were sent to advise him, not sent to be Cavilled at, because elected, or to be entertained by him with an vndervalue, and misprision of their temper, judgment, or affection.</p>

               <p>He intended to oblidge both friends, &amp; Enemies, and to exceede their desires, did they but pretend to any modest, and sober sense. <hi>To this he sayes</hi> mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the whole busines of a Parliament, which meete not to receive from him obligations, but Iustice, nor he to expect from them their modestie, but their grave advice vttered with Freedome in the publique cause.</p>
               <p>This man mistakes the whole busines of a Parliament, that would exclude modestie from the advice, and libertie from the advised. The freedome, that the libeller intends is inconsistent with modestie, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, as Monarchy, Trayterous dispositions having an Antipathy to morall vertues. How often have Parliaments made petitions to their King for graces, &amp; were they not oblidged, when they were graunted? But it cannot be expected, that such, as despi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If their advice had been grave, their behaviour would have been modest, and they whose dutie was only to advise, had no pretence to Commaund, and dictate, nor they, that were to receive Justice from their King, to snatch what they desired, and become judges of their owne demaunds. Such as wil not be oblidged by lawes, nor oaths cannot by benefites, &amp; favours, and such, as have robbed a King of his power, grow quickely to that heigth of impudence to deny he had ever any, as this Author, that is so Brutish to affirme, that Kings cannot oblidge their subjects, &amp; thence it followes, that they owe no thankes to God for a good King, as they professe to owe him none for his good Government.</p>
               <p>His talke of modestie in their desires of the common welfare argues him not much to have vnderstood, what he had to graunt, who misconceived so much the nature of what they had to desire.</p>
               <p>His excepting at the talke of modestie shewes how little he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands other modestie, or the right, or practice of Parliament. Is not humilitie a word of larger signification, then modestie, and yet this breaker will make modestie contrary to the nature of the Parliaments desires, and the Kings graunts, when humilitie is the common expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Parliaments petitions to the King. And he might well have said the King vnderstood not, what he had to graunt, if he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his subjects desires to have a modest, and sober sense. Can there be desires of the common-welfare, that exclude modest, &amp; sober sense? But the truth is the desires of the late faction in the name of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had neither modest, nor sober sense, and thence the libeller would inferr it vnnecessary, and it was very farr from the nature of what they had to desire to demaund their Kings Crowne.</p>
               <p>And for sober sense the expression was too meane, and recoiles with as much dishonour vpon himselfe to be a King, where sober sense could possible be so wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Parliament.</p>

And must it be the Kings dishonour, if an Assembly of Parliament want sober sense, how does that recoile vpon him, can he make them otherwise? Iconoclastes lately reprehended his mention of heate in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and now its the Kings dishonour, if the Parliament want so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber sense, was there never experience of a Parliament, that wanted sober sense, or was any man so savage, as to hold sober sense too meane for a greate Councell? Wee have seene not only sober sense, but al Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reason, law, &amp; Justice, wanting in a Parliament, being taken for the prevalent partie, and Histories record it to have happened, more, then once. Kings have been vnhappy in such Parliaments, but the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and infamy rests vpon such Assemblyes, and these Apologists are the Trumpetts of their shame, not the covers of their nakednes.</p>
               <p>The odium, and offences, which some mens rigour, or remissenes in Church, &amp; state had contracted vpon his Government, he resolved to have expiated with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lawes, and regulations. <hi>To this he sayes</hi> the worst misdemeanours of rigour or remissenes he hath taken vpon himselfe, as often as the Clergy, or any other of his Ministers felt themselves over-burthened with the peoples hatred. He instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the superstitious rigour of his sundayes Chappell, remissenes of his sundayes Theatre, that reverend statute for Dominicall Iiggs, &amp; Maypoles derived from the Example of his Father Iames, which testifies, that all superstition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missenes in Religion issued from his authoritie, and the generall miscarriages in state imputed cheifely to himselfe.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>remissenes and rigour</hi> of some men may contract <hi>odium,</hi> and <hi>offence</hi> in the best <hi>Governments</hi> was never doubted, but that this libeller would take occasion from his Majest: intention to expiate them with better lawes, to cast them on his Majest: shewes that this Rebellion arose not from offences in Government, but wicked inclinations of ambition, &amp; Covetuousnes, and that amendments were not desired but confusion. It was just, &amp; honourable, that the King should take on him the defence of his lawes against Sectaries, and the protection of officers, in the exercise of just authoritie, against the hatred of frenitique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The hipocrisie of the schismaticall partie, that professed greate tendernes of conscience, and greife to see Children whipp a top on a sunday, was ridiculous to al sober men, yet theis are the motives to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyle a state. That, which he calls the <hi>superstitious rigour of his sundayes Chappell</hi> is noe other, then observation of the order of the Church of England, which none, but the Bedlam Brownists ever called supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. His Majest: Chappell had nothing in the exercise of Devotion, but what the lawes of his Predecessours had appointed, and this must be his rigour. That, which he calls his sundayes Theatre it seemes are recreations vpon sundayes, and to that he prophanely, and scurrilously adds his Dominicall Jiggs. Can a Christian, that hath respect to the day, make Dominicall the matter of his jest, but having abused sacred titles to impious Actions, they proceede to scoffe with them.

               <p>And doth saint Paul exceede the worst of Kings professing Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme by borrowing to a Christian vse the words of an heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, and poet, did he thereby vnhallow, and vnchristen Scripture?</p>
               <p>His meaning is, as followes afterward, that the King vsed a prayer taken out of S. Philip Sydnies Arcadia. After the first Edition of his Majest: booke, the Printers finding the greate vent of them, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Editions Printed prayers, and other things in the Kings name, not belonging to the booke. Among these prayers, there is a prayer taken out of the Arcadia. That prayer is neither made by a heathen, woman, nor to a heathen God, but is composed by the Author a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian without reference to any heathen Deitie, and the Author is not thought to vnchristen prayer by it, the libeller himselfe saying the booke in its kinde is full of worth, and wit, but as his outcry hath noe cause from the matter, so heere is no evidence of the fact, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest: made vse of that prayer, or popt into the Bishopps hands as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of his exercise, though he might warrantably have vsed it and professed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he goes on to shew what he can say vpon this occasion.</hi> Who would have imagined so litle feare in him of the true alseeing Deitie, so litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the holy Ghost, whose office is to dictate, and present our Christian prayers, so litle care of truth in his last words, or honour to himselfe, or to his friends, or sense of his afflictions, or of that sad hower, which was vpon him, as immediately before his death to pop into the hand of that grave Bishopps, who attended him, as a speciall relique of his saintly exercises a prayer stolne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All men, that have observed this Authors practice hitherto rest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that he hath so litle feare, or reverence of the allseeing Deitie, so litle care of truth, or honour, as he stickes not to charge his Majest: with facts neverdone, and innocent Actions, with transcendent guilt. If his Majest: had vsed the prayer, or delivered it, as he imagines, no
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103102:51"/>
man of Christian sobrietie could charge the fact with Cryme, what one word, or sentence is there in that prayer, which a Christian may not vse, but the Image breaker hath a greate quarrel to al formes of prayer, and by the reason he produces, that the office of <hi>the holy Ghost is to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and present our Christian prayers,</hi> all set prayers want reverence to the holy Ghost, so tender is he of the best reformed Churchs, of whome he so often makes a propertie. And whence concludes he no care of truth in his last words, when the King never spake of it. He aggravates this fact by the person of the grave Bishopp, who had been a Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call leiturgist, had it not been to paint a slander. The laughter, which he conceives is caused by the thought of this, <hi>that he, which acted so Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically should have such a ridiculous exit</hi> might rather strike horrour in the libeller, for his malitious opposition to truth, that will so contrary to his owne knowledge charge him to act tragically, that had governed so mildly, and to have a ridiculons exit, that left the world with so greate pietie, and such vniversall greife of the people for his sufferings, but desperate wretches laugh at the wickednes they act. His Majest: friends have had good experience, that his Enemies, who have spared no paines to traduce him, would not forbeare any occasion of detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Majest: enduring afflictions with admired patience, his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring death with Christian fortitude, his vertuous life, &amp; holy Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, cannot be blasted by an Atheists scorne, nor a Rebells malice.</p>
               <p>His conclusion in the begging of the question, <hi>that it is cleere the King was not induced, but constrained to call the last Parliament,</hi> which by his owne shewing is apparently false, for if there had been such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, the Lords in vaine petitioned, and all the necessities, that he hath supposed may concurr with the Kings inclination to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if necessitie had constrained him to call a Parliament, what should hinder, but <hi>he might avouch in the eares of God, that he did it with an vpright intention to his glory, and his peoples good.</hi> If necessitie of his peoples preservation, or welfare cause him to call a Parliament, may he not vse these words; Whence would the Image breaker have it a cause of trembling, more, then any thing spoken in the presence of God. The permitting mans wickednes is no approbation of it, nor a token of his hatred to those, that are afflicted by it.

               <p>Impieties that were strange heeretofore, are common with this libeller, and it is vnheard of that repentance of an act conceiveded sinfull by the athour, was reproached by any before this Atheist, he never weighed neither repentance, nor confession, if he had, he would never have thought it strange, that his Majest: should confesse, that he sinned in following a multitude to doe evill, and if the murther of the Earle of strafford had been Justice, is it strange, that such, as had acted in it without sufficient satisfaction to their conscienc, should confesse their sin in concurring to such an Action? Was it not an injustice, that was done vnwillingly, and ought it not to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of? If his Majest: sole conscience thought the contrary, was it not sin in him to consent to the fact, and is it without experience, that a single man in an Assembly hath judged the right, and the rest procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the wrong, but he applies himselfe to readers, whose affections, and capacities, are proportioned to his expressions, and therefore his Majest: confession is the strangest, that ever was auricular. He would have them beleive, that his Majest: discourse in this Chapter was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish auricular confession, els his Jnigly of auricular, had no congruitie with a written confession. For the merit of that, which he calls solemne piece of Justice, no age had produced such a solemne, and formall peice of villany, which is by so much more odious, as it had the figures of law, and Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:103102:52"/>
And thus was the welfare, the safetie, and within a litle the vnannimous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of three populous nations, to have attended still on the Singularitie of one mans opinionated conscience, if men had allwayes been so tame, and spiritles, and had not vnexpectedly found the grace to vnderstand, that if his conscience were so narrow, and peculiar to it selfe, it was not fit, his authoritie should be so ample, and vinversall over others, for certainly a private conscience, sortes not with a publique calling.</p>
               <p>The welfare, and safetie of these three populous Kingdomes, had been probably preserved, if they had attended on his Maj: conscience, and what hath been the consequence of that spirit, and grace, which he sayes they found, and was indeede the infusion of impious inclinations into many by the spirit of errour, &amp; disobedience, but the most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, &amp; languishing miserie, &amp; danger, that ever lay vpon the Kingdome. And these graceles miscreants sport at the nam af grace, &amp; prophane the profession of it. He would be vnderstood a litle modest in adding with in a litle to vnannimous, but being weighed, his impudence wil appeare litle lesse in this, then former passages. If the three Kingdomes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in comparison to that small number, that vnderstood the case of the Earle of Strafford, it was a very litle part of the Kingdomes, that made the demaund he mentions, &amp; if he would advantage his cause by the cryes of those, that were stirred vp by the Seditious Seducers, to cry Justice, their giddy wilfullnes, aswel, as ignorance, &amp; lewdenes, wil add litle to the weight, though it encreas the number of these demaunders. But this man thinkes conscience vnfitt for a King, &amp; therefore would not have so narrow a conscience have so large an authority, for he sayes a private conscience sorts not with a publique calling, &amp; declares that person rather meant by nature for a private fortune. The must profest Atheists, &amp; loose debauches, never avowed a greater scorne of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, neither is there an Author extant, that hath adventured so farr vpon the reasons of men, as to complaine vpon a King for Tyrany, and errours in Religion, &amp; with the same breath, charging him with vnfitnes to be a King, for want of a wide conscience. These me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are true to their principles, to make vehement professions of Religion, though they hate it, and in the middest of their prophane fasts, &amp; presumptuous thankes giving, they jeere at al Religion, &amp; conscience, &amp; professe to the world, that a publique conscience ought not to be narrow, nor sticke at any thing, &amp; as their conscience is, so is their practice, &amp; they, that made no conscienc of their loyalty, mak no conscienc of exercising their power.</p>
               <p>He, whose conscience thinkes it sin, to putt to death a Capitall offender, will as oft thinke it meritorious, to kill a righteous person.</p>
               <p>If his Majest: had thought the Earle of Strafford, a Capital offender, he had made no conscience of his death, and this libeller vainely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses conscience of sin, to put to death a Capital offender, which cannot consist, with a conscience so informed, neither doth an erroneous

conscience in sparing blood, as oft thinke it meritorious to kill vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly, though it be nothing to the present purpose, for he can fasten neither vpon his Majest: conscience of sparing a Capitall offender, or killing a righteous person. But in this whereof he repents.</p>
               <p>That the sin of signing the Bill of straffords execution, he would not have matter to trouble the Kings conscience, and his reasons are, <hi>That all men looked vpon him, as one of the most impetuous instruments to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any illegall designe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earle of strafford was a man, that the Seditious disturbers of the state hated, and feared, and sought, vnderhand to rayse the malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of others against him. If any men have so farr lost reason, as to measure the Ministers of Kings by the libells of Traytours, they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely to take the best men for most guiltie, and if a King should sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his faithfull Servants, because they are not looked vpon with a good eye by the multitude, he may not expect to be served by men of fidelitie, or merit, and we have seene, how the peoples lookes have been won, and lost.</p>
               <p>That he had rul'd Ireland, &amp; some part of England in an Arbitrary manner.</p>
               <p>The word. Arbitrary in the beginning of the late Parliament was vsed to scare the people, and made to signifie greate affrightments to them, but that bugbeare is now growne rediculous to children, for all men see, that in all places of Government much is left Arbitrary to the Governour, and it was evident to the world, that the Earle of strafford did nothing in an Arbitrary manner, without President of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, and the Judges in Courts of equitie, might be aswell made Cryminall for proceeding in an Arbitrary manner as he. That he had endeavoured to subvert fundamentall lawes was a supposition, not a fact, and if the Image breaker looke over the Articles, where with he was charged at his Tryall, he will finde nothing of such a Cryme. <hi>To subvert Parliaments, and incense the King, against them</hi> was not as much, as vrged against him at his Tryall, that Article being declined by his accusers in regard of knowne falshood, and that the Earle of strafford advised the King, to call the former Parliament. <hi>That he had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make histolitie betweene England, and scotland</hi> was a legend devised for vulgar temper, not rationall consideration, for both Kingdomes being vnder one King, they must be Rebells in either Kingdome, that make warr against one another without him, and what dreamer can fancy that any Minister of state, that were affected to the Kings desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as this libeller supposes the Earle of strafford to be, would stirr vp hostilitie betweene the nations. They have not yet adventured to charge the Earle of strafford with stirring vp the scotch hostilitie, and if he endeavoured to refist them, is that <hi>to make hostolitie be tweene the nations,</hi> It hath been the practice of these Rebells to stile men incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, and malignants, that opposed their Rebellion, and such evill
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103102:53"/>
Counsellours that advised any course to prevent their attemps, and the following confusion but though this vaine delusion were cast abroade among the people, it was never offred, as a charge against the Earle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had councelled the King, to call over that Irish Army of Papists, which he had cunningly raysed to reduce England, as appeared by good Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony then present at the consultation,</hi> is vnseasonably remembred by the libeller after those Rebells, whome he serves, have severall times drawne in forraigne Armies into England, reduced the nation to serve an vsurped power, set vp an Arbitrary Government, subverted the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall lawes, and destroyed both King, and Parliament. It may astonish Knowing men to reade this Author, objecting Capitall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Earle of strafford, and numbring vp for instance the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions himselfe defends: soe as it cannot be an humane errour, but hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-fury, that hurles him into such mad contradictions, and its worth the observing, that to this particular he adds, as appeated by good Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony then present at the consultation, well Knowing, that the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was not only single, but subject to most just, and apparent excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in regard of knowne enmitie, and former prevarication in severall examinations vpon oath, and it no way helpes a false Testimonie, that he knew the truth, or that he was present at a fact, whereof he makes an vntrue relation, and if the Earle of strafford had councelled the King to make vse of the Jrish Army in either Kingdome in case of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, how comes that to be an offence, though that was not the truth, that he spake of England, nor the Army raysed against England, and is it a commendable cunning, to rayse an Army against a Rebellion.</p>
               <p>His reference to 28 <hi>Articles</hi> directs vs how to know, that he trusts on number more then weight, and those Articles remaine a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to posteritie of the ridiculous pretences which effected such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife. He sayth <hi>the Commons by farr the greater number cast him,</hi> and yet is so absurdly impudent to charge the King with singularitc of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and alledge presently a part of the lower house of the same opinion. <hi>The Lords,</hi> he sayth, <hi>after they had been satisfied in a full discourse by the Kings solicitour, and the opinions of many Iudges delivered in their house agreed likewise to the sentence of Treason.</hi> Those Lords, that condemned the Earle of strafford, might be satisfied by terrour of the Tumults, and their owne corrupt passions, never by law, nor reason. Its well knowne, that the Lords, and Commons were assaulted, and threatned by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly rabble of the Citie, and Suburbs, if they condemned him not, they had not freedome in their coming, or going to the house, or sitting there. There was no one judge, that gave his opinion for the sentence against him, and the Sollicitours discourse was very strong against the present Rebells, wholy impertinent to the case of the Earle of strafford, and shewed his owne deceite, and the sottishnes of them, that relyed on what they vnderstood not. Diverse lords for sooke the house having
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103102:54"/>
not libertie to be present, soe farr were the lords from being satisfied. That which he calls a sentence of Treason, was an act of power, it being a Bill to take away his life, but an exception of all men els, from being proceeded against for the same matters, in ordinary Justice, and this very Action, soe scandalous in it selfe, and soe greivous to many, that consented to it, must be drest out with a shamelesse commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to accuse the King, for his repentance of a fact, which soe much afflicted him. <hi>That the people vniversally cryed for justice</hi> is noe wonder, if we consider former examples, and they had a President in the people of the Iewes, that cryed Crucifie. If we believe this libeller, telling vs how light, and violent, they are in their motions, or if we looke vpon the acts of a powerfull faction, then prevayling with them, that could easily make them cry, what was put in their mouth, we may easily judge the injustice of their cry, and their ignorance of the cause, and a sober author would have hated, to borrow an Argument of Justice, from popular outcryes, which are the most evident proofe of injustice, and oppression of innocence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He sayes</hi> none were his friends, but Courtiers, and Clergimen, the worst at that time, and most corrupted sort of men, &amp; Court ladies, not the best of women.</p>
               <p>His fer friends, and many Enemies, render the proceedings against him more, then suspected, and men may easily beleive, that in such a condition furie was the accuser, and malice, and cowardise the judge. The confining his friends to Court, and Church, is the effect of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers engagement to schisme, and Rebellion, who holds such loyaltie, and affection to the King, and conscientious reverence to the Church, for the markes of greate offenders. If multitude of Ennemies be a Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of guilt, the best men will become the worst of sinners. But having noe friends, as he sayes, it adds much to the right of his cause, that soe many who were neither Courtiers, nor Clergymen, nor any way obliged by him, or the Court, should in discharge of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienc declare their dissent to that bloody law, though they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by objected to popular fury. His impertinent rayling at Courtiers, and Clergymen argues his malice, not Cryme in them. His mention of Court ladies was for want of matter, and their activitie in state affaires belongs not to this occasion.</p>
               <p>The King declared to both houses, that noe feares, or respects what so ever, should make him alter that resolution, founded vpon his conscience, and sayes either then his resolution, was not founded vpon his conscience, or his conscience recieved better information, or both strucke sayle, for within few dayes after, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Bishopps pickt the thorne out of his conscience, and he was perswaded to figne the Bill.</p>
               <p>Men, that are sincere often fall, but such never have consciencie, nor sinceritie, that jeere at it, and make the falls of men, and their wounds of conscience matter of their mirth. Though his Majest: did that,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103102:54"/>
which he had formerly professed to be against his conscience, could he not repent of that frailetie of falling from his resolution? Or might he not afterwards discover the errours of those reasons, that induced him to it? If feares were any motive to what he did, the curse lies on them, that caused it, and on them, that reproach him with it. Poets have not fancied a higher degree of wickednes in fends of hel, then in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious glory of compelling others to sin, and reproaching their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for sin. Experience hath represented his Majest: fortitude, and that not his personall feares, but his apprehension of the Kingdomes miserie wrought most on his passion, and wee cannot finde Parallell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions to those of this libeller in his Scoffes at conscience, and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the thorne out of it, vnles amongst those desperate, and prophane Atheists, that make it the highest pitch of wit to render things sacred most ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Perhapps, it wrung his conscience to condemne the Earle, not because he thought him guiltles, had halfe these Crymes been committed against his personall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, as appeared by his charge against the six members, but because he was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and the Earle but accessory, and thought nothing Treason against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, but against himselfe only.</p>
               <p>Playing with conscience he cannot part with, whose owne is insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. In those particulars he hath rehearsed against the Earle of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, no one of them could be charged vpon the King, and the nature of most of the Articles coud not admit a supposition of the Kings acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie in them. The charge against the six members conteyned matter of direct Treason against knowne lawes, &amp; his Majest: cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to thinke the Earle of Strafford guiltie, because he charged the six members, with some offences laid to the charge of the Earle of Strafford, but never proved, yet it was an infamous injustice of them that so violently proceeded against the Earle of Strafford, and would not admitt an accusation for the same offences against others. If his Majest: thought, that noe Treason could be committed, but against himselfe, he thought no otherwise then the law hath provided, &amp; the accusers of the Earle of Strafford maintained at his Tryall. And the libeller must checke himsefle for his imagination of Treason against the Common wealth, which had not a being, vnles he wil make a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by Prophesie, &amp; antedate his ordinance. He well knowes England was a Monarchy, and that his Masters professe the change of it into a supposed free state. Theis Traytours, that would imagine some Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the King are come to affirme, that there are no Treasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, for they are sure they have committed all, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his person. His impertinency is very tedious in demaunding, why the King should seeme satisfied to signe the Bill by those <hi>Iudges, and Ghostly Fathers,</hi> as he calls them, <hi>of his owne chusing, and now pretend, that it was the importunities of some, and feare of others made him signe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103102:55"/>
He does not produce any Testimony, that the King professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe satisfied, or had he been satisfied, it was no barr to his future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, &amp; repentance, but an instance can hardly be produced, that ever any mans repentance of a knowne fact was traduced, or scorn'd by any, before this libeller, &amp; he might aswel jeere at many famous saints, and Martyrs, that fell from their resolutions, and after recovered, as at his Majest: And <hi>the picking out of his thorne, striking sayle to his feare, and a fleeting conscience,</hi> may vpon the same grounds be the most eminent penitents in the Church of God. To make his Calumnies sticke, he sayes. <hi>That his Majest: ensuing Actions declare he could dissemble satisfaction, for that he had the cheife hand in a conspiracie against the Parliament, and Kingdome.</hi> How the King could conspire against his Kingdome, or what should be his end is not intelligible, &amp; when a King is traduced by Rebells for a conspiracy against the Parliament, and Kingdome, no men of common reason can receive such a palpable fiction, but this greate conspiracy, which he sayes <hi>came to light by the examinations of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Goring, and others was to rescue the Earle of Strafford by seizing the tower of Londen, to bring up the English Army from the north, joynd with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Irish Papists rays'd by Strafford, &amp; a french Army to be landed at Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth against the Parliament, and their friends.</hi> And where is the offence in all this, if it were true, and a powerfull faction assume the name of Parliament? No wise man will blame the King, if he had done such an Action to prevent the miseries, which he foresaw, and the Designes, that were plotted against him, but this story is now stale, though it then served the turne to distemper the people. The examinations, which he speakes of, doe not yet charge the King with the knowledge of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, but the readers of Iconoclastes must be of miraculous stupiditie, if they thinke it a Cryme in the King to intend the bringing vp of his Army from the north, or any other force, and thinke it lawfull for the Rebells against him to bring vp their Army against the Parliament, and plucke them out of the house. Was not the Tower of London all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the Kings possession, and might he not make it good against Traytours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For which purpose</hi> he sayes <hi>the King though requested by both houses refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to disband those Irish Papists.</hi> Though there were many reasons, why his Majest: refused to disband the Irish, and the request of the houses were a vote constrained by Tumults, not the result of a free debate, yet had it been so, that his Majest: had refused to disband them to prevent the plots of the Trayterous faction in Parliament, he had just reason to doe it. And as the Religion men professe, though true, doth not privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them from offending, though they are thereby a scandall to their profession: So Irish Papists, or any others of contrary Religion may be imployed against such, as have stained their profession by such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. These Rebels sought shelter from their Religion for their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103102:55"/>
&amp; perswaded the people of their sinceritie, because Papists fought against them, but it was in truth their infamy, that gave the reason, and the frequent repetition of Irish Papists shewes, that it is a stale to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leade the weakest capacities, that can only suspect, not prove, nor descerne.</p>
               <p>He concludes <hi>the King as Criminous, as the Earle,</hi> and therefore he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, <hi>insteed of detesting his ambition, evill Councell, violence, and oppression of the people, he falls to prayse his greate a bilities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It had been a Kinde of slander to forbeare the due commendation of such abilities, as all men admired, and an vnexcusable injustice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the memory of the innocent with the false accusations of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Enemyes. If his Majest: had recounted any faults of the Earle, it had byn no satisfaction to his conscience for consenting to his death, but it had been a signe of an vnsound minde to seeke matter of excuse for an illegall sentence from the disposition of the suffering partie, and such Actions, as the law had not made the merit of such a sentence. The world is well informed now, that those Rebells account the due performance of just authoritie violence, and oppression, and that their cheife hatred against the Earle of Strafford was for his fidelitie to king, and Kingdome, and his opposition of Rebellion his evill Councell.</p>
               <p>That beneath the decency of a King, he compares him to the sun which in all figurative vse beares allusion to a King, not to a subject.</p>
               <p>If such be the Kingly Prerogative, that the sun beares allusion only to Kings, not to subjects, then must this libeller confesse himselfe to be of that sordid generation, which by that influence are raysed out of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and puddles to obscure that gloryous luster, and his observation of this allusion might justly make him reflect vpon himselfe with detes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation contending against such cleere light, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He hath a conceite, that the <hi>King Knitts contradictions as close, as words can lie togeather, not approving in his judgment, and yet approving in his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent reason, all that Stafford did, as driven by the necessitie of times, and the temper of that people</hi> The Kings words are, <hi>I cannot in my judgment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all he did, driven it may be by the necessitie of times</hi> &amp;c. And let the reader judge, whether this libellers falsification be not Knit, as close, as words can lie togeather, and its like he knew it by his impertinent vse of the Phrase close Knit to his supposed contradictions. Though the King justly excused some things, which he could not approve, doth he therefore approve all, and doth the libeller thinke, that what a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve, he must thinke inexcusable, and that Circumstances doe not alter the qualitie of Actions?</p>
               <p>But he sayes <hi>it is the marvell, and may be the astonishment of all, that have</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103102:56"/>
a conscience, how he durst with the same words of contrition, wherewith David repented the murthering of Vriah, repent his lawfull compliance to that just Act.</p>
               <p>It is noe marvell to men, that know theis Rebells, though heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might have been the astonishment of all, that such should offer to perswade others of their esteeme of conscience, that make it their common scoffe, and while this libeller, charges the King with no lesse then murder in consenting vnwillingly, and consequently in him to an vnjust sentence, makes an exclamation, why he should repent in Davids words for the like Cryme. The libeller well knowes, that if it had been to a lawfull sentence of condemnation, yet blood guiltines lies, where consent with the tongue, had not the perswasion of the heart, &amp; when the King, thought blood lay on him, should he thinke to hide his sin from God? &amp; this prophane Sectary wonders a sinner durst repent. These miscreants are loath to behold their murders in those bloody colours, which the truth of God gives them, &amp; therefore they wil call that Act just against the cry of their Consciences, as they stirred vp the people to cry justice without knowledge of the fact.</p>
               <p>It would have taken much from the heavines of his sin to have told God in his confession, how he laboured, what darke plots he had contrived, into what a League entred, and with what conspiratours against his Parliament, &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to rescue so notable an instrument, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Doubtles the King would have taken that course, if he could have charg'd himselfe with any sinfull labour in that kinde. That he ought to have vsed all his power, and skill to have rescued that Earle, was his dutie to God, and a person so cruelly, &amp; shamelessely oppressed; And all men know what false feares were pretended, what ridiculous plots were imagined to disorder the people, and when there is such apparent discovery of Trayterous plots, and such avowing of Trayterous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there can be none so infatuated to beleive, that all necessary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of such wicked designes was not to withstand the ruine of the Parliament, and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was feare, which made him fayne both the scruple, and the satisfaction.</hi> And what feare could make him fayne a scruple, whome could he feare, if he had not scrupled, but God only? and where doth it appeare, that he fayned satisfaction, but its the libellers want of the fear of God, and men, that makes him thus feareles of slandering, and contradicting.</p>

be Treason, which the Parliament, and whole nation so judged.</hi> He hath already told vs it was al thost the whole nation, and the greater part of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but he finds now, that any diminution induces doubt, and it must be the Parliament, and whole nation. May not a man vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly repent, because the whole nation was in the same fault? how many Acts of Parliament have been made, whereof it had been happy for King, and people, they had repented? there neede not an cnumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in so Knowne a truth.</p>
               <p>It was a worldly repentance, not a consciencious, or els a strange Tyrany, which his conscience had got over him to vex him like an evill spirit for doing one act of Iustice to fortefie his resolution from ever doing so any more.</p>
               <p>We may see what account this man makes of sin, or conscience, that thus derides the terrours of conscience. We may beleive their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cauterized, that are such strangers to vexations of conscience, and that sin, and Rebellion have got a strange Mastery of them, that forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies their resolutions against all repentance, and the approbation of it in others. This libeller cannot perswade himselfe, that when he calls murther Justice, and Rebellion loyaltie, that he is beleived, though he professe <hi>admiration,</hi> that men <hi>disrelish</hi> those his prime qualities, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the execration of such wickednes to be <hi>strange infatuation,</hi> and <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of heart,</hi> and so calls the Kings vnwilling, and forced consent to an act, he judged evill, <hi>the tasting of a just deede,</hi> and his repentance for it, he calls <hi>spattring at it.</hi> The Devills are tormented with the repentance of others, and their Agents blasphemously deride it, and its doubtfull, whether the pittie, or detestation ought to be greater to wards such desperate persons, that call the consent to an execrable murder, <hi>tasting of one good deede,</hi> and the resolution against the like <hi>spattring at it,</hi> no doubt this man spatters at conscience, &amp; direlishes all repentance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being so naturall to him, as the opposition to pietie.</p>

His prophane, and malitious scornes, and reproaches of repentance in this very section, and magnifying an execrable Murther are Cammells in the Judgment of true Christians, though it seeme not so to that sense, which is wholy reprobate, the straining at gnats, and swallowing Cammels was never more apparent in any sect of men, then this libeller, and his crew, and if the <hi>ruine of three Kingdomes be soe big, &amp; bulky,</hi> as he confesses, and would falsely have to be the deedes of his late Majest: and that a wo belongs to them, what may this libeller, &amp; his Complices expect, that have strained at formes, and Ceremonies, &amp; swallowed downe not only periuries, and Murthers, the desence of odious sins, and the reproaching of Christian duties, but have vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly brought this ruine vpon his Majest: three Kingdomes.</p>

Could he name a greater discrasie then what he commends, that consines conscience to shed blood, exludes it from sparing. These Traytours had made falshood, and disobedience unnaturall to them, and thereby they caused such, as sought to preserve themselves from that pestilence, to avoyde them, &amp; those venemous persons according to their malitious qualitie sought to infect with their disposition, or destroy by their rage all that came neere them, or restrained their Company.</p>
               <p>That the King would perswade vs, that the Parliament escaped not some touches of remorse for putting Strafford to death in forbidding it to be a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the future; <hi>but he sayes</hi> in faire construction that act implyed rather a desire to pacifie the Kings minde, not imagining, that this after Act should be retorted on them, whether it were made a President, or not, no more then the want of a President for this.</p>
               <p>Its some what strange, that the Image breaker finding his rigour only to rayle would medle with this Argument, but it seemes he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the hope of a fallacie in the word after, &amp; would insinuate, that this Act was made after the murther, which was made to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise it, and in a <hi>faire construction</hi> it hath not the least shadow of a desire to <hi>pacifie the King,</hi> for it did not diminish any of their power, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, that contrived that Act, but only to exclude this fact from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Justice, which in a <hi>faire construction implyes,</hi> that it was not law, but will, and power, whereby they proceeded. The truth was them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves saw, that by the consequence of that fact of theirs, all mens lives, and fortunes were exposed to danger, and ruine, and no Magistrate, or officer, but might be drawne within the compasse of <hi>Treason,</hi> by the Rules they had held with the Earle of Strafford, &amp; all they, that were present at the debates of that busnies know well, that their proper fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res caused that provision in the Act, and though themselves were not bound to Presidents, they were affraid, that others would follow their <hi>Presidents,</hi> as in truth they ought, if this President had been according to law. He would not have, that this Act argued in the Parliament, <hi>their least repenting, when it argued so litle in the King, who accused the six members for the same Crymes, which he would not thinke treasonable in the Earle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The accusation of those six members was of other, and higher Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, besides some of those objected to the Earle of Strafford, and vpon better grounds, and if it had been only those it shewes apparently, that they, that would not proceede vpon that accusation, repented of what they had done against the Earle of Strafford, or had no conscience at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103102:57"/>
all, but were only guided by corrupt respects of person, and interest, and his Majest: might try what they would doe against persons evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently guiltie of that, which they had judged so high a Cryme in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the discovery of their former false proceedings; <hi>that the King held nothing Treason, but against himselfe.</hi> He hath been already told, was the judgment of the accusers of the Earle of Strafford, and he might have knowne it to be so farr from a <hi>Tyranicall principle,</hi> as he calls it, that it is the rule of law, and Government, for have not his Masters chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the stile of proceedings against offenders, which the law formerly vsed in regard of their change of Government, and devised one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their new modell? Its possible they, that devised that clause in the Act, did not expect, it would be retorted vpon them, they were blinded with their fury, and precipitation. But the Image breaker might have observed, that a greater evidence of their injustice could not have been provided. He that is so shamelesse to insinuate the <hi>Kings instigation</hi> to that clause in the Act for the death of the Earle Strafford, which were a madnes in any man to suppose, may aswell pretend it for his death. The six members must stand condemned, if he acquit them, for the contrary of what he affirmes is constantly true. And it were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aske him, why he should conclude the six members guiltles, that never were tryed, when they were accused of such facts, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sayes were Treason in others, for he will certainly say it, though he thinke it not.</p>
               <p>He concludes against the Kings conscience in saying, <hi>that he bare that touch of conscience with greater regret then any other,</hi> in regard of the <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory aide</hi> (he supposes) <hi>sent to Rochell, and Religion abroade, and a Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of shedding blood at home</hi> (as he phrases it.)</p>
               <p>There cannot be a greater evidence of the Kings innocence, and the Rebels lewdenes then their absurd accusations of him who after their barbarous reproaches, and crueltie make his greatest Cryme the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their Rebellion, and the misfortune of an expedition in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Rochell, and Religion. No man is so senseles to beleive that Rochell could have defended it selfe without other aide, then their owne, &amp; if the King had not intended their releife, he needed not have vndertaken such chrageable, and dangerous expeditions, &amp; whence can any reasonable man, collect that the Kings assistance to them could beproditory, when they were not their by hindred to vse their vtmost endeavours, besides the English succours, and heereby wee may see how miserably the people of England have been misled by hipocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Traytours who while they made profession of conscience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, acted the greatest villanies against Religion and conscience that the worst of Atheists ever attempted, and shame not at such assertions of falshood as common States blush to be detected of.</p>
               <p>The reason he sayes is worth the notinge, why the King would have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103102:58"/>
                  <hi>notice taken of so much tendernes, which is,</hi> he hoped, it would be some evidence before God, and man to all posteritie, that he was farr from bearing that vast loade, and guilt of blood laid vpon him by others, which hath (he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes) the likenes of a subtill dissimulation.</p>
               <p>When the Prophet David humbled himselfe, and put on sackcloth even that was turned to his reproach, and his Majest: teares, and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of soule are no lesse reproached by theis vipers, then the greatest sins, that could be repented of. Cursed shimi will call David a man of blood, and his repentance for the murther of one man with bitternes of soule shalbe counted a dissimulation, rather then the wretch will allow it any evidence, that he was innocent of that blood, he would lay to his charge. This was not the first time his Majest: charged himselfe with that innocent blood, the Rebells published his Cabinet, wherein they found it, and he might well hope, that God would cleere his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, as the light, and his righteousnes, as the noone day. Prayers may be made for mercy to a mans name, and a penitent may piously hope God will make his repentance evident to men, and his sorrowes for one sin, an evidence he was not guiltie of many of the same Kinde. His Majest: hopes not, that his expressions heere wilbe evidence, but that his regretts, which were Knowne not only to God, but men could be evidence, how farr he was from the guilt of what his Enemies char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with, and to declare a hope of the benifit of repentance is no more like a dissimulation, then repentance is like a justification. If his Majest: <hi>had shed the blood of thousands, whome he counted Rebells,</hi> as this Author mentions, he could not suffer regretts of conscience, though he had a sorrow of heart, his vnderstanding being satisfied of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and necessitie of the fact. But those horrid Traytours, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed themselves in the blood of that innocent King, were hardned against the sparing of multitudes, and would secure their consciences by reproaching his Majest: repentance, and transferring the blood of warr vpon him, which their Rebellion, and crueltie had spilt. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller in this very page within few lines told vs, that strafford was by him put to death <hi>vnwillingly</hi> and presently concludes, thus by <hi>dipping voluntarily the tipp of his finger in the blood of strafford whereof all men cleere him, he thinkes to escape that sea of blood, wherein his owne guilt hath plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And may not a mans owne conscience strike him for that, which all men cleere him of? but that himselfe hath related to be otherwise in this case, where so many concurred in Judgment against the death of the Earle of Strafford, and when so many have made confession of their owne vnhappines in the consent to that Action, and so few at present, that doe not abhorre it, and thinke it a greate cause of Gods displeasure against the nation, it is farr from truth, that all men cleere him. The Libeller holds a single murther, but dipping the tip of the finger in

Al men must confesse, it a cause of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regret to have his hand in the blood of one man against the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his conscience, then erroneously to enter into a warr, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are distroyed vpon the opinion of Justice, but the knowne Justice of his Majest: cause, layes the blood of this warr at the Rebells doores, whose malice, and Treason, not ignorance, or errour drew vpon them the guilt of that blood of Strafford, &amp; those thousands, which the warr hath devoured. If the King had never published his repentance for the blood of Strafford, all knowing men would have judged he had cause to doe it, and if he had never gone about to purge himselfe of that blood which the warr had shed, all men would have cleered him of it.</p>

               <p>To imagine a Monarchy, and Commonwealth, or Republique in the same state can enter into none, that vnderstand eyther, nor that a King can commit Treason with his subjects, or against them. Kings have been charged with Tyrany, never with Treason, till those brutish vndertakers. If there had been any law to make such a Treason, this libeller would never have added the word manifest, for tis a sure Rule with him to add most vehement asseverations, where he knowes there is no colour of truth. He well knowes how carefull the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were, that Treason should not be made Arbitrary, and therefore they were confined into one positive law, and in that law this Author findes not his fantasticall Treason. Can any, but mad men dreame, that when the priviledge of Parliament extends not to Treason, that they cannot committ Treason. Its Treason by the law to leavy warr against the King, and that this libellers Masters have acknowledged, and can he finde it consistent in the same Government, that there can be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the King to leavy warr against the Parliament, and because a King may have confederations, and Alliances with Forraigne Princes can subjects have so too? These are not the opinions, but the Stratagems of Rebels. The people of England are bound to assist their King against any without distinction, and the law hath provided for their indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though the King miscarry, but lawes are chaffe, when Rebells Raigne.

condemne a Traytour, that had combined to prosecute the Treason, and it was not for want of just matter, but the forefight of injustice, that caused his Majest: <hi>to lett fall</hi> his proceedings.

                  <hi>The King dismissed the guard, which the Parliament thought necessary, &amp; put in another contrary to the priviledge of that high Court, and by such a one commaunded as made them noe lesse doubtfull of the guard it selfe.</hi> Its very likely, that they had as litle doubt of danger, from any other, as from the guard, for they sought to create dangers to others, feared none to themselves, but from their owne guilt. Its well knowne there was not the least appearance of danger, but from what that faction intended, and such desire of a guard was noe lesse vnknowne, then ridiculous to all former Parliaments, and it was soe farr from being a priviledge to that high Court, that the leaders of the faction in the lower house pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a vote to desire it of the king. And how could it be contrary to the priviledge of that high Court for him to change the guards, that had first placed them? The guard, which the king appointed was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the cheife officer of that guard, and because he gave commaund to keepe of the Tumults, therefore the Rebell faction, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their busnies could not be done by such a guard, nor such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder. <hi>Which</hi> they therefore sayes he <hi>discharge, deeming it more safe to sitt free, though without a guard in open danger, then enclosed with a suspected safetie.</hi> And in what safetie sate they, that were threatned, and abused by those Tumults every day. The visible cause of a guard was the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, but the cause, why guards were desired was to act the same for which the Tumults were raysed, and the danger pretended was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, for they, that desired a guard would rather be without one, then not have a Commaunder of their owne faction, and the houses found noe inconvenience in the want of a guard, but in the insolencie of the Tumults, which the seditious faction invited, &amp; would not have them hindred by any guards.</p>
               <p>The people therefore least their worthyest, and most faithfull Patriotts, who had exposed themselves for the publique, and whome they saw now left naked,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103102:63"/>
                  <hi>should want aide, or be deserted in the middest of these dangers, came in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, though vnarm'd to wittnes their fidelitie, and readines in case of any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offred to the Parliament.</hi> It hath been aldeady observed, that these Tumults preceded the desire of guards, and they were soe farr from being acceptable to the Parliament, thar the house of Lords desired their restraint, and invited the lower house to concurre with them to suppresse these Tumults, and though the factious partie withstood the motion, yet it was thought necessary by a greate part of that house to joyne with the Lords in that desire. And how could they wittnes their fidelitie to the Parliament, when soe greate a part thought them a greivance? And why did they menace, and assault the members of both houses? Why did they prescribe resolutions to the Parliament, and in case their demaunds were not graunted, denounce terrour to the opposers? Is this fidelitie to the Parliament? This Author neede not seeke such blinde excuses for Tumults, that justifies open Treason, noe doubt those his <hi>faithfull Patriots</hi> well vnderstood, that their greatest danger was from the law, which they had violated, and they would be secure by subverting it, and engaging, multitudes in their owne guilt. The king had reason <hi>to send into the Citie to forbid such resorts,</hi> and nothing, but sedition could encourage, or permitt them.</p>
               <p>The supposition of the kings <hi>envying to see the peoples love devolved on another object,</hi> shewes, that Rebellious inclinations were the desire, and strength of the leaders in the lower house, &amp; the envying may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly changed into indignation, that subjects should breake their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and become workers of their owne miserie such Tnmultuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence had not soe much probabilitie <hi>to hinder any action of the King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Parliament,</hi> as to ruine the Parliament, &amp; kingdome. The faction feared not any action of his Majest: but endeavoured to promote their owne designes against him.</p>
               <p>He is now come to tells vs some reasons, why the Parliament peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the king for a guard after they were content to sit without one, and while be maintanies a power in his imaginary Parliament to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king, he presents them petitioning the king for a guard, and their words, which he will not take notice of are worth observing. <hi>The Knights Cittizens, and Burgesses of the house of Commons, your faithfull, and loyall subjects, who are ready to lay downe their lives, and fortunes, and spend the last dropp of their blood to maintaine your Crowne, and royall person in greatnes, and glory, doe cast themselves downe at your Royall feete,</hi> with such elaborate deceites did they hope to perswade the king to give them a guard to oppresse himselfe. Their subsequent actions have been a full Comment vpon theise wicked dissimulations, and theis false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions convince the present shamelesse challenges of power in theis, that thus addresse themselves.</p>
               <p>That blood was drawne in a fray, or two at the Court gate, and even at their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103102:64"/>
                  <hi>owne gate in Westminster hall.</hi> Are not these proper motives for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to call for guards? A Constable of a Parish might more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly set a guard about his house after the parting of a fray, then the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament seeke for an armed guard vpon such an occasion. If the tumults were soe seditious, as to shew their insolencie at the gate of white hall, or Westminster hall, and any of them were wounded in such disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly resorts, it had been just, and necessary to forbid their comming in such numbers, and provoking such danger, and their continuance is a mainfest signe, that these tumults were not the voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, but the instigation of the factious partie in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>That it was <hi>reasonable, and just for the Parliament to make choise of their owne guards, and Commaunder</hi> will only appeare to such, as had trayterous plotts against the King, and the choice, that they made of the <hi>Earle of Essex</hi> shewes by their after imployment, and his ensuing Actions, that the King had just reason for the refusall, and though this Author thinke, that he hath said somewhat by naming him <hi>the Kings owne Chamberlaine,</hi> yet all men see, that these obligations, which the King had put vpon that Earle, could not with hold him from being a leader to the mad multitude against King, and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the right of inferiour Courts to make choice of their owne guards,</hi> which is vtterly false, but can he tell, that ever an inferiour Court vndertooke to be guarded by a Militia, or that ever they had other guards, then from Constables, and inferiour officers, whome they might require to keepe the peace, and doe their dutie, and noe Court could ever make choice of any guard either for number, or Commaunder.</p>
               <p>He sayes, that why the King refused the guard desired, <hi>the next day made mainfest, for then he came to blocke vp, or assault the house of Commons.</hi> It soone appeared, wherefore they desired a guard, to protect Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, &amp; destroy the King. That the King came to blocke vp, or assault, the libeller hath already confessed to be false, for he did it not, when it was in his power, &amp; if he had refused a guard for that reason, he would have performed it, &amp; its impertinently alleadged for the cause of those tumults, when he hath shewed, that those tumults were begun long before, for he lately told vs of the blood drawne at the gate of white hall, and Westminster hall, which himselfe knowes was in the tumults.</p>
               <p>He proceedes to say, <hi>that he had begun to fortifie his Court, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained armed me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103102:64"/>
and with drawne swords wonnded many of the people, as they passed by in a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable manner, whereof some died.</hi> His owne relation makes it more then probable, that such, as were wounded gave the occasion of the hurt they had, for they were not drawne to the Palace gate, and might have quietly passed by though any of his Maj: Servants stood at the gate, &amp; the truth is they dayly provoked his Maj: with insolent, &amp; menacinge words, &amp; Actions, &amp; enforced such, as guarded the Court to repel them with force, &amp; if they were reviled, they gave the provocation by their seditious carriage, &amp; these armed men are now come to drawne swords there being no armes found by this Author, but swords, wherewith the persons vsually walked, &amp; which were necessarily drawne against that rowt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The passing by of a multitude, though neither to St. Georges feast, nor to a til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it selfe was no Tumult. The expression of their loyaltie, and stedfastnes to the Parliament, whose lives they doubted to be in danger was noe Tumult.</hi> but wherefore should such a multitude resort, that had nothing to see, vnles they were tumults? If a multitude, of people either at St. Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges feast, or a tilting should threaten the King, or with violence presse into his Court, and reproach, and assault such, as they found there, this would be a tumult, &amp; somewhat more, but this was not al these tumults acted, they assaulted the members of both houses neere their doores, they threatned them, that consented not to what they would have, they prescribed to the King, and both houses, what they should doe, &amp; doth this triviall discourser make no difference betweene such Actions, that are the most pernitious disorders in states, &amp; the comming of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to see a tilting. If the purpose of such multitudes had been preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the lives, or safeties of any members in Parliament, it was very vnsuteable to their pretence to enquire into the proceedings of the houses, &amp; assault, &amp; menace the members. The loyaltie, which he sayes they bare to the Parliament was il exprest by breaking the priviledges, &amp; wronging the members, their loyaltie was due to their King in the first place, &amp; they owed nothing to the Parliament, but as their Kings Court, &amp; Councel, but the Author thinkes fit they should breake their sworne loyaltie to their King to maintaine a faction against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it grew to be so, the cause was in the King, &amp; his retinue, who by hostile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and actuall assailing the people gave just cause to defend themselves.</hi> can himselfe beleive this dreame of his, when he reades it over, that the kings preparations against the tumults after a long continved insolence against him, should more excuse them for encreasing their violence, then justifie their first attempts? Neede they come to white hall, or Westminster to defend themselves, but theis disorderly, &amp; absurd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are fit Apologies for a tumultuous rowt.</p>
               <p>These petitioning people needed not have been so formidable to any, but to such, whose consciences misgave them, how il they had deserved of the people, <hi>and doe non forbid such petitioning people but those, wose consciences misgave</hi>

them, how il they had deserved of the people? why then were the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish petitioners, and others soe roughly handled comming vnarmed, &amp; more peaceably, then these Tumults? And doe the libellers Masters permitt such petitioning people at present, vnles it be some of their owne suborning? And are the people, which he soe lately described to to be exorbitant, and excessive in their motions become such exact jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of al mens meritt, and determine of punishment without respect to their Rulers. If the libeller would have shewen what these Tumults wanted to make them Cryminall, and wherefore other Tumults were condemned, he would have found meanes to have come to himselfe, &amp; have sayd, that Tumults, were necessary, Preparations to Rebellion.</p>

If Tumults never happen without cause, we must accuse the best Governments of giving that cause, we are sure Davids Government wanted them not, but Absolon, and Sheba shall condemne the man after Gods owne heart. Did this libeller thinke any truth in scripture, or was he at all acquainted with it, that will have a just cause for all Tumul, s, when we reade soe many against Moyses by the children of Israell? And if he had pleased to have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rused the Roman story, he must acknowledge many causses Tumults in that state. Its like he holds, that Demetrius, and his Craftsmen had a cause for their Tumults, and surely it was not soe violent, as the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult he defends. And if all Tumults, and Rebellions be caused by ill Government, we may reasonably conclude, that the people needed not Governours, that knew soe well how to governe themselves, and did never judge a misse of the Actions, or Councells of their Governours. The libeller at first said he tooke vp the gantlet for libertie, and the Commonwealth, which he hath now expounded to be for destruction of libertie, and Kingdome by Tumults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they prove extreame, &amp; pernicious</hi> (that is the Tumults) <hi>they were never counted so to Monarchy, but to Monarchical Tyrany.</hi> Who doubts, but Rebels wil pretend Tyrany, &amp; oppression.

most vertuous Princes have been acted by Tumults? But this libellet glories in those exploites of the rabble, and makes the Calamities they have brought on others the matter of his mirth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Extreames</hi> he sayes <hi>are at most Antipathy.

And are not the lawes of all states most severe against Tumults? And can there be any inference from thence, that the Government is Tyrany, are not Government, and Tumults at most Antipathy?

               <p>
                  <hi>He never thought any thing more to presage the mischeifes, that ensued, then those Tumults.</hi> To this sayes the libeller. <hi>Those Tumults were but the milde effects of an evill, and injurious Raigne.</hi> Tumults the prodigious, and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall raignes get vp in a milde, and gracious Government, wherein seditious, and trayterous factionists take libertie to defuse their venom among the people, and milde tumults, and loyall Rebellion are phrases agreable to this mans modestie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those signes were to be read more apparent in his rage, and purposed revenge of those clamours of the people.</hi> That those tumults might overcome the patience of any King, the severitie vsed vpon lesse provocations by others is a full evidence, but his Majest: moderation was constant, rage, and revenge being only legible in his Enemies. That tumults did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage the mischeifes ensuing, al knowing men concurr with his Majest: and descerne the libellers servile defence of popular clamours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not any thing portends more Gods displeasure against a nation, then when be suffers the clamours of the vulgar to passe all bounds of law, and reverence to Authoritie,</hi> to this he sayes, <hi>it portends rather his displeasure against a Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous King.</hi> As God sometimes gives an evilKing to a people, soe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he destroyes that King by the <hi>contemptible vulgar,</hi> it is a signe of the encrease of his displeasure, and seldome, or never was any King good, or evill soe destroyed, but the peoples sufferings were encreased.</p>
               <p>That those, whome he calls <hi>a supplicating people, and that did noe hurt to law, or authoritie, but stood for it in the Parliament</hi> were a Rebell rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cannot be doubted, since the libeller defends them, and he cannot be beleived they did noe hurt to law in as much, as he defends the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of law, and the attempts of this <hi>supplicating people,</hi> that were in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103102:66"/>
order to that end. This supplicating is one of his abolisht Ceremonies, The libeller tells, that they ought to have stood for law, the world knownes they did the contrary, and he is wittnes both of their guilt, and his owne falshood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they invaded the honour, and freedome of the two houses.</hi> To this he sayes, <hi>It is his officious accusation, not seconded by the Parliament, who, had they seene cause, were best able to complaine.</hi> And how were they able, when they were threatned, if they did complaine, and because the Parliament is overawed by Tumults, that they cannot complaine, therefore their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not invaded. But how shamelesly he charges the King with the officious accusation, he tells vs in the next words, for he sayes, <hi>if they strucke, or menaced any,</hi> as the King said, <hi>they were such, as had more relation to the Court, then to the Common wealth, Enemies, not Patrons of the people.</hi> Is not the honour, and freedome of the two housce invaded, when their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ar strucke, and menaced? And is it an officious accusation to say soe? Can this man pretend the name of Parliament, when he will allow the base rabble to abuse them at pleasure? And could any man but he tell the King, that <hi>persons elected were not sent to be Cavelled at by him, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with an vndervalue of their temper, judgment, or affection,</hi> and heere defend the rascallitie in striking, and menacing the members, and not only vndervaluing their temper, judgment, and affection, but handling them, as cullions. Never was libeller more passionately malicious, more blindly absurd, more wilfully false, yet he thinkes he hath a reserve against all opposition, for he sayes, <hi>if their petitioning vnarmed were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of both houses, what was his besetting it with armed men.</hi> Is striking, and menacing soe quickly returned to petitioning, Is it a way of answeare not to speake to the question? Did ever Kings of England come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an armed guard to the Parliament, and doe they beset the house, when the guard is at the doore? And can he say, that the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with his guard to the house is a greater invasion of the honour, &amp; freedome of the houses, then the striking, and menacing the members by the Tumults? Doubtles he had consulted better to his credit to have said nothing, then that, which was soe different from the case himselfe had stated, and his repetition of petitioning, and supplicating people is noe other, then the noyse of the Ephesian Rabble, that greate is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>They forbore not rude deportments, contemptuous words, and Actions to himselfe, and his Court.</hi> And to this the libeller sayes. <hi>It was noe wonder, having heard what treacherous hostilitie he had designed against the Citie, and his whole Kingdome, that they forbore to handle him, as people in their rage have handled Tyrants heere to fore for lesse offences.</hi> The supplicating, and petitioning people may vse rude deportments, contemptuous words, and actions. To what purpose hath he minced his Tumults into supplicating, &amp; petitioning people, when he defends their highest vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?

                  <hi>The King design'd Treacherous hostilitie against the Cittie, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> The last thoughts, that madd men had before their destraction run most in their fancie in the time of their frensie, and these Traytours having lost all reason inculcate still those ridiculous fraudes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with at first they seduced the people. The designes of Treacherous hostilitie was one of the Ceremonies, which its now time to give over. Who but an I diot can beleive, that the King can have Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous designes against his Kingdome, whereof shal he be King, &amp; whome shall he have to execate hostilitie against his owne Kingdome? but these dreames of the blowing vp of Thames, and tales of winde mills, and fiery Dragons are over, and its become the peoples sorrow, and shame to looke backe vpon the cheates, whereby they were deluded. He cannot name any Tyrant ill handled by tumults vpon such preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as he makes, &amp; the most wicked Tyrant was not soe guiltie, as that people, which exercised their rage vpon him, yet the libeller determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that the tumults fury is as justifiable, as the Parliaments order, for he ascribes noe more to the one, then the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were not a short ague, but a feiree quotidian feaver.</hi> And the libeller sayes <hi>he may best say it who most felt it.</hi> He will rather boast of the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their villany, then reprove the impietie of it, and therefore he sports himselfe with the injuries of it, after his appellations of mildnes, and supplicating people, and extolls the highest of their violence, as a feirce quotidian feaver, and he is soe Lunatique, that out of his malice to the King, he calls them milde, &amp; out of his insolence confesses them violent, and deadly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King would perswade vs, that men scared themselves, &amp; others without cause.</hi> And al men are now satisfied of the truth of it, the fraudes being soe apparent, and confessed by this breaker.</p>

What a silly propertie does this libeller make Parliament, and lawes, that subjects them to Tumults, and how barbarous are their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that made endeavour to subvert fundamentall lawes a Capitall Cryme, and heere he commends the fact, &amp; calls them deceitefull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and Circumstances of law. Might he not better have said, they would make good their villanies by the sword, then prevaricate, and say, and vnsay, and pretend Religion, and yet pray God to send Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and Confusions to breake all lawes in order to their designes?</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>they subdued the men of conscience in Parliament, backed, and abetted all seditious, &amp; schismaticall proposalls against Government Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, and Civill.</hi> To this he sayes. <hi>That it was not the Kings grace, but this Iron flaile, the people, that drove the Bishopps out of their Baronies, Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls, Lords house, Coopes, surplisses, papisticall innovations, threw downe high Commission, starr chamber, gave vs a trienniall Parliament, and what we most desired.</hi> And is not this brave? Is it a credit to a Church to be thus reformed? Is this the Christian Religion to glory in oppression, robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Rebellion? There is noe doubt, but many things graunted by his Majest: in the late Parliament, were Acts of grace in respect of his compliance with importunitie, in hope thereby to preserve the people from a Civill warr, not in respect of the nature of the things graunted. The libeller might have remembred, that the King never consented to drive the Bishopps out of their Baronies, or Cathedralls, and his Trienniall Parliament, which he soe much commends is repealed by his new Masters, for the people must not looke for the execution of any such law. And this Iron slaile, the rashnes, and crueltie of a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered multitude hath thresht, and broken the bones, &amp; sinewes of the people, and made them know the difference betweene a golden Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and an Iron flaile.</p>
               <p>In revenge whereof <hi>he sayes he now soe bitterly inveighs against them.</hi> And how can the libeller thinke it bitter, when their Actions, which he confesses exceede in impietie the greatest Crymes, that ever were inveighed against? And if we could wonder at any thing, we might wonder at his mention of <hi>Schismaticall proposalls consented to by the King,</hi> when he wel knowes, noe one thing by him mentioned of Cathedralls, or Ceremonies was consented to by the King, &amp; noe lesse strange is it, that the other particulars are by him recited, as intended by the King <hi>to be the Sedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>That <hi>these Tumults played the hastie midwives, and would not stay the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but went streight to ripping vp, and forcibly cut out abortive votes, to this he</hi> opposes, <hi>that the Parliament complained not, and therefore those confluxes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103102:67"/>
were not by them thought Tumultuous.</hi> And were they not thought Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous by such, as they had expelled, and driven away from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And did he but in his last words call them an Iron flaile, and recount the wonders, which they wrought, and now would not allow them to be Tumults? We may besure the seditious faction in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment stirred them vp, and such, as differed in judgment, or affection from them, were enforced eyther to be absent, or silent,</p>
               <p>But what good man had not rather want, any thing the most desired for the publique good, then attaine it by such vnlawfull, and irreligious meanes, <hi>which is sayes the libeller</hi> had not rather sit still, and let his Contrey be Tyranized, then like men demaund their rights, and liberties, <hi>And that is the people ought, when they thinke fit to Rebell against their Governours, and say their lawes are deceitefull, and their Government Tyranicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the artificiallest peice of finenes to perswade men to be slaves, that the Court could have invented.</hi> Is it not Scripture, <hi>that we may not doe evill, that good may come of it,</hi> And what other thing doth the King say, or this libeller make the artificialest finenes of the Court, Traytours perswade men, that they demaund their right, while they seeke only to oppresse the right of all men by a lawles vsurpation, and noe man can doubt, but such, as Rebell will make pretences, and not spare the lawes of God by prophane interpretations, nor the Actions of their Rulers by false representations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The morall of this lesson would better serve the teacher,</hi> and it is the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers sense. <hi>What good man had not rather want a boundles, and arbitrary power, and those fine flowers of the Crowne called Prerogatives, then for them to vse force, and perpetuall vexation to his faithfull subjects, nay to wade for them through blood, and Civill warr.</hi> And have not these Rebells waded through blood, and Civill warr to place theise Prerogatives, &amp; flowers of the Crowne vpon themselves, and continue force, and perpetuall vexation vpon the people of England to set vp a boundles, &amp; arbitrary power. The Kings just Prerogatives, and flowers of his Crowne were of absolute necessitie for his peoples safetie, &amp; they could be a vexation to noe faithfull subjects This libeller hath inherited Cains lurce, a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les motion, and discord within himselfe, that heere talkes of faithfull subjects, and by, and by will allow none to be subjects, nor faithfull, but the King is their officer, and noe oaths binde them to him.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>who were the chiefe Demagogues to send for those Tumults, some alive are not ignorant,</hi> he sayes <hi>the King cannot coine English as he could money, &amp; tis beleived this wording was above his knowne stile, and ortography, and accuses the whole composure to be conscious of some other author.</hi> And this learned observation vpon the word Demagogue deserves the Laurell. Why is demagogue amore <hi>hob goblin</hi> word, then Pedagogue? And why should the one be above the kings <hi>knowne stile, &amp; ortography</hi> more then the other? And why may not the king make an English word current,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103102:68"/>
as well as another, There are very many whose knowne stile, and orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy is beneath the Kings, that could have transcribed Demagogue out of many English Authors without offending against ortogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If these Demagogues were men of reputation</hi> with the rabble, it adds not to their reputation with knowing men, nor lessens the guilt, nor danger of those tumults, but rather made them more mischeivous; &amp; the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort of people have such most in reputation, as are neerest to their owne condition being strangers to vertue, and true worth.</p>
               <p>The King sayes <hi>complaints were made, yet noe redresse could be obtained.</hi> To this he returnes the Parliaments complaint of danger, and that it <hi>cheered them to see some flore of their friends, and in the Roman, not pettifog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging sense, their Clients soe neere about them.</hi> Though he sometimes vse the names of Justice, and Patriotts, and love of Countrey, yet he affects nothing more, nor prayses any thing soe much, as seditious contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and exploits, and to defend the Tumults, while he would deny there were any, and the seditious Gracchy, Catilnie, and other conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours against the Roman Senate shalbe commended, for what were these Clients in the Roman sense, but a powerfull number of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as were readie to fire the state at the commaund of their Patron. The Senate never made vse of such Clients, but the power of private men by them became the ruine of that state, and he hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a full answeare, why the Parliament complained not of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, when he boasts, that they were cheered to see them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Parliament, and people demaunded Iustice for those assaults, if not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> meaning those pretended brawles at the Court gate. If any had demaunded Justice they might have had it, for what should hinder? the procedings of noe Court were shutt but by the Rebells. And it is not Poeticall fury, but Bedlam distraction to compare the hurts done in a fray, ptrovoked by an vnruly rabble to <hi>the sheddinge of the blood of Nabaoth,</hi> and the murther of the king to the revenge of Nabaoths blood. Their choise of the place for that execrable Act before the kings Pallace gate is only an evidence of the pride, and malice of their hearts, and of their selfe condemning consciences, that contrived Circumstances to disguise their crueltie with a counterfaite of Justice.</p>
               <p>The king complaines, that <hi>he found noe declarations of the Bishopps could take place against the Tumults.</hi> To this he askes, <hi>was that worth his consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that foolish, and selfe vndoing declaration of twelue Cypher Bishopps, who were immediately appeacht of Treason for that audacious declaring?</hi> Surely it was worth the considering in reguard of the Justice of the declaration, and the Injustice towards those Bishopps, and there can hardly be produced a more impudent Act by an assembly of men, that would allow tumults to offer violence to their members, and charge their members for complaining of the injury with Treason.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103102:68"/>
And as they proceeded without shame, or truth, soe they make it their mirth, that they could by such a ridiculous meanes, effect soe greate a villanie. That declaration, which he calls foolish, and self vndoing will stand a perpetuall Monument of the vertue, and courage of these Bishopps, and the infamy of those Cipher Lords, that committed them. And if the Bishopps <hi>were pulled by their Rochetts,</hi> as he admitts, was not this a just cause in feare in his Majest? And doth this <hi>pulling by the Rochetts</hi> amount to nothing but petitioning? This libeller sayes, the <hi>Bishopps deserved another kinde of pulling.</hi> And noe doubt he would have justified their murther in the streetes, as well, as the Kings since, and that must not have been the blood of Nabaoth. He would inferr, that the King <hi>had noe cause of feare, because he came the next day after his going to the house of Commons into the Citie without a guard.</hi> The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived at that time the Citie was not soe totally debaucht, but that he might finde some, that would guard him against the disloyaltie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and those humble demeanours, which he mentions are well knowne to be most insolent provocations of base people, and though at that time the infection was not soe venemous, as it grew afterwards, yet the king found disloyaltie very apparent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though the King might have feared in reguard of his owne guiltines, yet he knew the people soe full of awe, and reverence to his person, as he dared to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt himselfe single among them.</hi> If the King had knowne guiltines in himselfe, he could not have hoped for that awe, and reverence, but his going single at such a time, and after soe many affronts shewes the audacious scurrilitie of this Author, that hath taunted at him soe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for seares, and terrours, and now sayes he dared goe single among such outragious tumults. And if awe, and reverence to his person were a commendation to the people, as this libeller would have it, it must be the brand of infamy vpon him, and his Rebellious packe, that have troden awe, and reverence vnderfoote, and wickedly despised, and murthered him.</p>
               <p>He would prove, that the King had no feares after all the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full scoffing at his feares, <hi>because he went into Scotland after the Bishopps had been worse handled, then in England, and after two Armies had entred England against him, and this he sayes argues first, that he was a stranger to England, and full of diffidence. To the Scotts only a native King in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, though not in his dealing,</hi> next he sayes, <hi>which shewes beyound doubting, that all his feare of Tumults was but a pretence.</hi> Wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not boubt, that this Authors braine is as Giddy, as the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, for to prove, that the King had noe feare of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, he affirmes him diffident to the English confident of the Scotts, and labours much to make periods of non sense, that he may vse words of Calumnie. Might not the King have cause to feare in reguard of their malice, though
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103102:69"/>
not his personall suffering? And doth not his libeller shew his vaine falshood, that heere makes the king feareles, and soe lately made mirth of the terrours of the Tumults. The libeller doubted he should not finde credit to his many contradictions touching the tumults, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turnes about to another theame of the Kings relation to the scotts, and is so voyde of sense, as having affirmed within ten lines before, that the king was confident of the awe, and reverence of the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to his person, heere sayes he was full of diffidence.</p>
               <p>But he sayes <hi>he tooke occasion from the Tumults of absence from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to turne his disorderly bickerings to an orderly invadinge.</hi> That the King might be absent without shewing a reason why, from his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, noe man of knowledge, or common reason ever doubted, and he might, as well goe to Yorke, as into Scotland. But he must be persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by disorderly Tumults, if he stay, and followed with a formed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if he depart, and they, that sought Colours, and disgiuses for the Tumults grow soe impudent to rayse an Army for the King to fight against him.</p>
               <p>The King sayes <hi>he would not have weakened himselfe by soe many former, and after Acts, if he had meditated warr, as some suspected, when he left white hall.</hi> The libeller sayes <hi>his former Acts did not weaken him, &amp; it might come into his minde after passing these Acts.</hi> That which strengthened the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells must weaken him, and was the Act for continuance of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which they could not have sate, nor acted, nor deluded the people, nor part of their strength, nor the Kings weakenes? But he that objects cunning fetches, and evill Councellours to the king now allowes him nothing, but improvidence, and feare.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>doubted not, but all had gone well, if the Parliament had sate still free, as it was in its first election,</hi> and sayes the libeller, <hi>his not doubting was all good mens greatest doubt.</hi> And theis are the good men, that could not endure a free Parliament, and the libellers Parliament, that must governe is a new modell, not a free Parliament, as it was at first elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that stood not with their Rebellious disignes, and his good men doubted, that all would not soe well with them, if that sate still free, &amp; therefore the Iron flaile must thrust the Bishopps out of the Lords house, and purge the lower house, and yet it is still Tyrany, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie in the King by this mans judgment not to accept all the Dictates of this ridiculous packe, and he hath a narrow conscience, and not fitt for the publique, that follows not the cry of this kennell.</p>
               <p>To the Kings resolution to <hi>heare reason, and consent, as farr, as he could comprehend.</hi> The libeller askes, <hi>what if his reason comprehend nothing, but his owne advantages, was this a reason to be trusted with the common good of three nations?</hi> Yes truly, and it is noe Paradox, that if the King compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his owne advantages, it is sufficient for the common good of the three nations, for whatever is their common good is his advantage, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103102:69"/>
whatever is his advantage is their Common good, but all his Patriotts for whome the libeller is soe Zealous have advantages of their owne, that are opposite to the Common good of the three nations.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>as swine are to gardens, soe are Tumults to Parliaments</hi> To this sayes the libeller. <hi>The Parliament could best have told vs, had they found it so.</hi> And doubtles such of the Parliament, as found it not, may be accounted among the number of these swine, or the herdsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them.</p>
               <p>But he sayes <hi>one greate hogge may doe as much mischiefe in a garden, as many litle swine.</hi> And it seemes, that the like evill spirit, as entred into the heard of swine hath possest this libeller, and driven him on head long in his Rebellious impudence.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>he was some times prone to thinke, that had he called this last Pa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>liament to any other place in England, the sad consequences might have been prevented.</hi> To shew, that the place could have made noe change, the libeller instances in his Majest: first Parliament at oxford, which was dissolved. What doth that prove to contradict what his Majest: sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, that if he had called the Parliament at another place, these sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences might have been prevented? Does the libeller thinke, that because there was misvnderstanding betweene the King, and some of his Parliaments, that they would therefore have run to the same extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that the faction in this last did, or that these factionists could have brought this mischeife vpon the kingdome, by like Tumults in another place.</p>
               <p>He goes on to say, <hi>that the King called his last Parliament at Oxford a Mungrell Parliament consisting all of his friends.</hi> Noe doubt there were in that Parliament many loyally affected to his Majest: but it cannot be denyed, for time hath tryed it, that there were many among them, that were spyes, and disturbers corrupted by the Rebell faction at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, and their owne base inclinations, who sought to disorder all Councells, and consultations.</p>
               <p>The libeller would comprehend the whole people of England within the Tumults, &amp; interprett the Kings prayer against the tumults to be a prayer against his people. Is it not God, that stilleth the raging of the sea, &amp; madnes of the people? And is not a prayer for the people to pray they may be delivered from such madnes, and yet this libeller sayes, that the king praying to be delivered from the Tumults prayeth to be delivered from the people, and blasphemously concludes, God save the people from such intercessours. And we cannot beleive, that God is in his thoughts, whose mouth soe often abuseth his name.</p>

any cause of his Majest: passing that Bill, but his earnest desire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde a Civil warr, and assure his people of his purpose by committing so greate a trust vnto them, neither can there be imagined other cause, why the passing of that Bill was soe much importun'd by the Rebells, but to secure themselves, for being conscious of their owne guilt they knew themselves vnsecure, vnles they gained a power over King, and lawes. The libeller cannot excuse neither the ingratitude, nor disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie of the Rebel partie in Parliament, from the Kings consent to these lawes to present disorders, and mischeifes, which in themselves had not been fitt, for his consent at another time, and their insolence <hi>in binding him first of all his Predecessours,</hi> shewes their corruption, and guilt, that would vse soe much violence, &amp; difloyalite to a Prince whose, gratious Government had least of all his Predecessours provoked it.</p>
               <p>The King taxes them <hi>with vndoing what they found well done.</hi> The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller sayes. <hi>They vndid nothing in the Church, but Lord Bishopps, Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies Ceremonies, high Commission judged worthy by all true Protestants to be throwne out of the Church.</hi> These Protestants, which are true only to him will judge the like of all Kings, and Rulers of State, and all orders of the Church, that are not of their Bedlem patterne. These false Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries talke of Church, &amp; true Protestants just as they doe of Parliament, as long, as it consists of their owne limbs, it must be obeyed, but if it dissent from their Commaunds, then they are worse, then Ceremonies in Religion. Doubtles al true Protestants abhorre this den of Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, that boast of their Rebellious defacing of the Church, and hate their societie, there having not been yet any true Protestant, Church, that ever pretended, that Lord Bishopps, Leiturgies, Ceremonies, or high Commission were worthy to be throwne out of the Church the greatest part of Protestants retaining the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They vndid nothing in the state, but irregular, and grinding Courts.</hi> The Courts they tooke away were judged by al wisemen to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Kingdome, and fitt to be continved, and the best Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours sometimes graunt that to the peoples irregularities thereby to preserve them from proceeding to their owne ruine, which were sitt to deny at another time, &amp; its their Zeale to publique safetie, not feare, and dissimulation, as the libeller calls it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was a greater confidence of the people to put into one mans hand a power to Summon, and dissolve Parliaments, then the King put in the people by the Act of continuance of the Parliament.</hi> And if the libeller could shew the Act, whereby the people put that power in the King, he had said some thing. But how had they put it into his hands, or what confidence was it, if they might take it away, when they list? This man cannot see truth through his owne contradictions, &amp; while he acknowledges the Kingly power to Summon, and dissolve Parliaments forthwith adds, that <hi>Kings could not dissolve Parliaments till all greivances were redressed;</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:103102:72"/>
and then where was the kings power to dissolve, or the peoples confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
               <p>This is he sayes <hi>not only the assertion of this Parliament,</hi> a strong proofe, but <hi>of our ancient lawe bookes,</hi> that noe man ever read, <hi>which averr it to be an vnwritten law of Common right soe engraven in the hearts of our Ancestours, and by them soe constantly enjoyed, and claimed, as that it needed not enrolling.</hi> this is pretty poetry, that because a law is no where to be found, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was engraven in the hearts of our Ancestours, where are those law bookes? But how many hundred yeares since was this engraving worne out, surely if there had been either such an vnwritten law, and soe constantly enjoyed, and claimed, it would have been often enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ere now, but the libeller expected applause for his conceite, not creditt to his assertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Scotts could charge the King with breach of their lawes for breaking vp that Parliament without their consent, it were vnreasonable, that the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England should be soe wanting to it selfe, as not to provide against the not calling, or arbitrary dissolving of Parliaments.</hi> If they had provided against it, where was the confidence he talked of? It followes not, that because the Scotts charged the King with breaking of the Parliament without their consent, that therefore the King offended in it, neither was the wisedome of the English nation wanting to it selfe in leaving the calling, and dissolving of Parliaments Arbitrary to the King, it being a power essentiall to Monarchy, and we have seene, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of that power dissolves the Government, and drawes confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and miserie vpon the state, and it cannot be avoyded, but that from a power erected to affront the soveraigntie, there must follow se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Civill discord. People must depend vpon their Kings grace, and goodnes for redresse of their greivances, whose power, and safetie consists in their welfare, not seeke by violence to be their owne Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the people never found soe greate suffering by submission to their, Kings, as by seeking wayes to oppose them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It appeares, that if this Bill of not dissolving were an vnparalleld act, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He sayes its not enrolled, and how then shall it appeare to be Common right?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What needed written Acts, when as it was anciently esteemed part of his Crowne oath.</hi> His Crowne oath is well knowne, and may not be tryed by estimation, but inspection. The libellers estimation hath as litle proofe, as authoritie. He referrs the <hi>lawerlie mooting of this point to a booke called the rights of the Kingdome</hi> written it seemes by some Author of as much fidelitie in his quotations, as this libeller in his narrations, and <hi>to other law Tracts being neither his Element, nor proper worke, since the booke, which he hath to answeare pretends to reason, not to Authoritie.</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:103102:72"/>
And he holds <hi>reason to be the best Arbitratour, and the law of law it selfe.</hi> And it appeares by his writings, that reason is neither his Element, nor worke heere, for had he vse of reason, he would not referr vs to bookes, that are onely of Authoritie to prove the ignorance, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the writer, neither could reason judge it a law, that a king should not dissolve a Parliament, till all particular greivances were considered, though the setting of it might prove an incurable greivance, but his reason would have the Parliament defend the Kingdome with their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as the Roman Senatours their Capitall with their robes against the Gaules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King must not be at such distance from the people in judging what is better, and what worse.</hi> That the people are not the best judges of what is better, and what is worse the libeller himselfe acknowledges, saying they are excessive in all their motions, and is it not reason, that the King then should be at such distance in judging, but the libeller see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to be at greate distance with truth, that sayes the Kings owne words condemned him, that he had not <hi>knowne as well with moderation to vse as with earnestnes to desire his owne advantages.</hi> Where as the King spake not of himselfe, but others, his words were, <hi>If some men had knowne as well with moderation to vse, as with earnestnes to desire advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of doing good, or evill.</hi> Doth this man thinke reason the law of law, or falshood the Master of both law, and reason, that soe palpably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes the booke before him.</p>
               <p>The King sayes <hi>a continuael Parliament, he thought would keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in tune.</hi> To this sayes the Libeller. <hi>Iudge Commonwealth, what proofes he gave, that this boasted profession was ever in his thought.</hi> The king doubtles thought not, that every Parliament would keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in tune, but a Parliament, that preferred publique good before private faction.</p>
               <p>The King saith, as he relates him, some gave out, that I repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me of that setling Act. The Libeller sayes, <hi>his owne Actions gave it out beyound all supposition, for he went about soe soone after to abrogate it by the sword.</hi> Heere the Libeller omitts a materiall word, which the King vsed, which was <hi>soone,</hi> for the Kings words are, <hi>that I soone repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> It is well knowne that the wicked vse, which the Traytours made of that <hi>setling Act,</hi> might give the king just cause to repent him of it, but as the king vsed not the sword till many Moneths after the passing of that Bill, soe the cause of his Armes were the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and Trayterous Actions of a faction, not the abrogation of that Bill.</p>
               <p>The King calls those Acts, which he confesses tended to their good noe more Princely, then friendly contributions, as if <hi>sayes the Libeller</hi> to doe his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were of Courtesie, and the giving backe of our Liberties stood at the mercy of his contribution.</p>

He would have it beleived, that Parents can doe nothing for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens good out of favour, all is of dutie, and noe thankes belongs to them from their children, nor any from subjects to their Soveraignes, or rulers, for the greatest benefitts they receive by good Government, and all the vigilance, watchfullnes, &amp; pietie of Princes for the peoples good is not at all thankes worthy, theis are the Maximes of Rebells, and if Kings will not yeelde vp their power, they may be compelled, and the quitting of Government, for which Kings must give account to God, is by theis mens Divinitie the giving backe of liberties, being noe other, then to give licence to all wickednes, and beare the sword in vaine.</p>
               <p>The kings sayes <hi>he doubts not, but the affections of his people will compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate his sufferings for those Acts of confidence.</hi> To this sayes the libeller, <hi>not his confidence, but his distrust brought him to his sufferings, and he trusted nere the sooner, for what he tells of their pietie, and Religious strictnes, but rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as Puritans, whome he allwayes sought to extirpate.</hi> The libeller himselfe cannot deny, but that if the king had not had confidence that those Acts of his would not have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abused, he would not have graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, for if he had not been so confident, it had been much more eligible for him to hav run the peril of a war without graunting them, and wee have seene by experience, that many as well as the king were deceived in those, that profest <hi>pietie, and Religious strictnes,</hi> and though the king had just cause to hate the faction of the hipocriticall Puritan, yet he thought, that there could not soe much impietie lurke in many vnder such profession <hi>of pietie, and Religious strictnes,</hi> as hath since excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the most blasphemous Atheist, and had the king sooner distrusted, he had in humane reason prevented much of the Calamitie, that hath befallen himselfe, and his kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That those Acts of the Kings did not argue, that he meant peace knowing, that what he graunted out of feare, he might assoone repeale by force.</hi> It is noe argument, that he would doe it, because he might doe it, but it is one of the libellers vsuall Arguments to conclude from the possibilitie to the being, and there cannot be a greater Argument of a mans desire of peace, then to part with his right to prevent a warr, and by this rule of the libeller there must never be peace, nor end of Rebellion but by the destruction of the king, because their guilt is still vnsecure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Tumults threatned to abuse all acts of grace, and turne them into wantonesse.</hi> This sayes the libeller <hi>is abusing of Scripture not becomming such a saint to adulterate sacred words from the grace of God to the acts of his owne grace.</hi> And is it an abuse of Scripture to say the King did Acts of grace? and whence then comes it to be an abuse of Scripture to say the people abused the Kings grace, or turned it into wantonesse? was it not a sin of wantonesse in the people and may it not be soe exprest without any abuse of Scripture. Scripture is abused, when it is applyed to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103102:73"/>
&amp; ludicrous sense, but the words heere are not transferred from a right signification. There are diverse words, that signifie both divine, and humane Actions, &amp; there is noe abuse of them in either sense And the libeller having excepted to the vse of an expression of Scripture, presently makes bold with Scripture saying, that <hi>Herod was eaten vp with wormes for suffering others to compare his voyce to the voyce of God.</hi> when as the Scripture sayes, he was eaten vp of wormes, because he gave not God the glory. And is not this to adulterate Scripture but nothing is sacred to Rebells.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the King by this Phrase gives jealosie, that he likens his owne Acts of grace to the Acts of Gods grace cannot be</hi> vnderstood, noe more then the vse of the name of mercy, or justice should give jealosie of likening humane vertues to divine Attributes, though there be a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene resembling, and comparing,</p>
               <p>The libeller sayes <hi>from prophanes he scarce comes of with perfect sense,</hi> To prove, that he shewes himselfe senseles. The Kings words are, that <hi>being not in a Capacitie to have taken r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He would not have, that considerations of hazard, and dishonour, with-held the King from that course, and that he would prove, because he made a warr, &amp; yet objects feares to him for the cause of all his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The King sayes <hi>All the Kingdomes of the world are not worth gaining by wayes of sin, which hazard the soule.</hi> And sayes the Libeller, <hi>he left nothing vnhazarded to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The King formerly exprest, <hi>that valour is not to be questioned, for not scufling with the sea, or an vndisciplined rabble.</hi> And though he had not a base feare he could not be vnapprehensive of violence intended by that rabble, and it cannot be doubted, but that a King must have a greater measure of shame then feare to see such insolencies, and if this libeller had any shame, he would not have argued from that expression of his Majest: a contradiction of what he said of danger from these Tumults.

By what law was the king bound to attend these Lords, or what authoritie had they to prepare matter for the Parliament, more then any others of the Kingdome? Is it not a knowne Treason to endeavour to depose the King, and did not the late Parliament professe to abhorre the thought of it?

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103102:75"/>
Cryme in the King is ridiculous to any reasonable man, and its not imaginable, that the king should be bound to attend any meeting of his Peeres, and Councellours, which did tend towards a Parliament, for by that Rule he must attend in as many places, as there are factions noe sober time ever pretended, that the king was bound to attend the Parliament, which was to be called, and dissolved by him, and our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours would be esteemed as voyde of reason, as loyaltie, if their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were governed by a Tumultuous rabble, and the king were oblidged to doe what they would have, though the whole kingdome were bleeding to death of those wounds, which their impious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate violence, and fury had inflicted.</p>
               <p>The king sayes <hi>the shame was to see the barbarous Rudenes of those Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe to demaund any thing.</hi> And this the libeller believes was <hi>the truest cause of his deserting the Parliament.</hi> And was it not a just cause for him to desert the Parliament, or faction in it, when either they could not, or would not restrayne that barbarous rudenes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The worst, and strangest of that any thing they demaunded was but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lording of Bishopps, and expelling them the house, and the reducing of Church discipline to a conformitie with other Protestant. Churches.</hi> And this the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller would have noe Barbarisme. What did the Parliament there, if the Tumults may demaund the alteration of the Government of Church, or state? Can it be presumed, that a rowte of Mechannicks could determine what, was conformitie to other Protestant Churches. The libeller at first remembred Mr. Solicitours discourse against the Earle of Strafford, there he might have found, that it was Treason to goe about, &amp; assemble a multitude to alter the Government of Church, or state; And to seeke the vnlording of Bishopps by force, in that manner they did was Treason by the law, and we have seene, that this desperate rabble, whose demaunds the libeller sayes were but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lording of Bishopps, and the like thinke the murther of the king, and destruction of his family noe other then a but.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were demaunded by the Parliament,</hi> which is vntrue, but they were demaunded by a factton, who suborned these Tumults to overaw, and drive away the greatest part of the members of both houses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King in a most tempestuous season forsooke the helme, and steerage of the Common wealth.</hi> He withdrew himselfe from that storme, which the Traytours had raysed against him, and admitted not any steerage, when all was whirled by tempestuous Tumults. The libeller would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mince the causes of his Majest: departure, and therefore he catches hold of the mention of shame to exclude feare, &amp; from the barbarous rudenes of the Tumults to demaund any thing, he would conclude; there were only demaunds, &amp; noe barbarous rudenes, and would make the last word to exclude all, that went before.</p>
               <p>To be importuned the removing of evill Councellours, and other greivances was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103102:75"/>
                  <hi>to him an intollerable oppression.</hi> To offer violence to him for his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faithful Councellours, &amp; the support of Government in Church, and state was intollerable, and though the libeller doe commend the violence of the Tumults, yet heere he calls it only importunitie, and the Kings denyall of the impetuous demaunds of a rabble to change the Government in Church, and state denyall, and delay of Justice. If violence be lawful, as he ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirmes, why doth he mince his defence, and soe often fly to these termes of importunitie, and petitioning?</p>
               <p>The advice of his Parliament was esteemed a bondage, because the the King sayes of them, <hi>whose agreeing votes were not by any law conclusive to his judgment,</hi> for sayes the libeller, <hi>the law ordaines a Parliament to advise him in his greate affaires, but if it ordaine also, that the single judgment of a King shall outballance all the wisedome of his Parliament, it ordaines that, which frustrates the end of its owne ordaining.</hi> There is no doubt, but in a Monarchy the dependence of the people is vpon the King the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of whose interest in the prosperitie of the Kingdome is more likely to oblidge him to their preservation, then any number of private men can be encleined to, and as the law ordained a Parliament to advise him, soe it forbidds them to commaund, or prescribe him, though the Major part of Parliament involve the whole, Its against all reason to include the King, who is allwayes furnisht by law with his other Councells, &amp; may see good reason to preferr the Counsell of the smaller number, and that law, which ordained the Parliament to be called, and dissolved by the King had destroyed what it ordained, if the King had been bound to consent to all advices given him by the Parliament. Such a restraint vpon the King not only makes voyde, and vseles those select Councells, which by law are continually to advise him, but destroyes the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Monarchy, which the law cannot intend, and gives the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the absolute soveraigntie, which the people would not live vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being contrary to their desires, and dispositions, &amp; the trust reposed in such, as they elected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kings judgment may dissent,</hi> he sayes, <hi>to the destruction of himselfe, and Kingdome,</hi> And soe doubtles may the judgment of a major part in Parliament, and we have found by long experience, that Parliaments have produced Acts to the preiudice of the state, and corruption of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but this libeller holds all meanes frustraneous, that beget not Rebellion, and as in his affection he preferrs the judgment of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, before the Kings; soe any Company, or committee of Lords, that conspire against him, as appeares by his late remembred instance against Rich: the 2: And what power he would have in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the King, he would place in the Tumults, his admired Iron flaile over the Parliament, and prayes vnto God to send them, that they may purge the Parliament, and prescribe lawes both to the King, and them, and therefore he judges, that it is vnlawlike, that <hi>a remedy soe slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103102:76"/>
should be the vtmost meanes of publique safetie.</hi> And we are sure, that Rebellion, the only remedy, which he approves, is the destruction of al publique safetie, and shewes the Libeller as vnable to judge of law, as vnwilling to obey any.</p>
               <p>He concludes, that <hi>the Kings negative voyce was never a law, but a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonles Custome growne vp from flattery, or vsurpation.</hi> And how shall wee judge, that soe long a Custome without contradiction was noe law? &amp; that the contrary was an vnwritten law, and constantly enjoyed, &amp; clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Can he thinke, that because the support of Rebellion is a subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of law, that therefore Rebells reasons are the rule of law? And yet he is confident, it is <hi>better evidence, then Rolls, and records,</hi> &amp; as they deale with law, soe with Scripture making their fantasticke dreames, &amp; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall infusions the Canon of their Religion. And the Monarchy of David, and his successours ordeined by God, and that had both a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and affirmative voyce, was a reasonlesse Custome from flattery, or vsurpation.</p>
               <p>He proceedes to shew the strength of his Argument. <hi>Because the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voyce is claimed to one man, not as a wise, or good man, but as a King.</hi> And how doth he claime the power of the Parliament as to wise, or good men, or as to elected men? And it may be easily supposed, that the Major part of the Parliament may not be soe wise, and good, as their King, especially soe assisted by other Councells, as kings are, and it were noe <hi>abusive thing to Summon Parliaments,</hi> though the King doe take their advices by weight, &amp; not by number, but it were an abusive thing, that such, as were called to advise, should take vpon them to determine.</p>
               <p>The King sayes. <hi>The whole Parliament represents not him in any kinde.</hi> To this sayes the Libeller. <hi>If the Parliament represent the whole kingdome, the king represents only himselfe, and a king without his kingdome in a Civill sense is nothing, nor without, nor against the representative, and soe his negative as good, as nothing, and though we should allow him something, yet not equall to the whole kingdome, nor them, that represent it.</hi> But what answeare is this to the King, that being not represented, cannot be bound by the votes of them, that represent him not? Is the Libellers making him nothing, or not equall to the representative any reason why he should be bound by their votes? The King is by law, &amp; reason the representative of the Kingdome, &amp; as this sottish libeller cannot deny it out of Parliament, so he might well see, that the election of persons to advise him, doth not take away that supream representation, which the law hath given him. there can be nothing more absurd, then that an elected company repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting subjects to their King, should take away the Kingly representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; it is a ridiculous sophistrie, that because the king is not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, therefore he is without his kingdome. The people in Parliament are represented petitioning, and consenting, not commaunding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting, &amp; it is repugnant to their condition to be equall, or not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103102:76"/>
to their King, which were to destroy the relation of king, &amp; subject.</p>
               <p>The king maintaines <hi>to be no further bound to agree with the votes of both houses, then he sees them to agree with the will of God, with his just rights, as a King, and the generall good of the people.</hi> The Libeller would allow him freedome <hi>with due bounds, but not, that he should have a negative, vpon that, which is agreed by the whole Parliament.</hi> Where are his bounds now? for if he have noe freedome, where they agree he hath none at al, for if they doe not agree, he can neither consent, nor dissent, but such poore so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phismes are the reason of these popular Tribuns, and they will have both affirmative, and negative in the Tumults, but not in the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To know the will of God better then his whole Kingdome, whence should he have</hi> it? The Libeller doubtles will, affirme, that himselfe knowes the will of God better, then many whole Kingdomes, and why will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that possible to a King? I may aske him, why he should call the judgment of the Parliament, or a Major part of it, the judgment of the whole Kingdome, when the Major part of the Kingdome be of another minde, if because they represent it, then why may not the Kings judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the highest representation be preferred before theirs? If the Libeller were put to tell whenever such an Action had happened, that the king dissented from his whole kingdome, he would hardly finde it, when people have in greatest multitudes opposed their king, they were rarely, or never in the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To know the will of God better, then his whole kingdome, he askes, whence should he have it? Court breeding,</hi> he sayes, <hi>and conversation of flatterers was a bad schole.</hi> But conversation with Sectaries, &amp; Rebels was worst of al, kings may be presumed to have better breeding, then any others, and the Libeller in another place argues from the kings breeding a greater expectation of abilitie. Flatterers are most hatefull to kings, and their principall breeding is to avoyde the insinuations of such deceivers, but the present faction have outdone all Court flatterers in falshood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The king could not judge of his owne rights,</hi> but he had a right to keepe them, when they were judged. He sayes <hi>the king had noe right by law to judge in any Court.</hi> And yet he judged in all Courts, all judgments being in his name, and we are sure, that the lower house could never judge of the smallest cases, nor the higher, but in respect of the kings presence among them, because the king judges by his delegates doth he not judge, or can they judge his Crowne to themselves.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the king cannot judge of Treason, &amp; fellony because he is held a partie.</hi> And why did he then exclaime, that the king should hold noe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but against himselfe, but if that were the reason his Judges were incompetent, aswell as he, but it is necessary that in a learned profession, as the law, the king should judge by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The kings rights,</hi> he sayes, <hi>must give place to generall good.</hi> But it is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103102:77"/>
generall evill to take away his rights. He may not yeilde to Traytours, that desire him to part with them for their owne advantages. It is noe arrogance in a king to suppose a cleerer insight of the generall good, then others, though chosen for the Parliament, whose breeding, and condition could not quallifie them for such a descerninge, and it is a fond imagination in the Libeller to suppose the Parliament the kings Councell, and suppose the king voyde of Judgment to descerne the soundnes of their advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have most authoritie to judge of the publique good, who for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are chosen out, and sent by the people to advise him.</hi> But it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that he hath most authoritie, whome they are sent to advise, their authoritie being to advise, his to determine, and being sent to advise they destroy their owne authoritie, and office, when they Commaund.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the King see oft the major part of them not in the right, it had been more his modestie to have doubted their seeing him more oft in the wrong.</hi> The libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler prescribes modestie to the king, insolence, &amp; impudence to subjects, that the Rule of their Rebellion. If the king had not governed his Actions by good advice, nor seene the often Levitie, and precipitation of a Major part, he should have doubted of their seeing him in the wrong, however they owne him dutie, as their king, he no submission to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the King ought to graunt the peoples rights, and liberties, because of right demaunded, it being his dutie, not his bountie to graunt these things.</hi> But it is the subjects miserie, aswell as their madnes to demaund the kings rights, as their owne, and we know, that the demaunds of Rebells are for themselves, and to take away the peoples rights, aswell as loyaltie, and wee finde, that there were such, as the king mentions, whome noe fountaine of Royall bountie was able to overcome, and for whome the comparision of hidropike thirst was very favourable being more insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate then <hi>gusters</hi> in a <hi>wine</hi> sellar, and neerer the nature of horse leaches, and swine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King confesses a rationall soveraigntie of soule, and freedome of within every man, and yet with an implicite repugnancie would make vseles that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will in all other men but himselfe.</hi> That cannot be by vsing the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of his negative voyce, for are the wills of other men captivated because they cannot doe as they will, &amp; because the king will not doe what they will have him, and because men are subject to Government is freedome of will denyed them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Them, that yeilde him the obedience</hi> meaning the king, <hi>he pronounces wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be slaves,</hi> which he inferrs from these words of the King, the <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be a slave, who captivates the rationall soveraignetie of soule, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his will to compulsion.</hi> And how can the libeller draw any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from these words? Lawes, that restraine Actions doe not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>What that Freedome is which cannot be denyed him as a King, because it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him as a man, &amp; a Christian</hi> the Libeller sayes, <hi>he vnderstands not, if it be his negative voyce, it concludes all men, who have not such a negative, as his against the whole Parliament, to be neither men, nor Christians.</hi> And as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well he might have said, that because every man ought to have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in giving his vote in Parliament, therefore every man ought to be there. The Libeller neede not be ashamed to confesse ignorance, that blushes not at such fooleries. The king argues, that he could not be debarred of that, as a king, which belonged to him as a man, and a Christian, which was libertie of will in giving his vote, and by what Logicque could the Libeller thence conclude, that all, that have not a negative voyce to what the Parliament propounds are noe men, nor Christians? If the king have not a negative voyce, he hath noe voyce, &amp; every members of Parliament hath a voyce affirmative, &amp; negative, and they deny that to the king in denying his negative voyce, which they allow all, that have any voyce.</p>
               <p>He demaunds <hi>what was he himselfe all this while, that we denyed it him, as a King.</hi> He had the freedome of his will, when he gave noe vote against it, but all the world sayes that you were Traytours in the deniall. His naturall libertie of will was not taken from him by your Trayterous violence, though his right to vse it in his kingly office were Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously withstood. If a King be prohibited the vse of his reason in his Government, he is denied that, which belongs to him as a man, and a Christian, and these impudent Traytours are soe cauterized, that they scoffe at their Lewde villany asking whether he did not enjoy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of his will, when they had imprisoned, and deposed him.</p>
               <p>He askes, <hi>might not the King have enjoyed both reason, and conscience go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verninge vs as free men, by what lawes we our selves would be governed?</hi> And how could he governe, if you make the lawes, he might be governed? And who shall governe, when every man is a law-maker, and he could not enjoy reason, nor conscience governing by lawes he approved not.</p>
               <p>It was not the inward vse of his reason, and conscience, that would content him. <hi>Doubtles it ought not being a King, but sayes he</hi> to vse them both as a law over all his subjects in whatsoever he declared as a King to like, or dislike. <hi>The King were noe King, if his subjects might make lawes without him, and his reason, and conscience ought to be his lawes in governing, and he justly said.</hi> It were better to be without the Title of King, if it should carry with it such a vassallage, as not to suffer him to vse his reason, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in what he declared as a King to like, or dislike <hi>which vse of reason sayes the libeller</hi> most reasonles, and vnconscionable is the vtmost, that any
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103102:78"/>
                  <hi>Tyrant ever pretended over his vassalls.</hi> Tyrants were never esteemed by their pretences, but by their Actions, &amp; it shewes that these men knew not, what Tyrany was, who make a just right of all Governours, the vse of reason Tyrany, and that, which never king was thought fitt to be denyed, though Tyrants abused it. Tyrany is in the abuse of power, not in the rule of Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all wise nations the Legislative power, and the judiciall execution of that power have been distinct.</hi> But never devided being allwayes subordinate one to the other, the judiciall execution depending on the Legislative.</p>
               <p>He makes an assumption, <hi>If then the king be only sett vp to execute the law he ought noe more to make, or forbidd the making of any law, then other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Iudges.</hi> But if the king be set vp to make law by the advice of his Councell the Parliament, can they make lawes without him, but this Libeller, that would be thought soe strong at Arguments, talkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into contradictions, and allowes the king, neither the one power, nor the other, for he affirmes the king cannot judge, and make lawes he must not, and what will he conclude, sure, that his owne nation is not wise, nor himselfe honest, or rationall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He cannot reject a law offred him by the Commons, no more then make a law, which they reject.</hi> And hath it sense, that because a man cannot doe an Act without the advice of another, therefore he must doe what that other advises? The man dictates, and would be beleived, though the Commons never did, nor could offer a law to the king, for he wel knowes it must passe the Lords before it come to the king, but he was loath to mention the Lords, least it should cry downe the noyse he hath made of the kings single judgment, for the Lords house may not have a negative in his judgment, notwithstanding their number. But why is it offred the king, if he may not reject it, and whence hath it been, that so many Bils have been rejected in al ages, without any complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When Kings come soe low as to fall vpon Philosophy, which before he neither valued, nor vnderstood is a figne they are then put to their last trump.</hi> If the king had not valued nor vnderstood Philosophy, he could not have made soe pertinent vse of it, and if the Libeller had vnderstood Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, or valued truth, he would have given better signes of it. Could not his Majest: <hi>discourse of his reason, and will, but it must be out of the way, or above his abilitie.</hi> But why is this a signe, that kings are then put to their trump, why the vse of Philosophy more then other, learning? Though kings come low, Rebells will come to seeke corners to hide themselves. He shewes not how Philosophy breakes the necke of their cause, or how he hath made advantage of Philosophy against the king, but we finde how his elaborate contradictions, have broken the necke of his owne cause through out all his discourses.</p>
               <p>The king sayes he <hi>cannot thinke the Majest: of the Crowne of England to be bound by any Coronation oath in a blinde, and brutish formalitie to consent to whatever its subjects in Parliament shall require.</hi> And sayes the Libeller, <hi>What Tyrant could presume to say more.</hi> And the law it selfe, Religion, and reason never said lesse.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>It cannot but be yeilded, that the oath, which bindes him to performance of his trust, ought in reason to containe the summe of what his cheife trust, and office is.</hi> But what if it doe not, is there an argument to be drawne from what the oath ought to be, but is not? The oath may containe the generall dutie of Justice, &amp; right, but it neither did, nor could comprehend all the wayes of effecting it.</p>
               <p>The libeller sayes, that <hi>the Kings negative voyce is not contained in that oath.</hi> But that oath oblidges him to governe by just lawes, which comprehends a negative to all vnjust lawes, and can it impose an obligation vpon the king of doing Justice, and not give him a libertie of judging what is just, or vnjust?</p>
               <p>The Libeller sayes, that <hi>his oath requires only his assent to those lawes, which the people have already chosen, or shall chuse,</hi> there is noe such word in that oath, and his mention of the Lattine, and old English of that oath are of another sense, &amp; that the libeller was conscious of, &amp; therefore he sayes. <hi>All reason ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, that the people should not loose vnder a new king what freedome they had before.</hi> but their freedome consists not in an exemption from soveraigne power. It is the custome of Rebels to contradict, &amp; corrupt al lawes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pretence of their private reason, &amp; allow no reason but what concludes against just authoritie, he wel knew there was not that double sense he assignes, but we wil make his sens the kings oath? if the peoples choise be referred to the time past, it implies not, that their choise was or ought to be a law, though they had a choise in the laws made, as stil they have, &amp; they could not loose what they never had, &amp; the Parliament, which at first me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned the kings oath acknowledged, <hi>that as they did not determine the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how far foorth the king is obliged, to follow the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his parliament, so as to conclude that a new law might be mad without his consent.</hi> so they acknowledge that <hi>the contrary may be truly inferred out of al they had said.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>if the King deny what the Parliament hath chosen, he makes himselfe supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to his whole Kingdome.</hi> And who doubts but he is? doe not they which take the oath of supreamacie acknowledge it? The libeller sayes <hi>the generall maximes of Policie gainsay it.</hi> The general maximes of Rebellion doe, but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy cannot.

                  <hi>Infinite mischeifes may grow while our safetie shall depend vpon the over weening reason of one man.</hi> And we finde by experience, that desperate ruine inevitably followes, when our safetie depends vpon the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a multitude. It is the nature of sectaries to be wise in their owne conceite, and thence come arrogance, and contempt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; it is a principall in their schisme to improve this naturall inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and contemne all Estates, and abilities of men dissenting from them, &amp; though his Majest: were of most eminent natural endowments this libeller cals him <hi>a man neither by nature, nor nurture wise.</hi> Which shewes he vnderstood not wisedome in others, nor was sensible of his owne folly soe apparent to all his readers. That a King should want breeding to make him wise, is strange in the libellers owne judgment, and that the experience, &amp; breeding of the King was eminently extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary the world well knowes.</p>
               <p>He calls the <hi>Kings negative his will, &amp; the Parliaments demaunds advice.</hi> May not their demaunds be willfull, and his negative advised? The nature, and nurture of this libeller is disobedience, and therefore will have the Kings wisedome to be will, &amp; the Rebells rashnes wisedome, and it is impossible, that men, who have sucked in such principles should ever be obedient to any Government, studying only how they may disaffect subjects to it.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the Kings errour was imperious, and force was vsed not to dispell errour out of his head, but to drive it from of our neckes.</hi> These Rebells sought to be imperious, &amp; put the yoke vpon the neckes of the people, and that, which restrained them from an absolute arbitrary power, which was the Kings negative, they would take away by force, and place negative, and affirmative in themselves. The libeller sayes well that force was not vsed to dispell errour, which was vsed to enforce consent, and to make errour, and shewes their wickednes, that tooke that course.</p>
               <p>The King sayes <hi>the vprightnes of his intention will excuse the possible failings of his vnderstanding, who seriously endeavours to see the best reason, &amp; faithfully followes it. This</hi> the libeller sayes <hi>is a position false in law, &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie.</hi> But for that we must take his word against all law, &amp; Divinitie. But he sayes its contrary to the Kings owne better principles, who affirmes <hi>the goodnes of a mans intention will not excuse the scandall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of his Example.</hi> And doth it contradict what the king had said, of the excuse of errour in judgment, by the vprightnes of the intention, because a man cannot excuse an evill Action by the intending a good end, where there was noe errour of the fact, but a knowne evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His not knowing through corruption of flattery, &amp; Court principles will not excuse him.</hi> But we are sure, that this libellers willfull falshoods, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and Rebellious principles condemne him, and make him odious to God, and man, and he is not like a Pilot mi'sled by a wandring starr,
<pb facs="tcp:103102:79"/>
that may be possible, but like a Pilot, that will not be giuded by starrs, but maliciously destroyes the ship, and men, and this Author might sooner excuse a drunken Pilot, then a savage Piratte, and such are they, who willfully practise doceites, and cruelties vnder the name of <hi>natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rights.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>They vsed force to acqiut their owne reason, and conscience from force</hi> That is they vsed force to Domineere over king, and people, and establish their owne will for law. And to rebell against their king is to arqiut their reason and conscience.</p>
               <p>The king sayes <hi>never thing pleased him more, then when his judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curd with theirs.</hi> The libeller to this sayes. <hi>That was to the applause of his owne judgment, and would aswell have pleased any selfe conceited man.</hi> But could the king despise the judgment of the Parliament, as this addle headed libeller continually exclaimes, and make it matter of applause to himselfe, that his judgment concurd with theirs? Could he sleight their judgment, and conceite his owne credited by their concurrence? If he had noe other esteeme of their judgment, then the libeller would have beleived, doubtles he might have suspected his owne Judgment, for concurring with theirs; And whence comes itt, that a selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited man would be soe well pleased with such a concurrence? A selfe conceited man scornes the concurrence of other mens judgments, and preferrs his owne against all others, but reason cannot be expected from this man being vse les to his vndertaking.</p>
               <p>The king sayes <hi>in many things he chose rather to deny himselfe then them.</hi> And sayes the libeller. <hi>That is to say Trifles, for of his owne interests, and personall rights he conceives himselfe Master.</hi> And who can deny itt, but he is Master of them, and yet he hath parted with these, land could he part with any thing wereof he was not Master? And were all these lawes, which the libeller commends, trifles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To part with if he please</hi> saith the Libeller, <hi>not to contest for against the Kingdome, which is greater then hee, whose rights are all subordinate to the Kingdomes good.</hi> If he may not contest for them, he must part with them, though he please, or not please, but being for the Kingdomes good, he is bound to contest for them, and it is to ruine the Kingdome, when subjects contest to take them away from the King. Those rights are in compatible with subjects, and inseperable from Governours, and are noe more subordinate to the peoples good, then Justice, or law are, but they are the peoples good, and the people are subordinate to their Rulers in judging what is their good. But he must part with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Kingdome is greater then he, as the Libeller sayes, That is noe reason, but it is according to the Rebells principles, that there is no right, but force, &amp; the weaker may not contest against the stronger.</p>
               <p>The libeller is very copious in his declamations against Monarchy, and it would be tedious to follow him in his verbofitie, he excepts to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103102:80"/>
these words of the King. <hi>In what concernes truth &amp; Iústice, the right of Church, or his Crouwne, noe man shall gaine his consent against his minde.</hi> And sayes the libeller. <hi>What can be left then for a Parliament, but to sit like Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whilest he assumes the best abilitie of judging, or restraynes all men from enjoyment of any good, which his judgment thinkes not fit to graunt them.</hi> And what were a King but an Image, if he were bound to graunt, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his subjects in Parliament demaund of him, and to what end doe they take an oath of Alleagiance, if he were bound to quit it, when they aske it? And are there any soe sunke in vnderstanding, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that it is the office of a King to judge of nothing, and the right of subjects in Parliament to commaund al things. But this man is of Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophells minde, that if his Councell be not followed, he will goe home, &amp; hang himselse. Advice from subjects to a King is ordained by law, but the subjection of a King to advise is monstrous, and vnsuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable. The Authors repetitions of rayling Epithites vpon what concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the King, or his Actions, &amp; commendation of the wicked Actions against him, will not alter the nature of one or other, and his vehement asseveration, that <hi>the law, and Coronall oath require the Kings vndeniable as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to what lawes the Parliament agree vpon,</hi> is not out of opinion of truth, but the strength of his language himselfe shewing the contrary aswell as the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The King sayes <hi>he had rather weare a Crowne of thornes with our saviour, then to exchange that of gold for one of lead, whose imbast flexiblenes shalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to binde, and comply to the various, &amp; oft contrary Dictates of any faction, when insteede of reason, &amp; publique concernement they obtrude nothing, but what makes for the interest of parties, and flowes from the partialitie of private <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They who governe ill those Kingdomes, which they have right to, have to our saviours Crowne of thornes noe right at all.</hi> Such as are Rebells to lawfull Princes, &amp; vsurpe Kingdomes, will never weare a Crowne of thornes with their saviour, nor can hope to be knowne by him, while they sucke the blood of his anointed, and Tyranize over kingdomes soe wickedly gotten. That Crowne of thornes, which this libellers savage souldiers, and others set vpon the last king, is now his Crowne of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in heaven, &amp; honour among men, &amp; the infamy of these hellish mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants. The libeller twists thornes, and snares for himselfe by his sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meles Calumnies, seeking to make the assassination of a gracious king his owne demeritts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Crowne of gold is not due to him, who cannot first weare a Crowne of lead, not only for the weight of that greate office, but for the compliance with them, who are to Councell him.</hi> A leaden Crowne may well expresse stupiditie, and basenes, and the Crowne of gold better agrees with sound Councell, which is compared to apples of gold in pictures of silver, then lead which shewes only <hi>that imbast flexiblenes to the various, and oft contrary Dictates of any faction,</hi> and is only a weight of punishment, not of office,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103102:80"/>
which the gold represents, but Traytours cannot endure a Crowne of gold vpon the head of their king, they will only allow him a Crowne of thornes, or lead.</p>
               <p>The libeller taxes the king <hi>for want of modestie, in imputing want of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and neglect of the publique, rather to the faction then to himselfe, because the faction was the Parliament.</hi> And he must be a man voyde of all modestie, that doth not judge such Actions as the king complayned of <hi>to proceede from want of reason, &amp; neglect of the publique, interest of parties, &amp; partialities of private will, and passion.</hi> The sectaries were wont to deprecate all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations of irreverence to their King, and complaine, that they were wronged, but the question is now changed, &amp; contempt of the King is their greate vertue. The libeller throughout this whole discourse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the consideration of the Kings conscience, &amp; heereto these words of the Kings I <hi>know noe resolutions more worthy a Christian King, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his conscience before, his Kingdomes,</hi> sayes <hi>the sentence is faire in seeming, but fallacious, for the conscience may be ill edifred.</hi> And because it may be soe, is it fallacious, that conscience must be preferred before Kingdomes? These hipocrites, that pretend to Rebell for their conscience, accuse the king for refusing to passe a law, in regard of the contrary perswasion of his conscience, and it must be an ill edified conscience in him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare an act, &amp; a rightly informed conscience in them, that commit an act so bloody, &amp; scandalous to the whole world, &amp; so dangerous to the soules of many, that were drawne headlong into that sin, the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science cannot be preserved without his negative voyce, and therefore he might justly assert it to be his right by law, &amp; when the libeller can perswade men, that Parliaments are infallible, and free from faction, &amp; that Rebells are best judges, of what is for the Kingdomes good, he may hope to be beleived, that the king denyed that, which law, his oath, and office bid him graunt. And all men see, that vnder the name of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Parliament, Rebels have introduced their owne wils for lawes.</p>

               <p>The king sayes <hi>this is the first example of any Protestant subjects, that have taken vp Armes against their King a Protestant.</hi> The Libeller sayes <hi>it can be to Protestants noe dishonour, when it shalbe heard, that he first leavied warr on them, and to the interest of Papists more then of Protestants.</hi> But then it is dishonour, if he first leavied not warr vpon them? And all that reade his booke must conclude, that they first leavyed warr vpon him, what els doth he meane by defending the Tumults, seizing the forts, and Militia, raysing an Army, &amp; vpbraiding the king with feares to hazard such a scuffle.

The world is satisfied, how disloyally the King was prosecuted by Armes, and had it been otherwise, subjects ought to petition not returne violence, and in all the excuses that these Traytours have vsed, they never mention any offer of satisfaction to the King, or desire to lay downe his Armes, but require his submission, and giving vp his rights, or otherwise they would take it by force.

                  <hi>If the feare of her delinquencie, and Iustice demaunded on her, was any cause of her alienating the more, to have gained her by indirect meanes, had been no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Religion.</hi> As the King observed, that this was the first exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Protestant subjects, that tooke Armes against their king: soe this of charging the Queene with Delinquencie was the first example in that kinde, that trayterous impudence had produced, &amp; when it shalbe heard, that a compaine of such vile persons charge the Queene with Crymes fot assisting her husband, they wilbe assured, that not feare of Delinquencie, but their barbarous crueltie might more alienate her, &amp; disadvantage Religion. <hi>Them, who accused her</hi> he sayes <hi>well enough knowne to be the Parliament, the King censures, for men yet to seeke their Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine, discipline, or good manners.</hi> And soe doth the whole world, whatever name the Libeller give such men, who are well enough knowne to be a Trayterous faction.</p>

How often hath this Libeller named the best reformed Churches, is not that as much a name of schisme? he is ignorant in the nature of schisme, though he be soe well practised in it, and its strange he would observe a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall name from the title of a nation, and not from his title of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie, that produceth as many titles, and distinctions, as there be Parishes, or Parlours.</p>

And the examples of feminine vsurpation are more frequent in Republican Tribunes then Monarchs.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, <hi>her tarrying heere he could not thinke safe among them, who were shaking hands with Allegiance to lay faster hold on Religion.</hi> The Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler sayes that <hi>he taxes them of a dutie rather then a Cryme, it being just to obey God rather then man.</hi> And is periury, and the breach of Alleagiance obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and doe men obey God, that breake one Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon pretence to keepe another.

The Court dissolutenes is made a common place of scandall, not veritie in respect of the application, there being not such excesses in his Majest: Court, that deserved a speciall observation, and the restraint of dissolutenes was more observable, then the Cryme. As to the scandalls of his Clergie, though we must beleive, that offences wil come, yet the scandall of the present disloyaltie was more offensive to those of different Religion, then any disorders in Civil conversation, and the injustice of the Rebells towards the Clergie, hath shewed the vntruth of the scandalls, that were cast vpon them, &amp; though their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice traduced, &amp; persecuted them, their proofes could not convict them of the scandall supposed. His Majest: owne judgment cannot be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast by a Rebells malice, and his examplary life cannot be stained by a Libellers pen. His letter to the Pope was noe complaince, nor could it give offence to protestant or hope to Papist, &amp; these Rebells, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Turkes, and infidells least of all thinke it a compliance. The Libeller well knowes there was noe nuntio in England, and if the King should have denyed the Queene the exercise of her Religion, whereto he was bound by the Articles vpon the match, he had given greater scandall by breaking the Articles, then by permitting her the repaire of persons in matters of her Religion. But sayes the Libeller, <hi>they must not sit still,</hi> that is not Rebell, <hi>and see their Religion snatcht away</hi> But they have Rebelled to snatch away Religion. He sayes, <hi>Its knowne, that her Religion wrought more vpon him, then his vpon her, and his favouring of Papists, and hatred of Puritans, made men suspect shee had perverted him.</hi> Noe doubt suspitions were industriously raysed, and carrefully nourisht against the King, though they beleived them not, that made vse of them. The King was not bound to destroy all Papists, and could not deny them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a King, &amp; he had just reason to suspect those bloody Puritans, whose inclinations he descerned to that wickednes they have since avowed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The King had lately been convinced of his illegallitie with the five members.</hi> He was injuriously denyed Justice against them, which produced the second insolence of Hotham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings relation declares his anger to be incensed,</hi> as he had, but doth it follow from thence, that he was not more sorry for others, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry?

He might have said that Townes vnder a popular Govern ment were the peoples, but in a Kingdome, it is a fantasticall dreame, &amp; the lawes deny a possibilitie of any such propertie having placed the soveraigntie of the Kingdome in the King, &amp; such a conclusion of right is inconsistent with a kingdome.</p>

               <p>

And is it a cryme in the kinge to vse his private wealth in a publique warr? No doubt, but his Majest: propertie is asmuch, as any private mans, els his kingly office had little honour, or strength, and he is not accountable for the vse, which he makes of his Estate either private, or publique, and there was noe feare of the vse, that the king would make, but from Traytours, that would prevent his defence.</p>

                  <hi>The king sayes</hi> he could not, but observe, how God not long after pleaded, and avenged his cause. <hi>The Libeller sayes</hi> most men, and commonly the worst are apt to interpret the judgments of God to the justifying of their owne cause.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103102:84"/>
Its possible the worst men may doe soe, but we see it very frequent with the best. The Prophet David often takes notice of Gods dealing with his Enemies, &amp; wicked men. The Libeller might hence observe his Masters, the worst of men, that interpret, and expound the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and the event of providence to the justifing of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion how often hath he in this Libell taken vp that Argument, and in this very Chapter makes an observation of Gods Judgment vpon the King, from their murther of him before his owne Pallace gate. And how frequent are their successes produced as profes of the goodnes of their cause, but his Majest: observation is not grounded vpon the event, but the evident Cryme of Hotham, which all men held Treason, but such, as would allow nothing to be Treason against the King. Although we know not the reasons of Gods ptoceedings, who often leaves good men to suffer, and wicked men prosper, yet when we see the prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of a wicked designe perish by the hands of those, whome he served in his vnlawfull enterprize, we may justly take notice of the proportion betweene the sin, and the punishment.</p>

               <p>Hotham was safe, and successefull, while be continued true to the Parliament. <hi>But the guilt of his conscience made him vnquiet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God had purposed such an end for his opposition to the King, he would not have deferred to puinsh him till of an Enemy be was made the Kings friend, nor have made his repentance the occasion of his ruine.</hi> These presumptuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells dare sit in judgment vpon Gods wayes, and prescribe a rule sor his proceedings. Its true, because judgment is not executed speedily, the hearts of the children of men are set vpon evill, &amp; the Libeller judges, that if the judgments of God be not apparent in his time, that is foorth with, they are none at all. God brought his judgment vpon the son of Ahab, and not vpon himselfe, because he humbled himselfe, and God punisht the sins of David vpon his posteritie, though he forgave him, and we may conceive the judgment of God vpon a wicked Act, not the repentance of it, though it come after in time. Strafford Duke of Buckingham was an active assistant to Rich: the 3: in his vsurpation, and after revolting from him perisht by that power he had raysed, which all men looke on as a judgment vpon his first compliance with that Tyrant, and the sate of Hotham, and that Duke hold greate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in regard of their Actions, and sufferings.</p>

               <p>Because <hi>God judges not by humane fancie,</hi> therefore sayes he <hi>such events, as are obvious to every fancie, are most like to be erroneous.</hi> And then such Acts of providence, as make men say surely there is a God, that jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the earth are most likely to be mistaken. Although Common fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are likely to be deceived, it is a sorry inference from thence, that what is obvious to every fancie weake, and wise, should be more likely to be erroneous.</p>
               <p>The king soe farr pittied Hotham, as <hi>he thought he at first acted more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the light of his conscience, then many other men, in the same cause.</hi> To this the Libeller sayes. <hi>They who act against conscience are least of all to be pittied either at the Barr of humane, or divine Iustice.</hi> Desperate sinners, as most miserable, are most to be pittied in Christian Charitie, though ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice proceede more severely against them, pitties are part of justice, the Libeller is acquainted only with the operations of malice, not of pittie, whereof his whole discourse shewes him destitute, otherwise the kings pittie could not argue him <hi>destitute of the Common grounds of nature,</hi> as the Libeller inferrs, and shewes that he esteemes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grounds of nature, Acts of Tyrany, and insultation vpon others, ruine, hatred, and scorne being all the Charitie, that Sectaries practise.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the king jerkes at some mens reforming to modells of Religion, and that they thinke, all is gold of pietie, that doth but glister with a shew of zeale.</hi> To this sayes the Libeller. <hi>The pietie of his Prelacie modell, glistered more vpon the posts, and pillars, which their Zeale, and fervencie guilded over, then in true workes of spirituall edification.</hi> The repairing, and beautifying of the houses of God was the highest commendation of many of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servants, and the Scripture gives that for the high commendation of the famous Jehojada, and we may expect spirituall edification from those, whose zeale, &amp; fervencie carries them to bestow their goods on such Actions, nothing but destruction of Church, &amp; pietie from those, that decry such commendable, and necessary workes, &amp; we have found, that such men, as have pretended to spirituall edification, by traducing other mens zeale in the outward service of God, have proved at last rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Carkasses guilded over, and painted sepulchers.</p>
               <p>He is sorry, <hi>that Hotham felt the Iustice of others, and fell not rather in to the hands of his mercy.</hi> The libeller sayes <hi>he should have shewed, what mercie he had vsed to such as fell into his hands.</hi> He needed not shew that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are soe many Examples.</p>
               <p>But sayes the Libeller, <hi>whathever one man might have expected, the whole nation found none, but had been swallowed vp in blood, had not his power failed.</hi> What neede the King produce Examples of his mercy, when his most ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

they had necessitated him to make. There cannot be an Argument more convincing of the want of all justification in these Rebells, then their perpetuall recourse to an incredible assertion, that the King caused the warr, which besides the falsenes of the allegation is not of weight to argue want of mercy, when as Princes, and states may casually be engaged in a warr, and yet be farr from crueltie, or designes of revenge, and his Majest: knowne backwardnes to a warr, and moderation in it, shew his compassion as eminent to the publique, as particular persons.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The King pitties Hotham, but aggravates rather then lessens, or concealos his fault.</hi> Conceale, or lessen it, he could not, aggravate he doth not, &amp; being a King his pittie ought not to destroy his judgment, nor deceive him in the offence of those he pardons.</p>
               <p>If <hi>a reiterating judge be worse then a Tormenter,</hi> a reiterating standerer deserves Torment. The mention of a malefactours offence, or repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a publique transgression is farr from a Triumph, and as this Act of Hotham was a groundworke of infinite miserie: soe his Majest: deepe sense of the mischeife of that fact, might reflect on it with serious observation, and pittie without any Triumph.</p>

               <p>HE begins with the Kings mention of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, <hi>the demonstrations</hi> he calls them <hi>of the peoples love, &amp; loyaltie to the Parliament.</hi> Which in their nature more then the kings denomination were demonstrations of disobedience to law, hatred of Government, &amp; disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the king. Their petitioning was in the Authors owne judgment the height of violence, &amp; Barbarisme, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103102:86"/>
to the Iron flaile, &amp; those Armes which he cals defensive were so apparently a Trayterous histolitie, that the ends, which he assignes for them admit not the least colour for the appellation of defensive.</p>
               <p>The King takes noe notice, that those listed about him were the beginners of these Tumults. <hi>Neither could he of soe strange an imagination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The king sayes <hi>his recesse gave them confidence, that he might be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> The Libeller sayes, <hi>other men supposed both that, and all things els, who knew him neither by nature warlike, nor experienced, nor fortunate, yet such</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes he <hi>are readiest to imbroyle others.</hi> How well he performes the first pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his booke not to descant on the kings misfortunes his readers may heere see, that makes the kings misfortune his reproach, and a ground of their wicked confidence to Rebell against him, but that such men are readiest to imbroyle others is not soe certaine, but vndoubted they are not readiest to imbroyle themselves, and noe valour, nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, whereof his Majest: is wel knowne to have had a greate measure can stopp a slandrous tongue. The mischeifes brought vpon his Majest: kingdomes sprung from such persons, as sought their advantage by such broyles, which all men see the King could never expect.</p>
               <p>The King sayes <hi>he had a soule invincible.</hi> And the Libeller sayes, <hi>what prayse is that? the vnteachable man hath a soule to all reason invincible.</hi> And is an invincible courage noe prayse? He seekes to shew his witt by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying invincible to vnteachable, when as if he had cited the Kings next words, as he ought, he had lost his jest, for the King sayes, he <hi>had a soule invincible through Gods grace enabling him,</hi> but he breaketh sentences, and truth, least he should breake for want of matter.</p>
               <p>That the King labours <hi>to have it thought, that his fearing God more then man was the ground of his sufferings.</hi> The Libeller sayes, <hi>he pretended to feare God more then the Parliament, who never vrged him to doe otherwise.</hi> And did they not vrge him to doe otherwise, when they vrged him to doe that, which was against his conscience? But there neede not more be spoken of this, for the Libeller calls that a narrow conscience, which will not follow a multitude against its owne perswasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He shewes his levitie beyound that Creature he calls the vulgar, who now affirmes the King was</hi> drawne by his Courtiers, and Bishopps, <hi>and yet in the beginning of his booke he sayes, that</hi> the discourses, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Courtiers, and Prelates against the Parliament was but a Copy taken from his owne words, and Actions, that all remissenes in Religion issued origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from his owne authoritie, all miscarriages in state may be imputed to noe other person cheifely then to himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He goes on to compare the words of</hi> Saul, that he had performed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God to the Kings mention of his fearing God, &amp; the kings vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Prelates, against the advice of the Parliament, &amp; example of al refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, is not much vnlike, if not much worse, <hi>noe neerer like, then this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors writings to modestie, &amp; loyaltie. Is the advice of the Parliament,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:103102:87"/>
and the example of all reformations equall to the expresse Commaund of God? The examples of all Reformations, himselfe tells afterward are not concurrent in the matter he mentions, and if they were soe, are all points of reformation equally necessary, and of the same obligation with the commaund of God? and was the Reformation of the Church of England noe reformation? Why then doth he say all Reformation? And is not the Church of England equall, if not superiour to any part of the world, that hath reformed? But we see what account these hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites make of the Example of all Reformation, that have set vp schismaticall confusions of Religion in contempt of all Reformation. His Majest: did noe more in vpholding the Prelates, then what the example of the most primitive times, Godly Emperours, &amp; holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs instructed him in, which noe Reformation ever contradicted, and he had no reason to hearken to the advice of such, as then called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Parliament, who had broken all the lawes, and priviledges of Parliament, expelled the members, and were governed by Tumults, &amp; a company of Bedlam Sectaries against the doctrine, and practice of the vinversall Church. The practice of Saul in persecuting David wel sutes with the course of these Rebells, but they have gone beyound him in malice, and disobedience in the matter both of David, and alsoe the Amalekites, he brake the Commaundement of God in sparing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleke, these traytours presumptuously breake the Commaund of God in destroying their King, &amp; Church. And this man exceedes Sauls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that makes the preservation of an order continued in the Church in all ages as bad, or worse, then the sin of Saul.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>acts of grace are proud, vnselfe knowing words in the mouth of any King, who affects not to be a God.</hi> Certainly this Libellers words shew him not only in affection, but in Act a proud vnselfe knowing man. Are there noe Acts of favour, noe Acts of mercy in Kings, but all of necessitie, but enough hath been said to these brainesicke dreames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Never King was lesse in danger of violence from his subjects, till he vnshea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed his sword, nay long after, when he had spilt the blood of thousands, they had still his person in a foolish veneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Should a Christian cal that, which God Commaunded, &amp; David practised foolish veneration, but they whose wisedome is Rebellion, hold Divine wisedome foolishnes. And was he in so litle danger from those, that held that veneration foolish, were there none, that held soe, when they affronted him, and threatned him every day? To what end should multitudes come about his Pallace, and cry Justice, when they sought murder? What would they have done if he had denyed their demaunds, shall we beleive they intended noe violence, or shall wee beleive, that they, who had seised the forts, and navy, and vsurpt the Government would have vsed noe violence to his person, when they had him, if he plyed not with them? Its true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were not wholy vnshamed at the first, but the malice, and ambition
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103102:87"/>
of others was sufficiently confirmed, and the multitude easily falls by Example.</p>
               <p>The King complaines, <hi>that Civill warr must be the fruites of his seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares raigning with such a measure of Iustice, peace plentie, and Religion as all nations either admired or envyed.</hi> The Libeller sayes <hi>for Iustice let the Councell table, starr Chamber, and high Commission speake the prayse of it.</hi> Wee may be assured that malefactours will never prayse Court of justice, we know Sectaries, and seducers hated the high Commission, and seditious Libellers the starr chamber, &amp; conspiratours, &amp; incendiaries the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of Kings, and there were noe Acts past in these places of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as the measure of justice, which he enjoyed was not admired, or envyed by all nations.</p>
               <p>His mention of <hi>abolishing Parliaments</hi> detracts not from the measure of justice, peace, plentie, and Religion, &amp; we have found what injustice hath succeeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The displacing of honest Iudges he hath misplaced</hi> to detract from the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of his Majest: Goverment, and as the placing of judges was in his Majest: choise, soe he might take notice, whether their places might not be better supplyed by others, and the change of two judges, for thats the number in seventeene yeares, is beneath an exception, his ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling declamation against corrupt Government being only in generall deserves not an answeare, and the knowne prosperitie, peace, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Kingdome, are a sufficient confutation of such imaginary oppressions.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>what peace was that, which drew out the English to a needeles, and dishonourable voyage against the spaniards at Cades.</hi> It was that peace the Parliament desired, and if the voyage proved successels his Majest: by preventing further danger, and preserving peace notwithstanding the miscarriage (which must be the dishonour only of the managers) suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently testifies how wel he deserved of his people for the continuance of their peace, and safetie.</p>
               <p>He askes next <hi>what that was, which lent our shipping to a Treacherous, and Antichristian warr against the poore Protestants of Rochell.</hi> What is this against our peace at home, and though there were shipps of ours vsed against Rochel, tis sufficiently knowne they were not lent against Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hell, and the Dutch shipps, which were vsed, as ours were not lent to a Treacherous, and Antichristian warr.</p>
               <p>He askes <hi>what peace was that, which fell to robb the french by sea to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring all our marchants in that Kingdome.</hi> Is not this man madd, that will charge the vse of the shipping against Rochell for a Cryme, and call it a Treacherous, and Antichristian warr, and presently charge the King for making warr against the french, vpon the ground of vsing his shipps against Rochell, and call it a robbing of the french by sea, and is it possible to avoyde the losse of Marchants in case of hostilitie?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:103102:88"/>
He proceedes to cry out <hi>on that vnblest expedition to the Isle of Ree doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whether more calamitous in the succes, or designe.</hi> Was not the designe in the favour of Rochell, did they not desire it? and yet he calls the ill successe of that Action <hi>the betraying all the flower of our military youth, and best Commaunders to a shamefull surprisall, all, and execution.</hi> And who betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and to what purpose, what advantage could his Majest: have by such a losse? And was the warr against Rochell Treacherous, and Antichristian, and the releife too? But this Libeller is resolute to defie sence, and reason, &amp; now he hath spoken against the peace we enjoyed, whereto doth it amount, was there any interruption of our peace at home, and was there not cause for these expeditions abroade, If there were not the Parliament failed in their Councell to the King in advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the warr with spaine, and complaining of the french for the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployment of the shipps against Rochell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If peace were intended vs at home, what meant these billetted souldiers in all parts of the Kingdome.</hi> Dot noth he know the meaning, that mentions Cades, and the Isle of Ree, where they were imployed, surely he is soe intent on words, as he looses his Memory, aswell as his other faculties.</p>
               <p>But he hath found out a designe <hi>of German horse to subdue vs in our peacefull houses.</hi> These German horse have made much noyse, &amp; yet were never discovered, and the King, who was advised to make a warr in Germany, and other places by the Parliament could not vse German horse, but against England. But what is all this to the greate measure of peace we enjoyed above other nations. Can any man, that reades this Libellers willfull impertinency judge other, then that he fights blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, who would extend these forraigne voyages, which had not the face of warr at home, and continved not beyound the fower first yeares of his Majest: Raigne, to diminish the measure of our peace soe long enjoyed, and that in the middest of soe many miscarriages, and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies both at home, and abroade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For our Religion</hi> he sayes, <hi>where was there a more ignorant, prophane, and vitious Clergie learned only in the antiquitie of their pride.</hi> The pride of these Sectaries contemnes all learning, &amp; antiquitie, which condemnes their fantasticall, &amp; presumptuous novelezing. The learning of the English Clergie is too well knowne to the world to receive any disreput from the Streechinge of night oules, and of Kats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noe wise man could see, what was left for other nations to admire or envie, but to pittie.</hi> Other nations saw who had enough to cause them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire our happines, not to pittie our condition, and of this there is a large Testimony.</p>
               <p>But sayes the libeller, <hi>wealth, and plentie in a land, where Iustice Raignes not is no Argument of a florishing state, but of neerenes rather to ruine, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</hi> The blessings of God, peace, and plentie are often turned into
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103102:88"/>
wantonnesse, and wickednes by the people, and are often a signe by the peoples abuse of ensuing ruine, or commotion, and of this the present condition of England is a greate Testimonie, but it was never denyed, to be the florishing state of any nation, and he will finde litle creditt to his supposition, that Justice Raignes not, where there is wealth, and plentie in a land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There were not some miscarriages only of Government, which might escape.</hi> And of that nature are all the particulars gathred by him, if they had been true, <hi>but an viniversall distemper, and reducement to arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> There was a distemper, and disaffection to Government in many seditious seducers, but an viniversall distemper, and reducement to Arbitrary Government could not consist with the oppression of that tranquillitie, and securitie of the people, which was visible to all men, the losse whereof brought on by these Rebells is too late lamemted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That his Majeest: owned the Actions, and protected the persons of men in highest favour with him</hi> is noe argument of this vinversall distemper, no more then the vulgar cryes against rulers is an Argument of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, or the peoples moderation, who will have persons removed from Government, and yet not agree, who shall succeede them. It was an Argument of greate distemper in a people, that cryed out against the Kings evill Councellours, that could not judge of their Actions, but of noe vinversall distemper in the Government, neither could the king with pietie, &amp; justice leave his Ministers to the malice of conspiratours and barbaritie of Tumults.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, <hi>whose innocent blood hath he shedd, what widdowes, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans teares can wittnes against him?</hi> The Libeller thinkes he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an answeare by saying <hi>the suspected poysonnig of his Father not enquired into, and he advanced, who was aceused by Parliament to be Author of the fact, and many yeares of cruell warr on his people in three Kingdomes.</hi> It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to amazement, that such, whose language hath noe Limits of truth, or modestie should not be able to forge a probable Calumnie, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Parliament shew, that noe man was accused for the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soninge of the kings Father, nor poysoninge named, ct the fact was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquired into, and all wittnesses examined, that had any knowledge of Circumstances touching it, and must this be the particular to prove the king guiltie, of shedding blood? We may see vpon what grounds they will draw blood, that offer such pretences for taking the blood of their king. Is it possible, that a Tyrant in seventeene yeares Raigne could not be proved guiltie of the blood of one man? And can a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion be more apparently convinced, then by the seeking a cause for it from the resistance, that is made against it, and the endeavour to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it? Was ever a cause soe barren of excuse, that had nothing, but its owne guilt for defence?</p>
               <p>But he hath found out <hi>a scotchman, not vnacquainted</hi> he sayes <hi>with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103102:89"/>
the affaires, who affirmes, that there hath been more Christian blood shed by the Commission, approbation, and connivance of King Charles, and his Father Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, in the latter end of their Raigne, then in the ten Roman Persecutions.</hi> And is not this a doughtie authoritie, what could he say more to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a false varlett? Whoever saw, or heard of this shedding of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an blood, is it possible, that soe much blood should be shed, and noe man know it, but this Scotchman? Was all the world soe negligent to take notice of it, and did the Scotchman, and this Author thinke, that the blood of the late warr made vp this number, they may then expect vengeance vpon themselves, and their bloody crew for it, either heere, or heereafter. They value such, as suffred in the ten persecutions at the same rate they doe their King, and their conscience, and if they thought persecution odious, why doe they exercise a persecution vppon Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians as cruell, as these persecuting Emperours?</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>not to speake of those many whippings, and other corporall inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith his Raigne alsoe before this warr was not vnbloody.</hi> And is a Raigne bloody by inflicting death vpon robbers, and murtherers, or whipping, and the Pillory vpon, Cheates Infamous Libellers, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious disturbers of Government, but of these latter the number was very small not exceeding fower in seventeene yeares, and these merited the punishment they had, &amp; an higher had not exceeded their crymes. Is the execution of law a bloody Raigne, he findes none, that suffred <hi>banishment,</hi> nor any that died <hi>in prison,</hi> but such as were restrained by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Justice.</p>
               <p>He cannot pretend <hi>an arbitrary power</hi> in any of this, that <hi>the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the true Church</hi> is noe other language, then what good Princes all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes received from Sectaries, who accuse allwayes for their restraint, infesting the true Church, but all men now see they are the malignant Compamy that infest the true Church, &amp; the seducers of simple soules.</p>
               <p>But he hath a proofe of blood above exception, where no blood was drawne, and that is <hi>the six members, whome all men judged to have escaped no lesse then Capitall danger.</hi> Doubtles they had merited Capitall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the judgment of all knowing men. That a just King may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for the escape of malefactours is easily beleived, but that saying <hi>the birds are flowne</hi> argues much trouble is a secret to all men, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe as often applyed in jest, as earnest.</p>
               <p>The libeller sayes, <hi>that if some vulter in the mountaines could have spake, he could not have vttered fitter words at the losse of his prey.</hi> The excesses in blood, and crueltie of theis Rebells cannot be expressed to the full, by the savage nature of any Creature. The grinning of doggs howling of wolves, and hissing of Serpents are not more hideous to nature, then the petulence of vile persons against kings are abominable to Religion, and pietie.</p>
               <p>Because Nero was vnwilling to sett his hand to the execution of a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103102:89"/>
Common Malefactour, and <hi>wishing he had not knowne letters</hi> he would prove the King prosecuting Traytours to have noe greate aversation to blood, but it strongly proves a bloody conspiracie, when the contrivers are held innocent, and the King made the offender for seeking just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and the Triumphs of such, as protected those persons, and their impudent braving the King at his very doores argued their haste to the shedding of that blood, which since hath covered the Land.</p>
               <p>Touching the cause of the warr, the King sayes, <hi>It was not my with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from whitehall, for noe account in reason could be given of those Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, where an orderly guard was graunted.</hi> The libeller sayes, <hi>that if it be a most certaine truth, that the Parliament could never obtaine any guard fit to be confided in, then some account of these pretended Tumults may in reason be given.</hi> But if they be not only pretended, but apparently Tumults, there can be noe account given of them, at least the libeller vndertakes it not, and that they could not obtaine a guard fit to be confided in, is false, for they had a guard, and Commaunder of their owne nomination, though not the Earle of Essex.</p>
               <p>The King askes, <hi>whome did he protect against the Iustice of Parliament.</hi> The Libeller sayes <hi>he endeavoured to rescue Strafford,</hi> that was from their injustice, if he had done soe.</p>
               <p>But sayes the Libeller he endeavoured it, though <hi>with the destruction of them, and the Cittie, commaunding admittance of new souldiers into the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi> And is it a necessary consequent, that the admittance of new soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into the Tower were to the <hi>destruction of Parliament, and Citie.</hi> But did not such, as like blood hounds, &amp; wolves hunted the Earle of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that they might not loose their prey, and the sweetenes of their revenge in drinking his blood, stirr vp the Tumults to the destruction of King, Parliament, and Kingdome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What can be disputed with such a King, in whose mouth, &amp; opinion the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it selfe was never but a faction, and their Iustice noe Iustice, but the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and overswaying insolence of Tumults, and rabbles.</hi> The Parliament was never a faction in the Kings mouth, but it is in every mans mouth, that the Parliament hath been overswayed by a faction, and a faction have called themselves the Parliament. And how can the Libeller define a Parliament, but he must acknowledge that those, whome the King calls a faction were noe Parliament, and that their Actions were noe Justice, but the Dictates, and overswaying insolence of Tumults, and rabbles? himselfe prooves it by the commendation he gives the Tumults, for effecting these Acts, which he now calls the Justice of the Parliament, &amp; noe wise man could thinke such a rabble fit to Judge of Delinquents, or that such men, who fled from their fury were thereby culpable of the Crymes objected, and the fairest Tyrall would sooner have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, these Tumultuous accusers then the parties accused. But who can talke with such a man, as this breaker, that reputes Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103102:90"/>
Tyrany, order in the Church an imposed Religion, and lawes worse then Ceremonies in Religion.</p>
               <p>He compares <hi>the avoyding of his madd Iudicature to Catilnies flight, and excepting to the Roman Senate, and Cesars injecting scrupulous demurrs against the Decres of the senate vpon Lentulus, and Cethegus.</hi> But did either of them object, that the power of Tumults overswayed the senate, or that the senate wanted freedome, and had oppressed the members of it? If Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline had set vp a senate as Caesar did afterward, and these Rebells have in England, &amp; oppressed the legal Government, the exceptions had been very just, but exceptions against particular senatours for private animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities cannot derogate from the judgment of the whole being free.</p>
               <p>That <hi>such reasons were vrged for Strafford,</hi> was never heard at his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or other proceedings against him, the cases being contrary, for Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus, and the rest were accused for conspiring against the state, &amp; Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was accused by those, that conspired against the state, and sought to take him away for a cleerer passage to their designe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King vouchsafes, to the Reformation, which both Kingdomes intended noe better name then innovation, and ruine both to Church, and state, and the expelling of Bishopps out of the Church, ruine to the Church, and out of the house of Peeres ruine to the state.</hi> And he askes <hi>how happy the nation could be in such a governour, who counted that their ruine, which they thought their deliverance.</hi> It cannot be doubted, but the abolition of the order, and Government of Church and state, is an innovation, &amp; performed by force against the King, execrable Rebellion, and the King never doubted to say, that such disorderly innovations were the ruine of Church, and state, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, and ruines mentioned by the King to be agitated by some men are not restrained to the cause of the Bishopps, though that alone, and the manner of proceeding in regard of the injustice, violence, and the dangerous consequences, that attend it, threatned ruine to Church, and state.

If Sectaries say the calling is vnlawful against the judgment of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church, must the king beleive this, &amp; thinke himselfe absolved of his oath? The King never doubted, that his oath could not binde him to sin, but he was assured, that it was a sin to breake his oath, when it was no sin to keepe it, and while his conscience was not informed of any vnlawfulnes in the matter of his oath, his sin must be the more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to act against his oath, aswell as his knowledge.</p>

Did not their pretended necessitie come from their warr to take away Episcopacy, and is not the necessitie of their owne making to get these Revenues? What if goods dedicated to Gods service were abused to luxury, were there none els in the Kingdome soe abused?

               <p>Thus farr he hath left the first Act of hostilitie vpon his Masters, and now he comes to the <hi>raysing of two Armies against the Scotss,</hi> which were both disbanded before this warr begun, and who was the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the world well knowes.</p>
               <p>But he sayes <hi>the latter of them was raised to the most perfidious breaking of a solemne pacification.</hi> His rayling signifes his owne impietie, and want of matter that insteede of declaring the fact of the first English hostilitie seekes for scandalls from a Scotch Treatie, and would make the King persidious in his defence, because they are Traytours in their assault.</p>
               <p>He comes now to the beginning of this Parliament, and talkes of bringing vp the Armies, and his often decanted <hi>Irish Papists, and french Army,</hi> that never struke blow to be Councells for beginning a Civill warr, but these apparitions were vanisht long before the warr begun. <hi>The letters to the King of Denmarke</hi> have been sufficiently cleered from being Councells, or preparations to make a Civill warr, and the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler cannot fix any preparations vpon the king, but in case a warr should be made vpon him, which was then plotted, and evident to all knowing men.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>these, and many other were his Councells towards a Civill warr.</hi> If the king should have taken noe Conncell to have resisted the violence, not only prepared, but begun against him, it had been vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly, and vnnaturall, knowing how maliciously, and perficiously the conspiratours had called in the Scots, bribed them with vast summs of money racked from the people vpon pretence of the kings service, how they had treacherously corrupted diverse officers, and souldiers of the kings army, how they had dispersed false reports of him, and his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103102:94"/>
to all lewde persons to preach heresie, and Treason in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, how they had endeavoured to weaken the bonds of Government by punishing men for observing the lawes, by commending, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardinge malefactours, how they had affronted the king, and stirred vp the rabble to threaten violence to him, if he refused their demaunds, and must he not now prepare for his defence, or submit his judgment?</p>
               <p>His refusing <hi>to disband that Irish Army</hi> shewes noe intention of his to a Civill warr, but the Rebells earnest sollicitation for the disbanding of that Army, and the English Army, likewise leaving the Scots vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disbanded shewes their false pretentions, and malicious preparations by disarminge the king of all Armies to subdue him to their wil. These Rebells, that seized the <hi>Tower</hi> to strengthen themselves for making a warr would have it beleived, that the Kings keeping it, which had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been in his possession, was a preparation to make a warr, and while they affronted him in his Court every day would have his guard preparations to make a warr.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These waggons of ammunition</hi> to be prepared by the King in that low condition, and want of all things for warr, which he then was in, are somewhat strange, although necessary for him against the continued Acts of violence vsed by the Tumults, and avowed by the saction in Parliament, and their continuall preparations for a warr, and it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the Libellers impudence, that would have such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible preparations in respect of the Rebells force by land, and sea, and possession of the forts, Navy, and Citie of London, and Magazins of the Kingdome, should be for the making of a warr vpon them, which was in all reason soe vnable to withstand them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The appearance of some hundreds of horse at Kingston,</hi> shewes how gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they are of pretences, that make such a scare crow a cause of their Rebellion.</p>
               <p>And <hi>the Queenes buying of Armes, and the forces raysed in yorke shire</hi> were much lesse then needed, when the Rebells had assumed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the Kingdome vnder their owne Commaund. And <hi>their petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King for peace</hi> (which the Libeller mentions to be that while) was that the King would submit to their Government, and doe what they required, and with what face now could any ingenuous man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the cheife designe of the warr was either to destroy his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or force his judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to act of hostilitie, it is not much materiall, in whome it first begun after such Counoells, and preparations.</hi> It is materiall to the truth of the fact, whatever the Councells were, but he hath not named a Councell, or preparation for warr but succeeding the designe of Rebellion, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence begun, against their rage, all that he supposes on the Kings part, that looked towards a warr being only defensive, and on the part of the Rebells plainely oppressive,</p>

But he sayes <hi>in the Act alsoe the King will be found to have had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedenice, if not at London by the assault of his armed Court vpon the naked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his attempt vpon the house of Commons, yet certainly at Hull, first by his close practices on that Towne, next by his seidge.</hi> Was the Kings going with his guard to the house of Commons a proper army to make a wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, they heeretofore called it a breach of priviledge, and is it now growne soe big with time to be called a warr? And must that, which continued not an hower be defended with an Army raysed many moneths after? And is his Iron flaile, and the Parliaments Clients, that were soe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make lawes by force become a naked people, &amp; the ragged Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment a formidable Army? But if these doe not prove the King to have done the first act, for it seemes he doubted it would not, yet at Hull he is sure, and if the King had fortified all, or any of the Townes of his Kingdome, is that the act of warr? Is not the law evident, that he may doe it, and hath it not been the approved practice of all ages? And if he beseidged Hull, who began the warr, they that surprized it, or he that would recover it? And yet the Libeller gravely concludes from this fardle, that the King is truly charged with beginning the warr, though the particulars themselves evince the contrary.</p>
               <p>He sayes that <hi>at the Isle of weight, he charged it vpon himselfe at the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Treatie.</hi> What he did at that Treatie is well knowne to be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the procuring of peace, and though they, that treated with him would have an Act to acquitt them for their securitie, yet that could not alter the fact, and the King tooke nothing on himselfe by consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to passe an act, if the Treatie tooke effect, which act by law, to whose interpretation only it was subject, could not be expounded to charge the king with the beginning of that warr, but so mainfest is the vntruth of their pretence, that they would aide their cause by inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from an Act of their owne importunitie, and violence for their owne securitie.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the securing of Hull was noe su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He sayes <hi>it were folly beyound ridiculous to count our selves a free nation, if the King against the Parliament might appropriate to himselfe the strength of a whole nation, as his proper goods.</hi> And is it lesse ridiculous to count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a free nation, if the Parliament may appropriate to themselves all the strength of the kingdome, as their owne proper goods against al the people, are they more a free nation, because they have many Masters? Our nation justly accounted it selfe a free nation, and yet a king had all the strength of the kingdome appropriated to him, as his owne proper goods, and they have seene how their libertie was preserved by that constitution, &amp; how it hath been lost by vsurpation of this right in the name of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103102:95"/>
The Parliament had never <hi>the life; and death of lawes in their power,</hi> and the people never thought it for their Securitie, that they should, and the Libeller may with as good reason call succeeding acts preventions aswell, as this taking of Hull <hi>a Securing.</hi> Are not the taking of Townes Acts of hostilitie vnder what name soever, had not the taking of Hull been an Act of hostilitie in an Enemy? And is it lesse in a Rebell? The question is now of an act of hostilitie, not the right of it, and that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Towne is not an act of hostilitie wilbe incredible to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest capacitie, and noe lesse, that the Parliament have a power of hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie against the king.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the law of the land is at best but the reason of Parliament.</hi> And the reason of Parliament is noe reason if it differ from the opinion of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, witnes his censure of voting the kings concessions a ground for peace: &amp; it were as dissonant from law, as reason, that a kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be subject to the reason of a Major part in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, <hi>they knew his cheifest Armes left him were those only, which the ancient Christians were wont to vse against their persecutors, prayers, and teares.</hi> At this the Libeller makes an exclamation, O <hi>Sacred reverence of God, respect, and shame of men, whither were ye fled, when these hipocrisies were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Doubtles reverence of God, respect, and shame of men are fled from this man, that makes this vaine, &amp; prophane outcry. Doth it follow, that because the King got strength, therefore he was possest of it, when they rebelled against him? doth not he reproach him, that all his adherents hardly amounted to the making, vp of one ragged Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment strong enough to assault the vnarmed house of Commons? And can he thinke there is a God, that cryes out sacred reverence of God, vpon occasion of these words of his Majest: was ever king more desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of aide, and might more truly vse that expression then he. Those <hi>thousands of Cavileers,</hi> whose number he soe often despised, and now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are a conviction of his contempt of God, and men, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes is more abominable, then any oaths, curses, and carouses he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. And <hi>the numbers mustred on Heworth Moore</hi> were a sufficient proofe of the Kings want of Armes to make a warr, as they were then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Rebells scorne, &amp; were not the Libeller as vaine, as wicked, he would not have mentioned the sale of the <hi>Crowne Iewells,</hi> to buy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes for a ground of his exclamation, when nothing could shame him more, were he capable of it, for may not a man justly say, that the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Armes left a King were prayers, &amp; teares, when all his visible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to procure Armes were the Jewells of his Crowne? &amp; those guns, which were bought with the Jewells, he calls <hi>deadly instruments of warr,</hi> but the instruments of Rebells are harmeles, and vnkilling. Men of corrupt consciences thinke they may prophane the name of God at

their pleasure by making their lewde constructions of words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And although this libeller jeere at the Kings weakenes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this warr, which was visible to all the world, &amp; the strength he found was vnexpected by his Enemies, and that all men judged pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and teares his cheifest Armes, yet because strength came to him, the Libeller calls <hi>Ammunition, Regiments, and Brigades, prayers, and reares,</hi> his ordinary Armes being slander, vntruth, and prophanes.</p>
               <p>In his next words he sayes, <hi>they, who fought for the Commonwealth have by the helpe of better prayers vanquished.</hi> It seemes he holds not their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers their cheifest Armes, who trusted more in other Armes, then their prayers, and might thence have reasonably concluded, that their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was not given to their prayers, but permitted for the sins, &amp; scourge of the nation.</p>
               <p>The King <hi>reckons not the want of the Militia in reference to his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as his peoples. Not consideringe</hi> sayes the Libeller, <hi>how ill for seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares he had protected them, and the miseries are like a forked Arrow, it cannot be drawne out without incision of more flesh.</hi> He hath told vs, that those miseries of seventeene yeares were peace, and plentie, which those merciles Phisitians will cure by an endles warr, letting out the blood, and tearing the flesh of the afflicted people, and wee now descerne what Phisike they intended for the Kingdome. Sawes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, swords to lance them, and famine to pine them, till they were sufficiently purged of their former prosperitie, and he neede not have vsed soe many shifts to deny the beginning of the warr, when he sayes the cure of the Kingdome was to be made with incisions. What want of protection appeared in those seventeene yeares, never people were more secure? But the man mistakes the scene of his exclamation, as his Sermonizers there notes, &amp; tell the people of suffring that knew none among them.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the wings of faith may be mistaken for the wings of presumption,</hi> Presumptuous men are mistaken of the wings of faith, and this Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler hath sufficiently exprest himselfe one of them, and may feare by his presumption to fall head long.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>that the Parliament have hung the Majest: of King-shipp in an airy imagination of Regalitie betweene the priviledges of both houses, like the tombe of Mahomett.</hi> To this sayes the Libeller, <hi>he knew not that he was prophesying the death, and buriall of a turkish Tyrany, that spurned downe those lawes, which gave it life, and being, soe strong, as it endured to be a regulated Monarchy,</hi> he was not prophesying, but relating a plaine story how a just Monarchy was opprest by a Turkish imposture, and Tyrany, and an Empire sett vp in an Army of Janizaries, that spurned downe al law, and Religion, and as the Turkish doctrine of propogating their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition by blood, and warr was preached vnto the people, as their dutie to doe the like for their new hereticall fancies, soe their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103102:96"/>
deceites in making the King a fantastique supposition, and his authoritie nothing els, but the opinions of the two houses was as grosse, and lewde, as the imaginary Miracle of Mahometts Tombe.</p>
               <p>From the Kings words touching the vse of the Militia, <hi>that he would but defend himselfe soe farr, as to defend his good subjects from these mens vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, who perswade the world, that none but wolves are fitt to be trusted with the Custody of the sheepeheard, and his flocke.</hi> The Libeller would inferr this a cleere confession from his owne mouth, that <hi>if the Parliament had left him the sole power of the Militia, he would have vsed it to the destruction of them, and their friends.</hi> And is an vse for defence against wrong, and fraude, an vse to destruction? And if the faction called Parliament be not permitted to destroy the sheepeheard, and his flocke, is it a destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them? But they knew themselves wolves, and could not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, while any power was out of their hands, &amp; therefore would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that they were fittest to be trusted with that, which was the sole defence against their rapacitic.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the King hath been often told, that he had noe more power over the sword, then the law.</hi> But who told him soe? Never any but knowne Rebells Parliaments have allwayes said the contrary, and the practice of it in all times was never questioned. Though Kings cannot be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Judges, yet all Justice slowes from them, and by their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and because their condition, and place requires, that Justice be administred by their deputies according to the Custome of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, therefore they have not power to vse the Militia, which is most proper to their place, and cannot be seperated from their person, could not be told by reasonable men.</p>
               <p>The pretended feare of Rebells, that <hi>he may by this power controll the law</hi> they will not extend to their owne power of the militia, and may not their Rebell generall controll all lawes by the power of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? And doth he not? The subjects of England vnderstood the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of their lawes to rest in their King, whose interest they knew it was to preserve them. Tyrany, and breach of lawes would make his Estate vnsecure, and dangerous, and therefore they fought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him against such, as would destroy their lawes, and him. But in this clamour of the Libeller he only seekes to vilifie Monarchicall Government, and to perswade all people, that live vnder Kings, that they are not free, and vnderstand not what is libertie, as is in other formes of Government the people were not Commaunded, and might chuse their owne lawes, and order their warrs. There is frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the Roman Commonwealth of the Rebellion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnder ptetence of libertie, and seditious inclinations will assoone take occasion to object Tyrany to senates, &amp; Parliaments, as kings What state can those Rebells frame, that may not degenerate into a Tyrany,

but they only feeke pretences for their Rebellion against the present Government to transferr it to themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King is contented to resigne his power for his owne time.</hi> And sayes the Libeller <hi>he is carefull, wee should be slaves to his posteritie, and leaue vs the legaice of another warr about it.</hi> There is noe doubt, but the Rebells desired the Militia to enslave the people, and destroy the king, and they would rather be devills then subjects. This Libeller makes noe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a subject, and a slave, and though they pretended the setling of the Militia in respect of present danger, yet they are soe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent to reject the kings offer to settle it for his owne time.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the King calls the Parliament a many headed Hydra of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not more eyes then mouths,</hi> which he falsely recites, for the King sayes, <hi>As this many headed Hydra of Government makes a shew to the people to have more eyes to see, soe they will finde it to have more mouths too to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and heere the Libeller according to his custome answeares sense with non sense, for he sayes, <hi>surely not more mouths, nor soe wide, as the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute rabble of his Courtiers both hees, and shees, if there were any males among them.</hi> Doth he make a question, whether any males, and yet talke of a dissolute rabble? And are the new senatours commaunded single life to prevent the generation of Traytours? But the Kingdome findes, that those numbers of leane kine have devoured more in seven yeares, then all the Courtiers in seven hundred.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>to dispute what kinde of Government is best would prove a long Theame, it sufficeth, that his reasons heere for Monarchy are found weake, and inconsiderable.</hi> We have the word of a grave Author for it, who hath made long invectives, &amp; yet never handled the Theame, nor answeared any one reason produced for Monarchy, &amp; though it be a long Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to dispute what Government were best in his judgment, yet he might have made the question shorter by disputing, whether subjects might Rebell to subvert the Monarchy vnder which they live, And he would have Tyrany a ground for Rebellion, and that Tyrany to be Monarchy, aud if the dispute be long, the solution wilbe very easie.</p>

But the wringing of the Militia out of his hands shewes how impudently these men pretend right, or truth for their Actions, must a man give vp his strength, when it is demaunded, because he hath an assurance of Gods protection, and because he sees some reason to part with it, as the king did for love of publique peace, must he not therefore have an assurance of Gods protection? his holding it fast was his dutie, and the wringing it from him hath open injustice both in the Act, and intention.

                  <hi>THE King vses plausibilitie of large, and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite words to defend himfelfe at such distance, as may hinder the eye of Common Iudgment from all distinct view, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his reasoning.</hi> It is the Libellers labour to keepe his reasoning from Common view, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seekes to divert the readers by Chimericall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and invectives against Monarchy, and repeated common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of misgovernment. Vpon examination the Kings plaine, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct reasoning will appeare convincing to every right judgment.</p>
               <p>The Libeller sayes. <hi>The king shewes not, how it can happen, that the peace of a people should be inconsistent with the conscience, and honour of a King.</hi> And doth this man hold, that the King ought to sacrifise Religion, Justice, and pietie for the peace of his people? Shall he destroy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men, and persecute Christians to procure peace? Or are these things consistent with honour, &amp; conscience? and may not such things be desired by a wicked people in order to peace? And therefore the Libeller vainely presses, that <hi>nothing is more agreeable to the conscience, and honour of a King, then to preserve his subjects in peace.</hi>

And is there anything more contrary to the conscience, &amp; dutie of subjects, then to procure a Civill warr, by demaunding concessions of their King, which in honour, and conscience he cannot grannt, &amp; which being graunted would be noe ground for a lasting peace, though it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded a present warr.</p>
               <p>The Libeller askes <hi>which of the propositions were obtruded on him with the point of the sword, till he with the point of the sword thrust from him both propositions, and propounders.</hi> A strange question in this Libeller, that hath soe often obtruded the feares, and terrours raysed in the King by the Tumults, and Iron flaile, seizing of the Magazins, and not leaving him a sword, that had a point to thrust, but this Theame is too much soyled by soe often repetition, and yet he proceedes to talke of <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les obtrusions, which for almost twentie yeares the King had been forcing vpon tender consciences by all sorts of persecutions.</hi> And these tender consciences he will allow to be preferred before the peace of the Kingdome. Truly these are not large, and indefinite words, but apparent absurdities to the eye of every Common judgment, that the pretended conscience of every hipocriticall sectarie must be preferred to the peace of a King dome, and the King must be allowed none, but lose life, and Kingdome, or prostitute his conscience. The Libellers examination of the Kings booke, it seemes was noe other, then of his owne writings, that huddles vp contradictions, and absurdities soe obvious to the first sight. His la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to declaime against <hi>persecution</hi> is not matter of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The king sayes <hi>Many things are required of him, nothing offred in requit all.</hi> And the Libeller demaunds. <hi>What could satiate the desires of this man, who being King of England, and Master of almost two millions yearely was still in want.</hi> And yet the Masters in the new state affirme in their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the constant Revenue of the Crowne exceeded not a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pound a yeare, And why should not the King expect contributions from his subiects, aswell as al his Predecessours still had? And why will this man deny him supplies, that soe often obtrudes his wants, and he will have the King content with Rebells Charitie, and allowes them to take al from him, when they list, as the subjects money, this is the supreame honour, and Revenue, that the king ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himselfe with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was for honours sake, that they put the King vpon the giving part, not that it belonged to him of right,</hi> for he sayes <hi>all lawes are in the hands of the Parliament, and King-shipp it selfe.</hi> He sayes it, and yet we must beleive him, that England was a Monarchy, if the Majestie were not in the king, how was it other, then a republique, and it was for honours sake, that they have been subjects these many hundred yeares, wherefore would he have the world beleive warrs were made betweene compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but we finde, that what Rebells can attaine by power, they will assert for right, and they, which have had soe many denialls, and have profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed conscientious, subjection at last come to say, it was for honours sake, and of forme, not necessitie, that they were subjects.</p>
               <p>The Libeller proceedes to shew, that <hi>Monarchy cannot permit the requisites necessary to societie.</hi> That <hi>the will of one man in Government is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to freedome.</hi> And why not the will of five hundred to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the rest, as much as that one? These men thinke that their clamour against the power of one man hes a greate influence vpon the ignorant people, which might have had some beleife before they had tryed their new Masters. If we looke vpon the most ancient sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world, we finde the people both in peace, and warr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by one man, nature teaching the necessitie of one generall in an Army, and the Government, which God himselfe appointed to his people was by one man, and as moyses was at first, soe were his successours, and the kings after Saul, and David, and this Libeller can speake nothing of this power of one man, but must censure, and vilifie Gods owne institution, he offers nothing against Monarchy but what hes equall opposition to Parliament, and all formes of Government, for the peoples good, for which he sayes the king hath his rights, will assoone become a pretence for Rebellion against any Rulers, as kings.</p>
               <p>His denyall, that <hi>the King is not greater then his Parliament,</hi> is only opposinge his bare word to all sense, and reason, for doth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter petition the lesse, and yet the Parliament constantly petition the king.</p>
               <p>He sayes <hi>the King can doe noe wrong.</hi> And have not they then, that pretend he had done wrong committed disobedience, and wrong?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King can doe noe right but in his Courts.</hi> And if they be his Courts, and his deputies, and doe all in his name, doth it not follow, that it is his doing? And though the kings sitt not ordinarily in their Courts, yet they have often sate in severall Courts, and in Parliament the King himselfe gives orders, as appeares by the Presidents of all times, and wherefore did the Parliament preferre their petition of right to the King, and importuned his answeare, if he had noe power to doe right, but by his Courts? But what concernes the administration of Justice by deputies is not peculiar to England, but to all other Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without his Courts he is noe King.</hi> And yet they are his Courts, and cannot sitt, but by his graunt.</p>

               <p>The Authors descant vpon the Kings words of the <hi>incommunicable Iewell of his conscience</hi> discovers, how he hath exposed his owne to the flatterie, and slaverie of his Masters, and had he thoughts of conscience he would not have valued it at the basest price.</p>

                  <hi>The breeding of Most kings hath ever been sensuall, and most humoured.</hi> He speakes it of his owne sense, and inclination to such base offices. Kings have greatest cause to avoyde such breeding, and persons of such condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The kings dissent from his whole kingdome</hi> is a supposition of that, which never was, and were impossible ever to happen, but should it happen, they that are governed must submitt to the governour, and that by all the Rules of divine, and humane law.</p>
               <p>The Libeller saying <hi>the king preferrs his love of truth before the love of his people</hi> the Kings words are, <hi>the love I have of my peoples place hath greate influence vpon me, but the love of truth, and inward peace hath more.</hi> And who thinkes not, that it ought to have soe? For <hi>his search of truth,</hi> he had gone amisse, if he had rested on those propounders, which the Libeller prescribes him. And that <hi>vnaccountable Prerogative,</hi> which the Libeller sayes <hi>is the truth he loves,</hi> would have been judged a truth by the Libeller, if he had reteined either feare of God, or love to his Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is our ill hap, that three kingdomes should be pestred with one conscience, which scrupled to graunt what the Parliament advised him.</hi> But it was the miserie of the three kingdomes, that a faction of depraved men, that had cast away conscience should oversway the Parliament, and demaund graunts for their owne ambition against the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

                  <hi>These scruples to many</hi> he sayes <hi>seeme pretended, to others vpon as good grounds may seeme reall.</hi> And to this it seemes the Libeller inclines, for noe reason wil permitt, that he should suffer soe much vpon a pretence of conscience.</p>
               <p>It was the just judgment of God, that he, who was soe cruell, and remorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to other mens consciences, should have a conscience soe cruell to himselfe.

               <p>The Libeller recites, that the King said <hi>he thought fit to deny some things in honour, &amp; Policie, though he could approve them,</hi> which is not at al said by the King, but that <hi>some things, which a King might approve, yet in honour, &amp; Policie might be denyed at some time to some men.</hi> And who doubts it, can there be a want of such considerations in a King?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good Princes thought it their happines to be allwayes graunting.</hi> How could that be, if it be true, which he sayes they had nothing to graunt? But good subjects never demaunded that, which should make their King vnable to graunt any more.</p>
               <p>He remembers himselfe now, that <hi>good things were to be graunted for the things sake, indifferent things for the peoples sake,</hi> and he hath made it his continued Theame, that the King could graunt nothing in favour, but all was necessary in Justice, and it is apparent, that the kings large concessions invited these ingratefull Rebells to make those shameles demaunds, which themselves knew noe king in honour, Policie, and Justice could graunt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vndoubtedly his Coronation oath bindes him to a generall, and implicite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to whatever the Parliament desired.</hi> And then vndoubtedly the king must be in worse condition then any subject, for noe man but he is bound to such a blinde obedience, and it is a strange blindenes in this man to offer such a thing to be beleived, which himselfe holds incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for he sayes, <hi>the Kings oath cannot binde him against necessary reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And can it then binde him to make wicked lawes, which must be reformed? Is the Parliament infallible, &amp; may they not make ill lawes? What is the reason, that the Libeller, and his Sectaries would not give obedience to Acts of Parliament vpon pretence of conscience, &amp; ought the king to consent to such lawes, as the subjects ought not to obey?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King ought not to vie wisedome with the Parliament,</hi> and why then doe the Libeller, and his Sectaries vie wisedome with all former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Any of the Parliament may as farr excell him in the guift of wisedome, as he them in place, and dignitie.</hi> But its very vnlike, and neere to impossible, especially, if we looke to the experience of all times, and it is often found, that a King is wiser, then all his Councell; And though the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller say <hi>sure it was not he,</hi> meaning the King: as wise men, as any of his Councell, or Parliament thought it was he, &amp; never good subjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with their King for that comparison.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, <hi>that that were, as if Sampson should have consented to put out his eyes, that the Philistins might with more safetie mocke, and abuse him.</hi>

And this sayes the Libeller <hi>out of an vnwise, or pretended feare of scorne for yeilding to his Parliament, he gives cause of suspition, that he made a scorne of his Regall oath.</hi> Could any man suspect, that his Regall oath bound him to such a dispicable slavery, that a king should be in greater bondage to his Parliament, then any vassall to a Lord, a king might justly scorne such an oath, that would make him scorned by all, when he had taken it, but the Libeller had noe better answeare, and therefore retreates to his Common refuge of insignificant repetition.</p>

Alterations were made, where corruptions had entred into doctrine, or practice, but it was very farr from esteeming the primitive Church, a time of superstition, and plucking vp by the rootes, what ever was planted in the first ages of the Church. Sectaries are not to be judges of what varies from Scripture, their opinions arising from disobedience, must needes be full of errour, and schisme, and his Majest: had good reason to preferre the doctrine, and practice of the primitive Church before any moderne opinion of reformation, and as all the pregnant, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reasons of the Chnrches beyound the seas wrought lesse with the faction in Parliament, then the Tumults, and rabbles, soe farr lesse with this Libeller, that defends a schisme from them all vnder the divided Conventicles of Independancy, and a crew of ignorant, and irreligious Hobgoblins that eate the fat of robbery, and oppression.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103102:102"/>
they would <hi>vindicate the Government of the Church, innovated, &amp; corrupted,</hi> he should have shewed from what time it was corrupted.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, <hi>such, as were looked vpon before as factious in the state, &amp; Schismatieall in the Church demaunded not only tollerations for themselves in their vanitie, noveltie, and confusion, but alsoe an extirpatiou of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whose rights they had a minde to invade.</hi> And the Libeller askes, <hi>was this man ever likely to be advised, who setts himselfe against his chosen Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and censures the Government of other protestant Churches as bad, as any Papist.</hi> Certainly such Councellours were very vnfitt to advise, that were soe ill qualified, such as the lawe judges offenders are incapable to judge of law, &amp; that such were these demaunders is evident to al men, that know the lawes, and Government of England. There are noe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches, that thinke their Government censured, if others dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from it, in any particular, but they will hold it a Schismaticall inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in any to endeavour to alter a Government well setled vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to introduce another against the will of the king. It imports not any contempt of the kingdome, if such, as they chose be found either defective, or false, and to engage the kingdome in all the impieties, that men act, which are chosen by them is as absurd, as vainely pretended by the Libeller who will make a faction prevalent by Tumults, and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the kingdome, and the king should have had his kingdome in greate contempt, if he had taken such a faction for the kingdome.</p>
               <p>He drawes an Argument <hi>from the penaltie of being a Christian vnder the heathens, and a Protestant vnder Papists.</hi> And surely had they sought to introduce their Religion with the destruction of the Civill state, such a fact would have merited the name of treason, but their course was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to these Sectaries, who sought only to enjoy the libertie of their conscience, not to enforce others.</p>
               <p>That <hi>our saviour comming to reforme his Church was accused of an intent to invade Caesars right, as good a right, as ever the Prelate Bishopps had, the one being gotten by force, the other by spirituall vsurpation.</hi> Helpes not the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for our saviour was innocent of that false accusation, declaring his kingdome not to be of this world, &amp; acknowledged Caesars right, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people to give vnto Cesar the things, that were Cesars, but this mans prophanes would have the accusation true, and lawfull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Cesars right from the false accusation of our saviours, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously avowes invading of the Bishopps rights, because one better then cesars, for to what other purpose doth he compare the rights of Cesar, and the Bishopps, vnlesse to justifie their dealinge with the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps. And accuse our saviour for intending the lyke to Caesar?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The right of the Prelate Bishopps was gotten by spirituall vsurpation.</hi> Could any Jew, Turke, or Pagan speake more reproach fully against Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aintie, that the calling of those men, who were soe eminent for suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and Martidome, and gathering the Christian Church throughout the world was a spirituall vsurpation?</p>

The objection or <hi>to his Majest: repeating the arguments from law, antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Ancestours, prosperitie, and the like</hi> was very improper from him, whose repititions of Tyrany, slavery, single voyce, consent of the kingdome, and such like have blotted soe greate a part of his booke, and he, that would binde the king to follow the Example of other Churches will exclude antiquitie, and the primitive Church, and authorise the schisme of innovating Sectaries, because Papists have vsed Arguments against them.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, <hi>had he two houses sued out their livery from the wardship of Tumults, he could sooner have beleived them.</hi> But sayes the Libeller <hi>it concerned them first to sue out their livery from his encroaching Prerogative,</hi> The law allowes noe livery from Royall Prerogative, but judges them Rebells that seeke it.</p>
               <p>The Character sett on them, <hi>that hunt after faction with their hounds the Tumults,</hi> the Libeller hath justified by his defence.</p>
               <p>Its noe shame for a King to be <hi>a pupill to the Bishopps,</hi> whose calling it is to give him spirituall Councell, but it were madnes to be a laquay to such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who take vpon them to judge of the callings in the Church of God, which have noe calling to it, much more to a rabble, whome the Libeller himselfe holds extravagant.</p>
               <p>That <hi>nimrod was the first, that hunted after faction</hi> could never be told by the Bishopps, much lesse, that he was the first, that <hi>founded Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi> The Bishopps could have named a more ancient foundation in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and Noah. They finde the hunters after faction by Tumults of a latter dale, Corah, and his Company, that Rebelled against Moses, and Sheba, that spake to the Tumults, what part have we in David, or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the sonne of Jesse? and they finde them in the cursed Jewes, that hunted by the Tumults against our Saviour. In Demetrious, and his Craftsmen against the Apostles, and in Alexander the Copper Smith against St. Paul, and thats the <hi>game,</hi> which Rebells in all times <hi>hollowed</hi> to, and the <hi>Mungrell sort</hi> never faile them, and these, that hunt with such hounds preserve beasts of prey to devoure the quiett, &amp; profitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly Parliaments made lawes before Kings were in being,</hi> which must have better authoritie then his reason to prove; We finde kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawes before ever we reade of Parliaments, &amp; in Commonwealths we finde their law makers were single men, as Licurgus, Solon, and diverse others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The kings holding his Crowne by law,</hi> doth not imply another law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then the king, who first made that law, wherevnto the whole people were subject, but he, that soe lately blamed repetitions vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably falls into his old rode of disputing against <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which he pretends to decline.</p>

Whereof was it a signe in Junious Brutus, that was directed by the oracle to kisse his Mother, his succeeding act was the expulsion of the kings, and change of the Government, was that lesse then Tyrany, or not soe presaged by the oracle, as wel as a dreame? Parliaments can be noe Mothers to kings, that are created by kings. The king is by the law of England Father of the Countrey, &amp; the life, and soule of the law, but the Libeller will finde out a step Mother an Athalia to destroy the seede Royall, and sett her meestuous broode vpon the throne, for these dreames were the delusions of some prime Rebells, and could not allude vnto just Title, but conceites are growne low, when such dreames must be fetcht in for reasons.</p>
               <p>And from his dreames, it is not strange, he should fancie allusions (which himselfe sayes are ordinary of the King to the sun) of force <hi>to swell vp Caligula to thinke himselfe a God.</hi> And because these Rebells can not be Gods, they will be Devills.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>these propositions are not the joint, and free desires of both houses, next that the choise of many members was carried by faction.</hi> He sayes <hi>Charles the fifth against the Protestants in Germany laid the fault vpon some few.</hi> And what is that to the faction in England? If they be not the joint desires of both houses, as it was not, ought the King to take it for the advice of Parliament, and forbeare to shew the fraude, because Charles the fifth said the like vpon another occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Court was wont to tamper with Elections, and</hi> he sayes <hi>noe faction was then more potent.</hi> And yet he affirmes they prevayled not, where then was their potencie?</p>
               <p>Because the king sayes, <hi>he cannot swallow such Camells of sacriledge, and Injustice, as others doe,</hi> The Libeller sayes, <hi>he is the Pharisee, vp, and downe, is not as other men are.</hi> Is it Pharisaisme to professe with the Prophett David the dislike of them, that follow superstitious vainties. Because the Pharisee swallowed Camells, be such men Pharisees, that professe they will not? &amp; because the Sectaries pretended conscience of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies like the Pharisees washing, the outside, while they devoure the Estates of other men without remorse, are they not Pharisees? and are they only, that professe they cannot swallow such Camells Pharifees? this is a new found Pharisee.</p>

               <p>But he sayes <hi>there is in it no such wide disagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the scope of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Counsells,</hi> we are sure there could not be agreement with the scope of his former Counsells.

yeare to the beginning of the Rebellion, but how does he hang this togeather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The advancing the Popish partie</hi> he sayes, but instances in noe particular, nor for <hi>negotiating vnderhand by Priests,</hi> which were as impertinent to an inference of the Kings friend-ship, or causing the Rebellion, as the vse of such persons by Ministers of State, though of different Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He engaged the Irish Papists in a warr against the Scotch protestants,</hi> there was never popish engagement against the Scotts for the King, if in the kings Army raysed in that kingdome, there were Papists, it was without the engagement of their partie, but their engagement by alleagiance to their King, and whence doth it follow, that because the King raysed an Army in Ireland he must therefore rayse the Rebellion in Ireland? and as its well knowne, that the keeping vp of that Army would probably have prevented the Rebellion of Ireland, &amp; that it was disbanded long before that Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brake foorth; so they, which complained so much of that Army, and importuned to have it disbanded, thereby prepared the way to their owne Rebellion as groundlesse, and cruell, as that of the Irish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The summer before that dismall October a Committee of active Papists, all since in the head of the Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> (yet Sr. Hardresse waller was one of them) <hi>were in greate favour at whitehall, and admitted to private consultations of the King, and Queene.</hi> Then all Companies of Traytours are Committees from the example of the late Parliament. But he was loath to say, they were a Committee (as they were) from the lower house of Parliament in Ireland, which kept correspondence with the faction of the English Parliament, and made addresses to them, and were encouraged by them in their proceedings with the King, and their comming over was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to serve the designe of the faction in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But noe meane matters were the subject of these conferences, for he gave away his peculiar right to more then five Irish Counties for an inconsiderable Rent.</hi> But it was not his right of soveraigntie, neither was this, which he calls noe meane matter a conference about the Rebellion, and this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar right, which this Libeiler accuses the King for parting with not to Papists peculiarly, but subjects in generall, the accusers of the Earle of Strafford charged him for asserting to the King, and that inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Rent was in their judgment excessive, these are the colours of Justice, and truth, which these Rebells put on their Calumnies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They departed not till within two moneths before the Rebellion.</hi> Rebells or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly disgiuse their intentions, and therefore such might frequent the Court, as the faction in Parliament pretended affection, and dutie, while they plotted to destroy the King, and now the Libeller resorts to his Scotch Author, who he sayes declares. <hi>What should move the King to those close meetings,</hi> he that beleives Sanders, Carries, and other Papists

               <p>The Libeller flies from hence to one of his common haunts, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of bringing vp the English, and Scotch Army,</hi> and thinkes it noe repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which he had soe often obtruded, and he inferrs, that because <hi>the King could not prevayle with them,</hi> he <hi>betakes himselfe to the Irish, who had in readines an Army of eight thousand Papists, and a Committee heere of the same Religion.</hi> But what to doe to kill one another? If the King sought to make vse of the Irish, that rebelled, he might more advantagiously have done it, then by cutting one anothers throates, and had they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him assistance, they would not have consumed themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his subjects there, and how could he transport that Army from Ireland, that was disbanded before ever the Rebellion brake foorth, and the Committee departed two moneths before.</p>
               <p>He tells vs from his friend the Scotchman, that <hi>there were they, who thought now was the time to doe service for the Church of Rome against the Puritant Parliament.</hi> Its very likely there were they, who thought the Puritan faction in Parliament had done more to the advantage of the Church of Rome by the embroyling of England, then ever had been done since the reformation, and they might well thinke it a fit time to attempt any designe against the Kingdome. And did not the Libeller thinke, that there are among the vulgar such capacities, as receive le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends, and Romanses for true stories, he would not soe grossely produce such discourses of <hi>five Counties</hi> given to the Irish, and <hi>fower offred to the Scotch,</hi> And of like stuffe is his mention of the Kings attempt to <hi>pervert the Scotch Army from their way homeward, and the plot,</hi> which he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his Scotch Colleague <hi>to remove out of the way such, as were most likely to withstand, or not further his designes.</hi> With this libertie of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe theis Traytours seeke to maske their villany</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Commission vnder the greate seale of Scotland commaunded this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> Was taken vp after the pretence of the greate seale of England was detected of falsitie, and as this greate seale of Scotland hath asmuch vntruth, soe it hath noe more colour, there being noe possibilitie for the King to vse that seale, not at all in his power to such a Commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The sending of the Ld. Dillon</hi> is of the same stampe, what the Irish did is easily graunted, but the falshoods of this Libeller, and his friend the scotchman are no misteries of iniquitie, but open, and detected cheates, &amp; one quotes the authoritie of the other, as if they were strangers mett by chance, and make Libelling their worke to distract the people, and yet from these devices the Libeller will conclude, that <hi>the King cannot be doubted to be Author, or instigatour of that Rebellion.</hi> It had been ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to cite a gazett, but a branded stigmaticke, infamous. If his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be moved by such Arguments, tis the lesse wonder, that his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

               <p>These Testimonies likelyhoods, evidences, and apparent Actions, which he mentions in the declaration of July 1643. Are of as litle cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as his friend the Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And there is not a more evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of malefactours, then their declarations against the king are of the guilt of those, that contrived them, setting foorth their dutie, which they dissembled, and condemning their actions, which they disavowed.</p>

                  <hi>It is not credible, that the Irish Rebells would be foe farr from humanitie, as to stander him being soe well received by him at Oxford.</hi> If a man had wanted an proofe of the Libellers absurditie, he might heere be furnished by himselfe, that drawes an Argument from the humanitie of the Irish, whose barbaritie, and Treacherie is soe greate a part of his accusation against the king. They who were received at Oxford vpon offer of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, were very farr from pretence of such a Commission, and it may be aswell concluded they had a Commission at Oxford, as before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were there, and aswell concluded, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The king neede not bring proofes against a groundles accusation, that containes not any evidence of fact, and a single denyall by al lawes is preferred before such a charge, and it is as likely, that the Rebells in Ireland should pretend his Seale, as those in England his authoritie, &amp; noe man doubts of the invaliditie of a Rebells pretence.</p>

the Irish had to alledge for their imitation, <hi>by how much protestant prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are more against Rebellion, then those of Papists</hi> such, as inferre good affection to the Irish from such premises will easily make vaine, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious rumours strong proofes.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>he hath the greatest share of dishonour, and losse, by what is committed.</hi> The Libeller, as before makes this noe Argument, because <hi>every one, that offends God, or his neighbour hath the greatest share of losse and dishonour in the end,</hi> and have they not worldly ends, in offending God, and if these ends were not sought by them, they would not offend God?</p>
               <p>He pretended before, that <hi>this was a politique contrivance of the King,</hi> and now he would have it <hi>an act without designe.</hi> Doth he thinke, that the malitious reports of him, and his Scotchman are of weight to make a man suspected of an act directly tending to his owne vndoing, and would the King instigate the Irish Rebellion for his owne ends to have the assistance of the Irish, which by such engagement could not assist him. Though presumptions are noe convincing proofes, yet they are more credible, then suspitions, or reports. It is a strong Argument for the peoples confidence in their King more then in other men, because his interest lies cheifely in the common welfare of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and it is hard to beleive, that a King will knowingly doe any thing against that interest, and to his owne losse, and dishonour, and whenever any have offended in that kinde, the proofe of it hath been more apparent, then the authoritie of rumours, and Libells, but heere the act it selfe cannot have any possibilitie of concurrence to the Kings ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It too notoriously appeares in another section,</hi> which he Mangles, but shall heere have it whole. The King sayes, <hi>tis thought by many wise men, that the preposterous rigour, and vnreasonable severitie, which some men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed before them in England was not the least incentive, that kindled, and blew vp into those horrid flames the sparkes of discontent, which wanted not predisposed fewell for Rebellion in Ireland.</hi> The Libeller sayes that <hi>these some men are the Parliament. And if the Rebells had feed an Advocate, he could hardly have dazled better.</hi> Truly the Libellers too notoriously doth not amount to a dazling of any eyes from descerning his vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Does any thing heerein excuse a Rebellion, that speakes only of what succeded it? And if the kings censure of the proceedings of such, as managed the busines against the Rebells, shew an affection to the Rebells then certainely most Princes, that have had warrs in Ireland were very guiltie of that affection, that vsed like censures, but what the king sayes heere was spoken in Parliament by diverse members, who disadvised the preposterous severitie, that was propounded, and afterward proceeded in, and it will rest an indelible blemish of a rash, and vnadvised Councell in those men, that in the beginning of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103102:106"/>
would put a whole nation into despaire, and feare of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>That <hi>their wonted oppressions,</hi> as they conceived <hi>should rather have made them against the King, then the Parliament</hi> is easily beleived, for its knowne to all the world they did rise against the king vpon pretence of regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their nationall liberties from the English oppression, as they called it, and since the Libeller seeth soe apparent an Argument of their rising against the king, its blinde madnes to suspect their rising for the king. The Parliament then pretended to act for the king, and that the Rebellion was against him, not themselves, but the man deserts his Arguments, and falls to his old common place, and will suspect the king, because <hi>he vsed the Prelaticall Religion, and to force it vpon others made Episcopall, Ceremoniall, and common prayer booke warrs.</hi> Such men, as made warrs, and raysed Rebellion to take away the order of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps, Ceremonies, and booke of Common prayer established by lawes in the Raignes of best Princes with the advice of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent confessours, and Martyrs of the age, wherein they lived confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Scripture, and purest times of the Church, declare to the whole world, that they have neither shame, truth, nor Religion, and are justly stigmatized for making not only Episcopall, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and common prayer booke warrs, but Antichristian, and Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Rebellion.</p>
               <p>That the Papists knew <hi>these warrs were their warrs</hi> may easily be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, for they must needes apprehend advantage from the Rebellion But its well knowne, that the Papists are more jealous of Episcopacie, Ceremonies, and booke of common prayer, as they stand r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The many invectives of Popish writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him signifie the plaine contrary; besides the lawes made by him against Popish recusants shew, that the Author was in one of his luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique transes, when he dreamt of that <hi>heckticke trembling.</hi>

                  <hi>The retarding, and delayes of releife to Ireland against that Rebellion,</hi> were soe apparently discovered to proceede from the faction in Parliament, that there rests not the least colour to charge it vpon the King. They converted the subjects money, and other preparations for the releife of Ireland to the raysing of the Rebellion in England, and they hindred the going over of a new governour into that kingdome, because they would vse his helpe to their designes at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were diffident to trust the King with an army, and therefore refused his offer to goe in person against the Rebells.</hi> It seemes they had litle compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on that people, that preferred their jealosies before their pittie, &amp; it is a plaine Treason, and encouragement to that Rebellion to pretend distrust of their King, and shewes they sought their owne personall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie before the remedie of that Rebellion, &amp; the safetie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. His Majest: might justly finde fault with those, who threatned all extreamitie to the Rebells, and they, that exclude all mercy to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry single person, where multitudes are involved, and such, as followed Absolom with a simple heart, shew neither humanitie, nor Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when <hi>Fathers Brothers, Wives, and Children were destroyed by such an occasion,</hi> neither is <hi>Magistracie, and warr vnder the gospell</hi> giuded by such passions, but by the rules of Christian pittie, and such as give themselves the licence of vniversall Massacres, will not abstaine from embruing their hands in the blood of their Fathers, Brothers, Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, sparing neither ancient, nor suckling, King, nor Priest, defacing, all Monuments of Christianitie, and turning Religion into the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of their hirelings, and all devotion into squint eyes, and disfigured faces, and erect an Empire in themselves with the slaughter of all, that submitt not to them.</p>

               <p>There is greate difference betweene the instances of the destruction of the sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemites, and the disciples calling, for fire from heaven against the Citie, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed lodging, and this of a nation by just warr, &amp; execution to slay whole fame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

                  <hi>of them, who had slaine whole families before.</hi> But where lies the odds, there was asmuch threatned to the Irish, as was done to the sichemites? Though there were a difference betweene the sins of some, there was noe difference betweene the innocence of many, and there is noe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them, that will destroy promiscuously without mercy, where all are not guiltie in the one case, and the other. But why doth not the Libeller state his case right, and insteede of families sett downe the whole nation, as the truth was? Did he shrinke at the expression of the truth at large, and name families to diminish the guilt?</p>
               <p>That, which <hi>was done against the Benjamites,</hi> was by Gods revealed will in that particular Case, and yet there was a remnant reserved of them, that escaped the present stroake of the warr, and they returned againe to their possessions.</p>
               <p>The Libeller sayes, <hi>he speakes not this, that such measure should be meated to all the Irish, or as remembring, that the Parliament ever soe decreed.</hi> But if they did soe, then this shall serve for their justification, for to what end els is it, that he offers excuses?</p>

                  <hi>To shew, that this homily,</hi> (meaning it seemes the Kings discourse) <hi>hath more of craft, and affectation, then sound doctrine.</hi> But either it is sound doctrine, or else the Libeller must justifie the contrary, to which he sayes that which he speakes is not intended, and that, which he hath brought shewes, that the homily he intends is sound Doctrine, and his intended opposition signifies nothing, but his owne corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King would have some punished,</hi> which he sayes <hi>were of least vse, and must of necessitie have been sacrifised to his reputation.</hi> And can he thinke, that the king caused the Rebellion, and yet would punish any for his reputation, might they not then produce it? and how then could he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifise them to his reputation, which would be more wounded by the punishing of one, then the sparing of all.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, <hi>some were to be pretected vpon their submission from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of those, who would soone drowne them, if they refused to swim downe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular streame with them.</hi> The Libeller sayes <hi>that fury is applyed to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> If such were their condition, its not misapplyed.</p>
               <p>The Libeller sayes, <hi>he remembers not they had soe decreed,</hi> &amp; if not, how could it be applyed to them? And wherefore doth he except to the soundnes of the doctrine, if it concerned them not?</p>
               <p>Those, who would not swim downe the streame <hi>are Papists, Prelates, and their faction.</hi> He meanes not English Prelates, for they have not yet been charged with the Irish Rebellion, and if he meane the Romish Prelates, it were superfluous, having named Papists before, and why doth he say, that he speakes not, that such measure should be meated to all the Irish, when he would have the king esteemed a favourer of the Jrish Rebellion, if he protected any Irish Papists vpon their submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For he sayes, <hi>by this, who sees not, that he, and the Irish Rebells had but

one aime.</hi> And whoever thinkes he sees it by this hath neither sight, nor reason, and there is nothing to be seene in the Libellers inference, but excessive impudence, and falshood.</p>
               <p>The King sayes, <hi>some kinde of zeale is not seldome more greedy to kill the Beare for his skin, then for any harme he hath done.</hi> This the Libeller ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>our zeale,</hi> and would inferre from thence, <hi>that the Parliament is more bloody in the prosecution of their Iustice, then the Rebells in their crueltie.</hi> And by what construction can he make that good? may there not be by ends in a judge, &amp; yet his sentence not soe bloody, as a malefactours Cryme, &amp; he, that charges a Magistrate with a wrong end in giving a Just sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, doth not diminish the Cryme of the malefactour. Can any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall soule conclude vpon the Kings dislike of irregular proceedings against the Irish, that he excused their Cryme? This is chaffe to cast in the eyes of his bleerde Sectaries, for none else are soe purblinde, and there neede noe dispute, that the King perfectly hated the Irish Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, &amp; justly censured the proceeding in that vnseasonable threatning of destruction. The instance of the beares skin was made by a member of the lower house at the time, when they debated that busines, and yet they then thought it noe favour to the Irish, nor censure of their owne proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The cessation, which the King made was in favour of the Irish, and without the advice of Parliament, to whome he had committed the managing of that warr.</hi> The King plainely descerned, that the designe of the faction in Parliament in managing the Irish warrs was only to draw money from the people vnder that pretence to subdue England, and destroy him by taking away al assistance from him, and thence proceedes their Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vpon the cessation; and their willfull neglect, and diversion of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours amidst the reiterated Cryes of the protestants in that Kingdome, the importunitie of the Lords Justices, and the visible growth of the Enemy shewes the advantage they made of that Rebellion, &amp; the King was bound in Justice, and honour to preserve that Kingdome, and in Christian pittie to releive his distressed subjects, which he could not doe without resuminge the managing of that warr, which had been soe Treacherously miscarried by those he trusted, &amp; as he made that cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the advice, &amp; intreatie of his protestant subjects there, soe they were sufficient wittnesses of the low condition themselves were in, and the power of the Rebells.</p>
               <p>But the Libeller would prove, that <hi>the Protestants there were on the winning hand,</hi> because <hi>they kept their owne notwithstanding the misse of those forces, which were landed in wales, and Cheshire, who without difficultie Maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a greate part of these Countreyes.</hi> The Protestants keeping of their owne was by the benifitt of that cessation, without which they hoped not to keepe it, and those Countreyes of wales, and Cheshire were not mastered by those forces, as the Libeller supposes, but protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103102:108"/>
by them against the Tyrany of the Rebellion then ontring vpon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Declaration,</hi> which he vouches for proofe is an infamy to the Authors, conteyning neither colour of proofe, nor soundnes of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of as litle creditt, as his owne assertions. In the meane time those forces of the Protestants, which the king gott by that cessation declare to the world, that the Irish Rebellion crossed his ends, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced those of the English Rebells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The way-laying of provisions</hi> was contradicted by such apparent proofes in his Majest: answeares, that vntill they make some reply to those particulars, their clamours will signifie nothing but want of matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The forces he called over stood him in noe small steede against our maine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> That noe way hinders, but that they might be termed <hi>handfulls</hi> in respect of the numerous Rebells both in Ireland, &amp; England. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the cessation, besides the knowne evidence of truth, and weight have an addition of Authoritie from the Libellers calling them false, and frivolous without the least shew of reason, it being his custome to stile truth, and reason by such Titles.</p>
               <p>He reprehends the king <hi>for likening his punishments to Iobs Tryalls, before he saw them have Iobs endings.</hi> And vpon the same reason he will not allow the Tryalls of the Martirs to have a likenes to Jobs, because the end in respect of Temporall felicitie was not the same.</p>
               <p>The king sayes, he hath not <hi>leisure to make prolix Apologies,</hi> from whence the libeller concludes <hi>those long declarations, and Remonstrances,</hi> which he calls <hi>Pamphletts set out in his name were none of his.</hi> And is not this a tidy inference, because the king in prison expecting the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the cruell designes of the Traytours had noe leisure to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix Apologies, therefore the declarations, and Remonstrances publis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed by him, while he was at libertie were none of his. The king hath given sufficient Testimony to stopp the mouth af a destractour, that noe writings, published in his name were above his abilitie. If his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations were weightie, and just, why are they Pamphletts? if not why, will not the Libeller believe him the Author whome he seeks to vilifie, but the world knowes the declarations in the name of Parliament were none of theirs, but voted vpon the word of a junto by such as had not capacitie, to vnderstand them.</p>
               <p>That <hi>though the Common saying, that it is Kingly to doe well, and heare ill be sometimes true, yet more frequently to doe ill, and heare well by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of flatterers, that deifie the name of Kings.</hi> It can hardly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ever evill king had soe many flatterers, as the best kings have detractours, and himselfe produces instances, how the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude deified Simon Mountford, and such popular brovillions against their kings.</p>

For <hi>the peace in Ireland,</hi> the Justice of it is now apparent, and he, that pardons Rebells to save the effusion of the blood of his good subjects, shewes greater tendernes to the good, then they, that by endeavouring to exclude all from mercy, expose them promiscuously to mutuall slaughter, and may justly be judged to looke vpón both with an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent eye, and that neither Justice, nor pittie, but greedy, and rapacious desires carry them to that crueltie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King prayes at large for the Irish Rebells.</hi> It seemes Charitie for Enemies is held a sin by these miscreants, otherwise he would not have censured a prayer soe becoming a Christian, that God would not give over <hi>the whole stocke of that seduced nation to the wrath of those, whose cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes makes them cruell, nor to their anger, which is too feirce, and therefore justly cursed.</hi> The King deprecates the Rebellion of Ireland, and in his prayer concludes his innocence, and that if he had not studied the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the differences sayes, <hi>let thy hand be vpon me, &amp; my fathers house.</hi> And this the Libeller calls a solemne Curse, which is his judgment of the Cryme, and the assertion of his innocence.

               <p>For the <hi>Kings concessions to the Scotts, either</hi> touching <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> or the <hi>Militia,</hi> wee shall heare his answeare in due time, howsoever the king was not bound to the same Actions, where Circumstances varied, nor after a fuller vnderstanding of the nature, and consequence of the things graunted, and as his Majest: professed a cleerer information af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these Actions had passed him, soe he evidently saw, that they were more against his subjects good, then his owne, and that insteede of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting an Arbitrary power, it would have introduced an arbitrary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and confusion into the Kingdome, and such men, as preferre the bondage of popular confusion, or the licentious insolence of many Lords, are eyther inchanted with a witch craft of Rebellion, or stupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benummed with a senseles Lethargy.</p>
               <p>With what Zeale the Libeller reproves the abuse of Scripture, when he exclaimes, as if it offended his conscience, we may perceive by the allusion he makes saying. <hi>Ireland was as Ephraim, the strength of his head,</hi> meaning the Kings, <hi>Scotland, as Iudah was his law giver, but over England, as over Edom he meant to cast his shooe.</hi> Hath this man reverence to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Author of it?</p>
               <p>He comes againe to accuse the King for persecuting <hi>the consciences of Religious men,</hi> a knowne vntruth, yet soe much beloved by the Libeller, as he seemes impatient to misse the repetition of it, and with this he joynes his reproving the Kings profession <hi>of being an Enemy of those, that forced the conscience</hi> because <hi>he had made a warr, and lost all, rather then not

vphold the Bishopps.</hi> It is an Argument, that he esteemed his conscience, that lost all for it. But the Libeller sayes, they were <hi>persecuting Bishopps.</hi> The King vpholding Bishopps, vpholds not persecution, or abuse, and th e Libellers confounding the office, &amp; ill exercise of it makes knowne his want of Argument. The falshood of their Calumnies against the Bishopps is sufficiently manifested to the world, that after soe many vehement outcryes they have not proved on such act of persecution done by any one of them, &amp; not the presons but the office, &amp; lawe were the persecution in this mans judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King obtruded new Ceremonies vpon vs, vpon the Scotts a new Liturgie</hi> There were noe new Ceremonies obtruded by him in England, and this horrid Rebellion to take away the Ceremonies, and Government legally established, and continually practised, vnder the name of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, detects both the fraude, and outrage of their proceedings. The new leiturgie offred the Scots by advice of their Bishopps, and Clergie, was an act befitting the care of a King, and noe man will beleive, that it was an offence te their consciences, who made noe conscience of blood, and Rebellion vpon pretence of their conscience, which the world sees was an hipocriticall straining at a straw, and swallowing a Camell, and these tender conscience men have written their tendernes of conscience with the blood of their brethren; which will remaine a memoriall of their dissembled sanctitie.</p>
               <p>What <hi>hinderance of the search of truth,</hi> he meanes is not vnderstood, vnles he would have the dreames of mad sectaries confirmed by authoritie.</p>
               <p>He would have the penalties of lawes thought persecution of the conscience, and sectaries the Judges, and sayes, <hi>if himselfe</hi> (meaning the King) <hi>and his learned Churchmen were the obstinate part, should Reformation suffer them to sit Lording like the greate whore?</hi> And are sectaries Libells convictions of Kings, and learned Churchmen, and the clamours of malefactours a sentence against the Judge? Such is the Government, that must now rule the world, and Reformation must be an Idoll in the hands of a seditious sectarie, whereto the people must fall downe, and such vnstable multitudes carried about with every winde of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine are likely to be those many waters, on which the greate whore sits, which hath for corruption, and crueltie a greate resemblance vnto those false prophetts, that now seduce the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These Clergimen were not to bedriven like sheepe, but driven out like wolves.</hi> But they are theeves, and wolves, that enter into the sheepefold by violence, and stealth, and the ambition, and greedines of these wolves will finde occasion to sucke the blood, and devoure the flesh of the sheepe.</p>

                  <hi>The king sayes,</hi> that he beleives the Presbiterie, though proved to be the only institution of Iesus Christ, were not by the sword to be set vp without his conjent, which is contrary <hi>saith the Libeller,</hi> both to the doctrine, and knowne

The reformed Churches professe to follow the ancients in suffering, not associate themselves to bloody Sectaries in Rebelling. And his next words impert that private men may not contend with Magistrates, nor vse force against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though Christ, and his Apostles being to Civill affaires but private men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not with Magistrates, yet when Magistrates themselves, and especially Parliament come to know Religion, they ought to defend it against any King, or Tyrant.</hi> What is defence to the question in hand of setting vp Religion by the sword without the kings consent? May an inferiour Christian Magistrate take Armes against his superior a Pagan to sett vp Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Is he not as much a private man as our Saviour, and his Apostles, where the Civill power hath not given him a right? And as a Civill right is not imaginable, soe the pretence of a power from Religion is execrable, and false which will not permitt an vsurpation vpon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill right. There may be a King, where there is noe Parliament, and it is noe more lawfull for an inferiour Migistrate, or to Parliament, who are but private men in regard of the Prince, whose deputies they are to take the sword to sett vp Religion against the King their soveraigne, then for any private men, and were not the libeller distracted betweene evidence of truth, and his owne corrupt inclinations, he would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the name of Magistrates, and Parliament, that but the line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretended the power of <hi>the people to</hi> doe the same thing by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and practice of all Protestant Churches, and would make them more publique persons, then their Saviour, and his Apostles, he thinkes his reviling language of <hi>Tyrany,</hi> and <hi>bloody Bishopps,</hi> and the <hi>King their pupill</hi> are irrefragable Arguments in the judgment of his pupills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a large difference betweene forcing men by the sword to turne Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterians, and defending them, who willingly are soe.</hi> But then it is impious to force men to be soe, what those wretches did to the King for not being soe, and for not consenting to impose it, vpon the kingdome by a law, the world knowes, and the world is wittnes, and they have robbed men of their possessions by the sword to sett vp this new Religion.</p>
               <p>His charging <hi>Covetuousnes, and ambition to be the events of Episcopacy,</hi> is schismaticall malice, for Episcopacie in the beginning of the Church was attended with povertie, and persecution, but the libeller will make Martirdome their ambition, and wants their Covetuousnes.</p>
               <p>He will have, that <hi>English Episcopacie hath markes of schisme, whether we looke at Apostolicke times, or reformed Churches,</hi> if he had shewed wherein, it had deserved an answeare, but we see what Apostolicke

times he meanes, that will not allow any Church of the world from the time of the Apostles til the present age, &amp; because the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is not vniversall, therefore all Sectaries may pretend themselves the Church.</p>
               <p>For the authoritie of Scripture, he neede not take paines to prove it. The Church of England claimes not power over other Churches, but to correct Schismatickes within her selfe. The exposition of Scripture may not be received from arrogant Sectaries against the judgment of the vniversall Church, &amp; the King might very well reject such reasons, as they, which offered them, had soe lately before disavowed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themselves scandalized with the imputation of such opinions. The greatest number of these pretended Reformers professed detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the opinion of lawfullnes in taking Armes against their Prince, of the opinion of the vnlawfullnes of Episcopacy, booke of Common prayer, and Ceremonies, and who now would dispute with such men maintaining these renounced opinions with such bloody vehemencie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not for the King to defend the Church otherwise then the Church would be defended.</hi> And what is the Church in the libellers sense, nothing but the crew of John of Leydons saints, and must the King follow them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church, these are the Divills factours to sett vp an Idoll Religion.</p>
               <p>These deceivers talke <hi>of the power of the keyes, in whose power holy things are,</hi> as if the keyes, that Christ gave to his Disciples are transmitted to this distempered crew, that pretend a power of their owne giving.</p>
               <p>Their Blasphemous pretence of enthusiasmes hath been the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and scorne of wise men, and thats the spirit which must not be <hi>fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with a negative voyce?</hi> But may it not be fettered by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments negative voyce, and why is it more fettered by the kings then theirs? That which he calls Tyranicall, and presumptuous in the king, with the same breath justifies in the Parliament, and yet complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Tyrany vpon the conscience. Such consciences are senseles of Tyrany, aswell, as of sin having given themselves vp to the Empire of hell.</p>
               <p>The kings negative voyce could impose nothing, yet these desperate hipocrites say, they were <hi>compelled to implore the aide of Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it from their consciences.</hi> And if the ground of their warr were to take away his negative voyce, their pretence of defensive force appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res noe other then violence, and persecution, which they soe hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically complaine of, &amp; such tender consciences, as feele not salshoods, and Rebellion must be mercilesse destroyers of Religion, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as these have proved.</p>

To the mention <hi>of the Bishopps possession heere since the first plantation of Christianitie in this I stand, and vniversall prescription since the Apostles till this last centurie</hi> he sayes, <hi>But what availes the most primitive antiquitie against the plaine sense of Scripture, which if the last Centurie have best follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, it ought in our esteeme to be the first.</hi> But where is the plaine sense of Scripture against antiquitie? Its very plaine, that these Sectaries noe more esteeme the present century, then the ancient, nor more the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then either of them, but take a libertie to vent their owne fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and arrogant fancies for Scripture, and reject all ordinary meanes vpon pretence of a lying spiritt. His Majest: meant not to oppose anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie to Scripture, but where the practice of antiquitie is consonant to Scripture. Its impious to reject the Communion of the first age. All helpes of interpretation are fetters to the proud Schismatickes, and this Libeller, that so lately obtruded the Example of the reformed Churc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes in the case of Episcopacie, quickely scornes the Classicall, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and diocesine Presbiterie, and the last Century hath only seene the ascent of these Locusts, and he only likes that part of the last Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, wherein they crept foorth, and they would willingly have the credit to be a part of other Churches, though they are in truth Enemies to them all. We may with farr better reason beleive the interpretations, and practice of the primitive Church, then any moderne Reformers, and there were never any, but those Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries soe shamelesse to deny the authoritie of antiquitie, or charge it in this particular with an aberration from Scripture, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men living vnder Presbitery acknowledge the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Bishopps above Presbiters in the times of the Apostles.

                  <hi>We may have learnt both from sacred story, and times of reformation, that the Kings of this world have ever hated, and instinctively feared the Church of God.</hi> Its manifest Sectaries hate King, and Church, malefactours will compliane, that Judges hate them for their vertues. We finde in the ancient Church, that Kings were the greate protectours, and reformers of the Church, and its strange that the Libeller, if he had looked backe at all, had not seene David, Solomon, Hezechiah, Josiah, and others. The Kings of Israell politiquely opposed the true Church, for feare the people should returne to the house of David, and if we looke vpon Pagan Kings, we finde Cyrus, and Artaxerxes helping the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the true Church. This Libeller hath discovered a greate Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of Rebellion, that having made such outcryes of Tyrany against his late Maj: heere tells vs the Tyrany was Monarchy, &amp; they would not be subject to the Kings of this world, to such impostors is England now subject, that kill Kings, and make Tyrants, and this blaspheamer stickes not to charge the Church of God, and the Doctrines thereof with opposition to Civill Government, and to commaund the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kings.</p>

And this broode of Sectaries have heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore complained, that their doctrines were traduced as opposite to Monarchy. And neither Libertie, nor equallitie is sought for to the people, but to betray them to the power of these deceivers, who are growne to that impudence to pretend doctrines of confusion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion to be the true Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Church, as ancient prophesies foretold should dissolve all their power, &amp; Dominion.</hi> Few sects professing Christ have appeared more Turkish, then these present of England, they fancie an earthly Kingdome for the Church, as Mahomett his Paradise, and then, that themselves are the true Church, and shall have Dominion over all, and avow their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to destroy all Kings, and whoever submitt not to them.

               <p>His first instance is <hi>in Pharaohs oppressing of the Israelites.</hi> And doth he beleive, that Pharaoh knew their doctrines, or prophesies, the man might have learnt more from the Text, that being strangers they might over power him, and thence grew his persecution, not from the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers imaginary doctrine.

               <p>The King <hi>bestowed livings</hi> according to the law, and the Policie was not his, but the ancient constitution of the Church, and this Monster, that reproaches the retaining any thing in Leiturgie, or Government practised by the ancient Church is not ashamed to charge the king with breach of Canons, and the ancient practice of the Church in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Ecclesiasticall dignities, and the peoples right in Elections was never pretended in England, and justly, and anciently forbidden in the Church, neither doe any Canons in force support that pretence.</p>

                  <hi>That influence, which</hi> the king sayes <hi>is necessarie for the Prince to have vpon Churchmen,</hi> noe man, that beleives the Scripture will thinke vnfitt, but how can the Libeller make good, that the many Emperours, and <hi>Kings,</hi> that imbraced the Christian Religion <hi>hated, and feared it,</hi> for soe they must by his grounds? And how can he conclude from Pagans hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Religion, that it was only from their kings, when as the stories are soe plentifull in setting downe the madd rage of the multitude, the truth is seditious innovatours know, that their hopes, and strength lie to seduce the silly people, and that it is the interest of governours, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their lewde endeavours, and thence proceede their declamations against Rulers, and their proclamations of Libertie, and that, which they cal the Bishopps Tyrany is only their office to take away schisme, and schisme is the way to Rebellion.</p>

He hath found a very strong proofe, as he would have it out of the Historie of the Councell of Trent, that <hi>Bishopps are most potent, when Princes are weakest,</hi> that argues not their dependence vpon Princes, nor that aversion to Bishopps is not aversion to Princes, it was spoken of Bishopps depending on the Pope, not on Princes, and such Clergy men, as have their dependence on Pope, or people wil never wish, that the king should be potent to master their dependencie.</p>

                  <hi>From this the King sett himselfe to the removall of those men, whose doctrine he feared would be the vndoing of Monarchy.</hi> And needed he the Councells of Bishopps to provide for his safetie against such men? And is that the evill interest of Tyrany, and Episcopacie to prevent the designes of Traytours? Who were Traytours, if they were not, that would vndoe Monarchy? The doctrine, and designes of the schismatickes are heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by apparent to be against Monarchy, and yet the prevention of such conspiracies is the Tyrany, and the corrupt Councells of Bishopps, which the hipocrites cry out on.</p>

                  <hi>Noe temporall law could touch the innocencie of their lives.</hi> And had they innocency, that plotted the vndoing of Monarchy vnder which they lived, and could not the law touch it? Their disobedience to lawes was a Cryme inconsistent with innocence, and must necessarily be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the lawes they disobey, and that, which he calls <hi>persecution of their consciences, and laying scandalls before them</hi> was only the requiring of their obedience to Acts of Parliament, whose authoritie he soe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cryes vp, and the inflicting of just <hi>penalties</hi> on their <hi>bodies, and Estates</hi> according to the lawes was the dutie of the Magistrate, to whome the execution of them belonged, although the indulgence they found from his Majest: in mitigating the penalties of law was a greate cause of their insolence, and that Calamitie they have brought vpon the kingdome, and if the lives of these men be sought into, their pride, impudence, calumnie, lying, perjurie, covetuousnes, and crueltie declare their lives farr from innocent.</p>
               <p>The man now breakes out into a thankesgiving for the successes of their Rebellion, and though these hipocrites despise the thought of a Church, and have noe Communion with any Church, ancient, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, yet the resistance of them is <hi>warr against the Church.</hi>

practice of the Church, and the quantitie, or quallitie of Townes, or Territories, wherein Bishopps were placed, noe way proves the lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their order, neither can it be collected, because Bishopps were in small villages, that therefore they were noe other then Presbiters, but heerein the Libeller shewes his malicious opposition to truth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing Sozomen, who having said, that Churches had several customes, &amp; instances, that though there were many Citties in Scithia, there was one Bishopp only over all, and in other Countreyes Bishopps were in villages, not every village, &amp; he might aswell conclude noe Presbiters in Scithia, as none, but Presbiters in Arabia, and Cyprus.</p>

                  <hi>The same Author tells the like of other nations, and that Episcopall Churches did not condemne them.</hi> Wherefore should they condemne them? Its like they would, if they had taken vpon them to exercise the calling of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps being but Presbiters, for that was long before condemned by the Canons.</p>
               <p>He makes a large leape from sozomen to fower hundred yeares agoe, and then he sayes <hi>many westerne Churches in France, Piedmont, and Bohemia admitted not of Episcopacy among them,</hi> and yet the doctrine, and practice of these Churches published by themselves is, that they had Bishopps, &amp; continue them stil, &amp; this the libeller might see in their own bookes.</p>

as truth the reformed Churches are not vilified one by another, though each maintaine their severall formes of Government, and his Majest: is farr from vilifying those Churches, but the Libeller vilifies himselfe, and them that scoffs it their Archpresbitery classicall, and Diocesine Presbitery, and their Priest-led herodians, blinde guides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None but Lutherans retained Bishopps,</hi> and therein convinces himselfe of his often repeated vntruths, that all the reformed Churches rejected Episcopacy for the Novations, Montanists having noe other Bishopps, then such, as were in every village is another of his falsities in adding the word every, and it doth not prove, that these heretickes had not Bishopps, and Presbiters, which Christians may have, though they live in Caves, and deserts, and its evident in story those heretickes had Bishopps. That the Aerians were condemned for heretickes the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beler well knowes, and the King naming them soe meddles not with their particular heresies, and it is too obscure to be seene, that the King fastens that opinion touching Bishopps, and Presbiters for their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie. Though the Clergie ought to minister the gospell, if the people supply them not, yet such temutie, and contempt quickely becomes a Carkase indeede. The Sectaries, that place their greatenes in being the ringleaders of faction turne all Religion into a fantasme, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing they could never by any judicious choise obtaine preferment in the Church professe the dislike of them, and seeke their fortunes in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the multitude.</p>
               <p>Its easily beleived, that <hi>wealth may breede vices</hi> in the Clergie, aswell, as others, but must they therefore be made poore, and others rich by the robbery of them? the Kings choise of Bishopps will convince the clamours of the Schismatickes, and gives just cause to expect the evill consequences the King foretells of their removall. That the function of Bishopps, and Presbiters was not tyed to place, though the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it was by Ecclesiasticall constitution, he hath been already told, and that it was necessary the Apostolique power for the Government of the Church must descend to Bishopps, there being noe others, that ever pretended to it.</p>
               <p>How <hi>the Church florisht vnder Episcopacie,</hi> the extent of the Christian Religion over soe greate a part of the world doth sufficiently testifie, &amp; the <hi>corruption</hi> of many in that <hi>order</hi> doth not take away the benifitt of it, which acrewed vnto the Church by the labours of others, and all ages have recorded persons of greate learning, and holines of life in that order.</p>

The libeller, if he would have vsed Arguments should have expressed wherein his pretences differ from other Rebells, for all pretend Tyrany in their Rulers, &amp; fighting for libertie, but he will have fighting lawful to make a new Republique, and to take the sword to destroy the old, &amp; insteede of making the King guiltie of the breach of lawes, justifies the Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because lawes were executed. Whatever he objects for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Rebellion against a King is as possible to any other Government, for are al Republiques of one Religion, &amp; may the subjects of different Religion from what is established in any state Rebel, &amp; say it is vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that rulers must be obeyed, when they wil not conforme to the opinions of a sect, &amp; so severall opinions must decide their Religion by the sword.

But there neede noe proofe of their transgressing old establishments, when they confesse it.

               <p>The Libeller, that scoffes at the seeking of heaven in <hi>forma pauperis</hi> shewes his value of heaven, and seekes none but that, which is to be found in forma proditoris.

The king neede not a discovery to the <hi>state of their consciences,</hi> more then by their Actions, that fought against him, and he might justly beleive <hi>they had never the better of him in their owne consciences, where they were more affraid to encounter those many reasons from law, alleagiance, and Christian grounds, then in a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bravery to fight.</hi> And is it to <hi>presume more then a Pope to say this?</hi> But he that will not sticke at open falsification will not sticke to slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoughts, and offer conjectures for convertions, such as were most zealous in his Majest: cause had a sobrietie vnblemishable by a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours malice, and were not only free from <hi>druken</hi> distemper, but bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish insolence, and brazen impudence, which the Rebells rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then repent of. And is there not a just cause, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of many <hi>should grow suspitious, and corrected</hi> by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the misnamed Parliament, now proved false, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended?

Those men will accuse the King for being a Christian, and have as litle love to prayer, as obedience, a monke will better governe, then such a man pray, who is constant to malice, &amp; falshood, and this man that sayes to governe by Parliament justisies his Rebellion to take away Kinglie Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His legislative Parliament, and oppressed lawes</hi> cannot be admitted, where other answeare is wanting, but the Libeller hath long since thrust the force of them out of doores by his many prevarications, confining them all in the Cabinet of his owne braine, which must determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good, and necessary.</p>
               <p>He is constant to Iohn of Leidens principles, that must take away other mens goods for doubt of ill vsing them, and because the King sayes, he <hi>feared the temptation of an absolute Conquest,</hi> therefore it was <hi>pious, and friendly in the Parliament to resist him.</hi> Their pietie, and friendshipp were much alike, and the Libellers Riligion might come in for a share. Its very probable, that this warr had never been, if the Act for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Parliament had not been consented to by the King, and that Act might stopp the mouth of any reasonable man, from saying there was such a power in the two houses, as the Libeller dreames of, that desired that Act from the King, and it was never heard in our sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ever <hi>Parliaments</hi> made warr against <hi>Kings, as Tyrants,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for how could they make awarr, that neither could, nor ever did prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to sit longer, then their King pleased, &amp; the immodestie, &amp; ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the present Rebells have farr exceeded the worst Examples.</p>
               <p>He is obstinate to his principles, and feares to attribute anything to the Kings concessions, or denyall, and had <hi>he graunted lesse</hi> in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie himselfe, and the Kingdome had suffred lesse.</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted, but the Libeller will invert whatever the King sayes, and it is a greate adventure, that he sayes <hi>the sins of their lives not seldome fought against them,</hi> and wee have greate cause to beleive their prosperitie did noe lesse, that continue hardned in soe execrable a cause.</p>
               <p>The King sayes he desires not <hi>any man should be further subject to him, then all of vs should be subject to God.</hi> And this Mountebanke holds this <hi>a

sacriledge worse, then Bishopps lands,</hi> for he sayes he desires <hi>asmuch subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is due to God, and so desires noe lesse then to be a god.</hi> And is subjection to Princes in the, Lord subjection to them as God? And doth the King desire otherwise, that would have them noe otherwise obey him, then that they might obey God, renouncing all obedience, that consists not with obeying God, but sale worke must be slight, and the Libeller would not exceede his hire.</p>
               <p>The Rebells desiring the Kings <hi>acquittall of them for the blood of the warr</hi> confirmes their guilt, not their innocence. Though God impute not to any man the blood shedd in a just cause in respect of the ground, and reason of doing it, yet there may be temptations vnto naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie in acting a just cause, and the King was not without a sense of such danger, therefore the Libeller wretchedly beggs an argument of his guilt from his prayer <hi>not to have blood imputed to him.</hi>

               <p>The first reformers <hi>in the time of Pope Adrian</hi> pretended not a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vniversall Church, and a rejection of whatever was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the primitive, as those men now, neither did they presume to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103102:126"/>
enforce others to their perswasion, and though <hi>noveltie, and perturbation</hi> were objected to them, yet they still deprecated that guilt, and it is a most vnchristian, and prophane disposition to desregard lawes establis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, and Religion setled vpon presumption of private opinions, and these of men neither learned, discreete, nor honest. There is greate difference betweene a clamour, and an vndeniable truth, and we may not thinke, that <hi>popular compliance, dissolution of all order, and Government in the Church, schisme, vndecencies, confusions, sacrilegious invasions, contempt of the Clergy, and their Leiturgie, and diminution of Princes</hi> are lesse odious, because Papists objected them, or that any pretended reformation introduced by these detestable practices can be acted, or approved by Christians, All men are wittnes, that the present Sectaries are guiltie of all these, The former reformers did not give occasion for such asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that desired only the libertie of their owne consciences from the practice, and beleife of errours newly enjoyned, and anciently rejected in the Church, or els followed the orderly reformations which Princes, and states authorised in their owne Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but these new reformers obtrude their dictates vpon all the world, and will dispose of all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with the Divill, as in their donation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let it be produced, what good hath been done by synods since the reformation.</hi> Its like not the good he meanes to authorise all manner of Lewde sects, and Lunaticke opinions. But synods are customary, and have their set times in all the reformed Churches, and if there be <hi>fraude, and packing in synods,</hi> as he sayes, whence come Parliaments, that are of like constitution to be free? Is there a priviledge of Parliament to change nature, and that the members cannot be guiltie of fraude, faction, and Treason? There is not only fraude, and packing by insinuations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, and corruptions of the vulgar, but violence, and confusion to Church, and state by tumultuary reformations, and what is this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of rejecting synods, but the justifying of all licentious violence, and Lewde Rebellion to introduce mens private opinions.</p>
               <p>The pulling downe of Church windowes, and Crosses, which were but Civill not Religious markes, defacing the Monuments, and inscriptions of the dead, <hi>mentioned by the King are the effects of a popular, and</hi> deceitefull refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <hi>in the account of all true</hi> protestants.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Protestants were accused by Papists,</hi> as these are charged by the King will not parallell guilt, nor hide the present Actions of these Traytours from view, and detestation.</p>
               <p>The Libeller doth very preposterously produce the Example of <hi>Iob, whose sinceritie was accused to God,</hi> as a protection for the hipocrisie of Sectaries, while himselfe acts the part of him, that accused Job to God, and omits not the traducing of all proofes of pietie, Religion, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the late King.</p>

They, that have no publique place, nor authoritie to reforme the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excused of presumption, if they (meddle with it, and such bu-sy bodies are moved with Carnall selfe seeking, and private ambition, not sense of dutie.</p>
               <p>If any thing <hi>grew worse, and worse in the Church of England,</hi> it was the encrease of Sectaries, who would cover their hipocrisie with censure of superiours, and lawes. These Reformers pretend to reforme lawes, not corruptions, for though they talke of the time of the Kings Raigne, they pretend to reforme nothing, that was particularly worse in his time, then before, and he might as well have asked, why Queene, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth in her fortie yeares raigne had not reformed, as peevishly talke, that his Majest: should not reforme in <hi>twentie yeares,</hi> when it was held strange, that the Schismatickes should be soe distempered to pretend a necessity of reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there being greater neede of strengthning what was established.

Though <hi>Christians might reforme themselves,</hi> they allwayes judged it an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to impose their Religion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the state they lived in. Private refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations are of Christian right, but publique are the prerogative of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power, and though <hi>Princes ought to serve God in the first place,</hi> the people are not to destroy Princes in the first place, they may worshipp God, though they be persecuted, they cannot truly, if they take the sword to subdue them, that are in authoritie, and they feare not God, that feare not their King, our feare of God bindes vs to vse noe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against our King, nor vpon others, our Allegiance to our King being a part of our dutie to God, and as the Apostle convinces those, that hate their brother, not to love God, soe in vaine doe they pretend to feare God, that offer violence to their King. Can a Christian breake all the lawes of the second table vpon pretence of keeping the first? And did not he, that Commaunded to have noe other Gods, but him, commaund the honour of Father, &amp; Mother? May a private Christian robb, and kill, because persons are not of his Religion. The scripture sajes, he that is guiltie of the breach of one commaundement, is guiltie of all, and though Christians may not obey Commaunds
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103102:127"/>
contrary to the commaund of God, they may not vse violence, &amp; force, but these are the Pharisees, that teach men by making a vow vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Gods service to disobey Parents, which our Saviour soe much condemnes. Christs Kingdome is spiritual in the hearts of the faithful, not in <hi>a papall consistory, nor a congregationall pullpitt,</hi> they were best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that obeyed not wicked commaunds, but detested by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that vsed violence against their Pagan Governours, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches may see what Communion can be had with those, that professe those best Christians, that were least subject to their King.</p>

By our happines he intends doubtles his Rebell partie, whose happines is to raigne, and Tyranize over the people, and that cannot continue with reinstalling the King. But the people of England expect not any end of their miserie, but by restoring the just rights of their lawfull King, and they now descerne, that the successe of a wicked cause was a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vpon the nation, whose vnthankefullnes, for their long prosperitie had justly provoked his wrath.</p>
               <p>He goes on to his proofes, that <hi>the king beares wittnes in his owne words, that the corrupt education of his youth was not vntruly charged vpon him, or his Sonne,</hi> and that he gathers from these words of the Kings, <hi>Court delights are prone either to roote vp all true vertue, and honour, or to be contented only with some leaves, and withering formalities of them without any reall fruites tending to the publique good.</hi> And is it a proofe, that because Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are prone to produce such fruites therefore all, that live in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts must necessarily have a corrupt education, &amp; might not this Libeller have cleerely observed, that his Majest: was free from such a corrupt education, that had soe cleere a sight of the ill consequences of Court delights. Though there be these pleasures at the Court, it is not the education of Princes, whose youth is seasoned by instruction against the corruption of these baites. There are dangers to mens manners from abundance, and high places, and thence the Libeller would inferr, that there must neither be wealth, nor power, but in the hands of his Pharisaicall Sectaries, who never complaine of such corruption. The desperate hipocrisie of these traytours is laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their owne words, and Actions, and the Libeller from the Kings caution to his Sonne by the example of Rehoboam frames an expression, as if the King affirmed

The best Governments are subject to repinings, and the greate prosperietie of Solomons Raigne, when silver for the plentie was not esteemed, drew after it popular Complaints of heavy burdens, and whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam threatned, Jeroboam really performed, the madnes of the people finding allwayes their murmurings repayed with greater suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.

               <p>Noe tolleration can please schismatickes, that is bounded with any lawes, and vnles they have a libertie to treade downe all law, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they account it not freedome, and such tolleration, which other Churches account themselves happy in, these Sectaries account despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, that will have it not beneath the honour of a Parliament, and free nation to receive a Schismaticall pretended Religion, devised by a junto of Mechannickes.</p>
               <p>His <hi>suspitions of palliation</hi> are of the same stuffe with his positions, and we may well thinke vpon his owne grounds, that the Kings advice to his Son <hi>to be tender of the people,</hi> was sincere, <hi>whose destruction would be his vndoing.</hi> Which might justly move a Prince to that tendernes. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull Rebells are noe lesse infamous, then greate, and these, who place the hopes of immortall prayse in the excesse of villanies, only erect the Monuments of their impieties the higher, that they may be seene by posteritie, though they avoyded for the present the heigth of Hamans Gallowes, and we may not thinke such men looke to be remembred in mercy with God, who shewed none to men. They thinke with Cain their sin greater, then can be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Although the King Exhort his Son <hi>not to study revenge,</hi> yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that <hi>he, or at least they about him intend not to follow that exhortation,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> he sayes <hi>was seene lately at the Hague.</hi> Its like he intends, the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Dorislans their Rebell Agent. Is that an Argument of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying revenge after Reconciliation, that a profest villaine was slaine in the heate of indignation, comming in Triumph with the blood of the Murthred King, as his Trophey? The Libeller would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade the multitude, that it concernes them asmuch, as those impious projectours of Rebellion to feare such revenge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not repent, but like himselfe maintaine Treason to be the better cause, and to returne to loyaltie were <hi>ficklenes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabilitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He cannot endure the Government by Bishopps, for he sayes, <hi>it is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103102:137"/>
away to subdue the consciences of vulgar men to slavish doctrine.</hi> The doctrine he meanes is order, and obedience, and he would have a compendious way to schisme, and Rebellion, and thats the grudge, which Traytours have at this Government, and their profest quarrell.</p>
               <p>He will not admit, that <hi>Parliaments can have freedome, if the King may deny any thing, which a Major part propounds,</hi> as if they had noe freedome, vnles the prevailing partie were absolute Lords, and yet their freedome is preserved, though the Army picke out a few to be the Parliament, and send packing the rest, and this is the foundation of the English freedome, as he would have it, and that this Conventicle must have the name of Parliament, and not of a faction. The conclusion, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller would have is, that the Parliament should consist of a few Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous designers, to whose voyce the rest must be only an <hi>Eecho,</hi> and the sound of a Parliament must be noe other, then a bagpipe, yeilding only such noates, as the breath, and stopps of the prime Masters allow it. We have seene those <hi>tapistry Parliaments,</hi> which he mentions, which stay, and remove at the pleasure of those Masters of the houshold; And should not the King have a power to stopp the extravagant motions of these impetuous Commaunders, which blasted all such, whose wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and gravitie offred wholesome Counsells for publique safetie, and ordered their <hi>mutes,</hi> and <hi>noughts</hi> to signifie their pleasure The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would be sure of miserie, as often, as they see a Parliament, and the people see they must seeke their preservation in vnitie, which is Resident in the head, not in those broken fractions the subject of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and such, as seeke <hi>vents, and ouletts</hi> from the supreame Government are the whirle windes of misery, and confusion, but Traytours would have lawes as easily broken, as the spiders webb. And this Parliament, to which the King must be subject, himselfe will allow noe more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then to sit in the <hi>noose</hi> of their Military generall, which when he pleases to <hi>draw to geather with one twitch,</hi> not only with his negative, but positive Commaud, shall <hi>throttle the whole nation to the wish of Caligula in one necke,</hi> and this the Kings negative was farr from, and if the Libeller stitch togeather all the quibbles of pasquills, &amp; satirs, they will agree vnto his Rebell Masters, but lose their propertie by his application to lawfull Government. Where they have placed the <hi>Militia</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome now feele, who vnderstood not the word, when they were at first hoodminckt by it to seeke they knew not what.</p>
               <p>The <hi>deliverance,</hi> which these men boast of is the deprivation of just Government, and the substitution of lawles will, and the people see, that they are soe farr from a <hi>deliverance,</hi> that they are delivered over to a languishing miserie vnder the sharpest servitude, and they now finde their Idolizing a Parliament hath drawne them from their loyaltie to him, whome God had set over them, and cast them vnder the hard bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of these Masters, and like them, which rejected the sonns of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103102:137"/>
and tooke the sonne of his servant to raigne over them, they feele a fire of division kindled among them to devoure one another.</p>
               <p>This Libeller allowes not any thoughts of revenge in his Majest: now living for the murder of his father, and yet reproacheth him for making <hi>peace with the Irish,</hi> and not seeking their totall extirpation, and the peace with them he calls <hi>a sordid, dishonourable, and irreligious seeking of his Crowne.</hi> But the man is vnwilling he should have any wayes at al, and would perswade his Sectaries, for none els will beleive him, that the King may not make peace with a Rebell submitting to oppose a Rebell persevering.</p>
               <p>That <hi>the Presbiter Scott, which woes the King now living is put of</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from his termes, not from his qualitie. Should not the people of England seeke the restitution of their King, and legall Government, whereof they have been cheated with the adulterate ostentations of libertie, and redresse of greivances, they would appeare arrant beasts, that cryed out, and below'd by the instinct of their drivers, fighting <hi>like brutes,</hi> till they ran into the <hi>pinfold,</hi> where they are reserved for servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and slaughter by those Masters, who allured them with foode to put the yoake on their neckes.</p>
               <p>The Libeller dislikes the kings conclusion, that <hi>Religion to God, and loyaltie to the King cannot be parted without the sinne, &amp; infelicitie of a people</hi> And sayes <hi>its contrary to the teaching of Christ, that noe man can serve two Masters.</hi> These are fit Judges of our dutie to God, or man, and fit refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Church, and state, that will have the service of a Master, or obedience to a father the serving of another Master, then God, and the spirit of God speaking by St. Peter, feare God, and honour the King must contradict the teaching of Christ, such Church makers doe we now live with. Such, as served heathen Masters, may not leave their service, though they serve not their heathen Gods at their Commaund, and if they did desert their earthly Masters for that reason, they did not serve their Master in heaven, who will be served by their subjection to their earthly Masters, but he, that will serve himselfe cannot serve God, and that selfe service is the whole worke of these Rebells, who pretend to put God in the first place, that they may leave him noe place, and such, as desert their King vpon pretence of Gods service, desert God to serve themselves, and they will only enjoy their power, and wealth, and ease for Gods sake, but suffer for him they will not, that kinde of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth of Religion, they account among the corruptions of the first ages of the Church, and they have found a more accurate, and pleasant way to serve God.</p>

He is courting of apocripha, and makes a Prologue out of Esdras, and Josephus, <hi>Authors</hi> in his judgment, <hi>not lesse beleived, then any vnder sacred,</hi> &amp; brings forth the story of the three wise questions, and zorobabells determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for women, and truth. Quorsum haec? <hi>Though he be not asked, nor in a nation, that gives such rewards to wisedome.</hi> (his Masters have not that bountie to restore the King, that he may <hi>sitt next him,</hi> their gratitude being of the same Stampe with their loyaltie) he <hi>shall pronounce his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence somewhat different, that eyther truth, and Iustice are all one, or els that Iustice by his office is to put forth more strength in the affaires of mankinde.</hi> To what purpose doth he soe solemnely produce this peice of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripha, and pronounce his sentence different? Iustice is a vertue of the minde, and putts forth noe more strength in the affaires of mankinde then truth, but he talkes of justice, and truth, as if they were members of the house of Commons. The sensuall appetite of some is too strong for their vnderstanding, and thence proceeded the conclusions for the strength of wine, and women. In others the vnderstanding and reason are stronger, and there truth is strongest, but we may be assured, that in this Libeller, and his Masters, ambition, crueltie, and falshood are strongest, and thence their Actions are an oppression, and defiance of truth, and Iustice, and they are growne soe absurd, as from the Titles of strength given to vertues, and passions, this triflinge Libeller would haue them non resident, and to act without a subject. If Zorobabell had made truth a fantastical person, as this man strives to have justice vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, he had surely lost his reward, as well, as the opinion of his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. This man would have Iustice vnderstood, as shee is painted in a peice of Tapistry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustice had a sword putt into her hand to vse against all violence, &amp; oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the earth.</hi> By whome was this sword putt into her hand? Doe

theis Traytours beleive, that their magnifying of Iustice makes any man looke on their Barbarous Actions with lesse detestation, or that justice is any part of their end, or Actions? Justice teaches Rulers how to vse the sword put into their hands, but is armelesse against any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and oppression without the power of the Ruler. If the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate doe injustice, there is noe justice committed to others against him. The wise man by the spirit of God tells vs, that he beheld wrong, and injustice, and the cryes of the oppressed, and there was noe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and where then was the Libellers justice? was not violence there stronger then justice? Though divine justice cannot be avoyded, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane justice often fayles, and cannot reach the offender.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shee is most truly, who accepts no person, and exempts none from the severitie of her stroake.</hi> Though by the Rules of justice, there is no accepting nor exempting of persons, yet the Magistrate, to whome alone the Rule belongs is confined to persons, and places, justice forbidding all vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and striking is oppression, where lawfull power gives not the sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shee never suffers injury to prevayle, but when falshood first prevailes over truth, and that is a kinde of justice done on them, who are soe deluded.</hi> And is not falshood an injury? why should justice suffer falshood to prevayle more then other injuries, and why should deluded, and deceived per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be deprived of Justice. And is it Justice to suffer deceived persons to be injured? This man sees the horrid Injustices acted by his Masters, and that must be a kinde of justice, because (in his sense) vpon decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though wicked Kings, and Tyrants counterfeite the sword, yet shee commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates not her power to any, but such, as are just, or at least will doe Iustice.</hi> Doth justice communicate her power to every just man, or that will doe justice, and are they not Tyrants, that take the sword, which is not given them by the Libellers owne judgment. He would needes make justice a Goddesse, and Poeticall fancies, realities, and Bellona must leade an Army without a Generall. Kings have their power from God, and God gives the sword ye even to wicked Kings; and because the power is given them for justice, it is called the sword of justice, though they vse it oft-times to Injustice, and though there are soe many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wicked Rulers, who yet had their power from God, yet this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Blaspheamour sayes. <hi>It were extreame partialitie, &amp; Injustice, the flat denyal, &amp; overthrow of her selfe to put her owne Authenticke sword into the hand of an vnjust, and wicked man, or soe farr to accept, and exalt one mortall person above his equalls, that he alone shall have the punishment of all other men trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressinge, &amp; not receive like punishment from men, when he himselfe shalbe found the highest Transgressour.</hi> He beleives not the Scripture tellinge vs Gods advancement of diverse Kings above their equalls, &amp; to that condition of impunitie; And must it not necessarily follow from his principles,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103102:139"/>
that God is vnjust, and partiall in soe doinge? And if all men be not punisht equally in this life for the same offences? Can there be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Blaspheamy? Were it not the height of Injustice, if the governed should judge, and punish the Governour? Were it possible for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to subsist in such a state, or can there be a possibilitie of any right, or Justice in such confusion? The Scripture forbids vs to judge another mans servant, but this man will have the father punisht by the childe, the Master by the servant, the Prince by the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustice is, and ought to be strongest.</hi> The strength of publique Justice is the Magistrate. Though Justice ought to be strong in our affections, and Actions, yet all men are not obliged, nor permitted to doe all Acts of Justice. The execution of Civill Justice is the Magistrates office, it is the strength of Injustice to vsurpe the calling of others. From this Lunaticke discourse of the strength of Justice, he concludes. <hi>That if by sentence thus written, it were my happines to set free the mindes of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from longing to returne poorelyvnder that Captivitie of Kings, from which the strength, and supreame sword of Iustice hath delivered them, I shall have done a worke, not much inferiour to that of Zorobabell.</hi> The sentence of this braine sicke Libeller is very weake to worke on any opinion, but the hath set free some Englishmen from the Captivitie of a received errour, for they were made beleive they fought for their King, and this man tells them it was to shake of Kings, and surely his vainities, and deceites, and his Masters Tyrany will perswade the Englishmen to seeke their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnder the free, and glorious Government of Kings from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of theis Tyrants, &amp; vsurpers, that have enslaved them; And that horrid murder of the King vnder the shamelesse pretence of justice, must necessarily worke detestation of the fact, and a longing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Dominion of such Monsters. Noe doubt this Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler would thinke it an happines to be secure in his stolen power, but he must expresse more reason, and lesse impietie to effect such a worke, &amp; he may be assured, that as long, as there are men soe ingenuous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Justice, that they must detest his cause, and him. And though Kings be <hi>vnaccountable</hi> to men for their Actions, it is noe way <hi>contrary to the wisedome of Zorobabell,</hi> who names not Justice, and if he had given that strength to Justice, which he did to truth, it had been in the same sense, vnderstanding the force of Justice, as of other vertues. The strength of the King is over the persons, that of truth, and Justice over the minde. But if the King be accountable to men, are not they, to whome he is accountable by the libellers Argument not only stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the King, but stronger then Justice? And soe Justice is not strongest, vnles the sword be putt into a madd mans hand, and the gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy multitude, from whome nothinge, but Injustice can be expected may punish their Rulers. To what end were Governments ordained, if justice be only in the Governed? Were ever like Tyranies, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justices
<pb facs="tcp:103102:139"/>
committed by single Rulers, as by the vnbridled multitude, and yet justice must have noe strength in the mouth of a King, and the word of Rebells only must be the strength of justice, and this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, that bindes justice to Rebell power, and excludes it from Kings, hopes to be a Zorobabell to the Englishmen for his wise sentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That noe law of God, or man gives the subjects any power of Iudicature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or against the King,</hi> he will prove most vntrue, and by that <hi>most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and vniversall law, he that sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shedd, and heere</hi> he sayes <hi>is noe exception of a King.</hi> Though it be plaine, that he, to whome the power of shedding the blod of the offender, is committed, must necessarily be excepted, vnles they will suppose he must kill himselfe, doth the Libeller imagine, that by this law, all men were judges, or that the subject may judge the soveraigne, who is not permitted by any law to judge an Equall? As the divine law appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted punishments, soe likewise Rulers, and if people may judge their Rulers, it anulls all the Commaunds of obedience to superiours, all subordination in humane societie, and all decision of Controversie, while every one may pretend his owne opinion the Rule of justice.</p>
               <p>Next he hath found the place in numbers. <hi>Ye shall take noe satisfaction for the life of a Murderer.</hi> But judges, to whome the law was given, were appointed to declare, who was guiltie of Murder, and we may easily see, who had beene the Murderers, if every man were to judge a superiour, or the multitude their Rulers, and this the Libeller might have found in the same booke where the people charge Moses, and Aron with killing the people of the Lord, and Moses sayes, they were ready to stone him. And the Libeller may with his Anabaptisticall brethren vpon better grounds abolish Magistracie, then make every man a Magistrate, as by this reason he would. Though the law appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted noe satisfaction for the life of a murderer, yet we finde David par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the murder of his son Absolom, and Civill punishments are not of immutable law, and it had been murder to take away his life, whome the king had pardoned, and we finde, that though Jacob curst the rage of his two sons, yet he put them not to death for the murder of the Sichemites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A law must be founded in vnrighteousnes, if the people doe not punish their Rulers, as the Rulers them.</hi> And such a law is contrary to those Rules of righteousnes God hath prescribed, and is the destruction of mankinde, not any law at tall, and this man feares not to charge God with vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, that forbidds evill speakinge of their Rulers though wicked, and vnjust, and scoffes at his ordinance calling <hi>anointinge a Charme.</hi> Can any man of Common reason imagine, that a people wilbe obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, whome they have power to punish, or that subjection can consist with such a condition?</p>
               <p>The anointinge of Abiathar to be a Priest did not exempt him from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103102:140"/>
                  <hi>of the King.</hi> And can any reasonable man thinke, that any, but the King could have vsed that power vpon Abiathar, or that because the King, who was anointed to that office over the Priest, was subject to the like from his people, or any private man, as this Atheist will have it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David, as a private man, and in his owne cause feared to lift vp his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lords anointed, but this Cannot forbidd the law, nor disarme Iustice from havinge legall power against any King.</hi> This sheweth, that divine law forbadd all men to take the Armes of justice without, or against the King, who is referred to Gods justice, and justice hath noe Armes, but his power. What David feared, he judged all others had cause to feare, <hi>who can touch the Lords anointed, and be innocent?</hi> If David were a private man, being anointed King, who was a publique man? But what David feared, these wretches despise, and Count this forbearance of David a ceremony, which he might have forborne. If David feared in his owne cause to lift vp his hand against the Lords anointed, the Libeller is his owne judge, and must be his tormenter, that makes an impious defence of those, that lifted vp their hand against the Lords anointed in their owne cause, and were by his owne confession but private men, and he would have their exorbitance, and disobedience to law vnblameable. Was David a more private man, then they? All supreame Counsells in other formes of Government, that have not a Monarch, claime this priviledge of exemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their subjects Judicature, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t those grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Rebells hold nothinge sacred, the place of Gods vicegerent they wil have to be an <hi>enormous priviledge,</hi> and blow away Religion, &amp; justice like Chaffe with the blast of their fancie, though they pretend the strength of it above that of Kings.</p>
               <p>He hath done with Scripture, he descends now to saint Ambrose excommunicatinge Theodosius, &amp; he will allow the Bishopp to be a saint for this fact, though his calling were Prelaticall, and vnlawfull in his judgment. But what is spirituall excommunication to the puttinge of a King to death? This fact of saint Ambrose is noe Rule. Though Christian Bishopps refused to give the holy misteries to Princes in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of sins, they did not presume to make a Civill seperation betweene them, and their people, and will the Libeller allow the Bishopps to be more publique persons, then Christ, and his Apostles, and to doe what they would not? He, that makes such outcryes against Popery heere takes vp the most scandalous doctrine, that any of them maintaine, and which the most sober disclaime, and takes vp those Arguments, which the Jesuites vse for the Clergies, and Popes power over Princes, &amp; yet the man would be accounted a zealous Protestant. The examples of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication by the brittish Bishopps, saint Germaine Oudeceus, &amp; the clergy of Morcant might be al true, but nothing to the purpose, nor are their excommunications Rules for Christian practice, neither can there be any inference of deposing, or murderinge Kings from such Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:103102:140"/>
But sor the <hi>greater Credit</hi> he sayes <hi>the facts of theis Brittish Bishopps were before we had Communion with the Church of Rome.</hi> And may not he looke on himselfe, and his crew with horrour for vilysying, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the calling of Bishopps, as Papell, and Antichristian, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it to be before we had any Communion with the Church of Rome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What power of deposinge Kings, and consequently of putting them to death was assumed, and practised by the Canon law, he sayes, he omitts, as a thing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally knowne.</hi> Why would he not tell, by whome it was practised, would that discredit the Authoritie? What power the Popes practised in deposinge Kings is generally knowne, and detested by all good men being Actions contrary to all lawes, but of their owne making. But did the people of England expect, that all the promises of Reformation made by the late Parliament would end only in approvinge the Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and vsurpation of the Pope over Kings, and justifying of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plot, and are all the complaints of the Protestant Divines against the practice of the Popes become impertinent Clamours? But such a defence is suteable to the cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whole Councells have decreed, that a Counsell is above the Pope, though by them not denyed the vicar of Christ, and wee may be ashamed in our cleerer light not to descerne further, that a Parliament is above a King.</hi> It were a shame to vs, if we should not descerne the difference betweene the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent power of Kings, and the vsurped power of the Pope, and this brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker wants shame, that pretends cleerer light, and opposition to Rome, and yet begg Examples from it. Such, as preferred the authoritie of Counsells above the Pope, had their warrant from the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells, which knew not the vicarshipp of the Pope different from his brethren; And had these Counsells thought him Christs vicar, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as the Romanists now maintaine, their conclusion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells superioritie could not consist with their premisses, being much alike this Authors ordinary Arguments. But what resemblance has a Counsell of the whole Church to the Parliament, or Counsell of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kingdome? By the lawes of some kingdomes there are noe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments at all, and in Counsells they are not subjects, but brethren to to the Pope, as they anciently stiled themselves, and they anciently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, and departed without any leave from him, but in the English Parliament, they are all subjects to the king, and their places were by his institution, and the kings calling any convention for advice, doth not alter the qualitie of subjection.</p>
               <p>He comes now to humane lawes, and by them he will prove a divine truth. The <hi>judgment given against Orestes,</hi> either at Athens, whose king he was not, or in any other Countrey, where he was but a <hi>Titular,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves nothing, though the story were Authenticke, and the proceedings legall, but popular furies, though occasioned by their Governours Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are not Examples of imitation. <hi>Solons lawes</hi> belonged not to king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Government, neither were the kings of Sparta Monarchs, nor Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus a King indeede, though he had a Title, the constitution of that State being a Republique, and their King noe other, then a Consul of Rome, or a Duke of venice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Decree in Rome</hi> is farr wide from the matter, and what the <hi>Senate</hi> did against <hi>Nero,</hi> was in vindication of their ancient power, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Justice of his soveraigntie. Though Theodosius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the law to be above the Emperour, yet he decreed not any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to have power over the Emperour. The law was above him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard it was his Rule, but could not make any person, or societie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him. The law is the directive power to Kings, but subject them not to any, and it is a senseles deduction from the superioritie of the Rule to imagine an inferioritie of the Rulers to the people, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie in power by the Rule.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Bracton,</hi> or <hi>Cleta</hi> say <hi>the King is inferiour to the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is a manifest vntruth, and Bracton sayes expressely, the King hath not a superiour on earth to punish him, and that only God is the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Actions, soe farr were theis men from affirminge, that <hi>he stands as liable to receive Iustice, as the meanest of his subjects.</hi> But this man thinkes, that some of his Readers will believe, that the name of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is sufficient Authoritie, though he speake contrary to what he alleadges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is said in an ancient booke, the King ought to be subject to the law by his oath.</hi> Though the King be bound to performe the law by his oath, is there any to judge him, when all are his subjects, and derive their power from him, or is he subject to any person? And who can judge another, that is not subject to him? Because Kings bound themselves to doe Justice, therefore did they give other men power over them?</p>
               <p>That the king permitted questions of his right to <hi>ordinary Iudicature</hi> is an vse of Counsell, not subjection, all Courts being his Counsells, for decision of controversies, but its a sorry inference, that Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in his affaires should have power over his person. As the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments right is circumscribed by lawes in regarde of the subject, soe it cannot be imagined absolute over the king. By what the Libeller hath said, he might well conclude, that kings are oblidged to doe justice, but that the people, or particular persons may judge their king by any law divine, or humane, he hath not offred a colour, soe barren is he in an Argument, which he calls <hi>over copious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who should better vnderstand their owne lawes, and when they are transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then they, who are governed by them, and whose consent at first made them.</hi> Certenly he might very wel have answeared himselfe, that they, which governed by such lawes, and whose consent at first made them better vnderstand them, and when they are transgressed, then they, that are governed, and it is a course very agreable to these mens confusion, that the suiter should teach the judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:103102:141"/>
The Libeller askes, <hi>who have more right to take knowledge of things done within a free nation, then they within themselves.</hi> And surely they will not be free long from destroying one another, where thats the libertie, for there wilbe as many Transgressours, and as many lawes, as there are opinions.</p>
               <p>He goes about to answeare the taking the oath of <hi>Alleagiance, and supreamacy.</hi> And to this his answeare is very ready, that <hi>these oaths were to his person invested with his Authoritie, and his Authoritie was by the people given him conditionally vnder law, and oath.</hi> And if his Authoritie had been conditionall, their oaths could not be absolute, as they are. This guift, and condition they imagine were engraven in Seths Pillars, and they have been long enquiringe for a Cabballisticke Rabbyn to finde out the Characters. How the kings hereditary succession is become a conditionall guift, must have better evidence then Aphorismes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, never law contained either the guift, or condition, nor was there ever such impudence before theis Traytours, that avowed, because they swore faith to their kings person invested with his Authoritie, they might take away his Authoritie, and not breake their oath, And it were a prophane oath, aswell, as vaine, that should be voyde at the will of the taker. The kings oath added nothing to his right, being only an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his conscience, noe condition annexed to his right, and if he never tooke the oath, his subjects obedience is noe whit diminished, and a king by inheritance needes not <hi>admittance,</hi> the death of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour puts him in possession, &amp; this is the knowne law of England. <hi>The Couquerour</hi> tooke on oath at his Crowninge, and other times, that made noe condition to his Government. There is not only reason, but absolute necessitie for the avoyding of confusion, &amp; ruine of mankinde, that the subject be bound to the king, though the kinge faile in his dutie, for the destruction of Government is more sinfull, and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to humane societie, then any evill, that can come by a kings mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government.</p>
               <p>He proceedes to answeare objections touchinge the Covenant, wherein we shall not much insist, but to detect the shifts of Malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to elude the evidence of truth. They were <hi>accused by the King, and his partie to pretend libertie, and reformation, but to have noe other end, then to make themselves greate, and to destroy his person, and Authoritie, for which reason</hi> sayes the Libeller, <hi>they added the third Article to preserve the Kings person, and Authoritie in defence of Religion, priviledge of Parliament, and liberties of the Kingdome.</hi> And to shew with what ingenuitie he dealt, in seeking to avoyde that just accusation, the Libeller tells vs, that they added that cause for a shew only, and they intended not to preserve the Kings person further, then it might consist with their opinions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge Reformation, extirpatinge of Prelacy, preservinge liberties of Parliament, and Kingdome, and in this very clause they called <hi>the world
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103102:142"/>
to be wittnes with their consciences of their loyaltie,</hi> and yet made <hi>the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Kings person, and Authoritie,</hi> arbitrary by their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and while this Libeller would have their Rebellion a defensive warr, he forbeares not to tell the world, that they resolved the Kings destruction to attaine their ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The sixth Article gives asmuch preservation, and defence to all, that enter into the league, as to him.</hi> And it seemes more, for they have dealt with none of them, as with him, and he sayes, <hi>if the Covenant were made absolute without respect to these superiour things, it was an vnlawfull vow, and not to be kept.</hi> It is agreed, that vnlawfull vowes are not to be made, nor kept, but it is an vnlawfull vow to destroy the Kinge in order to his supposed ends, yet they feare not to vow the destruction of any, that oppose them, though the honour, and innocence of the persons were without the reach of lawes, and they will exempt neither callings, nor integritie from their lawles Injustice, and that appeared by his glosse vpon the fourth Article of the Covenant <hi>to bring persons offending to tryall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment, all that should be found guiltie of such Crymes, and delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whereof the King by his letters, and proofes afterward was found guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> in what they thought him at the taking of the Covenant, to be over ruled only by evill Counsellours.</hi> And had not he avowed all, that ever his letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in his former declarations, and hath the Libeller forgotten, that the imputation of Crymes to evill Counsellours was but a Ceremony, and are not his foregoinge words, that their ends, reformation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpatinge Prelacy were to be preferred before the preservation of the Kings personand authoritie. This last age hath produced a generation, that pretend they doe God service, when they scorne all his lawes, and Religion, and hold forth their execrable villanies to the world, as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull, and <hi>well pleasinge sacrifices to God,</hi> and make ostentations of their perjuries, and Blaspheamies, as services to him. The nullities, and vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of those Monster judges, that made themselves cut-throates of the King, needed not the Kings exceptions to avoyde their illegallitie being soe apparent, &amp; what the King did, or said to of them wil remaine to his honour, and the Libellers infamy, that glories in the misfortunes of Princes, sayinge it was <hi>learnt from his graund-mother.</hi>

                  <hi>Its a sad fate to haue his Enemies both accusers, parties, and Iudges.</hi> The Libeller sayes, <hi>what malefactour might not pleade the like, if his Crymes have made all men his Enemies.</hi> But there were hardly ever such malefactours, vnles, they, who tooke vpon them to judge the Kinge. He, that is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy before judgment, cannot be a judge of the Cryme, and he, that is an Enemy to a Malefactour vncondemned is not fit to condemne him, and such, as are Enemies to Government, and are common destro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers cannot be judges,</p>

God gave that honour to the Israelites to binde the kings of the Amorites, their Enemies in Chaines, and their nobles in linkes of Iron. Theis darlings of the Devill wilbe the only saints, &amp; make it their honour to destroy the powers, that God hath ordeyned and there must be neither kings, nor Nobles, but theis evill spiritts, whome noe Irons, nor Chaines will restraine, and perjury, robbery, murder, and Rebellion are the honour of theise saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The building of Babell</hi> was not <hi>Nimrods worke,</hi> (whome by asserted vntruth he calls the first king) that worke was a popular vndertakinge, because the people would erect a Republique of confusion, &amp; not trust God to protest them, and the Libeller could not have fallen vpon an instance more like his present madnes, for as those builders faind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in pretending to prevent it, soe there Rebells pretend to preserve the Kingdome by turninge it into popular confusion, and therefore those saints must destroy Babell, especially <hi>that spirituall Babell, and first overcome those European Kings, which receive their power not from God, but from the Beast.</hi> Doth he meane the Beast with many heads? It is his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Argument, that Kings receive their power from the people, and if soe, then are they this beast. What Kings of Europe receive their Kingdomes from his Beast? But there Sectaries are drunken with their owne prophanes, &amp; pride, and have a strong delusion to beleive the lies of their owne invention.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Those Kings are counted noe better, then his ten hornes.</hi> Noe better, but by what proofe, are they the same by such frenetique dreames, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces? <hi>They shall hate the whore,</hi> and yet <hi>the saints must destroy them,</hi> and <hi>shall burne her with sire,</hi> and yet <hi>be overcome first themselves. But they shall at last joyne their Armyes with the Beast after they have destroyed the whore.</hi> And this is the Babilonish Creede, a bundle of contradictions to carry their Giddy followers into attempts as wicked, as their conceites are irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall. We see the grounds of their cause, an hellish impulsion against Government, and hatred of Kings, there having not been imposters of equall impudence since Mahomett, that professe a Religion to destroy all Kings, and those Blasphemies, that were abhorred in former Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Entheusiasts are the Creed of those miscreants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tis true, there be a sort of moody, hott brain'd, and allwayes vnedified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences apt to engage their leaders past retirement, and then vpon a sudden qualme, and Swimminge of their conscience to betray them basely in the middest of what was chiefely vndertaken for their sakes.</hi> Seducers cannot thinke to be vndiscovered forever, but such, as are not resolute villaines have a moody conscience in this mans judgment, the tender conscience is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moody, and hott brain'd, and certenly such were many in this Rebellion, or it could never have proceeded soe farr. <hi>Let such men never meete with any faithfull Parliament to hazard for them.</hi> And let never Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament thinke to be better rewarded, that follow a faction to betray their King, then to be subject to those base multitudes, whome they suborned to attempts against their loyaltie, and become slaves.</p>
               <p>He findes <hi>others, in whose consciences gaine hath sprung a sudden leake, and these are they, that cry out of the Covenant broken.</hi> Thus the builders of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell are scattered, while they make conscience, and Religion their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, and in the meane time, nothing is more the subject of their scorne. And if <hi>God were mocked in pretending the Covenant in Scotland, and Vlster,</hi> he was much more in England by crying out the King, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lawes, and libertie, and the Libeller might have found such men, whose prosperitie was sinne, that Triumpht in the afflictions of him, whome they persecuted, and said tush God hath forsaken him, let vs smite him, that he rise noe more. The <hi>sinne of Ahas,</hi> that transgressed more in the tyme of his affliction hath noe resemblance to a vertuous Prince afflicted by Traytours, whose crueltie encreased, while they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed him, and exceeded the inhumanitie of the cursed Moabites, that burnt the bones of the King of Edom into lime.</p>
               <p>The Kings Charatie in <hi>forgivinge his Enemies,</hi> will finde a right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction with all true Christians, but malice, and detraction of all Acts of pittie cannot meete, with lesse, then detestation in all men any way quallified with Religion, or reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hipocrites Almes,</hi> are not more odious, then hipocrites censures, the crueltie of Hipocrites will receive a greater condemnation, then their Almes.</p>

                  <hi>Prayers for Gods Compassion,</hi> are not to <hi>share victory with Gods Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> But such, as strive to slander mens prayers to God are as malicious to Gods victory, as the devotions of those, that pray vnto him. Such as reade this impudent Libell may rightly call it the Rebells Image, conteyninge precepts, and positions of violence against Government, confusion of States, doctrines of falshood, and hipocrisie, prayses of insolence, and crueltie, prophaninge of Gods name, and word, scoffes at things sacred, dissolution of all bonds morall, Civill, and Religious, of all orders, and degrees among men. And it must be hatred to God, and a Diabolicall impulsion, that drives on such persons to fill vp the measure of their wickednes.</p>
