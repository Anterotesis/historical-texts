         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Against thoffendours of this lawe, ther was no corporal punishement ordayned in this worlde, til after the destruction of the worlde with the great floud. For albeit <hi>Cayn and lamech</hi> had committed horrible murthers, yet were they not corporally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, but had a protection of God, that none should laufully hurte them. But after the flood, whan God sawe his gentilnesse and pacience could not worke his creatures to doo their dueties vnforced, but ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie preuailed and mischief daily encreaced, and one murthered, and destroyed an other: than was he constrayned to chaunge his lenitie into seueritie, and to adde corporal paynes to those that wold not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, but transgresse his ordinaunces. And so he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de this lawe, which he declared to Noha: <hi>He that Sheadeth the bloud of man, his bloud Shal be Shead by man. For man is made after the ymage of God.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:15453:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For he that geueth man autoritie ouer the body and life of man, bicause he wolde haue man to lyue quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all might serue him quietly in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and righteousnes, all the dayes of their life, it can not be denyed, but he gaue him autoritie ouer goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, landes, possessiones and all suche thinges as might bried controuersies and discordes, and so hyndre and let, that he might not be serued and glorified, as he requireth. This ordinaunce also teacheth makers of lawes, how they should behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues in making lawes: that is, to set aparte all affectiones, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue an equalitie in paynes, that they be not greater or lesse, than the fault deserueth, and that they punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he not thinnocent or smal offendour for malice, and let the mightie and great thefe escape for affection. And out of this ordinaunce groweth and is grounded thautoritie for Magistrates to execute lawes: for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes without execucion, be no more profitable, than belles without clappers. But whether this authoritie to make lawes, or the power to execute the same, shal be and remayne in one person alone, or in manie, it is not expressed, but lefte to the discrecio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people to make so many and so fewe, as they thinke necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the mayntenaunce of the state. wherupon in som places, they haue ben content to obey suche la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, as were made by one, as the Israelites were with those that <hi>Moyses</hi> ordayned: the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones</hi> with those that <hi>Licurgus</hi> made, the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15453:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with those that <hi>Solon</hi> gaue them. And in some places with suche as were made by certayn outcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen men, as in Rome by the ten men. And in some they receaued none, but suche as all the multitude agreed Vnto. Likewise in some countreyes they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to be gouerned, and the lawes executed by one king or Iudge, in some places by many of the best sorte, in some places by the people of the lowest sorte, and in some places also by the king, nobilitie, and the people all together.</p>
            <p>And these diuerse kyndes of states or policies hade their distincte names, as wher one ruled, a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie:</hi> wher many of the best, <hi>Aristocratie:</hi> wher the multitude, <hi>Democratie:</hi> and wher all together, that is, a king, the nobilitie, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mones, a mixte sta te: which men by long continuance haue iudged to be the best sort of all. For wher that mixte state was exerciced, ther did the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthe longest conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. But yet euery kynde of these states tended to one ende, that is, to the mayntenaunce of iustice, to the wealthe and benefite of the hole multitude, and not of the superiour and gouernours alone. And whan they sawe, that the gouernours abused their autoritie, they altred the state. As among the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, for the iniquitie of the children of <hi>Samuel</hi> their iudge, from Iudges to kinges: among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, for the tyrannye and oppression that
<pb facs="tcp:15453:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Tarquinius</hi> vsed ouer the people (as the chief oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) and afterwarde for his sonnes lewdenesse (as the outwarde occasion) from kinges to Consules, and so from Consules (for their euil demeanour) to <hi>Decem viri</hi> and <hi>Triumviri,</hi> that is, to ten rulers and three rulers: and so from chaunge to chaunge, tyll it came to the state Imperial: yet alwayes preseruing and mayntening thautoritie, albeit they altred and chaunged the kinde of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the Ethnikes themselues being ledde on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the lawe of nature and their owne reason, sawe that without politike power and autoritie, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde could not be preserued, nor the worlde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. The riche wold oppresse the poore, and the poore seke the destruction of the riche, to haue that he hade: the mightie wold destroye the weake, and as <hi>Theodoretus</hi> sayeth, the great fishe eate vp the small, and the weake seke reuenge on the migh tie: and so one seking the others destruction, all at leynght shoulde be vndone and come to destruction. And bicause this authoritie and power, bothe to make lawes, and execute lawes, proceded from God, the holy goost in scripture calleth them Goddes: not for that they be naturally Godds, or that they be transubstantiated in to Goddes (for he sayeth, they shall dye like men, and in dede their workes declare them to be non other than men) but for thautoritie and power which they receaue of God,
<pb facs="tcp:15453:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be his ministers here in earthe, in ruling and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning his people, and that the people should the rather obeye them, and haue them in honour and reuerence, according to his ordinaunce.</p>
            <p>And the wonderfull prouidence of God is herein to be wel noted and considered, of all suche as loue and feare God, that in all places and countreyes wher Goddes worde hathe ben receaued and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ther for the tyme the people folowed God, no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye could entre, but all the membres of the body sought the prosperitie and wealthe one of an other, for Goddes worde taught them so to doo. Thou shalt loue the lorde thy God (sayeth it) aboue all thinges, and thy neighbour as thy selfe. And, what ye will that men doo vnto you, doo you euen so vnto them. The frutes of his worde is loue one of an other, of what state or degree in this worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de so euer they be. And the state of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies and common wealthes haue ben disposed and ordained bi God, that the headdes could not (if they wolde) oppresse the other membres. For as among the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> certain men called <hi>Ephori</hi> were ordayned so see that the kinges should not oppresse the people, and among the
<pb facs="tcp:15453:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Romaynes, the <hi>Tribunes</hi> were ordayned to defende and mayntene the libertie of the people from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and iniurie of the nobles: so in all Christian real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and dominiones God ordayned meanes, that the heads the pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gouernours should not oppresse the poore people after their lustes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d make their wil les their lawes. As in Germanye betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the people, a Counsail or diet: in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande, parliamentes, wherin ther mette and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of all sortes of people, and nothing could be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne without the knowlage and consent of all. But wher the people haue forsaken God, and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned utterly his worde, ther hathe the deuil by his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, occupied the hole countrey, and subuerted the good ordres, iustice and equalitie, that was in the common wealthe, and planted his unreasonable lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes for good lawes, as euery man maye see by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme of <hi>Vngarie</hi> which the Turke in our tyme ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the occupied. And wher the people haue not utterly forsaken God and his worde, but haue begonne to be weary of it: ther hathe not God suffred Tyrannes by and by to rush in, and to occupie the hole, and to suppresse the good ordres of the common wealthe, but by litel and litel hathe suffred them to crepe in, first with the head, than with an arme, and so after with a legge, and at leynght (were not the people penitent, and in tyme conuerted to God) to bring in the hole body, and to worke the feates of Tirannes,
<pb facs="tcp:15453:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as hereafter it shalbe declared.</p>
            <p>This is so manifest in most places, that it shall not nede any particular example. Wherfore it shalbe the parte of all Christen men to take hede, that in forsaking God, they bring not iustly the deuil and tyrannes to reigne ouer them. And those that be called to councelles and parliamentes (and so to be makers of lawes, wherby the people should be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) not to neglecte their duetie, or to deceaue the people of the trust and confidence, that was put in them. For it is no litle daunger that maye therby fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe unto them, bothe in this worlde, and in the worlde to come. For that man that toke upon him to doo any thing for an other (being the thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so litle of ualue) and therin did use him self either craftily, seking his owne gayne and profit, or she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we him self not diligent, or not passing what beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the matter committed to his trust, our elders being men of honestie, iudged and condemned for a most uile uarlet and unhonest persone: and being men of wisedome, made a lawe (which continueth til this daye) not only that he should make recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the hurt he did, but also that he should not be allowed afterwarde in the company or nombre of honest men, no more than an open these. And this they did not by will, but by reason, not rashly, but aduisedly, not by the moo voices, but by the more discrete headdes, bicause they sawe, that men could
<pb facs="tcp:15453:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not be alwayes present to doo their owne thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but of necessitie must use the helpe and trust of others. And again, nature hathe not made euery man apte for all thinges, but hathe made one man mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re mete for one purpose than an other: so that one hauing nede of an other, euery one should be glad to doo for an other, and all be tyed together in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble strong bande of frendship. And therfore was suche false and unfrendly dealing taken to be most uile, bicause it did uiolate two the chiefest uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and most necessary thinges, without which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde coulde not contynue: <hi>faithe,</hi> and <hi>fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship.</hi> For noman requireth an other, to doo any thing for him, whom he taketh not to be his frende, nor trusteth him, whom he thinketh not faithfull. And therfore they thought him to be a uery wicked and vile persone, and not worthy the name of a man, that at one tyme and in one thing should thus undoo the knot of frendship, and deceaue him, whom he coulde not haue hurted, onles he hade trusted him. Now if nature, reason, honestie and lawe dothe so greuously punishe him, and cast him out of all honest mennes companies, that is necligent in a trifle, how muche more ought he to be punished and cast out of all mennes sight, that is necligent in the greatest matiers? If he ought so sharpely to be vsed, that deceaueth one poore man: how muche more sharpely ought he to be punished, and
<pb facs="tcp:15453:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all men to be abhorred (yea cast to the dogges) that deceaueth a hole Realme of ten or twentie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousaunt persones? If he be thus to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and punished, that is required to doo an other mannes busynesse, and deceaueth him: how muche more ought they to be abhorred and hated, that take vpon them to doo for others, not desired but suyng for it: not called therto, but thrusting in them self: not prayed, but payeng, geuing many lyuereyes, procuring and making frendes to geue them their uoices, obteynyng of great mennes lettres, and ladies tokens, feasting freholders, and making great banketting cheare: not by the consent of the parte, but by force and streinght, with tropes of horsemen, billes, bowes, pykes, gonnes, and suche like kynde of qualityes.</p>
            <p>If this opinion be had, and iudgement be geuen against a man that seketh his owne gayne with the losse of his frendes in small thinges: What opinion maye men haue, what iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shalbe geuen of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, that (to make them selues noble and riche) cutte the throtes of those that committed themselues, their wyues, their children, their goodes, yea and lyues vpon trust in to their handes?</p>
            <p>If this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be geuen for worldly thinges, what iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shalbe geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those that wilfully goo about to destroye me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes soules, and to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a present to the deuil, so that they for a tyme maye be his deputies
<pb facs="tcp:15453:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
here in earthe? If men doo thus abhorre and punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he suche unfaithfull and unhonest persones: how muche more will thalmightie God abhorre, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, and exercice his seuere iudgement on them, that thus abuse the autoritie geuen unto them by him, and deceaue and undoo those poore shepe of his, in whom (as his ministers) they put their trust?</p>
            <p>Hearke, hearke (while tyme of repentaunce is) to the sentence of God, pronounced by the mouthe of his seruaunt and Prophet Esaias. <hi>VVo be vnto you</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>that make vnrighteous lauues, and deuise thinges vuhich be to harde to be kept, vuherby the poore are oppressed on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry syde, and thinnocentes of my people are theruuith robbed of iudgement, that vuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douues maye be your praye, and that ye maye robbe the fatherles.

For God is iuste, and so hateth sinne, that he neuer leaueth it in any place vnpunished: but the more common it is, the greater plages and force dothe he vse to represse it: as we maye learne by thexamples of the cities Sodome and Gomor, and Ierusalem his owne citie.

For all men, yea half wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se women and babes can well iudge, that his power is worthy to be laught at: and were it not bolstred and propped vp with sweorde a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fagot, it wolde (as it will notwithstanding) shortly ly in the myre, for it is not buylt on the rocke, but on the sande, not planted by the father of heauen, but by the deuil of hell, as the frutes doo manyfestly declare. But we will speake of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of kynges and princes, and suche like potentates, rulers, and gouernours of common wealthes.</p>
            <p>Before ye haue hearde, how for a great long tyme, that is vntil after the general flood, ther was no ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le or politike power, and how it was tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> furst orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God him self, and for what purpose he orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it: that is (to comprehende all briefly) to maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne iustice: for euery one doing his deutie to God, and one to an other, is but iustice. Ye haue hearde also, howe states, bodies politike, and common wealthes ha ue autoritie to make lawes for the mayntenaunce of the policie, so that they be not contrary to Goddes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we and the lawes of nature: which, if ye note well the question before propouned whether kinges and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue an absolute power, shall appeare not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or if any wolde affirme it, that he shall not be hable to maintene it. For first touching Goddes lawes
<pb facs="tcp:15453:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(by which name also the lawes of nature be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended) kinges and princes are not ioyned makers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof with God, so that therby of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues they might clayme any interest or autoritie to dissolue them or dispense with them, by this <hi>Maxime</hi> or principal, that he that maye knyt together, maye lose asondre: and he that maye make, maye marre: for before Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates were, Goddes lawes were. Neither can it be proued, that by Goddes worde they haue any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie to dispense or breake them: but that they be still commanded to doo right, to ministre iustice, and not to swarue, neither on the right hande or on the lefte. Than must it nedes folowe, that this absolute autoritie which they vse, must be mayntened by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes reason, or it must nedes be an vsurpacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But what can reason saye? If it be not laufull, by no lawes (no neither by honestie) for any mannes seruaunt to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre his maisters (a mortal mannes) commaundement: can reason saye, it is laufull for any persone to altre Goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, or breake it? That a mannes seruaunt maye be wiser than his maister, that he maye be iuster than his maister, that he maye see what is mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re profitable and necessarie to be done tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his maister, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it happeneth: and therfore he maye haue som appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause, to altre or breake his maisters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun dement. But to saye, that any creature is, or that any creature wolde seme in worde or dede, to be more wise than God, more iuste than God, more prudent
<pb facs="tcp:15453:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and circumspecte than God, or knoweth what is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the creature than the creatour him self (as it must nedes be saied, that he dothe, that taketh vpon him to breake or dispence with Goddes will and commaundementes) what an horrible blasphemie is it? What luciferous presumpcion is it?</p>
            <p>If we will not submit our selues to Goddes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein expressed by his worde, as Christianes should, let vs yet marke the sequele: and therby ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goddes iudgement, as Ethnikes doo. For whan we haue wrought our wittes out, and deuised and done what we can, we can not so exclude God, but he will haue a saieng with vs.</p>
            <p>Goddes worde, will and commaundement is, that he that wilfully killeth a man, shall also be killed by man: that is, the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> But this lawe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the not ben obserued and all wayes executed, but kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and princes vpon affection haue dispensed and broken it, graunting life and libertie to traitours, robbers, murtherours, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But what hathe folowed of it? Haue they (whose offences haue ben so pardoned) after ward shewed them selues penitent to God, and thankfully profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the common wealthe? No, God and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealthe haue hade no greater enemies. They haue added murther to murther, mischief to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schief, and of priuate malefactours, haue become publike, and of men killers, they haue at leinght gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
<pb facs="tcp:15453:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be destroiers of their countrey, yea and many tymes of them that saued them from hanging and other iust paines of the lawe. And no maruail: for God dothe not oneli punishe the principalles and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of suche mischief, but also those that be acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and mayntenours of it, and plageth iniquitie with iniquitie. Ye maie likewise see, what frutes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue folowed, wher popes, haue dispensed, that maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges might be made contrarie to Goddes lawes. We shall not nede to rehearse any? thende will declare all. But let vs leaue to reason that, wherein nothing can be saied for it. And let vs come to that, wherein somewhat maye be saied: that is, whether kinges and princes maye doo thinges contrary to the positiue lawes of their countrey. As for example.</p>
            <p>It is a lawe positiue, that a meane kinde of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parail, or a meane kynde of diet should be vsed in a common wealthe, to thintent that men leauing thexcesse thereof, wherof many occasiones bothe to destroie nature and to offende God folowe, they might conuerte that they before euil spent, to the relief of the pouertie, or defense of their countrey.</p>
            <p>For answer to this question, this diuision ought to be made, that ther be two kyndes of kinges, princes, and gouernours.</p>
            <p>The one, who alone maye make positiue lawes, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the hole state and body of their countrey haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and resigned to them their authoritie so to doo:
<pb facs="tcp:15453:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which neuertheles is rather to be compted a tiranne than a king, as <hi>Dionisius, Philippus and Alexander</hi> were, who saued whom they wold a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spilt whom they lusted. And thother be suche, vnto whom the people haue not geuen suche autoritie, but kepe it them selues: as we haue before sayed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the mixte state.</p>
            <p>True it is, that in maters indifferent, that is, that of them selues be neither good nor euil, hurtfull or profitable, but for a decent ordre: Kinges and Princes (to whom the people haue geuen their autoritie) maie make suche lawes, and dispense with them. But in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not indifferent, but godly and profitably orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the common wealthe, ther can they not (for all their autoritie) breake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or dispense with them. For Princes are ordained to doo good, not to doo euil: to take awaie euil, not to increace it: to geue example of well doing, not to be procurers of euil: to procure the wealthe and benefite of their subiectes, and not to worke their hurt or vndoing. And in thempire wher (by the ciuile lawes) themperours claime, that the people gaue them their autoritie to make lawes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they haue ben willing, and ofte atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their autoritie, which som Piketha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes (to please them) saie they haue by the lawes, yet haue they ben forced of them selues to leaue of their enterprise. But such as be indifferent expounders of the lawes, be of that minde that we before haue declared: and therfore
<pb facs="tcp:15453:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make this a general conclusion, and as it were a rule, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour willing any thing to be done, ther is no more to be done, than the lawes permit to be done. For (saie they) neither pope, Emperour, nor king may doo any thing to the hurt of his people without their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent. King <hi>Antigonus</hi> Chauncelour, saieng vnto him, that all thinges were honest a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d laufull to kinges: ye saie true (quod the king) but to suche kinges as be beastes, barbarous a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without humanitie: but to true a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d good Princes, nothing is honest, but that is honest in dede, and nothing is iuste, but that is iuste in dede.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthiochus</hi> the thrid king of <hi>Asia,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that as he was aboue the people, so the lawes we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re aboue him, wrote general lettres to all the cities of his countrey, that if they shoulde perceaue, that he by any lettres, should require any thing contrary to the lawes, they should thinke, that suche lettres were obteined without his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent, and therfore they should not obeie them.</p>
            <p>Now if wher the people haue geuen their autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to their gouernour to make suche lawes, yet can he not breake or dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se with the positiue lawes: how muche lesse maie suche gouernours, kinges, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people haue not geuen their autoritie (but they with the people, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the people with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma ke the lawes) breake them or dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se with them? If this were tolerable, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were it in vaine to make sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne as semblies of the hole state, long Parliamentes &amp;c? yea
<pb facs="tcp:15453:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(I beseche the) what certayntie should therbe in any thyng, wher all should depende on ones will and affection? But it wilbe saied, that albeit kinges and princes can not make lawes, but with the consent of the people, yet maie they dispense with any positiue lawe, by reason that of long tyme they haue vsed so to doo, and prescribe so to doo: for long custome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a lawe.</p>
            <p>To this it maye be answered, euil customes (be they neuer so olde) are not to be suffred, but vtterly to be abolished: and non maie prescribe to doo euil, be he king or subiecte. If the lawes appoint thee the time of thrittye or fourtie yeares to claime a sure and a perfit interesse of that thow enioiest, yet if thow knowe, that either thy self or those by Whom thow claimest, came wrongfully by it, thow art not in dede a perfit owner of it, but art bounden to restore it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the lawes of man doo excuse and defende thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outwarde trouble and punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they not quiet the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth, that thow enioiest that is not thyne, it will byte the that thow haste done wrong: it will accuse the before the iudgement seat of God, and condemnethe. And if princes and gouernours wolde shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues half so wise, as they wolde men shoulde take them to be, and by thexample of others learne What mischief might happen to them selues, they wolde not (if they
<pb facs="tcp:15453:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might) clayme, muche lesse execute any suche ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute authoritie. No, neither wold their Counsai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours (if they loued them) maintene them in it: nor yet the subiectes (if they did but considre their owne sauetie and felicitie in this life) wolde not if they might suffre their Prince to doo what him lusted.</p>
            <p>For thone purchace to them selues a perpetuall vncer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Ther lacke no examples to verifie this. It was dryven in to the head of temperour <hi>C. Caligula,</hi> that he was subiecte to no power, that he was aboue all lawes, and that he might laufully doo what him lu sted. This lesson was so swete to the fleshe, that it was no soner moued than desired, no soner taught than learned, no soner hearde than practiced. First by like that thempire should not goo out of his owne race, he coupleth not with one, but with all his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, like bitche and dogge. He killeth his brother <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and all his chiefest frendes: he murdereth many of the Senatours of Rome. He delited to haue honest men to be garshed, scotched and cut in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and so to make him pleasure, to haue them cast
<pb facs="tcp:15453:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to rauenous beastes to be torne and deuoured in his sight, or to be sawed asondre in the middes. It was a pleasunt pastyme for him, to see the parentes stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de by, lamenting and weping, whiles their children were tormented and killed. He vsed to complayne and lament, that no common calamitie and notable miseries happened in his time. He reioyced muche whan newes were brought him of the slaughters of hole armies of men, great hongre, pestilence, townes burnyng, and openynges of the earthe, wherin many people were swalowed vp. But the daye he sawe any of these him self, he neded neither meat nor drinke, he was so iocunde and merye. And being glutted with the pastime of euery mannes dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, by him self (to procure a newe appetite) he deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an other, if he could haue brought it to passe. But whan he could not haue it done, the memorie therof was so swete, that he ofte desired: that is, that all the he addes of the people of Rome stode on one mannes necke, that he might with ones was he cut it of. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other noble actes by his absolute power he wrought: and at leynght he commaunded that his ymage should be set vp in the temple at Ierusalem, and ther worshipped: as not vnlike Sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Gardiners</hi> (for he hathe done no smal thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges) shalbe shortly by Anti cipacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

               <hi>Nero</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour was of nature very modest, gen til, and mercifull, and the first fiue yeares of this rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne, he behaued him self very vertuously. After, other counsaillours and maisters, than <hi>Seneca</hi> crept into his fauour, who tolde him that he might doo what him lusted. He was sone persuaded therunto. And to shewe som profe that he had well caried awaye their aduise: he killed his mother Agrippina. This cruel acte did so moue his wicked conscience, that he durst not come abroade in the Senate, but kept him self secrete in his priuie cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre. For he feared the hatred of the people, and knewe not what was best for hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doo. He lacked no flattering Counsailours. Ther were pleintie that sought their owne profit and gayne, and the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng of their lustes, more than their princes honour and sauetie, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthe of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treie Saie they: Sir, whi should ye be thus amased with the deathe of this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

They desire, that ye will returne in to the citie, that they maie with triumphe expresse how muche their ioie and gladnesse is, and how they loue you for so noble a feate. These craftie knaues seing how they might blinde their maisters eies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours behalf, that all the people should come out of

Rome, to mete themperour. The Senate in their best apparail cometh out, alle other ordres likewise after their degrees folowe, and finally man, Woman and childe.</p>
            <p>Themperour whan he sawe them, thought all was done from the botome of their heart. The Senate shewed suche outwarde honour, the commones so great loue, eueri body pretended so great ioye and gladnesse. And thinke ye, ther were not about him that said. Dothe not your Maiestie well finde all our saienges true? maye ye not credite vs in that we coun sail and aduise you? What folowed? Themperour em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed with the blood of his mother, and his vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acte commended by his wicked Counsailours, ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not from his crueltie, but earnestly goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde He putteth awaie his wife <hi>Octauia,</hi> bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se she semed to be baren. He marieth his harlot called <hi>Puppie.</hi> He sendeth his wife Octauia in to an Ilan de, he byndeth her in chaines, and causeth her to be let blood in all partes: and fearing least feare wolde dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the blood to the harte, and so she lyue longer than he wolde, he setteth her in a bayne of hotte water, that her blood might the soner come out. But what becometh of his deare dearling Puppie? he dalieth a while with his Puppie and at leynght his hotte loue being turned in to displeasur, he spurneth her (being with Childe) on the belye, and so she dieth. To late he repented, but yet ceassed not his crueltie. He killed
<pb facs="tcp:15453:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his maister <hi>Seneca,</hi> he persecuted the churche of Christ most miserably, and so thinking that he might doo what him lusted, and that all was well done, were it neuer so euil done, he neuer lefte of his crueltie, til the people finding occasion and oportunitie to vttre their dissembled hatred, slewe him.</p>
            <p>But what thinke you? who were to be blamed for these cruell actes?

Surely ther is none of them to be excused, but all to be blamed, and chiefly those that might haue brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and did not.</p>
            <p>He is a good citez in, that dothe non euil (saieth a noble wiseman) but he is a better that letteth others, that they shall not doo hurt nor vniustice to others.

<pb facs="tcp:15453:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and extinguishing of his posteritie, is more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne, than nedeth any rehearsall. <hi>Roboam</hi> bicause he wold reigne as a tyranne and not be subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte to lawe nor counsail, hade ten tribes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and geuen to <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> who also forasmuche as he contented not him selfe to be sub iecte to Goddes written worde and lawe, but fell to his owne Idolatrous inuenciones, and caused his subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes to folowe his procedinges: was so stripped from the enheritaunce of his crowne, that his sede was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rooted out.</p>
            <p>The ende of <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iesabel</hi> is well ynough vnderstanden. And kyng <hi>Ioram</hi> for his stout stryuing against Goddes lawes and the ordre of his countrey was so sore striken of the lorde with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible diseases, that at leynght his guttes for extreme anguishe flewe out of his bely. But wherto bring I out particular examples of Goddes plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishementes vpon kinges and princes that wold not be subiecte to Goddes lawes, and the lawes of nature, seing the hole body of the Bible, and writers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane histories be full of them?</p>
            <p>Therfore seing no king or gouernour is exempted from the lawes, hande, and power of God, but that he ought to feare and tremble at it, we maye procede to the other part of the question: that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinges, princes, and other gouernours ought to
<pb facs="tcp:15453:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be obedient and subiecte to the positiue lawes of their countrey. To discusse this question, the right waye and meane is as in all other thinges, to resorte to the fountaynes and rootes, and not to depende on the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and braunches. For as if men should admyt, that the churche of Rome were the catholike churche, and the pope the head of it, and Goddes onely vicare in earthe, and not seke further how he cometh by that autoritie: than could noman saie, but that all his doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (were they neuer so wicked) should seme iust: so if men should buylde vpon thauthoritie that kinges and princes vsurpe ouer their subiectes, and not seke from whens they haue theyr autoritie, nor whether that which they vse, be iuste, ther could be nothing produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to let their cruell tyrannye. But for asmuche as we see from whence all politike power and autoritie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that is, from God: and why it was ordained, that is, to mayntene iustice: we ought (if we will iudge rightly) by Goddes worde examine to trie this mater.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paule</hi> treating who should doo obedience, and to whom obedience should be done, saieth: <hi>Let euery soule be subiecte to the powers that rule, for ther is no power but of God.</hi> Ther are that wolde haue this worde, <hi>Soule,</hi> taken for man, not as he consisteth of soule and body bothe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but onely of the fleshe: and that so by the wor de (<hi>

            <p>But in scripture this worde (<hi>Soule</hi>) is taken for euery kinde of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as may appeare wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it saieth, that all the soules (that is, man and woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that were in the arke with Noe, were eight. And that all the soules of the house of Iacob, which cam in to Egipt were lxx. In which nombres it can not be denyed, but that ther were as holy and as spirituall persones, as any are or were in the kingdome of the bishop of Rome. And <hi>Chrisostome</hi> (a priest) expounding this texte (<hi>Let euery soule be subiecte to the higher powers</hi>) sayeth: yea if thow be an apostle, an euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, a prophet, or what so euer thow art: for this subiection destroieth not religion. So that it can not be denyed, but by this worde (<hi>Soule</hi>) is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, euery persone, and none excepted. Now touching this worde (<hi>Power</hi>) some wold haue it interpreted for all those persones that execute iustice, be he kai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, king, mayre, Sherif, constable, borseholder, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so lowe: and some wolde haue it to be interpreted only of kinges a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d chiefest officers. But it is here to be

            <p>Neither is that power and authoritie which kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, princes, and other ministres of iustice exercice, only called a power: but also thauthoritie that paren tes haue ouer their children, and maisters ouer their seruauntes, is also called a power: and neither be the parentes nor maisters the power it self, but they be inistres and executours of the power, being geuen

               <hi>depende on thautoritie of the lawes.</hi> And certainly it is more honour than the honour of the empire, to submitte the principalitie vnto the lawes. For in dede lawes be made, that the wilfull self will of men should not rule, but that they should haue a line to leade them, as they might not goo out of the waie of iustice: and that (if any wolde saie, they did them wrong) they might alledge the lawe for their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt and autoritie. It is also a principle of all lawes grounded on the lawe of nature, that euery man should vse himself and be obedient to that lawe, that he will others be bounden vnto. For otherwise he taketh awaye that equalitie (for ther is no difference betwene the head and foote, concerning the vse and benefite of the lawes) wherby common wealthes be maintened and kept vp. What equalitie (I beseche you) should ther be, wher the subiecte should doo to his ruler all the ruler wolde: and the ruler to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte, that the ruler lusted?</p>
            <p>The good emperour <hi>Traianus</hi> (whom for his iust behaueour, the Senate of Rome toke to be a God) being in possession of his office, and minding to shewe, that he was not ordained to be a tiranne, but to see the people well gouerned, and that, albeit he was the minister of the lawes, yet was he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to the lawes, toke a sweorde, and gaue it to the Captain of the horsemen, and saied: <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this sweorde, use it for me against</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15453:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Zaleuchus</hi> the ruler and maker of lawes to the <hi>locres,</hi> whan he made this lawe, that an aduoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should be punished with the losse of bothe his eies, and his sonne hade offended the same, albeit the people made great intercession, that his paines might be pardoned him, he wold not consent vnto it, but pul ling out one of his sonnes eies, to fulfill and kepe the lawe, he suffred one of his owne eies also to be pulled out.</p>
            <p>But thow wilt saie: What haue we to doo with Ethnikes? Why should we be ordred by Ethnikes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges? I answer, that whan Ethnikes doo by nature that thow art bounden also to doo, not only by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the lawes of God and man, such Ethni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes shall ryse in the vniuersal iudgement, to accuse the, and worke thy condemnacion. The bishop of Romes lawes (which albeit he vse not in him self, yet will he haue them practiced in others) saye thus: <hi>It is requisite and iust, that a prince obeie his owne lawes. For than maie he loke that others shall kepe his lawes, whan he him self hathe them in honour. Iustice will, that princes be obedient aud boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to their owne lawes, and that they can not in their owne doinges condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>

               <hi>those lawes which they prescribe unto others. Thauthoritie of their sayeng is iust and indifferent, if that thei suffre not them selues to doo that they prohibite unto their people.</hi> This saieth the bishop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes lawe. And vpon this principle after in the great general counsail of <hi>Lateran,</hi> Which pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the thirde helde, it may seme, it was ordained and decreed (as they saie) that whan kinges and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that knowlaged no superiour, should fall out among them selues, or should misuse their power and autoritie ouer their subiecttes, that than the matier should be hearde a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d corrected by the bishop of Rome</p>
            <p>But here it maie be asked, who did this iustice on kinges and princes before that time, sith it was but than co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the bishop of Rome? To that at this time we shall not nede to answer, for that we doo not seke prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to knowe who should be iudge, but onely to declare and proue, that kinges and princes ought, bothe by Goddes lawe, the lawe of nature, mannes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and good reason, to be obedient and subiecte to the positiue lawes of their countrey, and maie not breake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them, and that they be not exempt from them, nor maie dispense with them, onles the makers of the lawes geue them expresse autoritie so to doo.</p>

            <p>Thus they goo about to bleare mennes eies to con firme and encreace their deuillishe kingdome. But popis he prelates practices are no warraunt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a christian mannes conscience. He must seke what God will haue him doo, and not what the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie and viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of wicked men will force him to doo. He maye not robbe petre to clothe Paule, nor take from God his due to geue it vnto ciuile power: neither maie he make confusion of the powers, but yelde vnto euery one that is his due, nor yet obeyeng the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours commaundement, leaue the commaundement of the highest vndone. <hi>Yelde vnto Cesar, those thinges that be Cesares</hi> (sayeth Christ) <hi>and vnto God, those thinges that be Goddes.</hi> Ciuile power is a power and ordinaunce of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to certain thinges, but no general minister ouer all thinges. God hathe not geuen it power ouer the one and the best parte of man, that is, the soule and conscience of man, but onely ouer the other and the worst part of man, that is, the body, and those thinges that belong vnto this temporall life of man.</p>
            <p>And yet ouer that parte with thappurtenaunces hathe he not only not geuen man the hole power, and
<pb facs="tcp:15453:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
stripped him self quite of all thautoritie, but also he hathe reserued to him self the power therof. For we reade, that whan ciuile power (his minister) hathe ben necligent in doing his duetie, or winked at the euil life of the people, God hathe not holden his hande, but hathe whipped and plagued suche people, as he did the Sodomites, Gomorrianes, and diuerse tymes the Iewes.</p>
            <p>And in our dayes his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de is not shortened but he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the and daily dothe plage blasphemours, hooremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, dronkerdes, murtherours, theues, traitours, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannes, suche as in mannes sight no man durst or at the least wolde touche: som with incurable plages of their bodye, some with losse of their children, some with losse of their goodes, and some with shamefull deathes.</p>
            <p>And contrary wise whan the worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers haue violently, tyrannously, ouer sharply, and wrongfully oppressed and condemned innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, God (to testifie that he hathe also power of the body) hathe many tymes in all ages myghtily and miraculously deliuered his people from the power of tyrannes: as the Israelites from Pharao, Mardocheus from A man, Susanna from the lecherous iudges: Sedrach Mesach, and Abednego sro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the burnyng ouen: Daniel from the lyons denne, Petre from Herode, and infinite other examples we

            <p>God is the highest power, yea the power of powers, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him is deriued all power. All people be his seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

S.

Men must be sub iecte, not only for feare of punishement, but also for conscience sake. For not to obeye the power, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth the good and vertuous, and punisheth the euil and wicked, is deadly synne, And the self same also S. Petreteacheth. Wherfore the marke that all men ought to shoote at, is to doo good, and in no wise to doo euil, whoso euer commaundeth it.

maunde any thing that should be contrary to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, they should not passe theron, but that rather they should thinke, it was stollen or forged without his knowlage, considering that the prince or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is nothing elles but the minister of the lawes. And this same saieng of this most noble king semed to be so iuste and reasonable, that it is taken for a com mon principle, how subiectes should knowe, whan they should doo that they be commaunded, and whan they ought not.</p>
            <p>Likewise a bishop of Rome, called <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, wrote to an Archebishop, to doo a thing which semed to the Archebishop to be vnreasonable and contrary to the lawes, the pope perceauing that tharbishop was offended with his writing, and wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de not doo that he required: desired him not to be off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This is a popes saie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: which who is so hardy dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to denie to be of lesse autoritie than a lawe? yea not felowe, but aboue Goddes worde?

<pb facs="tcp:15453:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be obeied, but with standen. For the subiectes ought not (against nature) to further their owne destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to seke their owne saluacion: not to maintene euil but to suppresse euil: for not only the doers but also the consentours to euil, shalbe punished, saie bothe Goddes and mannes lawes. And men ought to haue more respecte to their countrey, than to their prince: to the common wealthe, than to any one persone. For the countrey and common wealthe is a degree aboue the king. Next vnto God men ought to loue their countrey, and the hole common wealthe before any membre of it: as kinges and princes (be they neuer so great) are but membres: and common wealthes mai stande well ynough and floris he, albeit ther be no kinges, but contrary wise without a common wealthe ther can be no king. Common wealthes and realmes may liue, whan the head is cut of, and may put on a newe head, that is, make them a newe gouernour, whan they see their olde head seke to muche his owne will and not the wealthe of the hole body, for the which he was only ordained. And by that iustice and lawe, that lately hathe ben excuted in Englande (if it maie be called iustice and lawe) it should appeare, that the ministers of ciuile power doo somtimes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that, that the subiectes ought not to doo.</p>

For the princes (doo they the worst they can) can but take from men their goodes and liues: but God can take from vs bothe goodes and bodie, and cast bothe body and soule in to hell.

And besides also they ought to considre, that princes be ordained for the wealthe and benefite of the people, and not to their destruction: to maintene common wealthes, and not to subuerte them: which rather than any man should consent vnto, he ought (being a faithfull ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his countrey) to abide all losses, bothe of body and goodes.

            <p>But ther be some in these daies, not of the meanest or poorest sorte, but of the chiefest and richest: that is, many wicked gouernours and rulers, who in this errour excell the common Anabaptistes. For the common Anabaptistes doo not onely take other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes goodes as common, but are content to let their owne also be common, which hathe som smacke of Charitie: for they them selues doo non other, but that they them selues are content to suffre.</p>
            <p>But the euil gouernours and rulers will haue all that their subiectes haue, common to them selues, but they themselues will departe with nothing, but wher they ought not: no, not so muche as paie for those thinges, that in wordes they pretende to buie of their subiectes, nor paie those poore men their wages,
<pb facs="tcp:15453:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom they force to labour and toyle in their workes. But the maner of coming therby is so diuerse, that it maketh the iustenesse of their doinges muche suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. For some doo it vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se to doo the people good: some by craftie and subtil meanes, colour their doinges: and some of right (but without right) claime them for their owne.</p>
            <p>Of the furst sort be those, that put great taxes and imposiciones on drinke for forasmuch as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with ouermuch drinking become dronkerdes (and so sinne against God) they wolde seme by making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paye asmuche or more to them as the drinke is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, they should force them the rather to absteyne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouermuche drinking, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d so from sinne.

            <p>This pece of scripture is their clooke: but it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no more a kinges wicked doinges, than that of the wicked sonnes of Eli, and the sacrisicers (whome men call priestes) to take out of mennes pottes, what pece them lusted, or to take their porcion rawe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Goddes ordinaunce. For as in thone place it is called the right or lawe of the king: so is it in the other place called the right or lawe of the priestes.
<pb facs="tcp:15453:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But in nother of these places it is called the lawe or right that God appoited to kinges or priestes, which he set out in other places, but suche is they wolde vsurpe ouer the people. Nother will this mayntene the purpose, that here he speaketh of a king and not of a tyranne, for at the first a kinges name was as odious, and as muche abhorred, as a tyrannes. But this was spoken of the prophet Samuel to feare the people, that they should not goo about to altre the ordre and policie that God had ordayned: which if they did, they should fele what a plague it were to haue a king geuen in Goddes furie. And if they had onely sought to be ruled by one (as partly in this, that one alone ruleth, a king do the diffre from other gouernours) they wolde haue ben content with Samuel alone, who as he was appointed by God to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le alone ouer the Israelites, so did he exercite and vse his office most vprightly: but they wolde nedes haue a galaunt and pompous king, one that should ryde out with his trompettes before him, a great trope of horsemen before and behinde him, his garde all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in silke with their halbeardes about hym, and eueri one to fall flatte to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de that should me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te him, as the Gentiles hade, who were in dede ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannes, as appeareth by the first called <hi>Nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> who for his rebellion against God, and deuourig of Goddes people, was called the stowte

huntour before or against God. And in the same king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of the Israelites God shewed by an euident ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to all gouernours, that he did not allowe suche right, as the prophet sayed, the king wolde vse ouer his subiectes. For whan king Achab wolde ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bought of his subiecte <hi>Naboth</hi> his vineyorde (which he neded not to haue done, if the subiectes goods be the ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges) a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he refused to sel it, as he might doo, for by Goddes lawe he had a propretie therin, from which without his will and consent, he could not be forced to departe, the king fretted so muche bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se he could not haue his will, that he fell sicke in his bedde, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wolde not eate.

What (sayeth she) be you a mete man to be a king ouer Israel, that will suffre suche dishonour at your slaues handes, one that bi your auncient prerogatiue which hathe continued thes hundred and three sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re yeares, yea from the first king of Israel) ye maye vse in body and goodes, as pleaseth you?

requireth to cause Naboth to be endyted and con demned for an heretike and a traitour: and so to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se him to be stoned to deathe. Her will is furthewith satisfied, matier ynough against Naboth prisoner at the Barre, bicause she wold so haue it: no man might be admitted nor durst speake the truthe in the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cause, least they had ben clapped fast and trussed vp also for speaking against the king and Quene: no queste durst quite him, for fear of kissing the flete: no lawes, no equitie, no iustice might defende the poore innocent. So the vineiorde is the kinges by the ordre of lawe. Those newes be caried in post to Iesable, she sheweth them to her husbande, wherwith he (as sone as he hearde them) was recouered, and goeth to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke possession of the vineiorde. But what foloweth this crueltie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie? Are not bothe the kinges Maiestie and the Quenes highnesse within while after killed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their blood licked vp of dogges, according as the Prophet declared to hi in the vineyorde, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he toke possession of it? and all his house so destroied, that ther was not lefte therof so muche as a dogge to pisse against the wall? Thus ye maie see thende of lustie lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and ladies that will haue their lustes a lawe, and their will to be folowed and obeied of their subiectes as a right in dede. The true right and prerogatiue of a king was written in a particular boke by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Samuel, and laied vp by the Arke, which boke (among many other) was loste, yet who so lusteth to
<pb facs="tcp:15453:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knowe it, maie see it set out by God i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the boke of Deu teronomie. After that God had prescribed who shold be their king, that is, no aliene or straunger, but one of their owne brethren: for naturally straungers doo not fauour straungers. And a straunge prince seketh by all meanes to destroy the natural inborne, that he maie with quietnesse and suretie enioie and vse that he cometh euil by, and so leaue it to his succession: than is set furthe the right and prerogatiue of a king thus. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your king is made, he shall not kepe many horses, nor putting his trust in his horsemen, he shall not bring the people again into Egipte. He shall not haue many wiues, least they altre his minde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: nother yet great treasure of siluer a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d golde. But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is set in his throne, he shall cause a copie of these lawes and statutes to be written out of thoriginal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with the Leuites, and the same he shall haue with hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the daies of his life, that he maie learne to feare the lorde his God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to kepe (not to breake) all the wordes and ceremonies that be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in the lawe, and also to fulfill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his doinges: And he shal not be prowde and hault ouer his brethren, neither shall he swarue from the lawe towarde the right han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de or lifte hande, that he and his children maie long reigne ouer Israel. But besides this lawe appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for all kinges, he that wilbe accompted a christian king or gouernour, must remembre, that he is a christian man, and that bi being made a king, he is not exempt from
<pb facs="tcp:15453:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the lawes and duetie of a christen ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which eueri one professeth in Baptisme: but as he is called and exalted aboue the rest of his brethren, so should he be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to them of good lyuing and vertue, in obserui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the lawe, which saieth aswell to kinges as to beggers: Thou shalt not steale, thou shalt not couet any thing that is thy neighbours: and so it stablisheth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that euery one maie iustly kepe that is his owne, and none maie take it from him by ani meane against his will, be it king or kaiser.</p>
            <p>And by the doinges of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who albeit he were not a king in name, yet hade he (being the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt and viceroie to God the chief king) as great autoritie as any king in the earthe: it maie appeare, that all thinges of the subiectes be not the kinges ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne propre. For if they had ben his owne, what neded Samuel (at the surrendre of his office) to offre to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an accompt? And to whom, I praie you? To any bribing Auditour?

Wolde they desire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace the worlde with children, whan they knewe that they should be lefte in worse case, than vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable beastes? No surely, and that ye maie see by the worke of nature in the people of the <hi>West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> now called <hi>newe Spain:</hi> Who knewe of Christ nothing at all, and of God no more than nature taught them. The people of that countreie whan the catholike Spaniardes came thider, were simple and plaine men, and liued without great labour, the lande was naturally so pleintiful of all thinges, and
<pb facs="tcp:15453:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continually the trees hade ripe frute on them. Whan the Spaniardes hade by flatterie put in their foote, and by litel and litel made them selues stong, building fortes in diuerse places, they to get the golde that was ther, forced the people (that were not vsed to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) to stande all the daie in the hotte sunne gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring golde in the sande of the riuers. By this meanes a great nombre of them (not vsed to suche paines) died, and a great nombre of them (seing them selues brought from so quiet a life to suche miserie and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie) of desperacion killed them selues. And many wolde not mary, bicause they wolde not haue their children slaues to the Spaniardes. The women whan they felte them self with childe, wolde eat a certain herbe to destroie the childe in the wombe. So that where at the comming thider of the Spaniardes, ther were accompted to be in that countrey nine hundred thousaunt persones, ther were in short time by this meanes so sewe lefte, as <hi>Petre martir</hi> (who was one of themperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifthes counsail the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and wrote this historie to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour) saieth, it was a shame for him to name.</p>

            <p>Now forasmuche as ther is no expresse positiue lawe for punishement of a Tyranne among christen men, the question is, whether it be laufull to kill su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a monstre and cruell beast couered with the shape of a man.</p>
            <p>And first for the better and more playne profe of this mater, the manifolde and continuall examples that haue ben from tyme to tyme of the deposing of kinges, and killing of tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, doo most certainly con firme it to be most true, iust and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sonaunt to Goddes iudgement. The historie of kinges in the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is full of it. And as Carnal Phoole truly citeth, England lacketh not the practice and experience of the same. For they depriued king Edwarde the secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, bicause without lawe he killed his subiectes, spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them of their goodes, and wasted the treasure of the Realme. And upon what iust causes Richard the the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de was thrust out, and He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the fourth put in his place, I referre it to their owne iudgement.

               <hi>Zacharias</hi> the pope that inuented first the lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes in the churche, deposed <hi>Chilperichus,</hi> king of Fraunce, bicause he was sayed to be a lecherous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone, and an unprofitable gouernour of the realme: and forced him to be a monke, and made <hi>Pipine</hi> (father of Charles) king of Fraunce.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Honorious</hi> (as ye hearde before) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that the king of Vngarie should be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, bicause he diminished the rightes of the Crowne: onles he repented, and vndid all that he had done.</p>
            <p>A certayn king of <hi>Portugale</hi> was very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his office: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wasted awaye the trea sure of his Realme, he oppressed his subiectes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d misu sed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But the Popes learned counsail saied, that he ought to haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly deposed of the Crow ne. These doinges of Popes I rehearse not, as though their usurped autoritie were to be allowed, but for that ye maye see, that it is no newe thing to depose euil kinges a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gouernours: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that those that haue the iust autoritie, maie and ought for the like causes, doo as they did.

honest and iust, and mete to be receaued and executed among reasonable creatures. And this lawe of nature to depose and punishe wicked gouernours, hathe not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only receaued a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d exerciced in politike maters, but also in the churche. For the canonistes (the popes ow ne championes) grounding them selues upon this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we of nature, saye, that popes who maye be in dede (by their saieng) the lieutenauntes of the deuil, albeit they call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues the uicares of God, maie be depryued by the body of the churche. And so at one clappe, in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sail holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in Germanie, in the yeare of our lorde 1415. were three popes popped out of their places, Gregory, Iohn, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Benet, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the fourthe (called Martin the fifthe) chosen. Afterwarde in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sail of Basil was Pope Eugenius serued with that sawce. For the unluckinesse of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey the rest of Popes haue sith refused that any general counsail should be kept in Germany, fearing least they all hauing deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as muche as the other foure deposed, should haue the like punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And thus they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme their doin ges. If (saye they) the Pope hade not a superiour, he might beig suffred in his euil, brig the churche to de structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore if he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not otherwise be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught to amende him self, it is laufull to use the lawe of nature, that is, to remoue him from his office: for he is no bishop or pope, that abuseth his Popedome and bishopriche. An euil prelate a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d unreformable semeth not to be ordayned by the will of God, saie the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes, alledgeing the wordes of S.

               <pb facs="tcp:15453:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the saye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the prophet Osee, that a prince or iudge is not alwayes ordayned by God. And he bringeth for example king Saul, against whom God sayed: Seing the people haue made them selues a king, and not a ruler by me, and not by my counsail: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet God hade chosen Saul. But yet bycause he was not chosen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, but according to the myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and desartes of the synfull people, God denyed him to be ordayned by his will or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sail. The Canonistes also saie, that albeit the Popedome be by the lawe of God (as it is not in dede, sayeth the truthe) yet that this man or that, Paule or Iulie is pope, it cometh by the acte of man. For the Cardinales representing the uniuersal churche, chose him. And therfore if he be not according to the will of God, and for the wealthe of the uniuersal churche, that is: if he be not one that seketh Goddes glorie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the wealthe of christes chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, he maye be iustly depryued, bycause they erred in chosing him. And God semeth not to be agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the put ting out of suche an euil persone, but to fauour and further it. For he sayed: If the salt be unsauerie, it is good for no use, but to be cast out, and troden under foote of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: If thi right eie be a let unto thee, pul it out, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cast it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee. For it is better that one me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre perish, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the hole bodi should be cast in to hell. And agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saie the Canonistes (the popes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers) in rehearcei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Christes words: If our eie, foote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vs, let it be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest of the bodi: for it is better to lacke me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this woorld, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that

thei should cari the rest of the body in to hell. By salt, eie, foote, and hande, is vnderstanden the headdes and rulers, and not the other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres and subiectes. And not only the headdes and rulers in the churche, but also in all policies and common wealthes.</p>
            <p>Now if it be laufull for the body of the churche to depose and punishe a Pope, being the chief priest, anointed not on the arme or sholder, as kinges be, but on the head and handes, to declare an higher au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie than kinges haue: nor crowned with a simple crowne, as Emperours a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d kinges be, but with a triple crowne, to shewe his Regalitie and power aboue all others: how muche more by the like argumentes, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones and autoritie, maie Emperours, kinges, princes and other gouernours abusing their office, be deposed and remoued out of their places and offices, bi the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or state of the Realme or common wealthe?</p>
            <p>By this lawe and argumentes of the Canonistes and example of depriuacion of a Pope, are all clokes (wherwith Popes, bishoppes, priestes, kaisers and kin ges vse to defende their iniquitie) vtterly taken awaie. Saie they: We are anointed, ye maie not touche vs: We are only subiecte to God, and eueri man to vs. God will haue vs (O most wiked popes, bishoppes, priestes, cruell and euil princes) reigne to plage you people, for your iniquitie.</p>
            <p>But here ye see, the body of euery state maie (If it will) yea and ought to redresse and correcte the vices
<pb facs="tcp:15453:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and headdes of their gouernours. And forasmuche as ye haue allready sene, wherof politike power and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement groweth, and thende wherunto it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained: and seing it is before manifestly and sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued, that kinges and princes haue not an absolute power ouer their subiectes: that they are and ought to be subiecte to the lawe of God, and the holsome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue lawes of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey: and that they maie not laufully take or vse their subiectes goods at their plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure: the reasones, argumentes and lawe that serue for the deposing a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d displacei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of an euil gouernour, will doo as muche for the proofe, that it is laufull to kill a tiranne, if they maie be indifferently hearde. As God hathe ordained Magistrates to heare and determine priuate mennes matiers, and to punishe their vices: so also will he, that the magistrates doinges be called to accompt and reckoning, and their vices corrected and punished by the body of the hole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregacion or common wealthe.</p>
            <p>As it is manifest by the memorie of the auncient office of the highe Constable of Englande, vnto who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se autoritie it perteined, ont only to summone the king personally before the parliament or other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of iudgement (to answer and receaue according to iustice) but also vpon iuste occasion to committe him vnto warde.</p>
            <p>Kinges, Princes and gouernours haue their auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb facs="tcp:15453:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the people, as all lawes, vsages and policies doo declare and testifie.</p>
            <p>For in some places and countreies they haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and greater autoritie, in some places lesse. And in some the people haue not geuen this autoritie to any other, but reteine and exercice it themselues. And is any man so vnreasonable to denie, that the hole maie doo as muche as they haue permitted one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre to doo? or those that haue appointed an office vpon trust, haue not autoritie vpon iuste occasion (as the abuse of it) to take awaie that they gaue? All la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes doo agree, that men maie reuoke their proxies and lettres of Attournaie, whan it pleaseth them: mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che more whan they see their proctours and attour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naies abuse it.</p>
            <p>But now to proue the later parte of this question affirmatiuely, that it is laufull to kill a tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne: ther is no man can denie, but that the Ethnikes (albeit they had not the right and perfite true knowlage of God) were endued with the knowlage of the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>For it is no priuate lawe to a fewe or certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but common to all: not written in bokes, but graffed in the heartes of men: not made by man, but ordained of God: which we haue not learned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued or redde, but haue taken, sucked, and drawne it out of nature: wherunto we are not taught, but made: not instructed, but seasoned: and

            <p>Kinges, Princes and other gouernours, albeit they are the headdes of a politike body, yet they are not the hole body. And though they be the chief membres, yet they are but membres: nother are the people ordained for them, but they are ordained for the people.</p>

And to encourage men to entreprise to kill a tiranne, they estemed the dede to be worthy so great rewarde, that they thought him worthy perdone that killed a tiranne, though he had killed his owne naturall father before. And besides this, whan they sawe, that tirannes vsed to haue their bodies defended with great garisones and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of forain people, or kept them selues in strong holdes and secret chambres, so as none without great hasarde and peril might come vere them: they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouned

great rewardes to him that should destroie a tiranne. Nother thought they rewardes or giftes to be a sufficient recompence for so vertuous an acte, but they vsed also to make the ymage of him that killed a tiranne, in brasse: and to set it vp in the most solemne place of the citie, for a perpetual memorie of the acte, the commendacion of the doer, and thencourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others to doo the like.

So that this principle that euil a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euil doers ought to be punished, and rotten membres to be cut awaie, was no peculiar lawe of the Ethnikes, but it procedeth of nature, and therfore common to all men, as it is plaine by the Chronicles and experience of all ages, and purposely exemplified for our sure staie and learning as wel in the boke of Iudges, as in many other histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of holy scriptures, according to the expresse worde and commaundement (applied to this sense and meaning) which saieth: <hi>Let euil be taken out</hi>

What oppressing of the poore, what robbing of the riche, what taking vp of corne and vitail for the king and his strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, and no money paied for it, what taxes and paimentes the people were yowked withall, what rauishing of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wiues, daughters and seruauntes, what heading and hanging of the natural Israelites to make the straungers lordes and gentilmen, what common mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and continual calamities ther were during that space, no doubt it is vnspeakeable.</p>
            <p>But what remedy? No man durst make moane to his neighbour for feare of bewraieng, none durst ones whistre against the king, they must bende or breake, no remedy, pacience perforce, all were faine to serue and please king Eglon.

            <p>Now, was this well done or euil? For so the the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de is so commended in scripture, that the holy goost reporteth Ahud to be a saueour of Israel.</p>
            <p>But note by the waie, the texte saieth not, that Ahud was sent of the people to kill the king, nor that he tolde them what he intended: for by that meane, one Iudas or other wolde haue betraied him, and so should he haue ben drawen, hanged and quarted for his entreprise, and all his conspiratours haue lost bothe life, landes and goodes for their conspiracie.</p>
            <p>Only the scripture saieth, that Ahud (being a priuate persone) was stered vp only by the spirite of God.</p>
            <p>Likewise whan <hi>Sisara</hi> lieutenaunt general of king Iabins warres fleing from Barac sought succour to hide his head, hauing long noied and hurt Israel with oppression and warres, a woman named Iael cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him in to her house, and hidde him vnder a Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

No in dede, he was excellent in that feate, as it well appeared. For whan he had wrought and made sure the great mariage to auoide the hatred of the people, he made his scholar to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, and to haue the outwarde thankes. And no maruail of his conning. For he was his maister, and hade studied longer the arte, than the proctour, and hade a better witte, and spent yearly the halfe of his bishopriche in bribing, or elles he had lost his head long before: for his treasones were not alltogether vnknowem, albeit they were couered and hidden.</p>

            <p>But forasmuche as all these fetches and practices be only made and laied to disceaue those that be honest, faithfull, true, and natural to their countreie: it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to treate how they maie be auoided. Deceat wold not be knocked out with deceat, if it might so be, but honest men should alwaies and at all times

deale plainly and honestly. And therfore the honestest meane before thinges be done, is to be wise and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspecte: and to forsee thende, what mischief maie folowe, before they sodainly, rashely and vnaduisedly consent to ani thing. To vse suche honest wisdom and forsight, is permitted bothe by Goddes worde and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yea Goddes worde and nature commaunde ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men to vse it. For those thinges that can but ones be done, and wheron so great weigh thangeth, ought to be well done. Therfore men ought not to geue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to faire wordes, large promises, and great othes (for these are the instrumentes to deceaue the honest and well meaning) but the fairer the wordes be, the larger the promises, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the greater the othes, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to suspecte.
