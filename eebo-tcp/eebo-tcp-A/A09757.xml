         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Sermon preached at Saint Maryes

            <head>To the most noble and
vvorshipfull Knight, my
honourable good Patron, Sir
George Carey, Knight Marshall of her
Maiesties most honourable housholde, and
gouernour of her Ile of Wight, all
ioyes, externall, internall,

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, as soone as I had
preached this Sermon,
it pleased the L. Bishop
of London last decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
both by his letter,
and by word of mouth,
to request a copie of it for the presse. The
like did diuers other also. But in trueth I
had then no coppy of it. Or if I had beene
possessed of any, yet I was resolute to yeeld
to no such motion. VVhich some (I knowe
not who) vnderstanding, that being by so
many, and so many times importuned, to
<pb facs="tcp:3737:3"/>
print this, or some other Sermon, I alwaies
vtterly refused so to doe, haue presumed to
print the <hi>Meane in Mourning;</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without true iudgement, or calling me
to counsell therein. And that so falselie,
and in most places so quite contrary to my
meaning, that I may say to him, whosoeuer
was the procurer thereof, as <hi>Martiall</hi> the
Poet sayd to one,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quem recitas meus est, ô Fidentine, libellus:</l>
               <l>Sed male dum recitas, incipit esse tuus.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>O Fidentine, a booke of mine</l>
               <l>Thou printst against my will;</l>
               <l>And yet not mine, but it is thine</l>
               <l>Because thou printst it ill.</l>
            </q>
            <p>VVhen in the triumph of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
the Romains had carried about the modell
of those Citties, which hee had subdued,
grauen in yuorie, and not long after in the
triumph of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> they shewed
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> description of his Citties, carued in
woode: <hi>Chrysippus</hi> beholding the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
saide merrily, that <hi>Fabius</hi> citties
were but the sheathes of <hi>Caesars</hi> Citties.
And certes I may be bold to auerre, that as
much diuersitie as there is betweene yuorie
<pb facs="tcp:3737:3"/>
and woode: so much there is betweene that
Sermon which was first once preached, &amp;
that which was afterward twise printed.
For those two editions were but woodden
sheathes. Or if there were any mettall in
them, yet it had not an yuorie but a dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
haft, beeing blunt and dull, without
any poynt or edge.</p>
            <p>Therefore after I was, not onely perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the aduise of all my friendes, but
euen enforced by the necessitie of the thing
it selfe, to print that Sermon as it was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
I thought good likewise to let this goe
with it. That as the grauer of images in
<hi>Aesop</hi> telleth <hi>Mercurie,</hi> if hee would giue
a groate for the image of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> hee
should haue his owne image for nothing:
so if any one who hath cast away his mony
vpon the former editions, will bestowe a
groate vpon the true copie now sette out by
my selfe, hee may haue this sermon with it
for nothing, in surplussage ouer and besides
the bargaine. VVhich if it shall please you
out of your true woorth fauourably to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronise
and protect, then all that reape anie
benefit by perusing it, shall haue good cause
to honour your most noble minde, by whose
munificence and bountie my studies haue
beene hetherto continued. And so crauing
<pb facs="tcp:3737:4"/>
your honourable acceptance of my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
endeuours I humbly take my leaue.
From Saint Iohns Colledge in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge

            <p>RIght Honourable, right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull,
and most Christian
and blessed brethren; perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is all in all. The onely thing
in euery thing. But that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
is like eyther the vntimely
birth of a woman, or else the vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fruire of a tree. The one dying
before it be borne, the other rotting
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3737:6"/>
before it be ripe. Therefore it is sayd
of the lawe,<note n="a" place="margin">He. 7. v. 19</note> That it made nothing
perfect: but of the Gospell,<note n="b" place="margin">Ih<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. 13.</note> that it
is most perfect in it selfe. And of the
tower of Babell,<note n="c" place="margin">Lu. 14. 30.</note> these men began
well to build, yet could not perfect it:
but of the frame of the world,<note n="d" place="margin">Ge. 1. v. 1.</note> thus
the heauen and the earth were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
finished, yea so perfectly, that
euery thing since which hath had any
little resemblance of this perfection,
is sayd to be as perfect as God made
the world. Now of all things in the
world, man especially is borne, not
to dye, as an vntimely birth, but to
liue: and man liueth, not to rotte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
as vntimely fruite, but to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for euer. Therefore we that doe
not dye vnder the law, but liue vnder
grace,<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 9. 14</note> must not be lyke the law, but
like the Gospell: and we which shall
not rotte away as the Tower of Babel,
but flourish for euer, as the building
of God,<note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 9</note> must not be lyke the tower
of Babell, but lyke the frame of the
world; labouring continually to be
perfect, as our heauenly Father is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3737:6"/>
perfect.<note n="g" place="margin">Mar. 5. 48.</note> Labour, I say, we must:
for as nothing is excellent, and easie
both together; in lyke sort perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though it be so excellent a thing,
that it ought to be much desired, yet
it is not so easie a thing, that it can be
soone attayned. Therefore sayes the
Apostle in the former verse, I do not
thinke that I haue yet attayned to it.
For, sayes Bernard:<note n="h" place="margin">Quomodo proficis si, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>icis?</note> Howe canst
thou possibly be a proficient, if thou
thinke thy selfe already sufficient?
The arke of the couenant was but a
Cubit and a halfe high.<note n="i" place="margin">Exo. 25. 10. i1. Ki. 7. 32</note> So likewise
the wheeles of the Cauldron were
but a Cubit and a halfe high. Nowe
we know that a Cubite and a halfe is
an vnperfect measure, which shewes
that none in this life are perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The verie highest are, as the
Arke in Moyses tabernacle, or as the
wheeles in Salomons temple, but a
Cubite and a halfe high:<note n="k" place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnperfect when they begin: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly
perfect when they end. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naiah
was honourable among thirtie,
but he attained not to the first three:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3737:7"/>
               <note n="l" place="margin">1. Sa. 3, 23.</note> And so some one man may bee as
perfect as thirtie, yea, as a thousand
other men, and yet not attayne to
the perfection of the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which is the first three. Nay
when we haue done the best we can,
we are but vnprofitable Seruants<note n="m" place="margin">Lu. 17. 10.</note>.
All our righteousnesse is as a stayned
cloth<note n="n" place="margin">Esa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 64. 5</note>. Our greatest strength is

that remember &amp; hearken after their

said, he had rather learne the Art
of forgetfulnes, then of memory. That
is, as I vnderstand it, rather diuinity,
then philosophy. For philosophy is an
Art of memory, but diuinity is an Art
of forgetfulnes. Therfore the first les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that Socrates taught his Scholler
was, <hi>Remember</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Reminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</note>. For he thought that
knowledge is nothing els but a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of those things to remembrance

Lo yee how true it is which I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that if wee remember our good
workes, then God will forget them;
but if we <hi>Forget</hi> them, then God will
remember them; yea &amp; he wil reward
them when we haue forgotten them.
If we wage warre with God<note n="l" place="margin">Lu. 14, 31</note>, &amp; think
to ouercome him with ten thousand
of our good deeds, then will he like a
puisant Prince, bring forth into the
field a huge army of our sins, twentie
thousand of our sins against vs, and
with twenty thousand of our sins will
easily ouerthrow ten thousand of our
good deedes, and so finally confound
vs. But if one the other side wee can
bee content to <hi>Forget</hi> all our good
workes; and to strowe our best gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and our most florishing bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
at Christs feete<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 21, 8</note>; and to cast
downe our verie crownes before the
throane of the Lambe<note n="n" place="margin">Reu. 4, 10</note>, then he will
be a right Lambe indeed, hee will not
fight with vs, but hee will crowne vs
with honour &amp; glory. Almighty God
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3737:17"/>
appoynted his people not to sheare
the first borne of the sheepe<note n="o" place="margin">De. 15. 16</note>. The
first borne of the sheepe are the best
of our good works. These we must
not sheare, nor lay naked and open to
the view and knowledge of all men,
but <hi>Forget</hi> them, and hide them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the fleece of silence, and keepe
them secret to our selues. So Ioseph,
whom God did lead as a sheepe<note n="p" place="margin">Psa. 80, 2</note>,
hauing a first borne, did not sheare
this first borne of the sheepe, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him Manasses, that is, <hi>Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
of those thinges which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
when God had now answered
the desires of his hart<note n="q" place="margin">Ecl. 5, 19</note>. The faithful
speaking to Christ say thus, wee will
make for thee borders of golde guilt
with siluer<note n="r" place="margin">Murenulas <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the fashion of the world. The fashion
of the world is to guild siluer with
gold, &amp; to put the best side outward.
But the faithfull guild gold with sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and put the best side inward. So
Moses hauing a glorius countenance,
did not set it out to the shew, but did
<hi>Forget</hi> it, and couered it with a vaile<note n="s" place="margin">Ex 34, 33.</note>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:3737:18"/>
Now, a glorious countenance coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a vaile, what is it else, but a
border of gold, guilt with siluer? But
we, we alas, for the most part, haue
such base mindes, that wee are scarce
worth the ground we goe vpon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We
doe not guild our borders of golde
with siluer; but wee sheare the first
borne of our sheepe. We do not cast
down our garments and our branches
and our crownes-before the throane
of the lamb, but we war against God
with tenne thousand of our good
works. Or rather indeed, which of vs
all can muster together so many good
works to fight for him? Nay, if wee
haue done one thing well, or one time
well, we think all is well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we need do
no more, we haue done good inough,
and oft inough. Yea, if others do not
commend vs also, we do so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
please our selues in it, that wee
are ready presently to prayse our
selues for it. But heere we may all of
vp learne true humility<note n="t" place="margin">Humilitas animi subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Leo.</note>, which is
true magnanimity of S. Paul. Paul had

Moses Arke had rings; and barres

Therefore we must so walke, as God

For they that wayte vpopn the Lord

Euen as Pindarus writeth that King

shall loose their strength, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before they were strong, now they
shall be weake: but they shall change
their strength (namelie, the vse of
their strength) that whereas before
they were strong, and did follow hard,

God.<note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 6. 19.</note> For God only it is which can

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3737:30"/>
there is a stone called <hi>Almacrasia,</hi>
which being molten becometh brasse.
But these words haue a far more hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

melt brasse out of a stone, when he
taketh the hart of a sinner which is as
hard as a stone, and melting it with
the holy Ghost, and with fire, dooth
afterward make it as tough as brasse.
This was seene in the conuersion of
Paul. For when Paul was made an

He was as hard as any stone, before
his conuersion, when he stoned Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen<note n="o" place="margin">Act. 7, 58</note>.
Hee was as tough as any

Iacob sayd, Beniamin shall be

was this Beniamin, because he was of
the tribe of Beniamin<note n="r" place="margin">Phil. 3. 5.</note>. Paul was

out threatning and slaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Paule in the morning deuoured
the pray, because in the beginning
of his dayes he wasted and deuoured
the Church of God as a pray<note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 1, 13</note>. Paul
in the euening deuided the spoile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the latter ende of his dayes,
he did <hi>Follow</hi> his calling hard, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
the word of God aright<note n="g" place="margin">2, Tim. 2, 15.</note>, of
which the Psalmist saies, I reioyce in
thy word, more then they which
haue found a great spoile. So that this
is no losse of strength, but onely a
change of strength. O blessed Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iamin!
O holy Apostle! Thou hast
now changed thy strength. Yea by
changing it thou hast much increased
it. For thou wert nothing so strong
before, as thou art now. Nothing so
strong before, being a ston, as thou art
now, being brasse. Nothing so strong
before, being a rauening wolf, as thou
art now, beeing a meeke lambe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so strong before, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3737:31"/>
Nothing so strong before, when thou

thou wilt needes <hi>Follow</hi> hard, and
runne ouer the whole world, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide

to preach the Gospell vnto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
So likewise Baruch was infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as the Hebrew word signifieth
<note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hekeriah.</hi> Nehemi. 3, 20.</note>, hee was (I say) inflamed, to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

After the same manner in Baruch his
heart, there were liuely and quicke
motions of the holy Ghost, which
did blowe coales, and stirre vp the
gift of GOD in him<note n="k" place="margin">2, Tim. 1, 6.</note>, which did
warme hys blood, and make hym
<hi>Followe</hi> the matter harde, beeing
wholly inflamed with a burning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to see the Cittie of GOD
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3737:32"/>
restored againe to her former glory.
So Abraham when the Angels came
to him<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 18, 7.</note>, made hast to runne to his
tent: &amp; his wife made hast to kneade
three measures of fine meale; and his
boy made hast to kill &amp; dresse a good

imployed in a godly mans house. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
and his wife, man &amp; woman;
Abraham and his boy, old and yong;
all make hast, and <hi>Follow</hi> hard. So
Dauid did runne the way of Gods
commaundements. Nay, no ordinary
pace would serue him, but hee must
needs daunce before the Arke. Yea,
his feete could not hold him, but hee
must needs haue wings as a Doue. O
that I had wings as a Doue (sayes he)
then would I flye and be at rest<note n="m" place="margin">Ps. 55, 6</note>.
Hee wisheth for winges, not that he
might first be at rest, and afterward
flye, but that he might first flye, and
afterward be at rest. That he might
first <hi>Follow</hi> hard, and flye vp with the
wings of faith, into the heauenly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice,
and afterward be at rest, and
settle there, in the tree of eternall life.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3737:32"/>
O that I had wings, that I had wings,
as a Doue (saies he) then would I flie,
would I flie, and be at rest. And so
must we after the example of Dauid,
of Abraham, of Baruch, of Paul, fight
for the faith which we haue receaued
<note n="n" place="margin">Iude, 1, 3</note>: &amp; striue to enter in at the straight

studie: and labour; and striue; and

            <p>TOuching the fift he sayes (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side

were better run, either too slowly, or
too fast in the way, then follow hard
out of the way. For the harder thou
followest out of the way, the further
thou runnest from the <hi>Marke.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the Apostle, after following
hard, addeth immediatly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Toward the

the matter. And consequently that

he which is not a skilfull <hi>Mark</hi>-man,

Therfore we must marke well, what

The word of the Lord endureth for

is the greatest felicity that man may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
by following hard towarde the

<hi>The prize of the high calling of God in

gallant wits in the world, could neuer
attaine to the true knowledge of perfect
blessednes. For following so many, they
could neuer finde any, but vanishing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

when they thought themselues wise
men they prooued in the end to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fooles<note n="e" place="margin">Ro. 1, 22</note>. Seeing this is the greatest
folly that can be, and a miserie of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
for a man but once to dreame of
so diuers and so contrary felicities. I will
touch but a few of them at this time.
And that very briefely. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

define perfect happines, to be <hi>an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Therefore as euerlasting death is the
greatest miserie, so euerlasting life is the
greatest felicity. VVhich iuerlasting life
being the perfect life, is not this present
life, nor in this present life, but the life to

speaking to God, O knit my hart vnto

we vsually reade it, O knit my hart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, that I may feare thy name, the
Chaldee paraphrast &amp; S. Ierom trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it, O make my heart but onely <hi>one</hi>
hart, that I may feare thy name. So that
a man cannot any way, so much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the feare of Gods name, which
is the beginning of all perfection, except
first his hart be made one in it selfe, and
one in GOD, that hee may principally
minde but <hi>one</hi> thing. Almighty God
concerning the East gate of the Temple
sayth thus, This gate shall be shut, and
shall not bee opened, and no man shall
enter by it, because the Lorde God of
Israell hath entred by it<note n="n" place="margin">Ezec. 44, 2</note>. Here-throgh
signifying, that although the heart of a
Christian, which is the temple of the
holy Ghost, may let many things enter
into it at other gates, yet it must keepe
the East gate, the most illuminate and
highest power &amp; part of it, continuallie
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3737:54"/>
shut against all men, yea against all the
world, and opened onely to one thing,
I meane to God, who hath already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into it, and enlightened it with his
spirit. That as at the window of Noahs
Arke, there entred in, no mist, no water,
nothing else but <hi>one</hi> thing onely, which

of humaine errors, no water of worldly
cares may enter in; but onely the light
of heauen, and a sanctified desire, to be
fast knit, and perfectly vnited, by faith
and loue to God. Hence it is that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
comming to talke with God vpon
the mountaine, was commaunded to
bring no man with him, but to come vp
himselfe alone<note n="p" place="margin">Ex. 24, 18.</note>. Nay more-ouer being
vpon the mountaine alone, he was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
and compassed about with a thick
cloude, which made him feare the name
of the Lord, and hooded him, as I may
say, in such sort, that hee could see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but <hi>one</hi> thing, which was God.
And therefore the Psalmist sayth, O
make my heart like Moses heart, when
he was vpon the mountaine: O make
my heart like the windowe of Noahs
Arke, and the East gate of the temple:
O make my heart but onely <hi>one</hi> heart,

For seeing Christ is nowe risen againe,
and ascended vp into heauen, which is

are two seuerall names, and yet they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

Now Iacob supplanting or wrastling is
a subiect or a seruant: Israell seeing or
beholding God, is a friend or a sonne.
This is confirmed by Baruch, saying<note n="k" place="margin">Baru. 3, 36</note>,

That which no mortall eye hath seene,
that we shall see. VVe shall see our own
selues sitting &amp; shining at the right hand
of the throne of Maiestie. VVe shal see
all our deere friends which we haue not
seene this many a day, embracing vs, &amp;
welcomming vs into Christs kingdom.
VVee shall see all the noble armie, of
Martyrs, of Apostles, of Prophets, of
Patriarkes, shouting day and night, and
singing out the praises of the lord. VVe
shall see all the inuincible hoast of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,

a counterfeit, but a shadow, in respect of
the bright-blazing beautie of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
spouse. For Christ Iesus is ten times
fairer, yea a hundred times fayrer, yea a
thousand times fayrer, yea ten hundred
thousand times fayrer, then all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men. So that if the whole beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
not onely of all men, but euen of all
this inferiour Globe, were put together
in one, yet it would not be any way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
not onely to Christs glorie, but
not so much as to the least glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3737:61"/>
in heauen. And yet all this is but the
outside of heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all thys wee shall see
with our bodily eye. The inside and the
insight is much more glorious. For the
least glorified body seeing innumerable
Saints and Angels more highly exalted
then he is, hath his ioy doubled, &amp; tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
&amp; beyond all measure multiplied,
when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidereth, that he is loued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably
more, by all of them, yea by
euery one of them, then hee can be by
himselfe. And therefore againe seeing
himselfe so deere vnto them, hee for his
parte likewise as a hote burning coale is
set on fire and inflamed with loue, and
the more he seeth any other excell him
in glory, the more doth he reioyce, and
is gladder of his glory, then his owne.
But now when hee lifteth vp his eyes to
the glorious Trinitie, and seeth how the
Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost,
doe eternally and perfectly loue and like
and enioye one another in surpassing
sweetnes and content, then all his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are swallowed vp in loue, all his
spirits are rauisht in delight, all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
are imparadized in pleasure. In so
much as if on the one side were layd the
loue of Christ as he is man, and of all the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3737:62"/>
Saints and Angels among themselues,
and on the other side, the loue which the
least glorified body in heauen behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the blessed Trinitie breatheth out
to GOD, this loue would without all
comparison excell &amp; exceed that as far,
as light doth darknes, or as heauen doth
the earth. VVherefore for man to see
God; for Iacob to be called Israel; for
him that hath bin a seruant, to becom a
sonne; for him that hath kept the lawe,
to enioy the testament; is the highest
degree to perfection, yea it is the very
perfection of perfection it selfe; The
onely <hi>perfect life;</hi> the onely hye <hi>honor;</hi>
the onely godly <hi>pleasure;</hi> the only chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

of God; in Christ Iesus.</hi> Seeing then,
blessed brethren, seeing wee fight not as
they that beate the ayre<note n="a" place="margin">1, Cor. 9 26.</note>, but our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
is so great, so exceeding great in

as the same Iacob sayde to the Angell,
I will not let thee goe, except thou
