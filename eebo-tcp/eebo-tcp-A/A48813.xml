            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In these Words, I <hi>A.

            <head>To the Kingdom in General.</head>
            <p>HIS Majesty, having with a <hi>Grace exemplary</hi> not onely to all his Subjects of this Naiion, but to all Christian Princes and States, (however they may be themselves of the <hi>Roman</hi> Persuasion) design'd it, as the <hi>avowed Glory</hi> and Stability of his Reign, to settle such a <hi>Liberty,</hi> that there may be free discourses, and debates concerning the Truths of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Dissents of Christians in them, as from the Pulpit, so proportionably from the Press; as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ministers and Fautors of that Church (which would be known by the Name of <hi>Catholick</hi>) have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (and will be while they are) always active with their Pens to the utmost in their Sphaer. And as we see they have Publick Freedom, so is it not to be doubted of the Princely so Vniversal <hi>Grace,</hi> but that he intends a Freedom on the other side to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; that there may be no Inequality in holding the Beam, but that it may alike incline to all in this matter, <hi>specially</hi> now that he is making <hi>Credence</hi> of those his <hi>Royal</hi> Favours to all His <hi>Protestant</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who cannot but be deeply concern'd at such a Time as this; because of the great Advantages, the Interests of the Counter-Scale hope for from a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> of their own Sentiments. But in no case is <hi>this Liberty</hi> more desirable, than when an Amphibious-Ambidextrous <hi>Bishop,</hi> who assumes, like that <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to set one <hi>Foot on the Sea,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50209:3"/>
the <hi>other on the Earth:</hi> One Foot on the <hi>Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> Church, (which he calls one as if his self were of it) and the other on the <hi>Roman:</hi> In favour of which he so openly appeareth (to speak the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of him) to conciliate toward it, at lest a <hi>Cassandrian</hi> Temperament: which, as it will never be yielded by the <hi>Protestant, so</hi> would it not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, if it were offer'd, by the <hi>Papist.</hi> For he hath published (with what intentions is best known to God, and his own Conscience) a palliation of the most ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciliable <hi>Points</hi> of the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> the <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> swoln to such a Monstrosity in that Religion, together with other <hi>Saints,</hi> and all with <hi>Images</hi> too; Points wherein the Wisedom of the Nation thought fit to fix the <hi>TEST,</hi> as the security of Protestancy; and that of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of so great Infamy in Sacred Writ, and all these with a Multitude of Rampant Words; now rather than a Multitude of such Words should not be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or a <hi>man of lips be justified,</hi> even the <hi>very Stones would speak:</hi> Such <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Sophistry</hi> will not suffer Men <hi>to hold their peace,</hi> and while he seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>to mock</hi> than argue, should not every one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make him ashamed? For, certainly, his ways of Discourse are like those of the <hi>Whorish Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> so moveable, one cannot know them, he comes out in this Time, that he esteems a <hi>Twilight,</hi> and with a prostituted Subtilty he treats of Sacred things: he is <hi>loud and stubborn;</hi> his feet <hi>abide not</hi> in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>his own</hi> Church, as he his self styles it; but now he is <hi>in the Streets</hi> of the <hi>Strange Religion,</hi> and layeth wait in every Corner with a <hi>New sort</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Polity,</hi> or in a <hi>New

            </p>
            <p>If I have offered too largely to a just Indignation here, I having the Treatise it self mostly applied my self to the rational part, and minded chiefly to possess the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the true sense of things: I have therefore wav'd the persuit of his History of Transubstantiation in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stages of it, leaving it to more learned Persons, who, I doubt not, may observe in their usual walks and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50209:4"/>
dail-y paths, through the whole course of <hi>Ecclesiastick Times</hi> Many of his Erratick motions: but however the <hi>main point</hi> of truth, or falshood on that Head, or Article rests in this little room <hi>whether it is possible to believe</hi> such sublime spirituality (as our Lord alway breath'd) <hi>so little of kin to sense, to matter, to flesh,</hi> should in his holy dying Institution, forsake him so, that he should, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to engage his Blessed Body, that was so suddenly to become a <hi>Spiritual Glorious Body,</hi> and to <hi>Asscend far above all Heavens,</hi> to so inglorious, insipid, ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a desscent, as onely to dispossess a small Roll os Bread, or Wafer of its whole Substance, and as by a trick to leave its Accidents still intire to fool and baffle all the sense and reason in the World: and <hi>yet to so little effect</hi> as to suffer the Bodies and the Souls too, of the greatest number of the Eaters to be without any Evidences of good, as notorious and certain, as the miracle is supposed to be stupendous; whoever can believe this, need not go to visit the dark and too oft impure Cells where so strange a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine was conceiv'd and foster'd, he hath a <hi>Bulimy</hi> of Faith without more ado of search and inquiry to devour all the absurdities that the name of a Church can offer him.</p>
            <p>And so to the points os <hi>Idolatry,</hi> abating from things Pious and Learned, (to which let the utmost allowances of deference and honour be yielded, and paid) the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he would imprint of it on the minds of his Readers, are an audacious affront (as he speaks in a more innocent case) to God the <hi>Creator of Heaven and Earth</hi> in <hi>his Word,</hi> who therein abhorrs all Distributions and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellings out of any the least Particles of the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>One God, or Mediator</hi> to any of the most <hi>Seraphick</hi> of his Creatures, Angels, or Saints, or the Mother of God, as he speaks without Precedent from Scripture, and hardly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50209:4"/>
allowable in a Discourse of <hi>Idolatry</hi> although tolerated in the case of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresie: Even so all Address of any Beings besides that <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Mediator,</hi> his <hi>Word doth de TEST</hi> specially invisible Beings, to whom we can make not the least Application, but under the peril of <hi>Idolatry</hi> as Communicating them, in any semblances of Worship, with those Incommunicable <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of <hi>Omniscience</hi> and <hi>Omnipresence</hi>: He hath indeed allowed and commanded mutuous respects in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er humane World for the settlement of the order of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and Civil Offices; but all the figments of Men's own Brains concerning <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Himself,</hi> or of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> through the <hi>Mediation</hi> of any of his Creatures, and most notoriously, by <hi>Graven Images,</hi> or any kind of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes</hi> comprehending other Figments, he declares to be <hi>Abomination.</hi> It is a grand Audaciousness therefore to offer such an insolent piece of falshood to Christian minds <hi>as that the Cherub were by his appointment to be Worshipped, or to have Worship directed to them,</hi> because their Resemblances were placed as waiting at that <hi>Throne</hi> that was <hi>Empty</hi> of any Presence to sit upon it; but an <hi>Invisible Glory</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> had promised favour to those who, <hi>according to his Word,</hi> praid toward that place, which He having fill'd with a visible sign of his <hi>Presence of Glory</hi> He after placed his <hi>Name</hi> there: with as much sense therefore it might have been said that every Stone in the Building of the Temple, or whatever was in the Temple, or specially in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> was to be <hi>Worshipped</hi> as to say the <hi>Cherubim</hi> were to be <hi>Worshipped,</hi> of God in, through, or by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Parallell Essrontery</hi> it is to load the <hi>Sun and Host of Heaven,</hi> the Scripture with all the Idolatries brands, and so contrary to the very letter of it, that the <hi>Visional</hi> Representation of the <hi>Jewish Idolatries</hi> to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ch. <hi>7.</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50209:6"/>
remembring the Admonition the <hi>Apostle Jude</hi> gives from the Example of the <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> who <hi>disputing with the Devil</hi> about the <hi>Body of Moses,</hi> most probably in the Cause of Idolatry, did <hi>not adventure</hi> to <hi>bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him</hi> a <hi>Railing Accusation,</hi> but said, <hi>the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will I assume to make the least Reflexion upon the Insufficiencies of the Discourse, as to its particular Frame and Menage, or upon the Air, Meen, or Spirit of it, relating to either the <hi>Roman,</hi> or the <hi>Protestant</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or to the Names of greatest Honour, Authority and Reverence, who have acted, or written in Defence of the Reformation: But leaving all this part to those, who have both <hi>Talents,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to support them in their just Censures of such a manner of Treaty of what deserves our highest Value and Veneration, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with Debating upon the principal Matters, taking them in the utmost Extent of the Offensive, or Defensive Arguments upon them.</p>
            <p>The Heads therefore according to which this Discourse is to be modell'd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.</note> must be those Reasons, the <hi>Bishop</hi> gives for the Abrogating of the <hi>Test:</hi> The firstof which is;
<q>That it doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminish, but utterly destroy the natural Rights of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and turns the <hi>Birth-Right</hi> of the English Nobility into a <hi>Precarious Title.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the first place in answer to this, I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; that in the very thought of utterly <hi>destroying</hi> this Right, the Episcopal Authour does somewhat relent, and recoyl from the Height of his Expression, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates it into a <hi>Turning that Birth-Right into a Precarious Title:</hi> Taking therefore advantage from that so natural, and even necessary Recess, or Condescension, if not to be thought, as it very much seems a Check upon impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50209:6"/>
of style from a Consciousness of its Excess; I shall take the boldness more freely to assert, That the natural Rights of <hi>Peerage</hi> are not at all destroyed, but own'd, upheld, and more solemnly acknowledg'd by the <hi>Test-Act.</hi> Secondly, that the Birth-Right of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Nobility is no way turn'd into a Precarious Title by it.</p>
            <p>And because this is indeed the onely Argument for the removing the <hi>Test-Act,</hi> that is of true Strength, and Merit in the whole Contexture; it deserves the more Attent Consideration.</p>
            <p>For whatever shall attempt to shake such a main Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and Fundamental Principle of our English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to be both suspected, and feared; and if it indeed prove to do so, to be surpriz'd and foreclos'd from its Effect: But the Invalidity of this Charge will thus appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is most evident the Right of <hi>Peerage</hi> in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral stands firm, notwithstanding the <hi>Test:</hi> Seeing this Principle of Government is not onely still, but with strongest Confirmations even from this very <hi>Test-Act</hi> on all sides preserv'd most firm and undoubted, That there is a most just Right that every <hi>Peer</hi> hath to all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of <hi>English Peerage</hi>: Accordingly the very Act is founded upon that Acknowledgment, and Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> That every <hi>Peer</hi> hath such Right to all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and to that Right most unquestionable in it self, for else the very Ground of the Law were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. 2. All and every <hi>Peer</hi> submitting to that Law takes that Right, and enjoys it without any Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, and holds it not onely for himself, but for that whole <hi>Estate:</hi> the whole being acknowledg'd in every Member: And particularly sitting, and voting in the <hi>Higher House of Parliament,</hi> (which is therefore with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50209:7"/>
Honour to that <hi>Estate</hi> call'd the <hi>House of Lords</hi>) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the just Right of <hi>Peerage</hi> without any Infraction upon the Right it self. 3. Even those <hi>Noble Lords,</hi> who do refuse, or do not actually submit to the taking the <hi>Test,</hi> have yet their Right of Birth, Blood, or other Title preserv'd undisputed, and inviolate, as it is such a Right and on such a Claim; and therefore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they please to accept it on that Condition, there is no demur upon their Right. But untill they so accept, their Right is in a kind of <hi>Abeyance,</hi> and <hi>Custody of Law</hi> for them; and never dyes, or is extinguisht. 4. The Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension in the mean time amounts no higher to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcation of the Priviledge, (nor indeed so high) than the <hi>Minority</hi> of <hi>such Noble Persons,</hi> which cause's a Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that Priviledge of voting in <hi>Parliament,</hi> till they are of Age, which is not at their pleasure, but requires the natural Course of Time to advance them to it; whereas in this case, they may in Construction of Law every day remove the Obstruction and enjoy their Right, seeing the Claim is always allow'd, and own'd, and the Law takes no notice of the Reasons of their refusal. 5. This is made most evident; in that all other natural Rights of their <hi>Peerage,</hi> are notwithstanding the Suspension of this particular Branch continued to them. 6. It is most undeniable; their Right of Blood, or other Claim to the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> is unmoved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not their taking the <hi>Test,</hi> but that precedent, and still continuing just Right, gives them a perfect enjoyment of that particular <hi>Priviledge</hi> whenever they take the <hi>Test.</hi> Which is, I hope, a full Vindication of the natural Rights of <hi>Peerage</hi> from being utterly destroyed; seeing it is onely one Branch, that is in Question, and that is onely suspended, or rather deposited in trust with the House of Peers, and no way destroy'd, or extinguish'd.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50209:7"/>2. I come therefore to make good in the second place, that the <hi>Birth-Right</hi> os the English Nobility is not turn'd into a <hi>Precarious Title,</hi> nor that which in former Ages was forfeited onely by <hi>Treason</hi> is now at the mercy of every <hi>Faction,</hi> or every <hi>Passion</hi> in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that can never be <hi>Precarious,</hi> nor at such mercy, which subsists, and rests upon the common <hi>Base</hi> of the whole World for its security, and that is the Law of <hi>self-preservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For when a <hi>Parliament</hi> consists of <hi>Two Houses,</hi> and the <hi>Vpper House</hi> of <hi>Two Estates,</hi> each Estate a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as is to be always presumed) of the wisest, and most honourable Persons of a whole Nation, the <hi>Lower House</hi> hath always upon all their Proposals, or Offers at any Bill, the curb and restraint; that this is to pass the <hi>Vpper House,</hi> or <hi>House of Lords,</hi> and therefore cannot rationally so much, as essay them with any Law, that would destroy the Rights of their <hi>Peerage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But suppose the <hi>House of Commons</hi> should make so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable an attempt, it can never be imagin'd, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent a Body always provident, and watchfull, so naturally sensible of Honour, and of their own Interest, should either be impos'd upon, or drawn by whatsoever motives to consent to the Destruction of their very Constitution, there being no stronger Passion, or more binding Cement, than that of <hi>self-preservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet the preparation of the <hi>Two Houses</hi> for the bringing forth a Law, does but form the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, that they may be presented to the Royal Assent to to give them the form and life; who as the common Father of the Countrey will judg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all Bills, whether they are the Products of <hi>Passion,</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> and so they either live, or are still-born.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50209:8"/>When all Laws are therefore thus winnow'd, and sifted through these several Explorations of Persons sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have all manner of <hi>Talents</hi> for judging, and the quickest Resentments of their own Interest, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment whether as the <hi>Lower,</hi> or <hi>Higher</hi> Body of a Nation, whether <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> and then shall all meet in the common Head, who sees, and feels for the whole, it is very adventurous to impute such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions to the Faction, or Passion of a <hi>Parliament.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this must needs be the firmest Foundation humane Affairs can be entrusted to in this World, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law of self preservation ballanc'd by <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> e're any thing becomes a Law. And although, it is true, the influence of the <hi>Supreme Prince,</hi> the <hi>Genius,</hi> and Temper of an Age, or particular Inclination of Times, the Configuration of various Co-incidents may prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate to the worse, in some Laws, yet there must be submission to suffering, even when Conscience, or Reason countersways that which we call Active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to such Laws; or all Government must be unhinged, and fall.</p>
            <p>And seeing it is acknowledg'd there may be a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture</hi> by Treason of the Rights of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and that it hath been in the Power of <hi>Parliaments</hi> to declare the nature and kinds of <hi>Treason,</hi> there is, nor can be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger to the <hi>Peerage</hi> in trusting themselves with the Suspension of one Branch of their <hi>Right</hi> than, in trusting themselves with the whole of those <hi>Rights</hi>: and it is very rare, that humane Nature (specially such sapient and honourable part of it) conspire with a <hi>Faction,</hi> or <hi>Passion</hi> against themselves, or receive a precedent srom a partial Infringment of their <hi>Rights</hi> to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole; seeing, if so great an <hi>Estate</hi> hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen in a lesser concern, it is to be concluded, it will be the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50209:8"/>
more jealous after, and where the whole is in danger; and so there is no more consequence from the Precedent of the <hi>Test-Law</hi> (which is either unawares, or by the sorce of Truth, or of meer Grace, it being unlike the rest of this Discourse, granted by the Reverend Authour to have been usefull in its season) than from a necessary and prudent opening a vein to conclude the Person that consents to the one, will therefore consent to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the whole Mass of Blood.</p>
            <p>And lastly after all that hath been said; the Instances this Authour gives of the first <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation-Test,</hi> and the <hi>Protestation,</hi> or Test of Loyalty in which the priviledge of <hi>Peerage</hi> was so carefully provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for against injury by either of those <hi>Tests,</hi> do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strengthen than weaken what hath been insisted on; for it confirms, how quick of apprehension the House of Peers have always been in that point, and therefore they would not suffer their own <hi>Peerage</hi> to fall under any Eclipse, sooner than they found abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity, and such a good arising, as would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate any so much, as <hi>Parenthesis</hi> of the full Beams of that Glory on any of their Members, and so that it should be no more than a <hi>Parenthesis</hi>; till such Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers mov'd themselves to such a position, that no part of their Orb of Honour should be unenlighten'd.</p>
            <p>But in the other <hi>Test</hi> they seeing no Reason sor the shortest Suspension on Accounts of Loyalty, sufficiently otherwise secur'd, lest there should arise a Custom of trapaning <hi>Peers</hi> out of their Rights, some <hi>Noble Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages</hi> resolv'd to Stem that Tide; even as in the wise Administration of what pertains to health, extraordinary methods may be resolv'd against; but when indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Symptoms appear, such resolutions may be rescinded; and so without any Dishonour but great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50209:9"/>
the <hi>Peers</hi> who entred Protestations against such superfluous <hi>Tests,</hi> as were projected to ensnare and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein upon them standing Orders of the <hi>House</hi> against any such <hi>Tests,</hi> and yet might upon pressing vehement urgencies, see it necessary for the safety of the whole Body of the <hi>Peerage</hi> to have such a <hi>Test</hi> as might bring some of their Members under a Suspension, till they gave Hostages of their not sufsering such persuasions to have the ascendent of them, as might be destructive to a Protestant Nobility in all appearance much the <hi>Major</hi> part; whereas in the case of the designed <hi>Protestation,</hi> the lesser part were probably understood to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by Degrees to have disinherison'd through such Artificesthe greater Number, of which some <hi>Lords</hi> more sagacious, being aware, entred their <hi>Protestation</hi> to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken others equally concern'd, though not so foreseeing, and whose foresight gain'd upon the rest.</p>
            <p>And seeing no such <hi>Protestation</hi> was entred in the case of the last <hi>Transubstantiation-Test,</hi> it assures the evidence of the reasonableness of it, overweigh'd the very attempt: And so I take leave of the First Reason, which I have more diligently attended in all its moments of appearance, because it is urg'd not only by this Authour, but by the generality of the zealous for removing the <hi>Test-Act.</hi> And it issues into this most equitable Maxim of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That the major part of each particular <hi>Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> in a Nation must judg, even as particular Persons do, what is best for the whole. And the <hi>House of Peers</hi> being Judg for it self, and most tender of it self; and the King, the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Fountain of Honour,</hi> having advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with them, and given life to a Law for the Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Rights of those <hi>Peers</hi> who neglect to take the <hi>Test</hi>; this Law can by no means shake the general Rights of <hi>Peerage,</hi> or so much as destroy, but onely
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50209:9"/>
suspends the Right of particular Peers, till they yield obedience to that Law, which acknowledging their Right expects it from them, and hastens them to a compliance with it self.</p>
            <p>And this will proportionably flow down upon all parts, and Persons concern'd in the <hi>Test-Act.</hi> If the <hi>major part</hi> of each distinct Body of Men in a Nation shall not by their <hi>Representatives</hi> freely chosen, or by the whole Body it self summon'd to <hi>Parliament</hi> upon the Right of their <hi>Peerage,</hi> conclude the whole, by their most duely weigh'd, and considered Acts, presented to the Supreme Power, and impress'd by him, there can be no possible Rest, Quiet, or Determination of humane Affairs in any rational way, or method: And all this being of that nature, and so cautiously suspending, or preseerving, as in Abeyance, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing any Right, it can never be said to destroy, nor so much as to submit to a <hi>Precarious Title, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Passion</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">(Words most injurious to the very Nature of Parliaments.)</note> Any Right, much less the Right of <hi>Peerage,</hi> as being a Right of Blood and of Inheritance.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to the <hi>Bishops</hi> Second Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly it ought to be repealed, because of its dishonourable Birth, and Original;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> 
               <hi>it being the first Born of</hi> Oates <hi>his Plot, and brought forth on purpose to give Credit and Reputation to the</hi> Perjury.</p>
            <p>How far the Wisedom of the Nation in <hi>Parliament</hi> shall concern it self for the Honour of both the Nation, and its <hi>Parliaments</hi> to give Reputation to the Cross Wounds it may seem to have receiv'd in that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Assair, I will not be so bold as to pry; it being an <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>State</hi> that hath its Secrets, and sacred Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50209:10"/>
nor at all wade in so invidious a matter; but wholly wave the Paragraph, in which it is handled; onely I will consider how far a dishonourable occasion may give Birth to a Law, and the Law it self still remain in honour; and then remark upon the Little Interest the (as the Bishop calls it) <hi>Otesian Plot</hi> may have in the <hi>Test-Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Test,</hi> all Laws have this dishonour in their Original (if we might allow things of that Class, or Rank to be Originals;) to have such respect to the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of humane Nature, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath said; <hi>The Law is not made for a Righteous Man</hi> but <hi>for the Lawless</hi>; and it is a known Maxime; <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur Leges.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Out of such manners as cou'd ne'r be said</l>
               <l>To have been good, good Laws have yet been made:</l>
               <l>Sic verè vertit —</l>
               <l>For grant the Birth be base; don't Comets rise</l>
               <l>From Fogs and Vapours, 'fore they shine in Skies?</l>
               <l>And acts amazing by a Pesant's Son,</l>
               <l>As by a Prince's, ha ve they not been done?</l>
               <l>If so, <hi>SA. OXON</hi> is <hi>(SAI</hi> not the <hi>TEST</hi> is) gone.</l>
               <bibl>— <hi>Sic justè judicat EHMAMP ARTNOCAS.</hi> Aliàs <hi>DRAWDE REVEROFMADA.</hi>
               </bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Laws therefore are to be weigh'd by the serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and use they are of to the main Ends of Vertue, Righteous ness and Peace, and not by the foulness of their occasional Originals. And therefore they have indeed a much higher Original, if wise, vertuous and good Laws; and claim their descent from the exemplar-Wisedom a nd Goodness, and that Eternal Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Truth and Equity, which can never be stain'd, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50209:10"/>
embas'd by the particular occasions, upon which they are Enacted, which give Being to them no otherwise, than as those Divine Emanations exert and direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against those contrary Evils and Vices which they Forbid and Punish: so that the Birth, or Original of this Law is not to be inquir'd into (suppose it <hi>Oats</hi>'s <hi>Plot</hi>) so low as <hi>Oats</hi>'s <hi>Plot,</hi> but as the Peace and Safety of a Community is provided for by it; which is as the <hi>Arteria Magna,</hi> in that universal Law of Righteousness, as it concerns Humane Affairs, and as it is calculated for the Support and Security of the National Religion, against the <hi>Vsurpation</hi> of a <hi>Foreign Jurisdiction,</hi> a nobler part, than that any thing else can come in Competition with it. It is then a very petty thing to weigh the goodness of a Law by the next occasion of it; and a manifest Blunder upon a <hi>Non Cause</hi> for the <hi>True Cause,</hi> to confound an <hi>Occasion</hi> and an <hi>Original</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Let us then consider in the next place, what Interest the (so styl'd) <hi>Otesian Plot</hi> hath in this Law: For if in effect it should prove the First-Born of that <hi>Plot,</hi> the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and <hi>Excellence of its strength,</hi> and that it hath not a more Excellent Soul, and Spirit, descending from Above; it might be in danger to be Condemn'd to the same Fate. But whoever considers the <hi>Test</hi> it self, will not find the least Cognation, or Relation it hath to that <hi>Plot,</hi> nor that any Lineaments, or Strokes of it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into its Composition: so that however it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive occasion from it, yet the Essentials of it are such Sentiments, as the Nation hath had for above the last hundred of years, and that it hath upon greatest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Reason and Experience confirm'd it self in: and according to several Emergencies added to its securities by <hi>Law</hi> upon <hi>Law,</hi> against the Regurgitations of that usurpation upon it; not barely because of such Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50209:11"/>
but because of that Grand Reason, the very Essence of <hi>Popery</hi> hath given it: whether therefore the particular Emergent hath had Dimensions Long and Broad enough for the particular Laws and Constitutions which have been made, was not so much consider'd: But the whole Nature of the Evil Fear'd, and provided against, being large enough to support such Acts, it hath given Reason to all such provisions; and <hi>that was</hi> the danger of the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> Resettling and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instating it self in a <hi>Protestant Nation,</hi> as the <hi>English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is and hath been for so great a space.</p>
            <p>Thus this <hi>Last Act</hi> for the <hi>Test,</hi> setting before it only that so Full and Comprehensive Consideration of the Increase and Danger of <hi>Popery</hi> in this Nation, to which the former good Laws had proved Ineffectual, does therefore so Enact as that Act expresses.</p>
            <p>In all which there is not the least Reference to the so much <hi>Infam'd Plot,</hi> nor any Line looking toward it: Till therefore there be a change in the very Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Nature of <hi>Popery,</hi> and a perfect Nullity of all the Fears arising from it made evident, there must be This, or That particular Accidental Cause quickning the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power of the Nation</hi> to branch out it self into more and more, and further and further particular Laws, that may more effectually reach the intended Point, and be new in the Particulars; observing where former Provisions were deficient and inefficacious: which new Laws are not to be charged upon the lesser Accidental Causes, but on the Irreconcileableness of <hi>Popery,</hi> and its Growth to the peace and welfare of a <hi>Protestant Nation.</hi> And so I have finished what I think necessary upon the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Second Reason, to shew how Inconcluding it is for the <hi>Abrogating of the Test.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="section">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50209:11"/>
               <head>I proceed now to the Third Reason.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>The Test ought to be repeal'd, because of the incompetent Authority,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> by which it was enacted, for it is a Law of an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Nature, made without the Authority of the Church, contrary to the Practice of the Christian World in all Ages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>1. This Reason rests upon these two Principal Pillars, that the Power of making Decrees concerning Divine Verities, is a <hi>Legislative</hi> Power, given as the highest Act of Government by Christ's Commission, to the Officers of his own Kingdom, upon which the whole Fabrick of the Christian Church hath hitherto stood, and is to stand to the End of the World, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it must run into confusion; and that to entrench upon this Prerogative of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> is to depose Christ from his Throne, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning, neglecting, and affronting his Commission to his <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> so that this Power cannot be usurped without Sacriledge, and Blasphemy, and such a daring Invasion of Christ's Kingdom, as that nothing more imports Christian Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, than to be wary and cautious, how they lay hands upon it.</q>
               </p>

                  <q>2. That the Bishops sitting in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> and (to their shame) consenting to this Law, is not sufficient to make this Law an Act of <hi>Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>; because it ought to have been first decreed by their own proper Authority, without any <hi>Lay</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and then to have come into <hi>Parliament,</hi> and as they judged sit, to have been abetted with Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Penalties, a Practice never violated, but by <hi>Aposlates,</hi> and <hi>Rebel Parliaments.</hi> And lastly because
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50209:12"/>
                     <hi>Particular Bishops</hi> sit not in <hi>Parliament</hi> by Power deriv'd from our Blessed Saviour, but by the meer Grace and Favour of the King, so that the exercising any <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Authority</hi> in that place is scandalously to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, as much as in them lies, the very being of a Christian Church, and profanely to pawn the <hi>Bishop</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi>; and lastly because the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Power is by the Law of <hi>England</hi> setled in <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and therefore to enact any thing of an <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Nature</hi> without their consent is to betray the Rights of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as by <hi>Law establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in particular, as well as of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> in general.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But as a Check and Limitation to all this, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Authour interposes; the <hi>Civil Power</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the Exercise of this <hi>Ecclesiastical Prerogative,</hi> as they shall judge meet for the Ends of Peace, and the Interest of the Common Wealth, and punish it too at their own discretion, if it shall at any time entrench upon the Power of the State, and it may prevent, or correct Abuses.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have thus collected the strength of this whole Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son without omitting any thing, I could think material; I have also subjoyn'd the Limitation, that it may be of the use the Authour design'd it, and may also be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in its place to our purpose.</p>
               <p>There are three Expressions, I desire in modesty and reverence to this R. R. <hi>Authour</hi> to draw a Veil over. 1. That <hi>Parenthetic (to their shame</hi>) viz. the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s shame, who consented to the <hi>Test-Law,</hi> because it seems so much to confine on <hi>speaking Evil of Dignities;</hi> and for the same Reason, 2<hi>ly.</hi> upon that, (<hi>Except by Apostates,</hi> and <hi>Rebel-Parliaments,</hi>) as also because I would not know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect meaning of those words, but go backward to cast a covering over them. 3. On those words, I draw the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50209:12"/>
Curtain; (<hi>profanely pawn the Bishop to the Lord</hi>) lest they seem rather, fit to be retyr'd among the <hi>Bishops Ludicra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to the main purport, and stress of the Argument I shall undertake to rejoyn these Assertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no such <hi>Legislative</hi> Power given by Commission from Christ to his Church, or made the Foundation of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all such Pretensions of <hi>Church-Power</hi> drawn from the Practice of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> are very invalid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Law of the Test</hi> is not a <hi>Law</hi> of an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick</hi> Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if it were, the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath done enough in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and other Church-Acts to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Presence of the <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> not <hi>protesting</hi> against it, are sufficient proof of the two last Assertions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That according to the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s own Limitation of <hi>Church-Power</hi>; it must remain a good, and necessary <hi>Law,</hi> and for which the <hi>Parliament</hi> had <hi>Competent Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the first. 1. That there is no such <hi>Legislative Power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>This <hi>Legislative Power</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is most contrary to that <hi>Holy Book,</hi> from whence we derive our <hi>Christian Sacred Religion,</hi> and to the soundest Reason guided by that; for by that there is, nor can be any <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in matters of <hi>Divine Verity</hi> but what is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>from Heaven,</hi> either by voice from thence, or by the <hi>Ministery of Angels,</hi> or by immediate <hi>Inspiration</hi> given to <hi>Holy Men, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and consign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50209:13"/>
by them into the Holy Writings we call <hi>Scriptures.</hi> All which after-<hi>Revelations</hi> are to be tryed, and <hi>Tested</hi> by their compare with, and Agreement to former <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> as is most manifest in all parts of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and by the constant, and continual Appeal of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the <hi>New:</hi> So that this <hi>prerogativ'd, Legislative Church,</hi> that is pleaded into so high and rampant a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that All-seeming wavings of its Authority must be an <hi>Invasion of Christ's Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Deposing of Him,</hi> an <hi>affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Commission,</hi> smells strong of the Pride, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of that <hi>City,</hi> which, first, as a <hi>City,</hi> and then as a <hi>Church</hi> hath always aspir'd, <hi>to have a Kingdom over the Kings of the Earth;</hi> as also of the <hi>Luciferian Ascent</hi> of the <hi>Beast; that carries it,</hi> with and upon which, I doubt not, the <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy</hi> will be found: <hi>Who exalts himself above all that is called God,</hi> or <hi>worshipped, who sitteth in the Temple of God,</hi> shewing <hi>Himself that he is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to us, there is but <hi>one Law-giver, who is able to save and to destroy. One Father, who is in Heaven; One Master, who is Christ, and all we are Brethren; One Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative-Lord;</hi> and the <hi>chiefest</hi> in his <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> Ministring his <hi>Word</hi> in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>onely law of Divine verities.</hi> And therefore in this <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-sense,</hi> dare not receive the title of <hi>Masters,</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> nor can those who <hi>receive the Law</hi> of Christ, made evident from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>his Law,</hi> by their <hi>Ministry,</hi> upon such <hi>Ministration</hi> yield them therefore the Names of <hi>Masters,</hi> or <hi>Fathers</hi> in a <hi>Legislative</hi> sense. For they know, they ought to <hi>Preach Christ the Lord</hi>; and <hi>themselves</hi> onely <hi>Servants for Christ's sake,</hi> that <hi>they have no Dominion over</hi> the Faith of Christians, (who are however called the <hi>Laity,</hi> yet are Christ's <hi>Clerus,</hi>) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are <hi>Ensamples</hi> of the <hi>Flock</hi> who attends the motion of the <hi>Chief Shepherd,</hi> the <hi>Lamb, Christ Jesus,</hi> whithersoever <hi>he goes,</hi> and will not <hi>follow Strangers.</hi>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50209:14"/>2. The pretended practice of the Church of God in all Ages, can give no presidency in this Case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is thus asserted; For in the times of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> Religious Princes, did by the general advice, and Doctrine of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and of those <hi>Priests</hi> who kept their Faith <hi>to the Law of God,</hi> themselves govern, and reform according to that of which each King was to have a <hi>Copy Written</hi> by himself, which was <hi>to be with him,</hi> and <hi>he was to read it all the days of his Life.</hi> That he might <hi>Learn to fear the Lord his God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and to keep his Laws.</hi> And whereas in that precedent Law, enquiry of the <hi>Priest in the place God should choose, was commended;</hi> it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insinuates, the divine <hi>Responses,</hi> God gave at that time by the <hi>Vrim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> immediately from himself were intended, but yet all was to be founded in the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law,</hi> there all was to be shown, and from thence to be <hi>learnt,</hi> or not to be receiv'd, no not under a power of seeming <hi>Miiracles,</hi> Deut. 12.</p>
               <p>In the first times of Christianity, for three hundred years, there were no Christian <hi>Magistrates,</hi> who would wait for the <hi>Churches Oracle's.</hi> But for the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Church</hi> without a <hi>Lay-Concurrence,</hi> it is most apparently opposite to that grand instance of the <hi>first Council,</hi> wherein the people (if any) distinguishingly styl'd the <hi>Church</hi>; and who made most manifestly one of the <hi>Estates,</hi> (if I may so express it) in the whole <hi>Conciliary</hi> management; The <hi>Apostles, the Elders, the Brethren</hi>; and the whole Consultation, and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation mov'd upon the <hi>Poles</hi> of express Scripture, as will be most visible to any enquirer into those <hi>Conciliary Acts;</hi> For he <hi>that runs may read,</hi> Acts 15.</p>
               <p>In the days of that first and most Religious <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Constantine,</hi> although he, as all pious Princes, and Christians would, receiv'd light from the <hi>Ministers</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50209:14"/>
                  <hi>sacred truth,</hi> yet so that he us'd his own Judgment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it; deploring the weaknesses he observ'd among these who <hi>seem'd</hi> to be <hi>pillars</hi> of light, but yet it must be acknowledg'd, that <hi>that Apostasie,</hi> the <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquity,</hi> that <hi>began to work in the Apostles days</hi> was well grown up, and advanc'd, and a <hi>Legislative Church</hi> was Towring up its <hi>Power</hi> in the Christian World at that very time.</p>
               <p>But it is undoubted, There is nothing so Ancient, as Divine Truth in <hi>the Law,</hi> and in the <hi>Testimony,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting with that <hi>Law of Reason Engraven in man's Heart,</hi> and to these we must goe; Fot <hi>whatsoever speaks not according to these,</hi> there is no Morning <hi>to it,</hi> nor <hi>from it;</hi> but a Night, even to a Midnight, ensues upon it, what Antiquity soever it pretends to.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That I may yet give a more direct Answer to this Reason, the <hi>Test-Act</hi> is not a Law of an <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Nature</hi>; For it is onely an Exploration, and Touch upon Persons, whether they are <hi>Romanists,</hi> or not: it is no <hi>Canonical Determination</hi> of the Point of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> it binds no <hi>Decree</hi> with a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastick Anathema,</hi> or <hi>Excommunication</hi>; which are of the Essence of <hi>Ecclesiastick Laws,</hi> as they have been always Solemniz'd, and Ratified in the <hi>Christian-Antichristianizing</hi> World upon light occasions.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Test</hi> presumes Two Things, suppos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be sufficiently certain. 1. That no <hi>Romanist</hi> will deny his <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> nor consent, that his <hi>Invocation</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and of <hi>other Saints,</hi> and that the <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass</hi> is <hi>Superstitious,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> The <hi>Test</hi> does not determine, nor pretend <hi>Canonically</hi> to Define <hi>of</hi> these Things: it onely propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses this, as a certain Discovery of the <hi>Votaries</hi> of a <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Church;</hi> nor does it mind to decide the Truth of those Matters: It is enough to it, to know, who do, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50209:15"/>
who do not assent to their presumed Truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to discover Men, not to <hi>Decree</hi> points of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is it <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> but purely <hi>Civil,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the <hi>State</hi> onely, whom it will judg safe to commit the Affairs of this Nation unto, and into what Hands to entrust its Interests; and having by more than a hundred years experience, deemed it not safe for a <hi>Protestant Nation</hi> to be overgrown by a <hi>Papal Power,</hi> it hath thus Resolved, and Enacted; not at that Time enquiring after the Truth of the Things, concern'd in the Test: but satisfied with the Assurance, that a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick</hi> (as he is call'd) will not assent to them, as they are there laid. Which are here onely taken notice of, as <hi>matters of State</hi>; and their Doctrinal Truth it supposes elsewhere to have been sufficiently Ascertain'd, as shall be afterward consider'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For indeed <hi>the Church of England</hi> hath both in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> in continual printed manifestations of its sense, in daily preachings, and <hi>ministrations of the Truth of the word of God,</hi> abundantly, and beyond all Controversie open'd, explained, and asserted concerning these things out of and according to <hi>Scripture,</hi> so that not in a <hi>Humane Light,</hi> or Determination, but in the very <hi>Beams of Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> which are plainly to be seen streaming from the <hi>fountain of light the word</hi> of God, there is warranty enough without any <hi>Invasion</hi> upon <hi>Christ's Kingdom,</hi> or the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Officers</hi> of it, (supposing them what we can suppose rhem) for a <hi>Parliament</hi> safely to proceed as it did; supported by as many Assurances, as it could desire; that if the <hi>Lips</hi> of the <hi>Ministry of the Church of England preserv'd knowledge,</hi> and that <hi>the Law was to be enquired at its mouth;</hi> the Resolution of that Church, in all those cases, was sufficiently known, and no injury could be done to it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50209:15"/>5. Of this the presence of the <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> not <hi>Remonstrating,</hi> nor <hi>Protesting</hi> against this <hi>Law,</hi> his consenting (however the Author judges it to their shame) are security enough: That they understood the <hi>Test-Law</hi> to be no Invasion of the <hi>Rights of the Church,</hi> but according to the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of it, as by <hi>Law established.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For seeing, as hath been before argued, every <hi>Body,</hi> nor <hi>Estate</hi> of Men in <hi>Parliament</hi> knew so quick and feelingly for themselves, and specially such a Body as the <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> of a Nation; it can never be suppos'd they would, as by a common Conspiracy, agree to betray their own Rights and Priviledges, having at hand always that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of entring their <hi>Protestations</hi> of Dissent. So that although it is acknowledg'd, they <hi>sit in Parliament by the Grace of the King,</hi> and by the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>English Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> and not by Power deriv'd from Christ, nor as a <hi>Convocation</hi> according to the <hi>Laws of England</hi> in that case; yet it is always to be forethought that they sit with their Understandings, with their Consciences, with their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, with their Sentiments of <hi>Self-preservation</hi> about them: and that therefore they would not be <hi>Felones de se,</hi> by consenting to the Destruction of their noblest <hi>Rights</hi>; and on account of which, they are judg'd worthy to sit as an <hi>Estate,</hi> and to <hi>vote in Parliament,</hi> viz. as <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But lastly, it can never be understood, but that according to the Bishops own limitation, (if that be the Standard) of <hi>Church-Power</hi> and <hi>Praerogative,</hi> or his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up another <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Praerogative</hi> to <hi>mute</hi> it, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> have well done in this <hi>Test-Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For seeing the <hi>Civil</hi> Power may restrain the <hi>Exer<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ise</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Praerogative,</hi> as they shall <hi>judg</hi> meet for the <hi>ends of Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Interest of the Commonwealth,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50209:16"/>
and may <hi>punish it too,</hi> at <hi>their own discretion,</hi> if it shall at any time intrench upon the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> and that it may <hi>praevent</hi> or <hi>correct Abuses</hi>; who can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the <hi>States</hi> have not done according to what they might and ought to do, in preventing and correcting Abuses: For if they may <hi>prevent</hi> and <hi>correct Abuses,</hi> they must be able to judg of them; they must determine when they ly, they must judge also of the <hi>best means to prevent them.</hi> And what more lyable to such judgment of <hi>Abuses,</hi> and to undergo the best and most effectual methods of Praevention, than the things to be declar'd against in the <hi>Test</hi>; as shall be manifestly prov'd in the following Reason. And seeing that upon these very accounts it is notorious, that even in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Church Power</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> hath swoln beyond all bounds, and entrench'd with a vengeance upon the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> why then may not the State <hi>continue the correction</hi> and <hi>punishment</hi> of it by After-<hi>Acts</hi> (seeing the <hi>Bishop</hi> allows these <hi>punishments</hi> at their own <hi>discretion</hi>) and <hi>restrain</hi> and lock down men? Certainly all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to such an Exercise and Notions again of that <hi>Power,</hi> that they hav found in all Ages so destructive to the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Interest of the Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I cannot but reflect upon the strange Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileableness of the <hi>Bishop's Church-Prerogative,</hi> and of the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> as he hath stated it. For that such a <hi>Seeing Judging Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> that can alter, <hi>make Decrees</hi> concerning <hi>Divine Verities,</hi> should not know how to keep within its own bounds, nor so to learn its <hi>Power,</hi> but that it must be restrain'd for <hi>the Ends of Peace,</hi> and <hi>the Interest of the Commonwealth,</hi> and be <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd too at discretion</hi> for its aptness to <hi>praesume,</hi> and to <hi>intrench</hi> upon the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>State</hi>; nay, and beyond all this, to be so extravagant, that its <hi>Abuses</hi> may have need to be <hi>praevented</hi> and <hi>corrected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50209:16"/>Who can imagine, Jesus Christ should be so nearly concern'd in such a <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> as to be <hi>disown'd, neglected, affronted,</hi> if that he be Christ risen, and that the <hi>usurpation</hi> of it should lie so near <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> as that his <hi>Kingdom</hi> should be <hi>inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> and <hi>Himself deposed?</hi> and on such an account, that it should be such a <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Holy Catholick Church</hi>; and yet that this <hi>Civil Power</hi> that is suppos'd to know so little in Divine Verities, may <hi>bind its hands, punish, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, correct</hi> its <hi>Abuses.</hi> What must Christ, so closely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned in it, suffer in the mean time? What kind of <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> is here allow'd in the mean time? What <hi>Governour</hi> would <hi>accept such a Power</hi> as this of Christ's? or how can the <hi>King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> be such an Underling?</p>
               <p>Certainly this is is a <hi>precarious Power,</hi> with a witness: Surely in this state of things, there must be a most <hi>profane pawning the Bishop indeed to the Lord,</hi> or how can ever one Firmament bear two such Suns, or the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Man ever be at rest between them both? or <hi>serv two such Masters?</hi> They must <hi>adhaere</hi> to <hi>one, and despise the other</hi>; But since the <hi>Bishop</hi> must be <hi>Reverenced</hi> as a <hi>man</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> certenly it cannot be the <hi>Roman Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholic Church,</hi> that may be thus treated by the <hi>Civil Power</hi>; nor is it any <hi>Protestant Civil Prince,</hi> or State that hath these <hi>Powers,</hi> but only a <hi>Caesar,</hi> or State of the <hi>Roman Character, Image,</hi> and <hi>Superscription</hi> hath this Power, and only on Protestant Churches under their dominion.</p>
               <p>And so I pass with the Fatigue of this confounding, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Reason, and com to the last but longest Reason, which I shall yet but in brief consider.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fourth Reason for which the <hi>Test-Act</hi> ought to be repealed, is, because of the uncertainty and falshood of the matters contained in the Declaration it self, as, 
<list>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50209:17"/>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That there is no <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our Saviour's Body and Blood.</item>
                        <item>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Invocation</hi> of Saints, and of the Mother of God, is <hi>Idolatrie.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This reason so plainly divided by the <hi>Bishop</hi> into its two parts, that of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and that of <hi>Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Saints, and of the Mother of God, must be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed upon either of them, I must needs object, That this <hi>Test</hi> is not fairly quoted, for in so great a concern every word ought to have its due place, and no pretence of keeping the substance, will justifie the variation of an <hi>Iota</hi> from the very Letter, except my apprehension exceedingly deceive me: the Sence is much more injured, than the Letter is varied: Indeed the Author hath been so fair, as to prefix the Text of the <hi>Act,</hi> that his unfair Repetition may be convinced by it; but the unwary, or unthinking Reader, may easily slide into Errour by it, one being in the <hi>Title-page,</hi> where it may miss being considered, the other in the <hi>body of the Book.</hi> Observ then the difference betwixt the Text of the <hi>Test</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Quotation; the Test runs thus: <hi>I believe there is no,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Bishop</hi> quotes as a proposition, <hi>There is no</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. It may be a much more uncertain propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more liable to falshood, to asfirm, there is no <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> than so say, I do <hi>believe,</hi> There is none; and so proportionably, <hi>I believe,</hi> is to be supplied to the second member of the <hi>Declaration, viz.</hi> And I <hi>believe,</hi> that the <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Adoration</hi> of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although, I make no doubt, that every Christian ought to be fully assured of the propositions themselves, to be <hi>declared</hi> in the <hi>Test</hi>; yet, plain and down-right Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Propositions are not the proper subjects of <hi>solemn
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50209:17"/>
sincere Profession, Testification,</hi> and <hi>Declaration in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But such <hi>solemn sincere Professions, Testifications,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,</hi> properly fall upon the <hi>belief</hi> of a man's mind; which he knows, and hath judgment of, as a rational man, becaus they are within him; for the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>The spirit of a man knows the things that are within him.</hi> So that a man's <hi>belief,</hi> that is within him, may be wel <hi>declared</hi> and <hi>testified,</hi> even as all matters of sence and of trust? and becaus they are within him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> known onely to himself; There are therefore many just occasions to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> and <hi>testifie</hi> it to others: Of which the denial of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority, as a Qualification for Places of Trust and Power, are justly to be accounted among the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal.</p>
               <p>And this very observation, (as it is plain, and grounded on undeniable evidence by a compute of the words of the <hi>Test,</hi> set down by the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself, in the <hi>Title-page,</hi> and <hi>Fourth Reason,</hi> page 9.) does indeed make vain, frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and of no possible avail, or so much as significancie. All that follows, as to the <hi>Test,</hi> which is the thing in quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and under debate, and brings it into this narrow compass, Whether persons so devoted to the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> may for the <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> of a <hi>Protestant Common-wealth,</hi> be secluded from Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and trust by the consent of the <hi>major</hi> part of their own particular Bodies, and of each other Body, or <hi>Estate</hi> of the Nation, and the <hi>Supreme Prince</hi> assenting, in so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and solemn an <hi>Act,</hi> as an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> must needs be; which hath been already discours'd.</p>
               <p>For which soever side of the Propositions should be true, yet stil, what a man within himself <hi>believes,</hi> he truly knows, and truly may <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>testifie:</hi> And the business of the <hi>Test</hi> is not to determine, as hath been said, which part of either of the Proposions is true; but what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50209:18"/>
belief each person admitted to Trust, and Power is of; that so the <hi>Nation,</hi> as <hi>Protestant,</hi> may consult its own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the growth of <hi>Popery</hi> into a <hi>National</hi> strength and interest, and further confirms all that hath been said, That it is no <hi>Ecclesiastic Act,</hi> but a pure perfect Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Act, as the <hi>Administring</hi> an Oath in all other cases concerning the Trust of matters of Faith is.</p>
               <p>So that the affirming, that those two Propositions are by this <hi>Law</hi> to be <hi>solemnly</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> in the <hi>Praesence of God, Protested, Testified</hi> and <hi>Declared,</hi> is a down-right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness (not to say, out of reverence to the Author, Falshood) in the very sight of the Sun, in the sight, if I may so speak, of the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> of the Book; which <hi>Title-Page</hi> gives of necessity the Lye to this <hi>Ninth page</hi>; and is enough to discredit, and to call into just suspicion, the badness of the whole Cause, that is so insincerely handled by a person of such a Character of Dignity, and Sacredness of Office, as a <hi>Christian Bishop,</hi> who ought to do so much otherwise.</p>
               <p>But this is not all the unfaithfulness of the <hi>Episcopal Author,</hi> in recounting the <hi>Test,</hi> he is arguing against; for whereas the <hi>Declaration</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> runs thus:
<q>I <hi>believe,</hi> that in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> there is not any <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> of the Bread and Wine into the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop represents his Proposition thus:
<q>That there is no <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of our Saviour's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood.</q>
Now it is easie for every person, that does but in the lest apply his mind to it, to perceive, that the <hi>Test</hi> leaves it free to every person to frame any <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical, Spiritual, Analogical, Figurative</hi> sense in his own thoughts concerning <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>; and which may sufficiently satisfie and exhaust the sense of more than most words of the <hi>Greek Fathers</hi> import, for it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vabl,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50209:18"/>
they have no word strictly <hi>Greek,</hi> for <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And onely foreprize's that so monstrous contradiction to all our Faculties, is the <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> into the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the <hi>Test</hi> runs thus:
<q>And that the <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> or any other <hi>Saint,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> as they are now used in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are <hi>Superstitious</hi> and <hi>Idolatrouus.</hi>
                  </q>
The Bishop thus:
<q>That the <hi>Invocation</hi> of the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Saints,</hi> is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
                  </q> Leaving out <hi>Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and as <hi>in the Church of Rome,</hi> and for <hi>Superstitious</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> putting in the word, is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though greater exactness in this Proposition, had been more becoming; yet, I must confess in my own sense, the Amount is the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>These things being thus adjusted, how empty of sound Sense and Reason must that Tragical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, that follows, be in; of the Monstrousness, and Inhumaneness of the Barbarity, that could never have entred into the Thoughts of any Man, but the Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author, to oblige the whole Nobility of a Nation, to swear to the Truth of such abstruse and uncertain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, which they neither <hi>Do,</hi> nor <hi>Can,</hi> nor <hi>Ought</hi> to understand; and this upon the Penalty of forfeiting the Priviledges of their Birth-right.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of the same Nature is, That which comes after, for what immediately follows, I will be, as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in, as the Argument it self is, as also in the two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Burgesses</hi> of <hi>Oxon.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But those Words, (<hi>viz.</hi> what is meant by <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> is altogether unknown to the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> being onely the Wars between <hi>School-men,</hi> who have quarrelled about nothing more, than the Notion of <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50209:19"/>
it is more uncapable to impose upon the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> to <hi>Abjure</hi> a thing that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impossibl for them to understand; and therefore it must be a profane <hi>Affront</hi> to Almighty God in whose Presence they <hi>Swear,</hi> and shews men will <hi>Swear</hi> to any thing before the <hi>Searcher</hi> of Hearts, rather than lose any Worldly interest) are to be cast into the main Heap.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Together with all this, an <hi>Appeal</hi> is subjoyn'd to the <hi>Honourable Members</hi> of both <hi>Houses,</hi> whether they have any distinct <hi>Idea,</hi> or Notion in their minds, about what they <hi>Renounce</hi>; and that if every man gave his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> it would be a <hi>Babel</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is what is declaim'd with relation to the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, on which Fallacie the <hi>Historical</hi> Account of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> design'd certainly on purpose to amuse, for it doth not <hi>add</hi> one <hi>Cubit</hi> to the <hi>Stature</hi> of the Argument, above, and beyond what is here summ'd up.</p>
               <p>Taking therefore the words of the <hi>Test,</hi> as they stand in the <hi>Test</hi> it self; I will sum up the Answer in these two Heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. That all the <hi>Abstruseness, Darkness,</hi> and difficultie in the Notion of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and this Bishop's amusing Historie of it, doth not in the lest prejudice the reasonableness of the <hi>Test,</hi> but make it more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</item>
                  <item>II. That the very Point of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is the most reasonabl of all others, to settle the <hi>Test</hi> upon, and the more reasonable, because of the difficultie of that Notion.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Let the first be consider'd with Relation to the most Unknowing, and Uninquiring Men of all, who can be suppos'd to be concern'd in the taking the <hi>Test.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50209:19"/>
the word made common <hi>English</hi> to them, which very ordinary use does to most Men in the <hi>Nation,</hi> much more to any likely to be concern'd, whether they can sound the Word, or hammer the Notion or not, is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; For still, what is more easy then to declare their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> according to their Senses; and that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> that they see before the Words of <hi>Consecration,</hi> and in which they are agreedly not mistaken, are the same <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> after <hi>Consecration.</hi> Who would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to <hi>Declare,</hi> and <hi>Profess,</hi> they <hi>Believe</hi> it so? and that it is unchang'd, <hi>Vntransubstantiated</hi> into the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of a <hi>Human</hi> Body. Let a Man be Unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd, Unprepossess'd, and what the least Shade of Doubt could fall upon him in this Matter? Call in Thousands together, to observe the Progress from the beginning to the end of the <hi>Celebration</hi>; And would they not consent upon <hi>Oath,</hi> that they fully believed there was no such <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi> Let but their minds be free, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd, unperplex'd, and the whole world of <hi>Touch,</hi> of <hi>Taste,</hi> of <hi>Sight,</hi> of <hi>Smell,</hi> of <hi>Hearing</hi> (so far as hearing can have interest in the trial) would be at perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning it, their minds and understandings judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the senses alike in all.</p>
               <p>Let such persons hear there are many Disputes, and much variety of Opinions concerning it; and how little would it affect them, except with wonder at the folly and madness of any difference?</p>
               <p>And let them know, some of the wisest and most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in the World, are of their Opinion, or rather of their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> by their senses, although there are others of a contrary Opinion, men of Name too for Knowledg and Learning; and it is easie to know whose minds they would be of, <hi>viz.</hi> of theirs whose Learning and Senses go together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50209:20"/>Thus let the thing be brought within the Verge of <hi>Scripture-judgment,</hi> and upon that so very controverted; <hi>This is my body,</hi> and discussed before the most plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial apprehensions; and let the general manner of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> expressing it self oft in familiar <hi>Figures</hi> be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: They would easily conclude on the side of their <hi>Senses,</hi> and that <hi>Scripture</hi> intended no violence on their <hi>Faith,</hi> against their <hi>Senses,</hi> on the side of so incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible a change of the <hi>Elements</hi> into a <hi>Humane Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing but the charms or inchantments rather of a false Religion, and the <hi>Sorcery</hi> of it, which are the things to be discover'd by the <hi>Test,</hi> the slavery of an <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> (except under the terror of a severe <hi>Persecution,</hi> for a contrary Perswasion) can endanger any mans falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such an unaccountable, wilful, professed blindness.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Test</hi> therefore requires not onely the easiest, most unperplexed Assent, Belief, and Declaration, but that which all Mankind with violence runs into (if not <hi>bewitcht</hi> with <hi>Superstition</hi>) upon the lest motive of apprehension about the matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If sense goes thus far with the plainest and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking men, how much more doth Reason and rational Faith assure the thinking and intelligent? who not onely by Sense determine the Bread is Bread, and the Wine Wine; but know, it can be no other, and the whole circle of <hi>Absurds,</hi> that crowd in upon the change into the Body and Blood of Christ, that have been so often arang'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such a Figment, encompass them, that with highest reason and assurance, they can <hi>declare</hi> their Belief, as the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Test</hi> requires them to do.</p>
               <p>Whatever then may be the various shapes this <hi>Proteus,</hi> or <hi>Camelion</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> hath put on through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the long <hi>Historie</hi> of the <hi>Metamorphos'd</hi> Notion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dress of Representation, the Eloquence of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50209:20"/>
the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiastics,</hi> or the <hi>Difficiles Nugae</hi> or the vain curiosities and subtilties of the <hi>School-men</hi> have Attyr'd it in; the sincere honest mind, and the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Christian, leaving all the cramping Difficulties of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to its Slaves, can <hi>declare</hi> freely with the <hi>Test,</hi> There is not any <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> of Bread and Wine, in the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> into the Body and Blood of Christ. Whatever spiritual Communion there may be between Christ in his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>true Believer,</hi> is most humbly in the mean time owned and prayed for: which is the first thing that was to be shewn.</p>
               <p>The second Head is, That the very point of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> is of all others the most reasonable to settle the <hi>Test</hi> upon, and the more reasonable in all regards, because of the so exceeding difficulty of the Notion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What can a civil Power have greater indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, or be more willing to settle upon, as an exclusive <hi>Test</hi> of all from places of Honour, Trust, and Power; than the being Vassals to such an Imposture as destroys all the Truth and Certainty that is in the World? Who can be believ'd upon <hi>Oath,</hi> (which the <hi>Apostle</hi> says is the end of all strife) if there be no more credit to sense, then that <hi>Bread</hi> may be a <hi>Humane Body,</hi> and <hi>Wine Blood,</hi> though it hath all the evidences to sense possible, it is what it judges it to be, and that is <hi>Bread</hi>? And what more heed can be given to Reason, if its main Foundations can be thus overturn'd, so that all the principles of Government, and humane Converse, are overthrown? What may not such Bigots be screwed into, who leave themselves naked of the defences of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> at the Command of a <hi>tyrannic Church,</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> and become meer Tools in such Hands? Who can concredit to them the Interest of their Country, who couch down like Asses under such a Burden, and especially for a Notion so dark and slippery,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50209:21"/>
that no one knows where to have it? And what would become of humane Commerce, if such Things multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> the <hi>Test-Act</hi> doth most deservedly fall; because, when the foundations of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason, and common Sense are laid, Religion, and the Reason, and Honour of that, as it is National, comes next to be consider'd? that it may bear up it self, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite both the People of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and even the <hi>Nations</hi> round about, to a just veneration of it: But <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> being made the great, and most tremendous <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, yet carrieth in the very judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sense, the Countenance, mean, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the most notorious Cheat, and Juggle, that the Name of Religion ever offered to the World; for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most contemptible, poor, and low outside onely, without the least of Power, or Puissance, or any the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest resemblance of a <hi>Miracle</hi>; demands a Belief of the Highest, and most constant <hi>Miracle,</hi> daily to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the most Profligate oftentimes, and most Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Mankind, and depending upon their Intention too, which may defeat the <hi>Miracle.</hi> All this dishonours the very Name of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and is so heavy, and intollerable a Gabel, Excise, and Tax upon the Religious Sense of Mankind, as must needs eat out the whole Life, Power, and Reverence of it. And therefore it is worthy the <hi>Notice, Prevention</hi> and <hi>Correction</hi> of so grand an Assembly, as the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Lords, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> met in <hi>Parliament</hi>; and the Seclusion of all Persons from so sage and awful a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, who are under so great a Slavery, as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it: For as <hi>Moses</hi> testifies, The wife Laws of a <hi>Nation</hi> in Religion give it an Estimation of a <hi>Wise, Great,</hi> and <hi>Honourable Nation.</hi> If therefore a <hi>Parliament</hi> secures

               <p>And whereas this <hi>Transubstantitaion</hi> is attempted to be brought into Parallel, and placed in the Rank of other great Mysteries of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as of the <hi>Blessed Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit, One God,</hi> of the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Jesus Christ, besides the Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick difference of the one, and of the other: There is this vast distance, That those Supreme <hi>Revelations</hi> are Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, Divine, retir'd in Meditation, Holy Rational Discourse, and Spiritual Adorations. But this of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> while it does nothing, offers nothing to Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Reason, or so much as to Faith from <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> but by <hi>Gross Letter,</hi> a <hi>Figurative, Spiritual</hi> Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into condensating, pressing, and incrassating, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to a real Operation, or conversion of Bread into the Body without any such thing.

Here have been the so-much unheard-of Barbarities and Inhumanities, that would make a <hi>Historie</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> Truth, indeed, could it be had, worth th' having, to justifie the <hi>Test,</hi> and such a one, that certainly could never upon the Account of so blessed a <hi>Religion,</hi> and of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of such infinite Grace, as that of Jesus Christs <hi>Offering himself once for all</hi> for Mankind, have entred into the Heart of any Man; were it not that such a very detestable <hi>Bestial</hi> Power, that bears at this very time, and hath long born a <hi>Citie,</hi> or <hi>False Church,</hi> in which wil be found the <hi>Bloud of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that is <hi>Drunk</hi> with the <hi>Bloud of Saints, and of the Martyrs of Jesus,</hi> is made known unto us in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all this is matter of known <hi>Historie,</hi> and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident <hi>Fact</hi>; How justly therefore is Power, and Trust, endeavour'd to be surprized by a <hi>Protestant Parliament,</hi> from such hands that dare not disown Principles so dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b le dyed in Bloud, on the account of which such <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,</hi> and Burnings of Men alive, have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that the so mis-stil'd Barbaritie and Inhumanitie of the Test-Act compared herewith, is not only Mercie andHonor to the Persons concerned, but a Monument of greatest Equitie and <hi>Philanthropie</hi> or Love to Humane Nature,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50209:22"/>
to endeavour to extinguish out of the <hi>Nation</hi> the very Principles of so much Bloud-Guiltiness, and Bloud-Thirst, of the greater heinousness, becaus if the <hi>Bishop</hi> be to be credited in the Case, it was for not believing a <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which it was <hi>Morally impossible for those Martyrs to know,</hi> and such abstrusities which they neither <hi>did,</hi> nor <hi>could,</hi> nor indeed <hi>ought</hi> to understand.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50209:23"/>For what is meant by <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself says, is altogether unknown and uncertain, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the persons chiesly concern'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi>; and which they neither <hi>do, can,</hi> nor <hi>ought to know:</hi> What obligation can they then have to <hi>believe</hi> it, except with such a blind <hi>Faith</hi> as all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reason abhors? However, if they have no <hi>Faith</hi> concerning so fugitive a thing, that like a shadow, cannot be catch'd, or like the Phantom of a Body that hath no <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>bones</hi> to be <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>felt,</hi> as all Bodies have, and as Christ, as it were <hi>prophetically,</hi> expos'd <hi>his Body</hi> to the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, when it was really there, that no such Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture concerning it should be palm'd upon the World: I say, if the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> have no <hi>Faith</hi> of such a thing, why may they not <hi>profess</hi> and declare, they do not <hi>believe</hi> it?</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Bishop</hi> seems either not to be awake, or to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble a slumber, that his Discourse of mens <hi>swearing to any thing,</hi> his Burlesque on the <hi>famous Burgesses of Oxon,</hi> and his Appeal to the <hi>Honourable Members</hi> concerning their <hi>Idea's</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Babel</hi> thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising, [the whole Notion is indeed a <hi>Babalism,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to <hi>Babylon the Great</hi>] had been very good, if the <hi>Test</hi> had requir'd them to declare their <hi>belief</hi> of such a <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> But now his Arguments hunt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and impeach the <hi>Roman Tyranny</hi> of horrid Murthers upon persons, for not <hi>believing</hi> what they neither <hi>do, can,</hi> nor <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>know,</hi> what they can so hardly <hi>pronounce</hi> the <hi>sound</hi> of, much less <hi>hammer</hi> the sturdy sullen <hi>Notion</hi> it self: For who can know what there is no knowledge of? But what more innocent than to <hi>declare,</hi> when lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, though before the <hi>Searcher of Hearts,</hi> a man does not <hi>believe</hi> what he cannot nor ought to know, nor so much as anvil a Notion of? If it were never so true,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50209:23"/>
real, knowable, and worthy to be <hi>believed,</hi> any one might, without guilt, (when justly demanded to do so) <hi>declare</hi> he did not <hi>believe</hi> it, while he <hi>knew</hi> it not so as to find reason to <hi>believe</hi> it; it were double Hypocrisie to do otherwise: and all the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s arguing and <hi>storying,</hi> can never make it otherwise. Indeed the whole recoyles upon himself, and dashes out the brains of all he hath writ upon it; which, sure, he crasly oversaw, or thought all his Readers were such Fools as to be couzen'd with the gloss.</p>
               <p>For if the infidelitie were ever so culpable, it were a Dutie, when <hi>adjur'd</hi> by a <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> it; but how can the infidelitie be blam'd, when after the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s hunting down the <hi>Notion</hi> through the whole <hi>Historie</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,</hi>
                  <q>He hath prey'd only upon a Ghost, miss'd of all <hi>comprehension,</hi> and he pronounces the summ, and result of all to be what is meant by that <hi>Transubstantiation is a thing altogether uncertain and unknown</hi>; and there is no one thing in which <hi>Christendom</hi> more both agrees and differs; all Parties agree in the Thing, and differ in the manner.</q>
Now it so happens, the <hi>Test</hi> was so sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously compos'd, though it might lawfully have done much more, that it modestly leaves the Thing free, and requires only to declare a Belief of such Manner of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> as of the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> into the <hi>Bodie</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of Christ; and requires the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> own <hi>Belief</hi> alone, and nothing of censure upon any others <hi>Belief</hi> in this branch of the <hi>Test</hi>; which surely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man may lawfully make, that makes it truly: and seeing the whole Issue of the Notion is <hi>Scepticism,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself being Judg, (and <hi>what can the man do that comes after the ishop?</hi>) may not every man then say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I do not comprehend it, therefore I do not believe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50209:24"/>Indeed if there were <hi>Revelation</hi> for it, like what there is concerning the <hi>Father, Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit, one God</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Hypostatic Vnion</hi> of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word</hi> with Humane Nature, leaning not on figurative expression, but plain assertion, wrought into all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and whole Argument of Scripture, all Disputes were silenc'd.</p>
               <p>But when there is no pretext of <hi>Revelation,</hi> but such a manner of speaking, as if it were press'd alike into a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense, through the whole Book of God, it must over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all <hi>Theologie.</hi> To refuse then a <hi>Figure</hi> there where it is so absolutely necessary, that else Christ must eat his own <hi>flesh,</hi> while it remain'd entire before the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and drink his own <hi>bloud,</hi> while it was circulating in his Veins, and no amaze nor so much as question upon it, is such a setting the Scripture to be broken upon the Wheel, such a Barbarity, as exceeds a thousandfold all the <hi>Barbarities</hi> and <hi>Inhumanities</hi> spoken of throughout the Bishop's whole Book: Especially when our Lord declares in a like manner of speaking, and doubts upon it; <hi>His words were spirit and life,</hi> and the <hi>flesh profited nothing.</hi> Why then should men bring the Scripture to the Engine, to torture it into the confession of what (as God speaks) <hi>never came into his heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so I may fairly dismiss the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s longsom <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> seeing the mouth of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non turns upon himself for what he can; and what should a man be shie of in <hi>declaring</hi> his <hi>Non-belief</hi> of what is against all the sense and reason of mankind, what hath no ground in <hi>Revelation,</hi> and what all the Wits and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties the <hi>Canonists</hi> and <hi>School-men,</hi> yea the very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the <hi>Roman</hi> Vassalage can, when set upon the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most stretch, make nothing of, but a meer <hi>Babel,</hi> if we may believe the Bishop, in what he determines upon the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50209:24"/>
whole search in favour of it. Not like <hi>Solomon's conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the matter</hi> into the <hi>whole of man,</hi> but like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of <hi>Babel,</hi> all was <hi>Jargon, Nonsense, Confusion,</hi> and <hi>Rubbish</hi>; and worse than that, the conclusion will be like that of <hi>Babylon</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> a perpetual Desolation and Burning.</p>
               <p>They therefore who have like Slaves <hi>bor'd their Ears</hi> to this <hi>spiritual Egyptian slavery,</hi> and under the <hi>Plague</hi> of its <hi>Darkness</hi> to be <hi>even felt,</hi> how just is it to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them from taking the Rights of their <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> into their <hi>trust,</hi> whether their contented <hi>Slavery</hi> rise from some weak part, or a worse depravedness, which inclines their always <hi>bowed down Backs,</hi> and their Eyes laden with slumber under such a monstrous <hi>Bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come therefore to consider of the second Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which, however it runs in the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Text, is thus express'd in the <hi>Test:</hi>
                  <q>And that the <hi>Invocation</hi> or <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or any other <hi>Saint,</hi> and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass,</hi> as they are now used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are <hi>superstitious</hi> and <hi>idolatrous.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In which, although I confess in my own Judgment, the very Extremity, as of Sense, that the words can reach, are supported by the demerit of the things <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> against: Yet, because it is a <hi>Test,</hi> publickly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the refusal of which suspends so great an Interest, as all share in Government, as the <hi>Bishop</hi> expresses it. It will not be unfit to observe all the Lenitives, that are by the Prudence of the Composers, (whoever they were, it makes no matter) contriv'd into it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therfore, <hi>I do believe</hi> is prefix'd to the whole <hi>Test,</hi> by common Equity of <hi>Construction</hi> to be supplyed. I do believe the first Proposition, <hi>That in the Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. And in the second, <hi>I do believe,</hi> that the <hi>Invocation,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50209:25"/>
Now it is Evident, a Man may Swear to his own <hi>Belief,</hi> if he knows he does really so <hi>Believe,</hi> although he be mistaken in the grounds of his <hi>Belief,</hi> because it is onely matter of Fact within himself.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Limitation, <hi>As these things are us'd, and now us'd in the Church of</hi> Rome, whether by express Command, or by Approbation, or Connivence; so that the very grossness and stupidity of the most Dull and Ignorant, who stick in the very thick Matter, and are able to extricate themselves, as the finer Wits pretend to do, are to be taken into that <hi>Vsage,</hi> and that most Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously, seeing if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> leads such unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and unapprehensive Persons in Obedience to it, to the very brink of the Precipice into so deep, and impure a Mud, and that so unnecessarily; it is to be chang'd with the <hi>Vsages,</hi> as in it self.</p>
               <p>And then those words of the <hi>Test, As it is now used</hi>; sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the first beginnings of these things were not so fresh, as now they are arriv'd to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that, the word <hi>Superstitious</hi> is first set, as the lesser, and most undoubted, and then not the downright full-out word <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> It takes off the full Blow of the Censures, for <hi>Idolatry</hi> imports a great danger, suspicion, and nearness to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Idolatry</hi> it self. And this the <hi>Bishop</hi> ought in all candid dealing to have taken Notice of, and to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Caution, with which the <hi>Test</hi> is worded; for the <hi>Stabbing,</hi> and <hi>Cut-throat</hi> word <hi>Idolatry</hi> is not used, and so the Piquancy of that his remark false.</p>
               <p>But letting slip all things that do not enter into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the matter, it is first to be observed, that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and in earnest, all that dreadful Representation of the punishment of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in this World, is disown'd by all sober Christians: and those rigid Laws, or any such
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50209:25"/>
                  <hi>Zelotic</hi> Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> as among the <hi>Jews</hi> on the account of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> are reversed under the milder temper, and more moderate climate of Christian Religion, and the compassionate Spirit of it, as repeated by <hi>our Saviour</hi> expresly in those words to the <hi>Disciples,</hi> that were for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Fire from Heaven upon the Samaritans,</hi> Luke 9.54. To which our Lord rejoyned, <hi>Ye know not what spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ye are of: the Son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We disown all such torrid <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> where-ever it is found, upon this Authority, and such <hi>Ravagings</hi> upon the Lives of men meerly for their (notwithstanding so great) delusions in so plain a point of Divine Worship, are not so much as thought of in the <hi>Test:</hi> Cruelties and inhumanities of that kind, are left as the proper Inheritance of the Idolatrous, who indeed cut Throats, and cause innocent Persons <hi>to pass through the Fire</hi> alive, in the rage of their <hi>Moloch-Sacrafice</hi>: And I am fully perswaded the principal end of the <hi>Test-Act</hi> was to secure the Lives and Fortunes of a <hi>Protestant Nation</hi> from the fury and blood-thirstiness of that name of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by which it is as much known (as the <hi>Scarlet</hi> and <hi>Purple</hi> it is arraied in) and that in the <hi>Historie</hi> of some Ages past, and so cannot but be still suspected.</p>
               <p>The prevention indeed of such, the public practise of those <hi>Superstitions</hi> and <hi>Idolatrousnesses,</hi> is worthy the care of a <hi>Protestant Magistracy</hi> to prevent, and to take care the Contagion may not spread, much less that a <hi>Protestant Kingdom</hi> should come under the Girdle of its Ministerial Government, (although with all <hi>Loyalty,</hi> it owns their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> according to the Christian Law, and of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) and then for to set such Bounds to it, as may most indemnifie it self.</p>
               <p>But for the securities of Divine Justice upon <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whenever they com to be manifested; they wil be just, and bring their conviction along with them; which may be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50209:26"/>
speedier than men are aware, the <hi>Measure</hi> of <hi>Iniquity grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now full,</hi> as of more then one God, is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> so of more than <hi>one Mediator</hi> is a <hi>Parallell Idolatry.</hi> And as letting fall any glances of Respect upon any Creature, Person, or Thing, Angel, or Diamon, Sun, Moon, or Stars, or the inferiour Creatures, as partial Gods conveying the Benifits of the Supreme God to us, is foul <hi>Idolatry:</hi> so any partial or inferiour <hi>Mediators,</hi> are alike <hi>Idolatry,</hi> under the Gospel. And as the making to our selves any <hi>likeness</hi> either in <hi>Heaven above,</hi> or the <hi>Earth beneath,</hi> &amp;c. as a <hi>Medium</hi> to Worship God by: so the making to our selves any <hi>likeness</hi> of the <hi>Mediator</hi>; (For though we <hi>had known him after the flesh, yet</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we know him so no more.</hi>) are alike <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> How certainly then are the <hi>Invocations</hi> of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> of <hi>Saints Idolatrous,</hi> as giving them a share of the incommunicable Mercy, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisciency, Omnipresence, seeing they are not visible to us, we cannot speak with them at certain times or places, we know them not, we know not they know us; there are no kinds of Communion between us; a Vail of thick Darkness is spread betwixt us, which nothing but <hi>Infinity</hi> can pierce. The Infinity of the Father, the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Mediator, <hi>God-man:</hi> Men indeed whom we see, whom we converse with, to whom we can make our selves and our condition known, we are allowed by God to Address, to give and receive mutual Religious Respects, and of Civility and Kindness, according to the Stations of Honour and Subordination we stand in one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But how both Senseless, and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> would it be with hope of good to pray to any Person upon Earth, at great, or even at the smallest distance one from another, where no Communication passes by Word, Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Letters, as in our private Closets, and Thoughts;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50209:26"/>
this were to make them, as God Omniscient, Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And to pray to Saints or Angels, as <hi>Mediators,</hi> is <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed against the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as if he had not that whole Sum of <hi>Mediatorial</hi> Mercy, Grace, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in himself. How certainly then are their <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> continually us'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> not only <hi>Superstitious,</hi> but <hi>Idolatrous</hi>: And indeed all <hi>Superstition</hi> is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> against the <hi>Second Commandment</hi>; Devising an <hi>Image,</hi> a <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to go to God by them.</p>
               <p>How certainly are those abundance of <hi>Images, Pictures, Statues, Representations,</hi> us'd at <hi>Rome:</hi> Their <hi>Incensing, Bowing, Kneeling, uncovering the Head,</hi> to <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> us'd at <hi>Rome, Idolatrous?</hi> For even <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>Mouth</hi> kissing <hi>his Hand, was an Indication</hi> sufficient of an <hi>enticed Heart.</hi> Their <hi>Elevation, Adoration, Geniflexian,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Bread,</hi> as the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> are of the same guilt, seeing <hi>Christ</hi> was never Worshipped Bodily on Earth, when his Apostles were daily with him, but in the Emanations of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> how much more (now we are <hi>to know him no more after the flesh</hi>) therefore are we not to Worship him Bodily, not in an Imaginary <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi>) into <hi>Flesh:</hi> Doth not he abhor such a Worship?</p>
               <p>For whatever we do in pretence of Worship to God and Christ, that is not either the pure Issues of that <hi>Law</hi> of the Mind, or of the Natural Conscience it self, or is revealed to us in his Word: The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (call it how you will, <hi>Dulia,</hi> or an inferiour Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) not so warranted, passes before God for no other, but <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Even the Worship of the <hi>Man Christ Jesus</hi> onely, as united to the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> is justified by Divine <hi>Revelation:</hi> so tender and severe a thing is the Worship of the <hi>Holy Jealous God,</hi> who as he is separated from all Creatures in his Purity and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so in his Worship, and tne manner of his Worship ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50209:27"/>
only by himself. And so <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely separate from all Creatures is <hi>IEHOVATH</hi> the <hi>Mediator,</hi> with whom none can be named; even as none can know but by the Revelation of the Father. All Worship therefore given to <hi>Creature-Mediators,</hi> all Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship given to him not according to his Word, is but <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> in his Account.</p>
               <p>How near therefore is it to the <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> of which the Author confesses, Idolatry is a principal instance; when he speaks of the <hi>Cherubins</hi> being <hi>worshipp'd</hi>; who indeed, had by God's immediate Command, a Place of Attendance, by the <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi>: this Type of <hi>Christ,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which God filling the Tabernacle, and so the Temple after with his Glory, that none could enter, and so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave a remaining Symbol of his Presence there; but likewise of God to be seen; but the People are warn'd over and over, to take notice they saw no Likeness or Similitude of God; nor is there the least shadow of any direction of Worship to those <hi>Cherubins</hi>; but to that God, who was pleas'd to promise his Presence there, where his Glory had appear'd, in Christ the propitiation; so that by pure spiritual Acts, they might pray towards that place, <hi>call'd by his Name,</hi> without any prophaning God by sense: From which he is always in an infinite retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for sense is the Foundation of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably what was in the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> not being seen, was a warning to retire all into a spirituality, and a sense of the incomprehensibleness of God, the enjoyment of him being in pure spirituality.</p>
               <p>And as false it is, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> speaks onely of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Worshipping</hi> the Heavenly Body.</p>
               <p>For from the heights above, to what is most below, <hi>the changing of the Glory of the incorruptible God, with any corruptile Image,</hi> or the Worship directed by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any <hi>Image,</hi> is Abomination to him, as in number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50209:27"/>
places of Scripture <hi>(besides the Second Commandment)</hi> particularly <hi>Duet.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23. For that I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe my eyes in reading the <hi>Bishop's</hi> Definition of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and so it is as to the Redeemer, or one Mediator, who is not to be worshipped, by any <hi>Image</hi> of his <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> nor by so despicable a Thing as <hi>Bread,</hi> which he made only the <hi>Element</hi> of a spiritual Communication of himself, as a most familiar Emblem, without the least design of Worship to it, most abhorred by him.</p>
               <p>Most false it is, therefore, that there is no <hi>Idolatry</hi> if Men do not worship <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>false Gods,</hi> or make <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Images of his divine Nature:</hi> For <hi>Angels,</hi> thô his <hi>Servants,</hi> and <hi>Saints departed,</hi> become <hi>false Gods,</hi> and Names of Blasphemy, when <hi>worshipped</hi> with any sort of <hi>Worship,</hi> as the <hi>Apocaliptick Angel</hi> testifies, <hi>chap.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 22. and the <hi>Host</hi> so worshipped, is the Symbol of <hi>a false God,</hi> as turn'd into a <hi>Likeness,</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> before the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, and Mediator, who will have all pure Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in the Worship of them.</p>
               <p>And yet in the mean time, I must acknowledge that the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath rightly observed concerning that <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which he is willing to allow to be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> viz. the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the heavenly</hi> Bodies (and I am sure it will follow of all other Idolatry, that it is to be proportionably admea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd to) <hi>It is an iniquity to be punished by a Judge,</hi> viz. By the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> And this determination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Idolatry, is recorded in that admirable Book of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> Now the Laws of <hi>Natural Religion</hi> are <hi>irreversible,</hi> and unchangeable; so that were it not that in the great degeneracie of humane Nature, the generality of the Nations of the World were early drench'd, and even plung'd in this great evil, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Laws had always so prevail'd: Whereas, alas, too too soon that Government grew to weak too establish it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50209:28"/>
self; and were that Government, the Government of the <hi>Law, written</hi> in <hi>Mans Heart</hi> restor'd, it must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with all Efficacy to the extirpating this Evil; and where it was so much restored, as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and enforced with further Positive and Ceremonial Sharpness of Laws, the Rigors on Offenders were so great, as the <hi>Bishop</hi> has Recounted: But yet the mercy of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> is such, that although in Governments able and equal for it, there ought to be no abatement of Severity against the Sin it self, yet there is by Christ, a Relaxation, as to Persons Lives, where the most guilty Circumstances of Presumption, Obstinacy, Danger of bad Example, do not inflame the Account of the Evil: All means of Conversion and Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first used; which is a great justification of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and necessity of the <hi>Test,</hi> in a <hi>Protestant</hi> Government. Nevertheless, the generality of the Sin, hath been at no time too big for Divine Vengeance; but that it hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from Heaven upon <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Powers, and Nations, when he saw good; And the time is approaching, when a better State of the renewed World growing on, will, by degrees, but with signal <hi>Vials</hi> powred out upon the whole Race of <hi>Idolaters</hi> and their <hi>Idolatries,</hi> make way for the perfection of that Renovation, and such a thing as <hi>Idolatry</hi> will not in one single example be endured. For <hi>Satan,</hi> that old <hi>Serpent,</hi> that hath deceiv'd the <hi>Nations</hi> into it so long, will be seal'd up into his own <hi>Abyss</hi> at the same time. <hi>But this hath been by way of Digression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is time to return now to the just <hi>Remarks,</hi> that are to be made upon the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Discourse upon <hi>Idolatry</hi>; so contriv'd, as to lead the Unthinking, yea, the not closely observant Reader, thorough a Variety of Matter, far off from suspecting the <hi>Roman</hi> Worship of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> where yet <hi>Scripture-Prophesie</hi> hath settled it upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50209:28"/>
its own <hi>Base,</hi> in that Land that is <hi>Spiritually</hi> called <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> or <hi>Mystical Babylon:</hi> His Discourse, indeed, is blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded sometimes with better, that it may convey more Artificially the intollerably bad, sometimes with things doubtful and uncertain, that the notoriously False may hope to skulk among them.</p>
               <p>I cannot, according to the brevity I have resolv'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail to the Reader, so ambagious, or tedious an Account of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> There are two things among his own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if he had taken his Measures by, they would have steerd him much better, <hi>viz. First,</hi> The observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Great Care</hi> God took by all his Dealings with his People, <hi>Descendants</hi> from <hi>Abraham,</hi> to secure them by the Mosaick Mediatorship in the acknowledgment of the <hi>One God, Creator of Heaven and Earth,</hi> the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and most Natural Standard against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> together with those particular assurances of himself to them; by his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> by bringing them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> speaking to them out of the <hi>Cloud,</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by his filling the Tabernacle with his Glory, which is especially to be remark'd, both in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Tabernacle, and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, as being the true Reason of the <hi>Worship</hi> toward the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> the observation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as a peculiar Commemoration of the <hi>Creation,</hi> as also of the further Manifestation of the same true God, <hi>Creator</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> who was so particularly the God of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Posterity.</p>
               <p>Had these two Observations, together with the Types, which the Episcopal Author, with Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> and other Learned men, not without Reason, make Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between <hi>Israel</hi> and the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Nations, and their <hi>Idolatries</hi>; or, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it, <hi>Partition-Wall</hi>; these would have led to the <hi>One Mediator</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>Who</hi> is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50209:29"/>
that very <hi>Propitiation</hi> and <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> of which, that in the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies</hi> was but the Type, and for which Type sake the <hi>Shecinah,</hi> or Glory once came, and sate in its filling the <hi>Temple</hi>; as between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> or Attendant <hi>Angels, Simbolycally</hi> Represented in an Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Posture, stooping down, and prying upon the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-Seat,</hi> as that Type of Christ, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Worshipping</hi>; but the <hi>Spirits,</hi> whom they resemble, would have abhor'd to be <hi>Worshipped</hi>; As he most injuriously to Truth, would bear his Readers in hand, if they would be deceived by him.</p>
               <p>Now, as Redemption parallell's Creation; so the One Mediator, the <hi>One God</hi>; as our Lord himself teacheth. <hi>This is Life Eternal, to know Thee the onely true God,</hi> and whom thou hast sent, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and so the Apostle tells us: <hi>There are Gods many, and Lords many in the World,</hi> Counterfeits of the <hi>One God,</hi> and <hi>One Mediator.</hi> As the <hi>Heathenish Gods,</hi> and <hi>Baalim,</hi> or <hi>Daimons,</hi> who were esteem'd a middle Region of <hi>Gods,</hi> or <hi>Mediators<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to us,</hi> saith he, <hi>There is but One God, the Father of Whom are all things, and we in, or for, or unto him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> So to <hi>Timothy,</hi> There is One <hi>God, and One Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus,</hi> which one God is now known to us, as the <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> which Title drinks up, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype doth the Type of the former Titles, of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. of the God that brought <hi>from Egypt, that sits between the Cherubins:</hi> that <hi>Title,</hi> indeed, of <hi>Creator,</hi> Lord of <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> is not in the least ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eclips'd, but shines together upon, and with, and in the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And as a Testimony and standing Plea of all this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of <hi>Creation,</hi> is remov'd from the <hi>Seventh,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50209:29"/>
into an Union with the <hi>First Day,</hi> the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> or <hi>Lord's Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus there is, as the <hi>Apostle John</hi> speaks, <hi>the true God,</hi> and <hi>eternal Life,</hi> in the very mention of which, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the great <hi>Antichristian Idolatry</hi> coming upon the Christian World in <hi>other Mediators,</hi> (the same thing with other Gods) he makes the Conclusion and Farewel of his Epistle, <hi>little Children, keep your selves from Idols:</hi> and seal's it with a passionate, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>One God,</hi> and this one <hi>Mediator,</hi> we are to worship, and only to know, and <hi>only</hi> to serv, all intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing other <hi>Mediators,</hi> either of Man, or of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as in honour to God, to worship Him, or Jesus Christ by them, join'd with some Ceremonies of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as <hi>Kneeling, Bowing, Incensing, Invoking,</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>Idolatrous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to draw the whole matter of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to a conclusion; I confess, it seems necessary, that whoever takes the <hi>Test,</hi> being, as the <hi>Bishop</hi> truly observes, of the Alloy of an <hi>Oath,</hi> it is necessary he should take it in <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as well as in <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and in <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That any one may so do it, he must carry about him a Gauge, or certain Notion of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and some general knowledge of the Usages of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the <hi>Invocation of the Virgin,</hi> of Saints, the <hi>adoration</hi> of them in <hi>their Images,</hi> with the <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass</hi>; which by a little enquiry will be easily known, if it can be at all unknown to any Persons, who can be suppos'd to have possible obligation to take the <hi>Test:</hi> For the <hi>Roman Church</hi> does not hide its Sin; but carries the Title on its <hi>Forehead,</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> its <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Fornications</hi>; and its <hi>Papal</hi> Prince carries his Names of <hi>Blasphemy, Idolatry,</hi> on her Heads; and it is to be earnestly prayed, these things may not be more vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly known among us, against which the <hi>Test</hi> is one great security.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50209:30"/>To give then in the second place, a very short, and portable Gauge of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> I should chuse to do it best, by all I have said; as encas'd, or ench<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s'd, in the very words, <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> truly explain'd. The first of which imports any religious Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons dead, as if they were now alive, and conversant with us, though above, as the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted or else and (as may most agree) <hi>Super Statutum,</hi> above the Rule and Law of all religious Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> the very Law and Light of Nature, teaching us natural Religion, which consists only in the Religion of the Mind, and expressed only in the most necessary <hi>Rational Latria,</hi> or Service of our Bodies; or else which best explains all Religion to us: <hi>The Word of God</hi>; seeing, there we find nothing of such <hi>Invocation,</hi> or Adoration, so much as in any dark Line of either of these Laws; but much written, as with a Sun-Beam against them, who even knows, and believes the Word of God, may boldly call the usages of <hi>Rome</hi> superstitious.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it is the Service to an Apparition of a God, to our <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>foolish Imagination,</hi> for the <hi>One God,</hi> that <hi>made Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>; or the Apparition of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> besides Jesus Christ, the <hi>One Mediator,</hi> who <hi>redeem'd</hi> us by his <hi>Death:</hi> Both which are against the <hi>first Commandement,</hi> for Idolatry is a worship of any thing whatever that is believ'd to be God, and Christ, from the highest Heavens to the lowestCentre, by any <hi>Image,</hi> or <hi>sensible Representation,</hi> (as against the <hi>second</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.)</p>
               <p>Now he may be sure of this <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whoever consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the <hi>Romish Church, (falsely so call'd)</hi> the <hi>spiritual Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the <hi>City</hi> made of <hi>graven Images</hi>; so certainly that <hi>headed Babylon,</hi> that in the days of <hi>John's receiving the Revelation, reign'd over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> and was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50209:30"/>
then (five of its Governments so notorious in History, being fallen, or gone off from their Principality) under its <hi>sixth King,</hi> the <hi>Heathen Emperor</hi>; and for a <hi>little space</hi> under the <hi>Christian Emperor</hi> its <hi>seventh King,</hi> but <hi>no Head,</hi> and hath been under its <hi>eighth King,</hi> that was of those <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Kings,</hi> who were ever <hi>Heads,</hi> ever since the expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Augustulus</hi>'s Line, the late Emperor, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 475.</p>
               <p>For till <hi>Rome</hi> be utterly destroy'd, and <hi>sink like a Milstone into the Sea</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>eighth King,</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> or <hi>Pope</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall not be utterly destroyed; but <hi>Rome,</hi> and its <hi>eighth King</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall fall within few years, from its <hi>Ten-king'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>All which may be thus demonstrated, the Bounds of the <hi>Prophesies</hi> stand eminent and unmoveable, even to demonstration, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Heathen Empire</hi> therein being at one end, and the final ruin of <hi>Rome</hi> at the other; in the middle just as the short liv'd <hi>Christian Empire</hi> expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, run forty two prophetic Months, or Times of the <hi>Moon,</hi> amounting to 1222 prophetic years, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted from 475, must end 1697.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Rome,</hi> and its so call'd <hi>Church,</hi> is <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Idolatries</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Pope</hi> its <hi>Balam,</hi> or <hi>High Priest,</hi> or <hi>Prophet</hi> carrying it, and so describ'd in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the thing there Prophecied, so fulfill'd in all Eyes, and Ears, in the <hi>Blasphemies of God,</hi> and of all that dwell in Heaven, by these <hi>Idolatries</hi>; that then can be no hazard, if there was liberty to demonstrate the thing, as it may be demonstrated: It would put <hi>Transubstantiation, the Worship of the Virgin, of Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> and its <hi>Sacrifice</hi> out of all Dispute, although the things may be otherwise set, enough beyond Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, yet not so suddenly or surely, as by this <hi>Prophecy</hi> is well explain'd.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, to say all in a word, I cannot but make
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50209:31"/>
great doubt, whether the <hi>Bishop</hi> with so great pretence, and yet such thin <hi>Sophisms</hi> in the room of Reason, and with those Unepiscopal, Unchristian, Ungentile, as well as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Senseless Reflections upon a Person of so great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gravity and Piety in the eyes of the whole Nation, (as Dr. <hi>St.</hi>) did indeed design any more, than to <hi>Ridicule</hi> what he would seem to <hi>Favor,</hi> things so False, so Fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, so Inconclusive, could never else have been so laid together, and to carry, as it were a fresh Remembrance. At the last he concludes his Book under a transparent <hi>Tif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fany,</hi> with a downright Falshood, <hi>viz.</hi> As if the not taking the <hi>Test,</hi> did wrap up the Refusers in a <hi>Conviction</hi> of <hi>Recusancy</hi>; to which purpose he foist's in a part of the <hi>Test-Act,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out what would have convicted him of sensless Fraudulency: For he well knows, not the Refusal of the <hi>Test,</hi> but the Refusal, and yet invading <hi>Offices</hi> contrary to the <hi>Test,</hi> brings any one under that <hi>Conviction</hi>: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore he was in earnest, or in a <hi>Sathanic Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism,</hi> when he writ all this, I much doubt; but if he were, indeed, in earnest, he deserves the Character of the weakest of Men, in a disguise of a Man of Parts and Learning; if not, of the most infidelious and dishonest <hi>Sophister</hi> in the <hi>Lawn</hi> of a <hi>Protestant Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But without any railing Accusation against him, or any such, I pray as I begun, <hi>the Lord rebuke</hi> them.</p>
