            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Beloved friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have of long time with much grief and ſorrow of heart beheld and conſidered your perſons and principles; for whilſt ſome of you excell in many things which are in themſelves good and laudable, you do by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein you ſtand, and by other practices and Doctrines render your ſelves very diſhonourable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Chriſtian Religion. I am ready to acknowledge in you a great deal of Temperance and moderation in the uſe of meat, drink, apparel and other pleaſures and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments; but I wiſh your inſobriety, pride and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in a high conceit of your ſelves and contempt of others, fooliſh boaſtings and braggings were not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous: you are juſt and punctual in bargaining; but are you free from making a prey upon your Neighbour's cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and taking up a ſlander againſt him? You ſay you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66034:3"/>have put away malice, envy and hatred: but where ſhall we find more bitterneſs, reviling and reproachful ſpeeches than in your writings and diſcourſes? You love the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood well and are kind toward them: but you diſown and condemn all, how vertuous and devout ſoever, if in theſe times of the ſhining of your light, they ſubject not themſelves to the yoke of your conduct. You talk much of Chriſt the light: but you ſeem at leaſt to deny his perſon. Your affections are much on things in Heaven within you: but not on things above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God. You are much to be commended for your courage and patience: but highly to be diſcommended for your ſuperſtition and groſs ignorance, whereby you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelves in great part to thoſe labours and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips you undergo. Thus I could in many particulars ſet your vices and defects againſt your vertues and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but it is not my deſign at this time to take a full view of you. And indeed I have found it very fruitleſs to deal with you by way of reaſon and Scripture; for your leading men have ſo ordered the matter, that you will not give ear to the moſt demonſtrative arguments that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; and you accept of the weakeſt reaſon imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on your ſide. And the reaſon is evident; for whil'ſt you look upon your ſelves as lead by an infallible ſpirit, (though it be indeed nothing but the fancy of <hi>George Fox,</hi> or ſome other of your Teachers) you muſt needs reject the cleareſt light that God has given to men or Angels, when it oppoſes your ſentiments. And you are ready with your anſwers of <hi>This is the wiſdom of the world; This is natural underſtanding that knows not the things of God; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the letter or tradition,</hi> and the like. If we will not be put off ſo, but tell you, <hi>we by your own confeſſion have the light within as well as you, and that light tells us thus, and thus contrary to what you aſſert;</hi> O then you tell us,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66034:3"/>
               <hi>alas! you have the light, but you have not been obedient to it; you are not come to plain language; you are ſtill in the cuſtomes of the world, reſpect of perſons;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore you are not to be heeded.</hi> Thus you prove your ſelves to be in the truth, and us to be in errour, not by divine reaſon and holy Scripture, but by the high opinion you have of yourſelves, and your low opinion of others.</p>
            <p>I will not therefore now deal with you ſo much by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from reaſon or Scripture, and depending purely upon the underſtanding and mind; but by ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments whoſe evidence depends moſtly upon the outward ſenſes. And I hope, though you will not allow us to judge whether a mental propoſition be true or falſe, ſence or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; yet you will not deny us capable of determining concerning matters of fact, that are before our eyes. That is to ſay; if you will but allow us competent witneſſes to prove that <hi>George Fox</hi> kill'd a man, ſuppoſing we have ſeen him at noon day thruſt him through the heart with a ſword; or, if not that, you will grant that we can read Engliſh or Greek, that is, not underſtand Engliſh or Greek, but know A. from B. and ſound them when we find them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther A B. and know that A B. is not <hi>Co,</hi> and the like: then upon theſe conceſſions, we will undertake to prove that <hi>George Fox</hi> is a falſe Prophet, a liar or Impoſtor. But if you will not allow us competent witneſſes againſt <hi>George Fox</hi> either in matters of reaſon or ſenſe, then we beg but this favour of you that you will pleaſe to believe your own eyes; and if you will not do that, I hope you will excuſe us from ever believing any thing that you ſay or affirm, and from ever ſpeaking or writing to you any more. But as for thoſe of you that have in the ſimplicity of their hearts by good words and fair appearances been induced to walk in your path, (for to ſuch chiefly do I addreſs my ſelf) I make no queſtion but they will ſee themſelves miſtaken.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66034:4"/>For their ſincerity will oblige them to give their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſome ſatisfying account why they take <hi>George Fox</hi> for a true Prophet, and his Doctrine for infallible as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it is: but it will be impoſſible for them to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any ſuch account againſt the evidence of their ſenſes. As for thoſe of you that are much affected with, and have a good ſhare in the glory and honour which accrue unto them from this ſingular way of knowing all things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better than all other men, I may ſay of you as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to the rich man, <hi>neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is time for me now to begin to make good what I have undertaken, to witt, To prove to your ſenſes that <hi>George Fox</hi> (who is not only a great Patriarch, but alſo in higheſt eſteem among you) is a falſe Prophet, liar or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor. And thus I go about it. If <hi>George Fox</hi> in matters of concernment not only to mens bodies and eſtates but alſo to their ſouls and eternal eſtates, affirm that to be true which to your own eyes is manifeſtly falſe, or that to be falſe which is true, then he is what I have ſaid: But <hi>G.F.</hi> doth ſo oftener than once, twice or thrice. Again, if <hi>G.F.</hi> doth bely not an ordinary perſon, a mortal man or Prince, but God Almighty, our Lord Jeſus and the Holy Ghoſt, then he is much more guilty. Moreover, if he deal thus not only through ſloth or pride or careleſneſs, but alſo through deſign and purpoſe, then he is an Impoſtor with a witneſs. Laſtly, if he doth that which he judges and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in others, and much more than that, then he is much more guilty of that condemnation. <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt; for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt doſt the ſame things.</hi> Rom. 2.1.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe you will not require it of me to bring proof that <hi>George Fox</hi> proſeſſeth himſelf and is eſteem'd by you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66034:4"/>for a Prophet, ſeeing your principle doth not allow any to be of the miniſtery but him or her that hath an immediate revelation, or a Prophet: beſides <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi>

And <hi>G. Fox</hi> himſelf in his Book, intituled, <hi>The great Myſtery of the great Whore,</hi> (which I ſhall animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon,) ſaith, p. 82. <hi>How can ye be miniſters of the ſpirit, and not the Letter, if ye be not infallible? And how can they but delude people that are not infallible,</hi> &amp;c? p. 72. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Is it not blaſphemy for you to ſpeak, and preach</hi> (ſure there is the ſame reaſon of writing) <hi>that which ye have not received from heaven?</hi> Here we ſee we are to expect nothing from <hi>George Fox</hi> but what is infallible, otherwiſe he is a Deceiver and a Blaſphemer. And that we may be confident he will not impoſe, upon us as others do, he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 50. of that Book, <hi>You run into all Abſurdities that give your meaning to Scriptures.</hi> Will not this man be far from falſifying Scripture, who will not ſo much as give his meaning to them? We ſhall ſee that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
            <p>But firſt I muſt ſhew you how ſevere he is in taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Adverſaries miſciting or defective citing of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: For miſciting Scripture ſee <hi>p.</hi> 7. Where he brings in his Adverſary ſaying, <hi>Whoſoever ſaith, he hath no ſin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf,</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>He perverteth the Scripture of John—He wrongs Johns words, and puts</hi> He <hi>for</hi> We. I know not whether this change makes any alteration in the ſence;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66034:5"/>but it's fit we ſhould be exact in theſe matters. He charges his Adverſary with perverting the Scripture upon the ſame account, <hi>p.</hi> 37. and how often beſides I know not. Nay, ſo wonderfully punctual is he in the citing of Scripture that he will not have the pronoun <hi>Ye</hi> expreſſed, where of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it muſt be underſtood: Seep: 188. <hi>And Chriſt did not ſay, deſtroy ye this Temple, thou perverts his words.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he is more nice than wiſe at this turn. Now for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective citations ſee <hi>p.</hi> 75. and 29. They are both to the ſame purpoſe. He cites the Prieſts ſaying, <hi>And the Holy Scripture is able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi> He anſwers among other things; <hi>That ever the miniſters of</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>ſhould ſay, that the Scriptures are able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation, and leave out faith.</hi> It is to be acknowledged a defective citation: but in the mean time (that I may note it by the way) neither doth the putting in of <hi>Faith</hi> make it full, except he add alſo <hi>which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> (See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.) For there may be faith which is not in Chriſt; hence Chriſt ſaith, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1.) <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> But <hi>George</hi> did not care for that. Again, under the head of <hi>Scriptures corrupted by the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> he reckons <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. where <hi>In the Greek Lat. &amp; Eng.

               </gap>. And yet it's doubful whether that is good Engliſh, though it is good Greek. He might have ſpar'd the Tranſlators ſuch a ſmall fault: but indeed among about 22. places of Scripture there vindicated by this Grecian (with whom nothing is more common than falſe Engliſh conſtruction, and oftentimes non-ſence,) from the Tranſlators corruption, 12 or 13. of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

               <hi>in.</hi> But this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation tended to the credit of their beloved Doctrine of <hi>The light within.</hi> Once more for the credit of right citing Scripture. In <hi>p.</hi> 64. he corrects his Adverſary, for not ſpeaking proper like Scripture. <hi>And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is a proof to thee that the Quakers are ſent of God, who ſpeak to thee of the Scriptures right as they are.</hi> I hope then he will give us leave to conclude, they are not ſent of God, if it be apparent they do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And now to the trial. 1. The firſt Scripture which I ſhall pitch upon as miſrecited, (in his language <hi>perverted</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi>) ſhall be that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. the very foundation of all his Doctrine, which he repeats to nauſeating, often times Thrice, ſometimes Four times in one paragraph. Thrice he has it or a great part of it in 8. lines <hi>p.</hi> 21. And he cites it almoſt as often wrong as right. The Scripture runs thus in our Tranſlation: <hi>That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> In the Greek it is <hi>coming,</hi> (not <hi>that cometh</hi>) and ſo if may refer to <hi>light</hi> as well as to <hi>man:</hi> but <hi>George Fox p.</hi> 9. hath it thus: <hi>And John ſaid, Every man that cometh into the world is enlightned.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>which every man that cometh into the world being enlightned, that through it he might believe.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 24. <hi>which every man that cometh into the world is enlightned withal.</hi> See alſo <hi>p.</hi> 11.15. with 20 or 40 more. But now has he obſerved that exactneſs which he requires in others? may there be no difference between <hi>lighteth</hi> and <hi>enlightneth?</hi> and muſt every man of neceſſity be <hi>enlightned,</hi> becauſe the light <hi>lighteth</hi> him? If there were no difference, yet he is faulty according to his own law, for he has changed both the phraſe and the tenſe or time. But there is great difference in that caſe; for example in another word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.—<hi>non knowing that the goodneſs of God</hi> leadeth <hi>thee to repentance:</hi> but we cannot ſay that impenitent hearts
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66034:6"/>of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, are led to repentance, for God is ſaid ſometimes to do that, which is not effected, becauſe he doth all that is fit on his part for the effecting it. So our Lord Chriſt ſaith <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a buſhel, but on a candleſtick: and it giveth light to all that are in the houſe.</hi> And yet if a man ſhut his eyes or have very ſore eyes he ſhall not be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. See alſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.33, and 36.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next ſhall be the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. which he has relation to in <hi>p.</hi> 13. (or elſe I know not where to find it,) where he anſwers thus: <hi>Contrary to</hi> John's <hi>doctrin and Chriſt's, who ſaith, The light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world, is the true light, that men through the light might believe;</hi> and in <hi>p.</hi> 10. cited but now, <hi>that through it he might believe;</hi> notwithſtanding if you take the pains to read it, you will find it thus: <hi>that all men through him might believe;</hi> and read that and the former verſe, and you will perceive that <hi>him</hi> refers to <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and not to the <hi>light,</hi> as <hi>George Fox</hi> would have it. So that he doth not only change the word, but brings in thereby a divers ſence of his own. See <hi>p.</hi> 28. and many other places.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third ſhall be that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. which he cites almoſt as oft as that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. but ſeldom right as it is, but thus or the like: <hi>p.</hi> 11. Anſ. <hi>When as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid, that the light which ſhined in their hearts to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If it be non-ſence I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it. <hi>p.</hi> 21. he ſaith —<hi>which was the work of the true Apoſtles to bring people to the light within, that ſhined in their hearts, to give,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>p.</hi> 41, 59. and 20. places more to the ſame purpoſe. Only in <hi>p.</hi> 59. when he had cited the Scripture after his wonted falſe manner, attributing that to the <hi>light,</hi> which the Text attributes to <hi>God,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Mark! he ſaith, the light is that which gives the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c. What a ſtrange degree of confidence muſt this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66034:6"/>man be arrived at, that he ſhould abuſe his Reader with falſity and bid him <hi>Mark</hi> it too! For the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> has it thus: <hi>For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs hath ſhined in our hearts to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But if he had recited it right, it would then have appeared, not only that God is the giver of light, and the light a gift, but alſo, that it is the light of knowledge, and created; for God commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs by creating it. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3, 4. But <hi>George Fox</hi> likes none of theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, therefore it was his Intereſt to pervert the Text. And becauſe that Text <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. ſeems to have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by him upon the ſame account, that ſhall be</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next. <hi>And have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.</hi> So ſaith Paul; but <hi>George Fox</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 220.) puts <hi>them</hi> in ſtead of <hi>him;</hi> and ſo the Saints muſt be the Antecedent to <hi>Them,</hi> whereas the new man is the Antecedent to <hi>Him,</hi> and ſhews that the new man is created, which <hi>George Fox</hi> is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to allow; for <hi>p.</hi> 10. he corrects his Adverſary for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The light is a creature;</hi> and I take it, he means by the <hi>light</hi> and the <hi>new man</hi> the ſame thing. However this is, the alteration is manifeſt of the words, and of the ſence by reaſon thereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth Scripture ſhall be that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14. where I complain of defect, <hi>p.</hi> 10. for there he makes mention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the words of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes, but in the ſame Character with his own words, but then he changes his Character, whereby he intimates that he cites the very Text, and ſaith, <hi>But the word is night in thy heart, Deut.</hi> 30. Moſes ſaith, <hi>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayſt do it.</hi> To ſay <hi>The word is nigh thee in thy heart,</hi> agrees pretty well with his Doctrine of the <hi>light within:</hi> but to ſay, <hi>The word is in thy mouth and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66034:7"/>in thy heart,</hi> argues that word there ſpoken of is indeed ſuch a word as is wont to be in ones mouth, that is, a word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and that our Author <hi>G. F.</hi> is not willing to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 47. <hi>The word of faith is within, Rom.</hi> 10. This is manifeſt, that in citing this Scripture he leaves out of the middle that which ſeems againſt him, and takes the former part and the latter part that ſeem to be on his ſide. Compare this with what he condemns in his Adverſaries. Now becauſe it follows immediately in the ſame para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of his Books, <hi>p.</hi> 10. that Text in</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Luke</hi> ch. 24. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. ſhall be the ſixth Scripture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his prevarication appears notorious. For he brings in the Prieſt ſaying, <hi>Chriſt was not in his Diſciples, when he ſaid, I am the light of the world.</hi> And <hi>G.F.</hi> corrects him by Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>I in you and you in me.</hi> Then he brings in the Prieſt ſaying, <hi>They that will came to Juſtification muſt go to Chriſts grave without,</hi> &amp;c. And anſwers him by citing <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. as I have ſaid. And then it follows. <hi>And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſaid unto them that went to the grave without, Why ſeek ye the living among the dead, he is riſen;</hi> now the Angel's words run thus: <hi>Why ſeek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is riſen.</hi> So <hi>G. F.</hi> leaves out, <hi>He is not here,</hi> out of the middle of the citation, for that would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown his opinion of Chriſt within and not without: for the Angels would not ſay truth in ſaying, <hi>He is not here,</hi> if he was indeed <hi>there,</hi> even within thoſe that ſought him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Seventh Scripture follows in the ſame paragraph. (So he has abuſed 3. Texts of Scripture in 6. lines.) For it follows, after, <hi>He is riſen, and the Saints ſits with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places.</hi> (We muſt take no notice of the failure in Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax, for that's frequent.) Now <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6.—<hi>and made us ſit together in heavenly [places] in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now there may be a different ſence of <hi>ſitting with Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in him;</hi> for when an Ambaſſador from any State is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66034:7"/>honourably entertained and ſeated, the people of that State may be ſaid to be honourably entertained and to ſit in him, becauſe he repreſents them; but ſcarcely to ſit with him. But whether there be any difference or no in the phraſes, it's certain that <hi>G. F.</hi> chargeth the Tranſlators with corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for putting <hi>with</hi> for <hi>in.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 373. <hi>Jud.</hi> 14. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing of this Scripture in this manner is ſo frequent with him, that though he uſe it perhaps 20 times or more, yet not once (I think) as it is in Scripture. And here give me leave to complain of him, that he deals like a deceitful Chapman, that would not have his wares try'd whether they be good or no, for he hides the Touchſtone, by uſing ſome words of Scripture putting them in a different chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, &amp; ſaying, <hi>The Scripture ſaith,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt ſaith,</hi> or <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith,</hi> &amp;c. but he names ſeldom the Book or Chapter, more ſeldom the verſe; (though he clamour upon his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for Chapter and verſe,) and ſo he impoſeth upon his Reader for Scripture what is no where to be found. Theſe; as I have in ſeveral particulars made it evident before your eyes, and ſhall in many more.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The next ſhall be that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. which he often u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and always abuſeth as far as I remember. Chriſt's words are theſe. <hi>And now O Father, glorify thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> But <hi>G. F.</hi> thus, <hi>p.</hi> 13.—<hi>Chriſt who was glorifyed with the Father before the world began.</hi> You will ſay perhaps his words and Chriſt's are the ſame in ſence: but doth God give <hi>G. Fox</hi> his infallible ſpirit to correct his ſon Chriſt's words? Can he ſpeak better than Chriſt, or are theſe two manners of ſpeaking ſo much the ſame that they cannot be taken in a diverſe ſence? Nay, Doth not <hi>G. Fox</hi> take <hi>his</hi> phraſe in a diverſe ſence from what Chriſt intended by <hi>his?</hi> For it's manifeſt that Jeſus prayed now to be glorified with the glory, wherewith he was not at this time glorified
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66034:8"/>when he ſpake theſe words; for who will pray for that which he enjoys? But God was glorious before the world was, and could not poſſibly want it at this time, ſo as to pray for it; therefore Jeſus intends by the glory which he had with the Father before the world was, the glory which the Father had given him in his decree before the world was; but he had it not yet in poſſeſſion. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.) before they had any actual Being; which ſhould come unto them, and be brought unto them at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 13. And the Evangeliſt tells us expreſly <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39.—<hi>Jeſus was not yet glorified,</hi> But it's evident enough that <hi>G.F.</hi> means by his phraſe to poſſeſs his Reader with an opinion that that which he calls Chriſt, (which is not Jeſus the Son of man) was actually glorified before the world began. And this brings to my mind another phraſe of his, which he uſeth diverſe times, 8. at leaſt, as if it were Scripture, but is ſo far from being Scripture that it will be very difficult for any man to make leſs than a groſs abſurdity of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can ſcarce get leave of my ſelf to refer it to any phraſe of holy Writ.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It runs thus <hi>p.</hi> 66.—<hi>and ſo to the word Chriſt Jeſus: him by whom the world was made before it was made.</hi> Strange! that the world ſhould be made before it was made! I would fain know of him what that world was which was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was made: but I deſpair of Information. But what can you or any man that has not abandon'd both his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and ſence ſay in vindication of this Prophet? Can you match this ſaying in the moſt impertinent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Papiſt or Proteſtant?</p>
            <p n="10">10. A Tenth Scripture is that of <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 10. and 19. <hi>But what they know naturally, as brute beaſts, in thoſe things they corrupt themſelves.</hi> The 19. <hi>v.</hi> thus. <hi>Theſe be they that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66034:8"/>ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the ſpirit.</hi> But how doth our <hi>George</hi> read it? p. 2. and 196. <hi>And the Apoſtle ſaith, What they knew who are ſeparate from the ſpirit, they knew naturally as brute beaſts, Jud.</hi> 10.19. Judge now whether <hi>Jude</hi> ſay as he ſaith! But what's the difference in ſence? <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of notoriouſly ungodly men, who corrupted themſelves in natural things, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah; G.F.</hi> ſpeaks of all men whatſoever beſides thoſe that are inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, theſe men <hi>ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the Spirit;</hi> and <hi>G.</hi> ſaith, They are <hi>ſeparate from the ſpirit,</hi> and they that are ſuch, <hi>what they know they know natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as bruit beaſts.</hi> But what may be the deſign in rendring it thus? you may ſee he oppoſes this Text to his Adverſary aſſerting, that <hi>there is an infallible Judgment which may be made from the Scripture without the ſpirit:</hi> and this Text would not ſerve his purpoſe without thus corrupting it. Beſides he cannot indure that men ſhould be ſaid to know by nature any thing that's good, therefore he takes this courſe to diſparage all ſuch knowledge. But you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I am not bound to give a reaſon why he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts a Text, I am only to ſhow you that he doth ſo.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Next I bring you to <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. which he is pleaſed to cite: the paſſage is this in his Book, <hi>p.</hi> II. Prieſt <q>
                  <hi>The Scripture plainly denies that conſcience can juſtify, though it may condemn.</hi> Anſw. <hi>Which is contrary to plain Scripture, where the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Rom. 2.15. <hi>Their conſciences either accuſing or excuſing?</hi>
               </q> Who would think that <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſhould have either ſo little wit or conſcience as to write in this manner? for the Scripture words are theſe;—<hi>their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> The truth is, <hi>G. Fox</hi> was willing to have this works of <hi>accuſing</hi> and <hi>excuſing</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>light,</hi> and therefore he ſaith by and by, <hi>And the light condemns which you call conſcience:</hi> but becauſe it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66034:9"/>ſerved his turn to attribute it to conſcience, he did. Beſides, the Quakers uſed to ſay, they were out of the thoughts and the imaginations; and upon that account it was not fit for him to recite the Scripture right, ſure I am he doth it wrong.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Let us ſee now what he ſaith of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> for it would be ſtrange if he ſhould ſcape without abuſe. <hi>p.</hi> 2. He makes the Prieſt ſay, <hi>He that can bridle his tongue is not a perfect man.</hi> Anſw. <hi>Which is contrary to the Apoſtle James, who ſaith he is, and ſo thou art out of James's Doctrine.</hi> But where <hi>James</hi> ſaith ſo, I am to ſeek, if he cannot produce it, he belies the Apoſtle. He ſaith indeed <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.2.—<hi>in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man, and able alſo to bridle the whole body.</hi> It may be queſtioned whether every man that can bridle his tongue, doth alſo not offend in word. The ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.26. <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart. this man's religion is vain.</hi> But I dare not ſay, that every one that offends in word, his religion is vain.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>G. Fox</hi> anſwers his Adverſary thus: <hi>p. 9. Corrected by the Apoſtle, who ſaith, he works all in us and for us.</hi> I do not remember where the Apoſtle hath thoſe words, I doubt <hi>G. Fox</hi> is fallible and herein miſtaken. I'le count him ſo, till I can find them. And I muſt ſay the like of that paſſage of his <hi>p.</hi> 15. Prieſt, <hi>There is nothing in man to be ſpoken to but man.</hi> Anſw. <hi>How then miniſtred the Apoſtle to the ſpirit?</hi> I cannot find where the Apoſtle is ſaid to miniſter to the ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The next I will note is in <hi>p.</hi> 9. thus: Prieſt. <q>
                  <hi>The Quakers are deceived becauſe they ſay, Chriſt is within them, kept down by ſomething within them.</hi> Anſ. <hi>Corrected by the Apoſtle who ſaith to the Saints, Chriſt is in you the hope of glory, and he was preſt down as a Cart with ſheaves.</hi>
               </q> It's manifeſt that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Antecedent to <hi>He:</hi> but where is that ſpoken of Chriſt? The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> (not the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66034:9"/>Apoſtle) ſaith in the name of the Lord, <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Behold, I am preſſed under you, as a cart is preſſed that is full of ſheaves.</hi> But it is referred to the Lord or <hi>Jehovah</hi> that brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt, v.</hi> 10. and not to Chriſt. But our Prophet <hi>George</hi> will not allow the Father and the Son to be diſtinct, but all one, (See <hi>p.</hi> 99.)&amp; therefore frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs that to Chriſt which is ſpoken only of God the Father.</p>
            <p n="15">15. So he doth with that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. which he doth us the favour to cite, Chap. and verſe, and to put the words in Scripture Character too: for thus he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 343. <hi>The promiſe is to the ſeed, the ſeed is Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt all and in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28. He's very unhappy both in reciting words and Texts, for the Apoſtle ſaith thus: <hi>And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God(not Chriſt)may be all in all.</hi> He could not have done a greater Injury to the Holy Spirit's words than thus to put <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> for it mades them altogether abſurd; but whither will not the love of a falſe opinion drive men?</p>
            <p n="16">16. Thus where the Scripture ſaith—<hi>and the word was God, G.F.</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 350. and 61. <hi>God is the word, <hi>Jo.</hi>
               </hi> 1.1. I would gladly know of you, my friends, Whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſpirit that leads <hi>G.F.</hi> into all truth, doth not alſo bring things to his remembrance? if it did at the time he wrote this, then he ſailed through wilful diſobedience; if it did not, then <hi>G. F.</hi> is not infallible, for here either his memory or his will fail'd him. And this he is chargeable with, though we ſhould ſuppoſe there were no difference in the ſence: but I conceive there is a difference; for though the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>And the word was made</hi> [or <hi>was] fleſh,</hi> yet no conſiderate man will ſay, <hi>Fleſh is the word,</hi> neither is it in it ſelf true.</p>
            <p n="47">17. It ſeems to proceed from the ſame bitter root in him, that he perverts the ſence by ſo cutting ſhort that Scripture.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66034:10"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. ſaying <hi>p.</hi> 160.—<hi>And immortality, not come to the light, <hi>through the power of God which is the Goſpel.</hi>
               </hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It</hi>
               </hi> [the Goſpel] <hi>is the power of God;</hi> whereas the Apoſtle ſaith indeed, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God unto ſalvation, to every one that believeth,</hi> &amp;c. which is far another thing than to ſay ſimply, The Goſpel is the power of God: for what may not a man make of Scripture, if he will take to himſelf this kind of licenſe? Then may we ſay of the like phraſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. The preaching of the croſs is fooliſhneſs; and fooliſhneſs is the power of God: for the preaching of the croſs is both.</p>
            <p n="18">18. And if it had not been for the confounding of the perſon of the Son with the Father, I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 119. <hi>His father and he is greater then all.</hi> For Chriſt ſaith, Joh 10.29. <hi>My Father which gave them me</hi> [ſpeaking of the ſheep] <hi>is greater then all.</hi> What would you ſay of your Adverſary that ſhould deal thus with your writings, as <hi>G. Fox</hi> deals with Holy Scriptures?</p>
            <p n="19">19. And he that dares thus to add and inſert another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the Text as he hath done in that now named, what marvel is it that he adds the name of a perſon at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether it be right or wrong? Thus doth he <hi>p.</hi> 134. —<hi>and ſo deny Chriſt the Lord that bought them.</hi> He had heard (it's like)formerly that Text (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.) ſo render'd by ſome or other, and therefore it muſt be ſo, though <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith only—<hi>denying the Lord that bought them;</hi> which may agree as well to God the Father, as to Chriſt his Son.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The two laſt Scriptures we noted, we found addition in them; here we have ſubſtraction; which thought it might be pardon'd in another man that appears not to have any deſign in it, or that condemneth not ſeverely the like in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet in him it cannot. If he will quote Scripture why not as it lies plainly? eſpecially when brevity doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66034:10"/>him to do otherwiſe? Thus when he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 165 <hi>Chriſt is come, <hi>to whom every knee muſt how, and tongue confeſs to the glory of God;</hi>
               </hi> why doth he neither add <hi>the father</hi> to the term <hi>God,</hi> nor inſert, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle doth both? for he ſaith, <hi>And that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> But how the truth of this Scripture can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with their Doctrine that ſay, the Father and the Son are all one, I cannot conceive.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Scripture which he hath notoriouſly and impudently added to, is that in <hi>John,</hi> Ch. 15. <hi>v.</hi> 25. which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>John</hi> runs thus: <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, [even] the ſpirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtify of me.</hi> But according to <hi>George</hi> thus: <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is in the Father, and the Father is in him, and he will ſend them the ſpirit of truth the Comforter, that proceeds from the Father and the Son.</hi> Now that it may appear moſt evidently that he quotes this as Scripture and <hi>Chriſt's</hi> own words, I will produce a paſſage out of the Epiſtle to <hi>G. Whitehead's <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt</hi>
               </hi> ſubſcrib'd by <hi>G.F.</hi> &amp; <hi>John Stubbs,</hi> where he uſeth the words in the letter of Scripture, ſaying alſo, The Scripture ſaith; and challengeth his adverſaries to give him Scripture in plain words; Thus it is read.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But we do charge <hi>Danſon,</hi> and his Brethren to make this good by Scripture in plain words; — For the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, &amp; the holy Ghoſt proceeds from them.</hi>
               </q> I beſeech you friends, conſider what ſpirit lead <hi>G. F.</hi> when he wrote theſe words! What! Call and clamour upon his Antagoniſt for Scripture in plain words, and then pretend to give Reader Scripture &amp; falſify it! Can you produce an Author that ever wrote ſo inconſiderately? If this be not a plain addition to the words of Chriſt, I pray tell me
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66034:11"/>what is? <hi>It is now</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daille</hi> of the right uſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) <hi>the ſpace of ſome Ages paſt, ſince the Eaſtern Church accuſed the Weſtern of having added</hi> [Pilióque, <hi>and the Son</hi>] <hi>in the Article</hi> (of the Nicene Creed) <hi>touching the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But the Pope and his Council were never ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as to make that addition to the Scripture, as <hi>G. Fox</hi> hath done. See how upon occaſion of an Inference (not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting it to be the words of Scripture) <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the curſe upon his Adverſary <hi>John Newman</hi> (Chriſt aſcended, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 21, 22.) <q>
                  <hi>J. N.</hi> from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Thoſe that pierced him in his body of fleſh, ſhall ſee that body viſibly come again.</hi> G. W.'s Anſw. <hi>Theſe are not the words of Scripture, but added; although to add or diminiſh be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden under a penalty,</hi> Rev. 22.18, 19. <hi>Yet this mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption leads him to incur that.</hi>
               </q> What would <hi>G. W.</hi> have ſaid to him if he had done a <hi>G. Fox</hi> has done? Well! there is a righteous God that judgeth the heart, and tryeth the reins, and is no reſpecter of perſons. It's true he doth not quote the Ch. and verſe; but more to blame he, for if he had, we could ſoon have ſeen his forgery, whereas now perhaps not one of a Thouſand (that has read his Book) has diſcovere it. Or if he can tell us where thoſe words of his are to be found in Scripture, he ſhall eſcape the Curſe for addition to it, till then it lies upon him.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inſtance of his negligence and fallibility in quoting Scripture may be that place <hi>p.</hi> 71. of his Book, where he ſaith,—<hi>and Paul declares himſelf</hi> (<hi>take</hi> Paul's <hi>own words) <hi>not of Man, nor by man, but by the will of God:</hi>
               </hi> now this citation might have paſſed currant for Scripture though it's no where found in this form, (for all I know) but that he ſo confidently calls them <hi>Paul</hi>'s own words, which is falſe, if they be not found together, and not only apart.</p>
            <p n="23">23. The 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> this, <hi>p.</hi> 68. ſpeaking of the Churches or Temples wherein God is worſhipped by ſome; ſaith he, <hi>Is

Is not be worſhipped in the ſpirit and in the truth?</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent letter wherein he puts it, intimates that he would have us take it for Scripture; and there are ſome words like his in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. and <hi>Acts</hi> 17. but in neither of thoſe places are either the ſame words or the ſame ſence: but it's ſufficient againſt him that there are not the ſame words.</p>
            <p n="24">24. The 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Scripture perverted is <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. <hi>He that believeth on me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) as <hi>the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhalt flow rivers of living water:</hi> where <hi>his belly</hi> is plainly ſpoken of him that believeth, but <hi>G. Fox</hi> applies it to the light, Chriſt, ſaying <hi>p.</hi> 130. — <hi>and believing in the light Chriſt, <hi>out of whoſe belly flowed rivers of living mater.</hi>
               </hi> The <hi>light,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> muſt be magnified by <hi>G. F.</hi> and the Scripture muſt be wreſted to that purpoſe, come on it what will!</p>
            <p n="25">25. The 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inſtance of his fallibility or deceitfulneſs in the uſe of Scripture is taken from <hi>p.</hi> 27. where he makes the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſay, <hi>A true Church is guilty of Injury.</hi> G. F. Anſw. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the Church is the pillar &amp; ground of truth, without ſpot or wrinkle or blemiſh or any ſuch thing.</hi>
               </hi> The Apoſtle ſaith indeed <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25 27—Chriſt <hi>alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, — that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing.</hi> He ſaith, That it <hi>might</hi> and <hi>ſhould,</hi> not that it <hi>is,</hi> as our <hi>G.</hi> repereſents it.</p>
            <p n="26">26. So he abuſeth us with a defective quotation of the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of the ſame <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. which he has both in the 11. and 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pages in the ſame manner, as in divers other places. The 11 <hi>p.</hi> thus: <hi>Prieſt. They are no Chriſtians that doth not hold Chriſt abſent from his Church, but Antichriſts.</hi> (By the way, I believe he wrongs his Adverſaries in making them ſpeak bad Engliſh.) Anſw. <hi>Which is contrary to the Scriptures, which ſay, <hi>they are fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone, and they are as nigh together as husband and wife.</hi>
               </hi> But the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66034:12"/>Apoſtle thus: <hi>For we are members of his body, of his fleſh and of his bones.</hi> If he had not left out the former clauſe, <hi>we are members of his body,</hi> the latter clauſe which he takes, would not ſo well have ſerved his purpoſe, and alſo have been more eaſily underſtood: for we know it's ordinary for a member of a Body, or for the head it ſelf of a Body, which is an aſſembly, (as the word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> (here rendered <hi>Church</hi>) ſignifies) to be in one Countrey, when the Body or Society is at a far diſtance in another. But this was not ſo diſcoverable in the Allegory of fleſh and bones alone.</p>
            <p n="27">27. The 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place ſhall ſhow that our Author's memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or negligence as fallible, rather more fallible than that of other men; which is a great reflection upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſpirit. Thus <hi>p.</hi> 152. he ſaith, <hi>
                  <hi>And the Apoſtle ſaid,</hi> the deep things of God was revealed by the ſpirit of God,</hi> (It's a ſmall matter with him to make the Apoſtle ſpeak bad Engliſh.) But the Apoſtle ſpeaketh neither ſo nor ſo: but— <hi>God hath revealed them unto us by his ſpirit, for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God:</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. And <hi>v.</hi> 11. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God:</hi> but <hi>G. Fox</hi> thus, <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things that be of God:</hi> he leaves out <hi>ſpirit,</hi> though for ought he knows, there may be a vaſt difference between the things of God, and the things of the ſpirit of God, as there is a vaſt difference between blaſphemy againſt God, which may be forgiven; and the blaſphemy againſt <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which <hi>ſhall not be forgiven unto men.</hi> Mat. 12.31.</p>
            <p n="28">28. And if <hi>G. F.</hi> were a man capable either of rendring or underſtanding reaſon, I would aske him, why in uſing thoſe words of Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. he puts in the term <hi>God</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Lord;</hi> for thus he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 99.—<hi>who</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>both died, &amp; roſe again, that he might be God both of the dead,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66034:12"/>and the living.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</hi> So <hi>p.</hi> 17. <hi>Let the word of God dwell in you richly:</hi> The Apoſtle hath <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Col. 3.16. But this ſavours of his willingneſs to have no diſtinction between God and Chriſt. For he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 142. <hi>Chriſt is not diſtinct from the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">29. And <hi>p.</hi> 160. by the Character he writes in, he gives us theſe words for Seripture—<hi>and ſo who is in Chriſt is a new creature; And old things paſs away.</hi> But the A poſtle ſaith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature: old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become new.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a thing done; <hi>G. F.</hi> as a thing a doing and not done; for that agreed better with his deſign in tha place.</p>
            <p n="30">30. But we have not yet done with the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> where <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 16. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To the one</hi> [that periſh] <hi>we are the Savour of death unto death; and to the other</hi> [the ſaved] <hi>the Savour of life unto life.</hi> But <hi>G. F.</hi> (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as he had heard it ſometimes from ſome <hi>Prieſt</hi>) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to <hi>the word,</hi> thus: <hi>For the word it ſelf is immediate, for <hi>it is the Savour of death to the death, and of life to the life;</hi>
               </hi> Thus when it is for the honour of his phraſe, the word muſt be put for the Apoſtles and Preachers of it.</p>
            <p n="31">31. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Tim. 3. propheſying of the wicked ones that ſhould come in the laſt dayes, ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>of this ſort are they which creeps into houſes, and lead captive ſilly women laden with ſins, led away with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> But <hi>G.

                  <hi>who are</hi> reprobates concerning the faith, which crept into houſes before the Apoſtles deceaſe; which have kept people always learning, but never able to come to the know
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66034:13"/>ledge of the truth, led away with dibers luſts.</hi> Now the Apoſtle doth not attribute to theſe falſe Teachers, (which yet were bad enough) that they kept people always learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they led captive ſuch as were ſo. He ſhould give him without wrong to the holy ſpirit in the holy Apoſtle.</p>
            <p n="32">32. And that our Prophet <hi>G.</hi> may ſeem to have ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for diſparaging the other Miniſters upon the account of their humance learning, he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 70. <q>So all your tools ye have wrought withal ſince the Apoſtaſy, hath been taken out of the ſtops of humane learning which is earthly; this proves ye are Apoſtates, and the ſpirits gone out into the world. And <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, the tongues of the <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> was ſet up a top of Chriſt by <hi>Pitale</hi> who crucified him.</q> But where <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith ſo, he leaves us to gheſs. I have found indeed that <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith Ch. 23.38. <hi>And a ſuper ſcription alſo was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latine and Hebrew;</hi> but I could never yet find <hi>Luke</hi> ſaying, <hi>The tongues of the Hebrew, Greek and Latine was ſet up a top of Chriſt.</hi> This came out of <hi>George</hi>'s own brain, that is not over fraught with thoſe tongues I dare warrant you: but yet he will undertake to correct the Tranſlatours; and he never doth it with greater advantage than in the rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that paſſage of the Apoſtle to the.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Coloſſians, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 23. which we read thus: <hi>If ye continue in the faith grounded and ſetled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven:</hi> The uſe of this laſt clauſe in <hi>G. Fox</hi> is this: <hi>p.</hi> 41. <hi>Prieſt.</hi> 
               <q>He dare boldly aſſert that the Goſpel is not firſt made known by the ſeeing within, but by hearing tidings without, <hi>&amp;c. G. Fox</hi>'s Anſw. Contrary to that which they call their original, which ſaith, <hi>the Goſpel is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66034:13"/>preached in every creature.</hi>
               </q> That which is to my purpoſe chiefly is, that puts <hi>is</hi> for <hi>was;</hi> that it may be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to his Doctrine of the Goſpel in theſe days and all days of the world preached within them that never heard or ſaw a tittle of the Goſpel either by word or writing. Thus when our Lord ſaid unto his Diſciples (<hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15.) <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature, (in</hi> is not there;) he bade them do that which was done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and was always done ever ſince there were men in the world. And them it would have been hand for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul, <hi>to preach the Goſpel, not where Chriſt was named.</hi> Rom. 15.20. It ſeems <hi>G. F</hi>'s Goſpel of Chriſt is preached, where Chriſt is not named. This excellent uſe doth <hi>G. Fox</hi> make of his skill in the <hi>Orginal as they call it.</hi> But more of that afterward.</p>
            <p n="34">34. But is it not pretty? that whil'ſt <hi>G. F.</hi> charges the Tranſlators with corrupting the Scripture becauſe they render <hi>en to</hi> in Engliſh and ſometimes <hi>with</hi> or <hi>among;</hi> that yet himſelf, when they have tranſlated it <hi>in,</hi> ſhould change it into <hi>within;</hi> (as he chang'd it into <hi>with,</hi> which I obſerved before upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.) Thus <hi>p.</hi> 105. <hi>Now the Scriptures cannot lead into all truth, but it teſtifies of that that doth ſo. And if <hi>Chriſt be not within people; they are reprobates:</hi>
               </hi> The Apoſtle and the Tranſlators ſay; <hi>know you not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates?</hi> 2. Cor. 15.5. But <hi>G.</hi> thinks he may boldly and to the Scripture when he doth not alter the ſence, though he reproves it very ſharply in others. As if <hi>in you</hi> could admit of no other ſence but <hi>within you.</hi> Let us ſee then whether the words of Chriſt will always admit that ſence. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.26, 27. <hi>But it ſhall not be ſo</hi> within <hi>you, but whoſoever will be great</hi> within <hi>you, let him be your miniſter, and whoſoever will be chief</hi> within <hi>you, let him be your ſervant.</hi> Here if <hi>G.</hi> pleaſe to conſult that which they call the <hi>Greek,</hi> he will ſind
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66034:14"/>it <hi>en by min in you,</hi> and then we muſt read it as I have done. And is not that excellent ſence? let the impartial judge. The like fault is <hi>G. F.</hi> guilty of in relation to 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>the anointing which—a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in you:</hi> but <hi>G. p.</hi> 79. — <hi>the Apoſtles brought the Saints then <hi>to the anointing within them:</hi>
               </hi> and a little below in the ſame page, <hi>no one knows the eye of the ſoul, but who comes to the <hi>light within.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35. But that charge will not lye againſt him for the term <hi>within</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.21. becauſe he finds it in the Text: but it's rare with him to uſe any. Text and not abuſe it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſtead of <hi>The kingdom of God,</hi> as it is in the Text, he makes it go for <hi>the kingdom of heaven, p.</hi> 64. But that's a ſmall matter, and might be paſſed by, but he will not leave it ſo, for his Adverſaries do often preſs him with the many Scriptures, which ſpeak of Chriſt's being in Heaven, and conſequently abſent from the Saints on earth as far as heaven is from earth: this Text now muſt be preſs'd for his ſervice at this turn, and muſt prove that Heaven is within men: Therefore he ſaid <hi>p.</hi> 101. <hi>And the Scriptures doth witneſs <hi>heaven within.</hi>
               </hi> Is not this fair dealing, firſt to change the Kingdom of God into he Kingdom of heaven, and then to leave out <hi>Kingdom</hi> too, and put <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> for the whole phraſe? Who needs ever want Scripture for any thing he has a mind to ſay, if he may abuſe the words of Chriſt after this manner? But if he or any of you think you can produce a Text that favours him more than this, I will recal what I have writ on this points if not, pray take notice of the groſſeſt forgery.</p>
            <p>Here I might bring in his uncouth uſe of thoſe words in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.20. as another Inſtance: but becauſe it is not very clear, that be quotes them for the, very words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> I will only propoſe it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith; <hi>To the law; ard<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ke teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66034:14"/>there is no light in them.</hi> But <hi>G.F.</hi> thus <hi>p.</hi> 75. <hi>For Iſaiah—bid them come to the law and the teſtimony; and you that do not ſpeak according to that rule, it is becauſe you hate the light in you. Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no light in them.</hi> G. ſaith, <hi>you hate the light in you.</hi> One would have though he ſhould have had ſo much reſpect to Scripture words, as not to have ſaid the quite contrary to them.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inſtance of perverting Scripture ſhall be that in <hi>p.</hi> 280. where he hath this paſſage; — <q>which [Scriptures] ſaith, that the Holy Ghoſt moved in them that gave forth Scriptures, which led them into all truth, and did not ſay, the Holy Ghoſt moved in the Scriptures; but ſaid <hi>The letter was dead, and did not give life.</hi>
               </q> But I am to ſeek for that Scripture. I find indeed the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s miniſtration, not of the writings of the new Covenant,) ſaith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. — <hi>the letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life:</hi> but I think there is difference enough between <hi>The letter killeth,</hi> and <hi>The letter is dead;</hi> for who will fear to be killed by that which is dead? for that which kills muſt have ſome activity, life or power; that which is dead hath none: and the letter and ſpirit are not oppoſed as the one dead, the other living, but as the one killing, the other enlivening. This I ſay to ſhow what a perverſe ſence, and how contrary to the Scripture he has brought in, by altering the words.</p>
            <p n="37">37. And as if he ſcorned to quote Scripture right, he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 170. <hi>And I will ſlay you with the ſword, the words of my mouth, <hi>ſaith the Lamb,</hi>
               </hi> which words I cannot find in Scripture, much leſs ſpoken by the Lamb: I find theſe words <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.16.—<hi>and will fight againſt them with the ſword of my mouth &amp; Rev.</hi> 19.21.—<hi>the ſword-which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his mouth:</hi> but not the other. Here is falſe quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but I know not what bad ſence; therefore it is with him a ſmall fault, though it would be a great one in his Adverſaries.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:66034:15"/>
            <p n="38">38. But my 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inſtance will diſcover both his forgery and vanity ſufficiently. For <hi>p.</hi> 98. he introduceth his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary charging the Quakers, <hi>that they publickly deny the reſurrection of the dead body:</hi> to which among other things he anſwers; <hi>Chriſt—<hi>is the reſurrection and the life both, and thy dead body ſhall live with my dead body: this is Scripture, and they that ſaid the reſurrection was paſt in the days of the Apoſtles, overthrew the faith of ſome.</hi>
               </hi> In the firſt place I would know of any man what pertinency there is in this quotation of thoſe words that ſeem to be taken out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.19. Can any man be more certain by it than he was before, of the Quakers acknowledging or denying the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead body? or can any man tell by it, what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> means by thoſe words? which are not neither the ſame with <hi>G.

As if he would upbraid his adverſaries with their reſpect to Scripture, <hi>This is Scripture!</hi> He might as well have quoted, <hi>Abraham begot Iſaac,</hi> and have concluded, <hi>This is Scripture.</hi>

            <p n="39">39.

            <p n="40">40. And if he were not delighted with adding or detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from Scripture at his pleaſure, why ſhould he not quote Chriſt's words as they are, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.37. <hi>But let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay; for whatſoever is more than theſe cometh of evil?</hi> But <hi>G.F.</hi> thus, <hi>p.</hi> 178. <hi>He</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>ſays, in all your communication <hi>let your yea be yea, and

               </hi> Why not here as he has it afterward, <hi>whatſoever is more, is evil?</hi> except it were that he would confound his Reader, and ſo make him believe that the Quakers are very obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Chriſts command and perfect men, though they in their communication <hi>call <hi>God to witneſs,</hi>
               </hi> and aſſert things in <hi>the preſence of God,</hi> and the like phraſes, which other Chriſtians take to be Oaths, and dare not uſe them in that manner: at leaſt they are more than <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> which Chriſt ſaith, cometh of evil: but <hi>G.</hi> only, <hi>whatſoever is contrary is evil;</hi> as if all that is more muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="41">41. And where to find that clauſe which he gives us for Scripture <hi>p.</hi> 250. I know not. He brings in the Prieſt ſaying, <hi>Sin is in the Saints for their humiliation.</hi> His Anſ. <hi>Contrary to the Scripture which ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is their humiliation.</hi>
               </hi> And this he hath divers times as I remember: but I take it for Scripture of his own making.</p>
            <p n="42">42. There he makes Scripture, here he marr's it moſt egregiouſly. For <hi>p.</hi> 47. he ſaith; <hi>
                  <hi>And ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi> God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf;</hi> where he puts <hi>is</hi> for <hi>was.</hi> (Sec 2 Cor. 5.) the preſent for the paſt time. For you muſt know that their opinion is, as one of their great Authors expreſſeth it, that <hi>God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling men to himſelf ever ſince the fall in all ages, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſince Chriſt ſuffered in the outward;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the verb <hi>was</hi> doth not ſignify any thing paſt but what is alſo now preſent and ever will be, as it always was. By this means it may as truly be ſaid, that <hi>God is in</hi> G.F. <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world to himſelf,</hi> as that <hi>god was in Jeſus, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> &amp;c. foraſmuch, as Chriſt is (ſo they would) as truly and properly (perhaps equally; See <hi>p.</hi> 67.) in <hi>G.F.</hi> as he was in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But he has not yet done abuſing this Scripture, for <hi>p.</hi> 250. he ſaith, <hi>God can do what he will, who was in Chriſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66034:16"/>reconciling himſelf to the world.</hi> Is not this a large liberty that he takes, to ſay the quite contrary to Scripture and to his own friends? for ſaith that Author of theirs,—<hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith not, When we were enemies God was reconcil'd to us; but—when we were enemies we were reconciled to God.</hi> But may not <hi>G.

            <p n="45">45.

               <hi>p.</hi> 337. I ſuppoſe he has this diſtinction between <hi>the word</hi> and <hi>words</hi> above 20 times in his Book. But if he would have looked upon his Greek Teſtament, (wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſuch skill, that he often corrects the Tranſlators) he might have found that that very word which they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> Act. 1.1. is <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Logon,</hi> which is the ſame which in <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.1. is tranſlated <hi>Word,</hi> ſo that that very Text which he produceth againſt the Scripture it's being call'd <hi>word</hi> is a plain Text for it: and the.

               <hi>Ch.v.</hi> 34, 35. in as plain and expreſs words as can well be ſpoken, ſaying, <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in the Chruches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak; but they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be under obedience, as alſo ſaith the Law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their bus bands at home: for it is a ſhame for women to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> Here if the Apoſtle do not command ſilence to women by ſex, in thoſe caſes wherein he allows men by ſex to ſpeak, I underſtand nothing tht's written. But <hi>G. F.p.</hi> 386. (ſpeaking of the woman that is forbid to ſpeak in the Church) ſaith—<hi>now the woman here hath a Husband to ask at home, and not uſurp authority over the man, but Chriſt in the male as in the female, who redeems from under the Law, and makes free from the Law, that man may ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. Here we may perceive, he allows women as well as men to ſpeak in the Church, and indeed your practice ſhews that women are not in any caſe excluded from ſpeaking, where it is permitted to men. Alſo we may perceive that by the husband that is to be asked at home he means <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now if we may take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to expound Scripture after this manner, I count it utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible to prove any truth by Scripture: &amp; then we may as well deny Scripture as affirm it. It will be a noſe of wax that may be turned which way we pleaſe. I do not in this particular charge <hi>G. F.</hi> with miſrecital of, adding or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing from Scripture words, becauſe he neither quotes the place, nor puts the words in Scripture Character, as he doth in the other inſtances: but the expoſition which he gives of it is ſo groſs and abſurd, that it may well be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd among his abuſes of Scripture. Beſides it ſeems to be built upon a mis-reading of Husband for <hi>Husbands,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66034:17"/>Chriſt, who is but one, is made the Husbands that muſt be asked at home. So one of your Authors ſaith, <hi>But what husbands have widows to learn of but Chriſt? And was not Chriſt the Husband of Philips</hi> 4 <hi>danghters? And may not they that learn of their husbands ſpeak then?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="48">48. The 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inſtance of his abuſing Scripture ſhall be that great doctrine of yours of not calling men <hi>Maſter,</hi> and thus he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 43. <hi>Prieſt. Why may they not be called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?</hi> Anſw. <q>It is his maſter that teacheth him to be called of men Maſter, that is gone out of the truth; but Chriſt ſaid' <hi>Be not of men called Maſter,</hi> and wo be to them that are, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.</q> Thus for <hi>G.</hi> Where I obſerve firſt, that he puts in here <hi>of men</hi> into the Text, as he doth in 20 more places beſides. But then 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>ly, I do not find Chriſt (<hi>Matt.</hi> 23.) ſaying, wo be to them that are call'd Maſter; that ſeems to be added by <hi>G. F.</hi> True indeed Chriſt ſaith: <hi>But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren. And call no man your Father upon the earth: for one is your father, which is in Heaven. Neither be ye called Maſters, for one is your Meſter, even Chriſt.</hi> Now I will take the liberty to argue a little: becauſe the Text ſeems to be ſo plain on your ſide. An firſt let me tell you that you your ſelves do reſtrain this Text from univerſally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all men from being called <hi>Maſter,</hi> whilſt you allow your ſervants to call you maſters, and your children to call you Fathers. If your ſervants may call you <hi>our Maſters</hi> or <hi>my maſter,</hi> becauſe you are their maſters; (which exception is not in the Text:) why may not another man call you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becauſe you have ſervants, and are maſters? When I call a man <hi>maſter,</hi> I do not call him ſo becauſe he is my maſter, (perhaps he is my ſervant,) but becauſe he hath a ſervant and is a maſter. Now doth Chriſt forbid that any man ſhould be called maſter, if indeed he be a maſter? The Apoſtles, that underſtood Chriſt's precept as well as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66034:18"/>
               <hi>G. F.</hi> call the <hi>Coloſſians, Maſters,</hi> Co. 4.1. and <hi>Fathers,</hi> Col. 3.21. Alſo the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Eph. 6.9, and 4. And <hi>Stephen</hi> a man full of faith and power ſaith to the Councel of the Jews, <hi>Men, brethren, and Fathers,</hi> Act. 7.2. They were not <hi>his</hi> Fathers, but they were <hi>Fathers,</hi> and therefore he calls them ſo. And why may I not as well call him, Maſter, that is not my Maſter, as call him ſervant, that is not my ſervant? 2. Let me tell you that there are divers words in the Greek Teſtament which are by our Tranſlators ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Maſter,</hi> which not withſtanding have different mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and acceptations. Thus we find <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, all render'd <hi>Maſter.</hi> But that which is uſed by Chriſt in this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.10. is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Kathee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geetees,</hi> which ſignifies (as the learned tell us) <hi>a leader of the way</hi> or <hi>a Guide:</hi> but as for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Kyrios,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth, when he writes to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> and <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and is tranſlated in Scripture ſometimes <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Sir,</hi> moſt often <hi>Lord,</hi> we find that the Apoſtles both ſingularly and plurally ſuffer'd themſelves to be called by it. Thus in the ſingular number the <hi>Greeks</hi> that came up to worſhip at the Feaſt, deſired <hi>Philip</hi> ſaying, <hi>Kyrie, Sir, we would ſee Jeſus.</hi> Joh. 12.21. And in the plural number the Jayler came trembling, and fell down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and brought them out and ſaid, <hi>Kyrioi, Sirs,</hi> [or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,] <hi>what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> if <hi>Sirs</hi> or <hi>Maſters</hi> had been a term offenſive to the Apoſtles, would the Jayler in this caſe have call'd them ſo? or if they had diſallowed it, would not the holy writer have intimated ſo much unto us? eſpecially conſidering that Chriſt's precept is given to his Diſciples, <hi>Be not ye called Maſters,</hi> whereby they ſeem to be obliged to reprove thoſe that do ſo. But the example of that good Convert <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> is in this caſe beyond all exception, and proves that Holy perſons uſed to call <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> not only thoſe that were known, but ſtrangers, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66034:18"/>that they no precept of Chriſt in ſo doing; except we will ſay (which I abhorr to think) that <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf ſuffered her in his preſence to ſin without reproving her: for <hi>ſhe ſuppoſing him to be the Gardiner, ſaith unto him, Kyrie, Sir</hi> or <hi>Maſter, if you have born him hence,</hi> &amp;c. For in her intention, ſhe called a ſtranger, and him no great perſon, a Gardiner, <hi>Maſter;</hi> and that in the preſence and hearing of her Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made it manifeſt to your ſenſes by a multitude of inſtances, that <hi>G.

            <p n="49">49. In the next place I do not find thoſe words in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which he uſeth for Scripture <hi>p.</hi> 249. when he ſaith, —<hi>God juſtified</hi> [Job] and ſaid, <hi>Job did not ſin with his mouth:</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>In all this did not Job ſin with his lips:</hi> but that is far from not finning at all with his mouth; for a man may in this cafe keep himſelf from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with his mouth, and in that caſe be guilty of ſin.</p>

So that his faults are in ſome degree imputable to you, eſpecially if being warned, you do not declare againſt them, &amp; diſown both him &amp; them.</p>
            <p>Neither are theſe things that I object againſt him matters whoſe proof and evidence depend upon any curious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or even logical Demonſtrations, but upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of ſenſe; for the Queſtion is, How readeſt thou? Doth the Scripture, God, Chriſt, the Apoſtles and divinely inſpired writers ſay thoſe words, that <hi>G.F.</hi> charges them with? If not, as I have ſhewed to your eyes they do
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66034:20"/>not, then I have proved what I undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>G. Fox</hi> is not only, not infallible, but a falſe prophet, a liar or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, and that in matters which concern the moſt holy God and his Son, and the holy Apoſtles and writers. If I have prov'd alſo to your eyes, that he paſſes ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon others for far leſs crimes than himſelf is guilty of in the ſame kind; then ought ye to condemn him out of his own mouth. Moreover if according to your principle, (which forbids all ſwearing,) thoſe of you that affirm falſly are to be reputed as perjured perſons, then <hi>G. F.</hi> is highly liable to be ſo reputed. And if ye being now called as his Peers, and as it were a numerous Jury to try and judge the cauſe of <hi>G. F.</hi> whether he be guilty or not guilty of thoſe crimes which I have ſet before your eyes, if ye (I ſay) ſhall not find and declare him guilty, why ſhall not you alſo be accounted for perjured perſons? The evidence is not only as clear, as that Twice two are four; (for <hi>G. F.</hi> has deny'd as plain a propoſition as that, namely, that twice one are not two, but all one,) but as clear as that one Egg is not two Eggs, a Horſe not a Cow, or that THE is not AND, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now that I have brought ſuch undeniable evidence againſt him in obvious matters of fact, I will take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to tell you, that it's manifeſt alſo to any common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that <hi>F. G.</hi> neither knows the meaning of the words he writes, nor conſiders them; to ſuch a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of himſelf is he arrived. Who that either knew or car'd what he ſaid, would have given out for Scripture ſuch a plain abſurdity as that in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inſtance — <hi>by whom the world was made, before it was made?</hi> Suppoſe he had reference to that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3.—<hi>and without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi> Would any man but he have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as he hath done? What Sottiſhneſs? what pride and folly would not you impute to another that ſhould ſo do? If he had known the meaning of the word <hi>infallible,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:66034:20"/>would he have ſaid <hi>How can they but delude people that are not infallible?</hi> As if there were no difference between, <hi>To fail,</hi> and, <hi>To be not infallible.</hi> Who but he would have ſaid it was <hi>contrary to Chriſt's words, to ſay, That the Son of Mary, God man, is abſent from his Church?</hi> Who that knew what he ſaid, would have urged, that <hi>Bunyan is deceived, who ſaid <hi>he</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>is Diſtinct from the Saints,</hi> p.</hi> 16, and <hi>p.</hi> 293. that <hi>the Son is not diſtinct from the Father?</hi> Who that knew the meaning of words would contend againſt him that ſaid, <hi>The ſoul is not infinite in it ſelf, but a creature,</hi> and have aſſerted that it is—<hi>infinite it ſelf,— inmortal and infinite.</hi> p. 29. and <hi>p.</hi> 68. <hi>Is not that</hi> [the Soul] <hi>of his being?</hi> and p. 90. <hi>Is not the ſoul without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coming from God,</hi> &amp;c. and p. 273.—<hi>it is not horrid blaſphemy to ſay the ſoul is a part of God, for it came out of him,</hi> &amp;c. Who that knew what he ſaid, or whereof he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed would have reaſoned thus, (<hi>p.</hi> 325.) <hi>If the ſeed of Iſrael be men, then by thy account the ſeed of Iſrael is the ſeed of the ſerpent, for they are men?</hi> His Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary chargeth him that <hi>he profeſſed equality with God:</hi> and he anſwers as if he did grant that ſome do witneſs equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with God, only he did not ſay it of <hi>G. Fox.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 127. If he had known the ſence of the word <hi>carnal,</hi> would he have ſaid of the Bells, <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>If they be not carnal, then they are ſpiritual?</hi> Who but <hi>G. F.</hi> would have ſaid, It was <hi>contrary to the Apoſtle's Doctrine</hi> to aſſert, <hi>The Enjoyment of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is not till they have put off the body? p.</hi> 40. And <hi>p.</hi> 55. he ſaith,—<hi>They that are not worſhipping him</hi> [Chriſt] <hi>in them, are worſhipping men, Devils or Angels.</hi> But he never play's the Critick with greater glory than when he meets with the word <hi>humane</hi> ſpoken of Chriſts nature, for then he anſwers, <hi>where doth the Scripture ſpeak of humane, the word humane? where is it written? tell us that we may ſearch for it. Now we do not deny that Chriſt according to the fleſh was of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66034:21"/>but not the word humane. And Chriſt's nature is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, which is earthly, for that is the firſt Adam.</hi> And he is ſo pleaſed with this Criticiſm, that he has it over and over, again &amp; again. O learned Obſervation! and yet we find the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>anthropinos</hi> (which all our Lexicons and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries tell us ſignifies in Latine <hi>humanus,</hi> humane,) no leſs than Seven times in the Epiſtles of the New Teſtament, and once (<hi>James</hi> 3.7.) it is joyned with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>nature, humane nature,</hi> and 1 Cor. 2.4. it is rendered <hi>man's,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the plain Engliſh of it, for <hi>humane</hi> is rather Latine. What is then the <hi>humane</hi> nature of Chriſt, but the <hi>man's</hi> nature of the man Chriſt Jeſus? And if Chriſt be indeed a man, muſt he not of neceſſity have the nature of a man, or a humane nature? Behold! This man never betrays his folly more, than when he pretends moſt to learning. Thus you may ſee that your difference from others is grounded much upon words and phraſes miſunderſtood. If <hi>G. F.</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Greek,</hi> (as he highly pretends) or <hi>Latine,</hi> nay or good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he would never have run into many of thoſe abſurdities he is guilty of.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhould conclude and leave what I have written to your ſerious conſideration; and I doubt not but it will have a divers reception among you. For there are ſome among you (as I hear) that are already griev'd at <hi>G. F.</hi> and thinks he takes too much upon him. There are others, I perſwade my ſelf, that have ſo high an opinion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Light,</hi> your great Fundamental, and conceive they are ſo certain of that, and have found ſo much benefit thereby, that they are ready to ſay, Though an Angel from heaven ſhould preach any other Doctrine than that which <hi>G. F.</hi> has preached and they received, they could not give ear to it. To ſuch I ſay. Firſt, that the evidence I have brought of <hi>G. F.</hi> his failing and falſity is as clear and full as if I had brought miracles to confirm it; for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66034:22"/>of miracles depends upon the certainty of our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſenſes, and ſuch certainty we have in this caſe. 2<hi rend="sup">ndly</hi>, I appeal to the light in every one of you, whether he is not guilty himſelf, in a much higher degree, of ſuch things as he condemnes in others. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, I deſire you to conſider, that this principle of the <hi>light in every man,</hi> which you ſo much boaſt in, is the principle of all Proteſtants, however you have entertain'd it under new names, as that which you were not aware of before; and have extended it farther than it will reach. 1. That it is the principle of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is evident from the diſſent from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Church of <hi>R.</hi> pretended to be the infallible guide of all men in matters of Religion: No, ſays the Proteſtant, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is to judge for himſelf, to be ſatisfied in his own mind, to try the ſpirits whether they be of God, to prove all things and hold faſt that which is good, and not to pin his faith upon any man or Church's ſleeve. And that they may ſo do, God has (ſay they) endued every man with ſuch a light of common and certain principles written in every mans heart, that if a prophet ſhould come and give them a ſign or a wonder to draw them away from the obſervance of that light and thoſe principles, they ought not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the words of that prophet (See <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3.) Moreover they ſay that God has promiſed his holy ſpirit to them that humbly implore it in the obedience of that light which God has already afforded. To this purpoſe they quote thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 7.17. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, That you have entertained it under new names, appears from the contention between you and others, whether God have given this light to men by nature, conſequently whether it is a natural, light or a divine light, &amp;c. to which purpoſe your adverſaries quote <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>For when the Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66034:23"/>
                  <hi>in the law, theſe having not the law are a law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> You urgo <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. to prove it is a divine light, which Chriſt the true light lighteth every man withall, that cometh into the world. Is not the difference now between you and others about words and names? for whether God hath given it unto men by nature or not, it is of God in reſpect of it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from God and tending to him; for God is as truly the Author of the good gifts that come unto men by nature as of other gifts; and what reaſon can there be, why that ſhould not be ſaid to be natural, which agrees to every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of the ſame kind, as you ſay the light doth? for <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 20.—<hi>a blind man and an Infant is inlightned with the light of Chriſt—and where there is life in an Infant there is light.</hi> And the Apoſtel ſaith—The <hi>Gentiles do by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and—are a law to themſelves.</hi> Thus and eminent preacher in a great Aſſembly of late upon that Text. <q>And ſo far the Quakers are in the right, if they underſtand themſelves, and mean no more by it, when they ſay that every man hath light within him, than this; That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath naturally the notions of good and evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, which in plain caſes of good and evil, right and wrong, will tell him what he ought to do, and what he ought to avoid, by which he ought to be directed, and that his conſcience will acquit and excuſe him if he do the one, and accuſe and condemn him if he do the other.</q> Thus far he. And this helps me to ſhow in the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> place that you extend the Doctrine of the light in every man farthor than you ought; for it is not to be extended to all caſed whatſoever, as if every man that attends to the light in him; did certainly know what is good, what is evill, right or wrong in every caſe, for many caſes are every difficult, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66034:23"/>even good men do commontly differ in their Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their. So we ſee that among the Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, <hi>One</hi> (faith he) <hi>believeth that he may eat all things: another who is weak, eateth herbs. One man eſteemeth one dya above another: another eſteemeth every day alike. Rom.</hi> 14.2, 5. And the Apoſtle doth not condemn them for judging thus diverſly, but teacheth them how to behave themſelves under this diverſity. And I appeal to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of very one of you who has not enſlaved his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Judgment of your Miniſters and Elders, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in divers caſes which come before in your Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, you are not of another mind before you hear the Judgment of thoſe your Elders, and ſometimes afterward alſo? and whether you do verily believe that in all caſes that have been decided by you, every particular perſon would have been of the ſame mind being alone, as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was of in their determination? Nay do you not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find your ſelves aggrieved at the Judgment of men? and are you not forced ſometimes to ſet up the Judgment of a part or of the Elder, againſt the Judgment of another part of the people? If you are; then how is the light in every one of you extended to every particular caſe? or is the light contrary to it ſelf in this and that man or number of men? And where is the Infallibility you ſpeak of in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, in all caſes? If you conſider this well, I am perſwaded you will perceive that the light in every man, (eſpecially in thoſe whoſe Judgments have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſed with falſe notions, (as many of you have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were Quakers) doth not teach him all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but all things that are neceſſary for him to know in order to a holy truſt in God, and ſincere obedience in the general courſe of his life. Beſides, Doth not the light in every man teach him to make uſe of ſuch helps and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as God has afforded him? And doth not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66034:24"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſay—whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope?</hi> Rom. 15.4. And the Apoſtle John — <hi>Theſe [things] are written that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name,</hi> Joh 20. 31. Now ſuppoſing the light in every man would teach him every particular thing, it is always to be underſtood, if he be obedients to what he knows and diligent in the uſe of thoſe means God has afforded him, of which we find the holy Scriptures are very great means: and perhaps he has been negligent in the uſe of theſe; indeed who can think any leſs of you, who have ſuffered a Book to be ſet out in your names about 12 years agoe, wherein I have ſhewed you about fifty falſe quorations, (not only falſe Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or meanings) beſides non-ſence and other faults, and yet I am apt to think, that ſcarce one in 500 of you that have read that Book, have obſerved any ſuch falſities. And muſt we believe that God will ſtill give you a light actually teaching you all things whatever, how negligent ſoever you have been or are in the following of that he hath given you? Muſt God be bound with his divine light and Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſupply the defects of you Idleneſs and pride? For when other men count it great mercy and favour in God, that he is pleaſed through the vileſt means that may be, and through their earneſt Study and diligence to grant them the knowledge of his will, inlightning their minds by his holy Spirit; you must have it, like the Angels that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways behold his face, by immediate Revelation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>So now my friends, I deny not that there is a light in every man, which he is obliged under pain of the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Almighty diligently to eye and follow; that ſo doing it will lead him by degrees into all neceſſary truth,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66034:24"/>and at length to eternal life. I deny not but ſome of you have received and done much good by following this light: but I muſt ſay again, and that with great ſorrow of heart, that your preachers, eſpecially <hi>G. F.</hi> have greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both the Teachings of and the Obedience to the Lights that your zeal been in great part, not according to knowledge; that you lay great ſnares in your onw way, by binding your ſelves to thoſe things, to which God hath not bound you; that in ſtead of worſhipping God in ſpirit and truth, you require the obſervation of ceremonies, things in themſelves neither good nor evil; ſuch are your not putting off the hat in Salutations, not ſaying <hi>you</hi> but <hi>thou</hi> to a ſingle perſon, not calling him Maſter that is a Maſter, and the like, which your negative precepts no man in the world is one jot the better for, &amp; your are the worſe. But above all, your allegorical way of interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tends utterly to make it void and of no uſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the ruine and overthrow of all Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Now I doubt not but there will be found among you more then one <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> whoſe blood will boile within him and ſtir him up to the vindication of this great Prophet: &amp; I can eaſily perſwade my ſelf that there is ſcarce any one, of you, that at leaſt has at any time wrote any thing in your cauſe, but he or ſhe will think him or herſelf as ſoon they read the Title-page, able to give a confuting anſwer to all that can be ſaid againſt ſo worthy a perſon: but I ſhould think that as none of you is ſo able, ſo none ſhould be more provoked to defend him than your late Apologiſt <hi>William Pen,</hi> who <hi>from Jenner's relation did obſerve, that the only blaſphemy was againſt</hi> G. Fox, <hi>in ſpeaking evilly of the Lord's ſervant.</hi> (p. 170. of that Apol.) If he be moved to ingage in it, I only beg of him that he would firſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his own conſcience and light concerning that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derta king:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:66034:25"/>and if he can do that, I ſhall ever after have a better opinion of the Popiſh writers that ingage in defence of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>Here I eaſily foreſee, one ſubſtantial Objection againſt me and Defence of <hi>George</hi> will be, that I was aſhamed of my name, and durſt not ſubſcribe it to the charge. Now I am almoſt ready to grant the laſt part of the Objection, for I have ſome fear upon me on that acount, and my reaſons for it are ſuch as theſe. 1. There are ſome of your writers, that make it a great part of their anſwers to Books, the reproaching of the Author, and they are very Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in that point, and truly I deſire rather a pertinent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and am not willing to put into your hands an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for an impertinent one. If you had my name, then it muſt be conſidered what party I am of, whether an <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian, Prechyterian, Independent,</hi> &amp;c. and accordingly all that is odious or ſo reputed either in the Doctrine or practice of the whole party or any particular perſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt all be raked up againſt me, and ſerve for a very plauſible Anſwer. Or if I ſhould chance to be an old man of ſixty ſix, like your Adverſary <hi>Jenner;</hi> that would help, (as it doth againſt him) to render me doting at every turn, and be matter for a good part of an eighteen pence Apology. Or if I have been a Braſier heretofore, or a Tayler, the world must be made to know what a pitiful mean fellow I am, and muſt be told my name with Tinker or Tayler at the end one. [See the Apol. <hi>p.</hi> 2.] But if this will not be enough, you have a way that will ſerve you effectually to diſgrace any man living, ſo far as it is in your power; and that is by ſuggeſting (as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi> (<hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> p. 49.) that he was given to Gaming, Bowls, and Nine-pins) any crime whatſoever; and when the ſuggeſtion is proved to be falſe, if it ſo fall out unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, you may come off as he, by ſaying, you did but <hi>quaere</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:66034:25"/>whether it was ſo or no; you did not poſitively affirm it. Will theſe things incourage any man to put his name into your hands, that can keep it out? Judge yee! Beſides, I known not what diſadvantage it will be to you, not to know my name, for what I have written will be as true without it as with it. I confeſs that perhaps you will loſe ſome of that ſweetneſs of Revenge you would take in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily beſpattering me, and that I am not willing to gratify you with. I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt I have a full teſtimony in my own Conſcience both touching the cauſes and Inducements of my preſent writing, <hi>viz.</hi> my hearty love and affection to Truth and your perſons, (for whom I have longtime dayly prayed God who is light, to lead you into the true light, and the acknowledgment of the Myſtery which was hid from Ages and Generations:) and alſo touching my faithfulneſs and Intergrity in the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Citations and Obſervations I have made: ſo that whoever of you have a true diſcerning of ſpirits, which you lay ſo great a claim to, I am ſure ye muſt juſtify me in what I have done, and receive it as that which I was moved to, in the general, by the light of God and Chriſt in my heart. But however you receive it or judge of it, he that juſtifieth me is the Lord, to whom I commit my ſelf and it, ſtill praying for you, for I am</p>
