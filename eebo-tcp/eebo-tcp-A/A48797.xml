            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHen I consider in how many respects, the world is now under the sad Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of being given over to <hi>beleeve</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 11.</note>

            <p>When I read that some pretensions in the last times, will almost deceive the very <note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 24. 24.</note> Elect; insomuch that one of those Elect writing to his Brethren, hath left this as the greatest Caveat amongst them, <hi>Beloved, beleeve not every Spirit,</hi> but <note n="d" place="margin">1 John 4. 1.</note> try the Spirits whether they be of God.</p>
            <p>And adde to all these, those sad words 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57307:4"/>
That the Mystery of iniquity doth already work; <hi>only,</hi> he who now Letteth, will Let, until he be taken out of the way, and then shall that wicked one be revealed, even he whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs, and LYING WONDERS, and with all deceiveableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.</p>
            <p>When I reflect on the state of the World, now so parrallel to that it was 4000 years agoe, especially in one particular, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is immersed in Fancy, Imagination and Lust, which are all Inter-woven with its Phylosophy, its Religion, Worship, Doctrine, Discipline and Government, so far, that it is as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Diabolical Impressions, leading to Atheism, <hi>now</hi> towards the end of the World, as it was to such as led to Polutheism, <hi>then</hi> in the beginning of it: I do not so much admire your Caution in complying with the Vulgar apprehensions of this late <hi>Gift of Healing,</hi> so much cryed up amongst us; as I do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unwillingness to comply with your Cantion; so much more strange is it, that the generallity should allow such groundless, and ill contrived pretences, than that any man should scruple then; were not we in <hi>England,</hi> famous almost to a Proverb, for our folly, <hi>in reference</hi> to <hi>Prodigies and Prophesies;</hi> and a People that would make it necessary, that as it was one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Judges of the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> that they should be skilled in Magick, that they might detect and Judge others for it; so it should be one in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, that they should <hi>be expert</hi> in the <hi>works</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they might understand what is above it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Seriously, since there is not a greater confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what God speaks, than what he doth; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57307:4"/>
so no greater evidence of Religions proceeding from God, than Miracles wrought by God. And there being no ordinary way of conveighing the evidence of divine Truth into the mindes of Men, but by a concurrence of a divine power set before their eyes to confirm that Truth. The World is not capable of diving into the depth of Religious Mysteries; so shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, narrow, and dark are mens capacities and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, and so apt are men to suspect impostures in things of subtilty, reason and mystery, and therefore they must have plain confirmations of those myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before their senses, which they think will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; so true is it, what that excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son observes. The world being to be taught of God, must be taught with actions, which they can trust, and not with words, wherewith they may be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and hence Miracles, or the performance of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above the reach of Nature, hath been alwaies looked on as the greatest testimony to divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For the course of nature being settled by an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power, and all Agents acting by the force  of that power;</q> whosoever in doing wonders, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the course of nature, is esteemed to have the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine presence going along with him.</p>
            <p>Since I say, the working of Miracles, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming things above the course of Nature, hath been looked upon by mankinde, since God hath made use of men to act in his name; here in the world, as the best evidence of Gods presence going along with them, as the fairest credentials for their Message, and the greatest argument for the truth of the Religion; by them at several times published in the Name of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57307:5"/>
God. As it is certainly of very dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to Counterfeit the Kings Seal, by which all Acts of State are confirmed, and made authentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to the people, so it is to pretend to Gods Seal, whereby he doth convincingly make known his will in the world.</p>
            <p>And as all the Kings Leige People, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of conniving at the one, for fear of a mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, likely thereby to grow between the King and the People; none then being able to discern what is really the Kings Act, and what is not; what they should obey, and what they should not; as they would not be guilty of mis prision of Treason against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, so all Gods people should be very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in allowing the other, for fear of a mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing between God and their Souls; none in case of such Counterfeits, being able to discern what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confirmed to be Gods will, and what is only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended so, what is a Religion, and what is a chear.</p>
            <p>Whence really there cannot chuse but ensue these two sad things. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 An opportunity in distracted and divided Times, to broach strange and dangerous Opinions. For if a man can but prevail with the People, to beleeve that God assists him, to Effect new and extraordinary things; he may easily perswade them, that the same God inspires him to speak new and extraordinary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; when they see God in what he doth, they will easily believe he is in what he saith; and where they observe <hi>omnipotence,</hi> there they will believe <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallability:</hi> and if the man saith now, <hi>I received a voice from Heaven, bidding me Cure all Diseases;</hi> he <hi>may if this take,</hi> say anon, <hi>I am Commissioned by a Voice from</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57307:6"/>
wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other Gods; thou shalt not hearken to him, for the Lord your God proveth you: <hi>So just it is with God to try peoples faithfulness to, and stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the truth, by Diabolical Wonders, leading them to error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So good a Caution is that of <hi>Gerson,</hi> upon the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pretences of Miracles among the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to carry on their different okpinions and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; one side pretending Miracles for their Opinion, and the other for the contrary, <note n="*" place="margin">De distinctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne verarum &amp; salsarum visio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> 
               <hi>That in this old Age of the world, in this last hour, and time so near Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs Revelation, its not to be marvelled at, if the world, like a doating old man, be abused by illusions and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies:</hi> And so excellent is Dr. <hi>Fields</hi> observation, that there being but two waies to confirm Religion; the Testimony of Gods Spirit to the heart, called u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually Gods privy Seal; and the Testimony of his Miracles to the <hi>Eye,</hi> called his broad Seal: There cannot be a wider door opened for all the fallacies Satan would put upon mankinde, than the pretences of the first by the <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> and the second by the <hi>Juggler:</hi> There being no greater Testimony likely to be given to the truth, than that they Counterfeit for falshood, <hi>viz.</hi> the Testimony of God, who can neither deceive nor be deceived, confirming it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, or operation.</p>
            <p>These are sad things, but the second consequences of these pretences is sadder; for men deluded by these juggles of false Miracles, are shaken in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of true ones; and as by the first appearance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretended Wonders, they may bee cajoled to embrace some errors; so upon the discovery of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57307:7"/>
bottome of them, they are ready to cast off all truth, and because they finde themselves imposed on once, their short reasonings cannot satisfie them, but that they have been abused alwaies, and therefore saith the excellent Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> 
               <q>It is no wonder A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism should be such a thriving Plant in <hi>Italy,</hi> nay, under, if not within the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, where inquisitive persons do daily see the jugglings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures of Priests, in their pretended Miracles; and from thence are brought to look upon Religion its self as a meer imposture, and to think no Pope so Infallible, as he that said, <hi>Quantum nobis profuit, haec de Christo fabula?</hi>

               <p>How possible it is for a man, especially in an age of Fantasies as a Learned man calleth this, to be wrought by his Imagination to a belief of strange

Abilities in himself; may easily be discerned by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randulaes</hi> Discourse <hi>de Imaginatione,</hi> c. 8 where he saith, 1. That by the predominancy of a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique humor (for humors give complexion to a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Fancy,) 2. By the imposture of the senses: 3. By the strength of the passions, that have a great command over this faculty. 4. By the ministry of evil Angels, who can easily cast into the Fancy strange and false <hi>species,</hi> with such subtilty as shall easily gain them plausible credit, and admittance. 5. By the influence of a mans Starres. 6. By he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary imaginations. 7. By sad Necessity. 8. By windy meats, and want of due Evacuations. 9. By sor did dwellings and manner of life, with thick Air. 10. By idleness and solitariness. 11. By lying a bed and sleeping. 12. By grief, fear, envy, disgrace, faction, revenge, &amp;c. a man may become an <hi>Enthusiast.</hi> So easie it is for these or the like causes to stir up a mans humors, and those humors to work upon the Fancy: And by the many Instances hereof through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, as 1. The <hi>Jew</hi> that did so really imagine he could raise the dead, that he killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in order to the experiment. 2.

               <p>It being so possible, that the man is really posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with an importunate Imagination that he should perform these Cures he pretends to, let us condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether the Attempt hath any thing more in it than Imagination.</p>

of strange alterdtions in the world, makes strange alterations upon mens thoughts and spirits; it's no wonder, when all men look or a year of Miracles, that one man should attempt to begin it.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Hee voucheth a voice from Heaven, for his extraordinary Performances, when yet hee should vouch extraordinary performances to make good that voice from Heaven; the voice of God gives not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to Miracles, because the Devil in the Air, or the Fancy in the Brain, may counterfeit such a voice, but Miracles give evidence to his voice; <hi>How shall the people be assured,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>that thou O God, hast appeared to me, take the Rod, and it shall turn to a Serpent, that they may beleeve, that the Lord God of their Fathers hath appeared to thee,</hi> saith the Lord. Its impossible for us to be satisfied of any appearance of God to this man, bidding him work Miracles, unless we had other Miracles to satisfie us about the appearance of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Gods revealing himself to men by <hi>Bath Col,</hi> or the <hi>daughter of a Voice,</hi> which was indeed the last way that he was pleased to communicate his minde to his people, seems to be now superseded by that of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>And this voice which came from Heaven, we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount.</hi> 19. <hi>We have also a more sure word of Prophesie, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</hi> and we are obliged by the voice of God, confirmed by uncontrolled Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, not to give heed to any voice pretended, to give credit to new unnecessary and doubtful ones.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Voice of God concerning any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Person, under the Old and New Testament, was not spoken only to the Person himself (as it is in this

case) in private, but to several others in publick; as you may see, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and the History of the <hi>Transfiguration:</hi> These things as the Apostles argue, were not done in a Corner.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Voice of God was agreeable alwaies to the dispensations that were then a foot, so that when they heard the Voice, they had Prophesies, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Rules, directing them to the beleif and use of the voice, a particular defective in this Case, where the dispensations of God amongst us, are so far from concurring with this pretended Voice, that the established Religion is inconsistent with it; we having a compleat platform of the will of God conveighed to us by Voices and Signs from Heaven that rendereth it needless, to have any more extraordinary revelations (til <hi>the great day of the Revelation of all things</hi>) unless we ad mit <hi>menstruam &amp; diurnam fidem,</hi> a new Faith every month and day; for what is this Voice for, is it to <hi>confirm our faith?</hi> that is already done, or we have been Infidels all this while, and indeed know not when we shall be compleat Christians, because we know not when these pretenders will have done; Is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the corruption that <hi>hath overgrown Religion in the theory and practice of it?</hi> Indeed the Prophets under the old Testament, had extraordinary Voices to this purpose, but it was provided by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Theocratia,</hi> that it should be so, and the <hi>Paedagogy</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> might look for it; but its not so under the Gospel, whereby we are Conjured not to be soon shaken in <hi>minde, either by Spirit, or by Word, or by Letter, or by Voice;</hi> is it to beget Faith? <note place="margin">1 <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

way of Physicians, being together with Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy the ground of it, at the heighth in these times; and however God never wrought a Miracle for no other design, than to alter the course of nature.</p>
               <p>Is it to do good to some particular persons? God never miraculously did good to any particular, but with reference to the common good of mankinde; shall we make providence so cheap, as to put it upon such mean Offices, as helping the Patient to another stool more than his Physick could work; to cure a poor body of a swelling, to save 20 s. charge? Its true, when God hath a great and suitable design to be carried on by Miracles, he condescendeth to shew those Miracles, in such charitable and good Offices as these, but not barely <hi>for</hi> them: Christ confirmed Christian Religion by Healing here and there a poor person; but neither he, or any other extraordinary person, came to the world with so low a design, as only to perform those Cures.</p>
               <p>Is it to set out this person for an eminent instance of Heroick virtue and holiness? besides that the man pretends not to such heroick attainments, his carriage being loose and like a good Fellow, his Religion La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinary, his discourse unsavory, sometimes break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to Oaths (as I have been Informed by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry discerning and honest person at the <hi>Charter-House,</hi> who heard him in much passion say, that though the poor people that urged him to touch them, from the length of the journey they had taken to come to him, came from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he would not, <hi>by his Maker,</hi> meddle with them) often incohaerent, faultring, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent (an effect of the weakness of his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) his converse and dealing with Women, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and scandalous; his privadoes and familiars, men

of no great repute for common honesty; and though our Saviour conversed with Publicans to convert them, he was not guided wholly by such men, to set them up in the world; his falacies put upon poor people, as to the places of his abode palpable, his neglect of ordinary Christian duties intollerable, his account of himself very various, broken and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Besides that, the holy men inspired of old time, approved themselves to the most knowing &amp; discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons in the world; yea, and
addressed themselves upon any extraordinary occasions for advice; whereas this man began and set up among the Ignorant and Rude part of mankinde, the <hi>Irish,</hi> easily imposed on; (when he should by right have sate among the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, as the greatest worker of Miracles did, and have answered them about the ground of this pretension, and have asked them <hi>Questions;</hi>) not appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wise men in publick, till his feats had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the more Ignorant in private: How much more agreeable had it been for him, upon the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the pretended Voice, to have repaired to some Reverend Divines and Physicians, than to chat with his Wife and some two or three old Women, and then set up; for it seems he told his Wife the Vision, and when she laughed at him, he trieth experiments upon her, and between them behinde the Curtain was begot this great faculty.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Nay, and this voice was in his sleep too (the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of sowing the Devils Tares) and should every Dreamer of Dreams, practice in the world according to his Visions on his Bed, the whole world would require again, Christs miraculous power of curing Lunaticks, and that but twice; notwithstanding that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57307:12"/>
the doubts of men require the oftner promulgation of it: whereas all the real testimonies that ever God gave, were given as often as there was occasion for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> But the man replyeth, that however wee are <note place="margin">The Impulse that moved him to hearken to this voice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</note> at liberty to dispute this extraordinary faculty of his, he was forced by an impulse and motion over all his body to exercise it.</p>
               <p>But considering how much <hi>Impulse</hi> as they call it, is put out of countenance, and exploded, by reason of the horrid Villainies at all times, especially of late, performed upon that ground: This pretence is worse than the other, there being nothing more desperate than a man given over to his own Impulses, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions, without any regard of Religion, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Laws, Rules, and Principles. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. The jolly man doth not look as if hee were much troubled with <hi>Impulses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He can be no more sure of his <hi>Impulses</hi> being from God, than he was of the Voice, and therefore <hi>this</hi> should not be any Motive to him, to hearken to that: the Impulse may bee a cheat as well as the Voice.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Impulses being the method of Satan, when hee reigned among the Children of disobedience: I mean the Heathens; such as the <hi>Sybils,</hi> the
<hi>Corybants,</hi> the <hi>Bachides,</hi> the <hi>Zabii, &amp;c.</hi> God allowed no Impulses for currant, under either the Old Testament, or New, but what were agreeable to, and made good by the established Religion: If they speak not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this word, <hi>It is because the truth is not in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. God looks upon it, as contrary to the nature of man to be acted by brute Impulses, and Instincts, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hitherto led him to all his performances, by a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> But why should we suspect a man that makes <note place="margin">His taking no mony exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> no advantage of his practise?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. He takes nothing in publick himself, but it hath cost some good round summes of mony to his followers, who are observed, to be noted Projectors. <hi>John Terril</hi> Gent. expending 100 l. to come at him, <hi>James Bivion</hi> 40 l. <hi>William Feltiplace</hi> 60. and others to the number of 500 that have expended above 7000 l. to follow this man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He may have a greater design than mony; let him gain Reputation the first quarter, and he shall not fail of mony the next.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He borroweth mony of his Patients though he takes none.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nay, what if it be proved that such as he, have those that maintain them, and hire them Patients; Now the Story about his great Estate of 800 l. a year, dwindling to a hundred, and he living at the rate of a thousand a year, being certainly kept by a party, and the Patients hee produceth for his vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, being poor Women and Children, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows whence they come, nor whither they go: The <hi>English</hi> understand too well now, what the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers mean, that will take no Tythes, and the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician that will take no fees.</p>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57307:13"/>
And the dullest nose may smell the matter, when hee heareth but this tradition of him, that being a Member of an Independant Church, he was Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated thence, for pretending to this gift of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thereupon his gift left him, until being absolved, he was re-admitted at once to his Church-Priviledge, and his Gift.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Why is hee followed, if he bee but an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor, <note place="margin">His being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> why do not the people cry out against him, and the Magistrates restrain him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the giddy multitude should follow any strange thing: that the <hi>English</hi> so notorious for their unsettledness, should gaze after a novelty at first: is no wonder, especially in such a year of expectation as this is: But they follow him not in any place so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly at first, as they leave him discontentedly at last: He is not so much cryed up in the places where he comes, as hee is cryed down in the places where hee hath been: and hee removes from place to place, not so much to Communicate his virtue, as to save himself, being not known two nights together in one Lodging: I, and whereas it might bee expected, that hee should come with Certificates of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee comes loaded with reproaches from each place where he hath been.</p>
               <p>And if the deluded souls reply, as some very Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously do, that that was our Saviours case (for no less a parallel will do.)</p>
               <p>We Answer, that our Saviour being to alter old Customes, to cross mens lusts, to overthrow their Laws and Government, to prejudice their carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, to reprove and reform their vices and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the Religion to be confirmed by his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, was reproached indeed for the Religion hee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57307:14"/>
                  <hi>taught,</hi> but all that saw him reverenced him <hi>for the Miracles he did.</hi> His Miracles being equally recorded and owned among <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens, and among Christians; their affection and interest, as it is clear, carrying them to speak the worst of his person, when their hearts and consciences thought best of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done by him, as appears in divers places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>But this man pretends to nothing that grieves or disobligeth men, crosseth no mans opinion, stands in no mans way, onely takes on him to help the miserable and afflicted, and to do good, and yet is cried upon not certainly because he doth such inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent things, as cure a Tooth-ache, help the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, launce a Sore, which good old women have practised these many years, without any clamor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, but because he pretendeth these things and doth them not; and so puts an <hi>injury</hi> upon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which they are most impatient of, called by them <hi>a Cheat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to make it evident that this whole Affair is but a Cheat, I'le not instance in the 1000, that have been deluded by him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the West, in <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> and other places, nor those at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> St. <hi>James, Lambeth, Westminster, Fleetstreet, Bread-street, Cheapside, Foster-lane,</hi> that make horrid complaints of his undecent and intollerable hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all their parts; of his pinching, rubbing, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, and lancing their Sores, of his inflaming of their blood and humors, and rendring many of them by cutting them and other wayes, incurable: Not to tell you, that there is not a man, woman or childe, that may be trusted, and are well known, that is the better for him; that all that he doth, is but by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57307:14"/>
raising peoples Imaginations, especially the weaker sort, by rubbing and chafing, to scatter the humor for the present to the Patients little ease, till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth with more violence after the chafing than ever: I say, not to instance in any thing but what I have seen.</p>
               <p>This Mr. <hi>Greatrates</hi> was at one Capt. <hi>Cressets</hi> in <note place="margin">What Cures he performed at the <hi>Charter house.</hi>
                  </note> Charter house-yard, the 10, 11, and 12 of <hi>March,</hi> there several people applying themselves to him, some he would not take notice of, notwithstanding that he had an impulse, and could not but heal and doe good: Others he could not help, he said, although he pretended his second voice commissioned him to heal all Diseases: Others he directed to some imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent means, as to wash their sore eyes in fair water, and it may be he said, <hi>God might do them good.</hi> One that was almost blinde, he directed to some frivolous remedy, adding what every body saw, that God in time would make him blinde. Others that were deafish, he rubbed and chafed, poking in their ears, leaving them after all that within three hours in the same condition he found them.</p>
               <p>But one poor Fellows Case there is, more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent than any that I have heard of, except the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman in <hi>Austin-Fryers,</hi> and the Gentleman of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poor man, a member of the <hi>Charter-house,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">A Fellow in the <hi>Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi> which <hi>Greatrates</hi> had almost killed, and how.</note> a little troubled with a sore knee, and so little that he did but just take notice of it, must needs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress himself to him: He pincheth and launceth the poor man, the Sore gangrenes, the worthy Doctor <hi>Bevoir,</hi> Physician to that House, and Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> the Chirurgeon, are sent for to the fellow, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a day after takes his bed: They gave him over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57307:15"/>
for dead; yet using all means possible for his recovery, with the blessing of God upon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and incredible care and pains, they stop the Gangrene, set the man past danger, though he be like to be long bed-rid. <hi>Greatrates</hi> heard of this, and comes to the man, and would have been tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with him, but the man would not endure him, charging him with his blood, if he had died, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him no more to delude the people.</p>
               <p>If he hath not the grace to make good use of this Instance, to undeceive himself, who as I told you, I hoped rather deluded than a deluder, and the world: Certainly the Magistrate, who would not hinder any man from doing any good he can pretend to, will take care that he do no more mischief: And the people being now convinced, how easily they may be deceived, will take care whom they follow.</p>
               <p>But as the <hi>Athiest,</hi> thinking our Saviour did all his Miracles by the power of mens Imaginations, say that Christ, so some people say this man <hi>cannot</hi> do any Miracles because of mens unbelief. Ah that any Christian should talk so, who must needs know, that the meaning of that passage about Christ, is not that Christ could not work Miracles, because men believe not, but that he could not prevail with himself to do what he could, and that it is not the want of Imagination or Fancy which is indeed enough to set up a Juggler, whereof the <note n="a" place="margin">And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wrought Miracles on things that had no fancy, as the Fig-tree, the dead, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the windes, the Heavens, people at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, the loaves.</note> 
                  <hi>Jewes</hi> had good store; but of the grace of Faith, which was the condition of embracing, and benefiting by a Saviour, that rendred them uncapable of his Miracles: And can the man blame men for want of Faith, when they see nothing that deserveth it; or was he so weak as to undertake Miracles, which yet he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57307:15"/>
unless men believed he could do that which no man ever saw hee could? It is well the folly is grown so notorious, that it hath no other plea than this, <hi>That he cannot cheat the people, if they will not trust him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his Jack-Puddings, I mean his Vouchers, and Familiars (who have been caught in fearful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths about him, and his acquaintance with Friars, hee speaking one thing and they another; he saying hee had not heard from such a man in eight years, and one of his followers shewing a Letter hee had from him in eight daies; hee shewing how hee had Cured one with a stroke, and one of his Comerades asking the man unawares, how his Pill, Glister, and Plaister wrought last night; hee pretending to pray all day, and yet one of his Zanies saying, to take off from him the suspition of a Phanatick, that hee was none of them that spent their time in Canting, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Praying:) I say, his Disciples alledged for him, that the Apostles could not work some Miracles that they attempted, To which we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That possibly they could not, where they had no Commission, as they had not but in some cases before our Saviours Resurrection; and if for that reason he can cure no Disease, let him say so; or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly they might by unbelief, whereof they were too frail in Christs life time, provoke God to suspect the virtue which they really had; shall a pretender thence argue for want of that power which hee never had? let him shew us that he can do any thing that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did, and wee will bear with him, if hee fails only in what they failed in; however this is certain, we believe Christ and the Apostles could do more Miracles, than in some cases they would; wee see

               <p n="1">1 That true Miracles, or the altering of the course <note n="a" place="margin">The Devil may do strange things, and what we would think were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nature, but nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally so.</note> of nature by God, who alone can do it, are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Testimonies, that God useth to evidence his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence (otherwise invisible) with any Doctrine or person, sent by him to the world.</p>

hath not, but possibly may be in an error, as this man may be, men could not be sure when Miracles confirm truth and when they do not; for by this it should seem they might go along with truth in one man and with error in another, and so men should see the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est assurances they have of Gods being with any Doctrine attending the looser and the stricter Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men, the indifferency of the Latitude-man. and the heat of the Zealot; and so men that had a certain way of intercourse with God, and discerning of his voice, by the Miracle, that so solemnly attended his voice, will loose it, if Miracles be wrought by all sorts of men, upon every petty and trivial occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="3">3 God doth not work such a Miracle as this is, that is produce an effect without any second causes, but for some very considerable design; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as a learned man observeth, when God works Miracles, they would not bee taken notice of, nor thought to bee an alteration of the course of nature, but only some rare contingencies, that lye hid in the order of causes, but only break out at some times.</p>

after much contest with the Magicians of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> being owned as the effects of the finger of God; and Christs as things that evidence him the son of God; whereas there is nothing above the art of man, and the power of Nature in any Miracle, since those of Christ and his Primitive followers.</p>

               <p>And these people though at first allowed, because one or two of the first of them seemed to bee serious <note place="margin">The reason why the <hi>Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and punished.</note> men, and men of Estates, and because they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the publick good, and took no mony, are now severely prohibited.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because they are a lewd people, unlikely to have that Commerce with God they pretend to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because they are but loose, and unsettled in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and would render others so.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because they made the people tempt God to do that by an extraordinary way of Miracles, which he had appointed to bee done in the ordinary way of means and Physick.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because they had seduced people to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the ordinary means of their preservation, to the danger of many peoples lives.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Because they brought the Curse of God upon poor people, many having confessed, that they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished under the just hand of God, for having any thing to do with these <hi>Salutators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Because they were abetted by desperate men of dangerous principles and practises.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Because they took the Name of God in vain, and abused his Word to superstitious purposes.</p>
               <p n="8">

8. Because they performed no real, or lasting cures.</p>

               <p n="10">10. Because many of them could do nothing till they had well drunk (a pottle of Sack, being required to a Miracle, when they pretended that they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired) and had with them a madde Dogge.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Because they gave occasion to strange discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses about the Miracles of Christ and his followers, and so overthrew the great ground of Faith.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Because they perswaded people to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves mischief, that they might do cures.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Because there were several instances brought in of their confederacies, impostures, and juggles.</p>
               <p>In fine, because they did a world of mischief, and but little good.</p>
               <p>Because some of them were convicted of familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with Satan: Because the pretence and cheat, by reason of the curiosity of some, and necessity of others, was spreading: because these Miracle-mongers prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at last Athiests, Apostates, or Hereticks, because it took people off their callings, spending their time in vanities: Because some of them were <hi>Enthusiastical:</hi> because they set many others upon unlawful distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and intollerable courses to attain that gift: Because they were mostly men of bad looks: Because they took men off their art, industry, and skill, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to that in Physick, that gifted men do in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, both with a design to overthrow the standing Ordinance, and order of God.</p>

Courts, to be considered by all sober Christians.</p>
               <p>But what need, you will say, all this, when Mr. <hi>Stubbs</hi> himself in a <note n="a" place="margin">Called the Miraculous Conformist.</note> Book written in the mans behalf, hath sufficiently laid open his pretence; for indeea upon perusing that Book, I finde,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the ground <note n="b" place="margin">Page the 3. of that Book.</note> of this strange attempt, is but an <hi>Impulse,</hi> and some chat <hi>thereupon between him, his Wife, and a poor Woman of the Village.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>That the man</hi> observing how his stroking <note n="c" place="margin">Page 4.</note> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual upon some Diseases, betook himself, without any Voice or Impulse, to Incision.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That <note n="d" place="margin">Page 4.</note> Dean <hi>Rust</hi> being solemnly employed by my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> to bring him from <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Lady <hi>Conway,</hi> he came, and could do her no good.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That some say his body smells strongly, but Mr. <hi>Stubbs found it not so,</hi> which if it did, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary in the Case.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That notwithstanding the pretended vertue of his body, together with the pinching, rubbing and cutting of peoples Sores, and the peoples imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fermenting the masse of blood, spirits, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, (wherein lye all the diseases as Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> saith he pretends to cure, for he medleth not with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in whom nature is decayed) all that he can do, is to ease people <hi>a little</hi> by Pinching and Rubbing an humour <hi>from one place to another,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> takes some paines to prove Natural, Ordinary, and not at all Miraculous, by many instances; <note n="e" place="margin">Of the said Poole, where he sheweth how Nature and Art doth as much as Mr. <hi>Greatrates</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to</note> Pag. 18, 24. 25. yea, and Pag. 14, he concludes that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of a distemper from place to place, is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Nature invigorated, and not of his touch.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That there are none perfectly healed by him, one Gentleman failing because he laid aside his <hi>Cap too soon;</hi>

into an Aposthume: The Maid that was struck dumb by a Poyson, being able onely to cry <hi>Ma</hi> for mother, for all his stroaking; the Gentlewoman that he went to dispossesse of a Devil, when she was onely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the winde, being still troubled with the Collick; and the rest of the simple people men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in that book, finding no other benefit of his rubbing, pinching, and cutting, than a little alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as they poor people imagine for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And therefore Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> saith, that as he added Lancing and Pinching, without any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Commission to his stroaking, when he saw it would not do, so hee added Physick to his Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; for hee saw him apply Eye Salve to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Eye, and he had leave of him to apply Physick to others after his stroking; so dividing the honour of the Gift, that Mr. <hi>Greatrates touched, and</hi> Mr. <hi>Stubbes Cured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to say no more, I finde, that all that Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> can say for this pretender, is, that for ought he can guesse, by a few <note n="a" place="margin">Page 4, 5. 14. he saith he had not the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to converse with him long.</note> hours converse with him, he may be a Primitive Christian, and a conformist, though no rigid one; that there were formerly Gifts of Healing in the Primitive times, which he proves out of I <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>That the cheating Souldiers called <hi>Salutators</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> that <hi>Pyrrhus, Vespatian, Simon Magus, Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> and other Heathens, that some <hi>Turks,</hi> by a Gift left them by Mahomet, do feats of the same nature; about whom Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> refers us <note n="b" place="margin">The substance whereof toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with, &amp;c.</note> to <hi>Delrio;</hi> who indeed hath written six Books of Magick, not to approve, as a man would think by Mr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> his quotation, but to discover these Legerdemains.</p>
               <p>And that he findes nothing in what he calls Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57307:26"/>
but what he undertakes to: Salve by Natural causes, Pag. 18, 19, 20, 21. the effects whereof, by reason of the ignorance of some sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may seem Miraculous, which to others, more knowing, are ordinary, the Sympathetick Cure, and others of the same nature may bee thought Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the Vulgar, when they are known Physick to Phylosophers; and therefore when I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated you to pardon the mistakes of a Letter, that I have not time to Read over; I conclude, that though you and other Reverend Persons, may think charitably the man means no hurt, all men confess, as well as our Society, that hee can do no good.</p>
