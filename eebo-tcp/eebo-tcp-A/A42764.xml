            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I am glad to see you Sir, will you take a walk with me this morning, and tell me what good newes yee have heard, for I have not yet been in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, the place most infected with the <hi>Athenian</hi> disease.</p>

               <p>None truly, but this I confesse, that though I cannot but allow those who from their affection to the Cause, are inquisitive of newes from severall quarters, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make some good use of what they heare; yet for mine own part, one thing sticks with me, which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth me not either to be so curious in seeking, or so

I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put you in mind, that in all ages God hath by posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Lawes descended into many particularities with man.

Under the Law, beside morall and forensicall observances, there were many ceremoniall Statutes. And under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Christ and his Apostles have left another Law, which though it lay opon us, neither many nor burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some performances, yet bindeth us to such and such things in Ecclesiasticall policy. The particulars we find in the Acts of the Apostles, and in the Epistles, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>

               <p>Many particulars of that kind there are in the Acts and Epistles of the Apostles. But that those things were intended as perpetuall and binding ordinances, is a great question.

               <p>I answer, First there is no ground at all in Scripture for such a distinction, for the Scripture holds not out one form of Church-government, for times of persecution, another for times of peace. But rather one form to bee perpetuall and continued, till the second coming of Jesus Christ. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>That which ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> have already, hold fast till I come.</hi> So 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14. before cited, and the like. 2. <hi>Chrysostome Hom.</hi> 12. in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> doth shew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse sinnes for which the best Law-givers had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no punishment. And where there are Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, yet there are no Lawes nor civill punishments for somethings which must needs fall within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of Church-discipline, such as ignorance of God, neglect of family worship, living in malice, or envy, &amp;c. 3. And though the civill or municipall Lawes should reach to all offences which are supposed to fall under the verge of Church-discipline, yet there is still a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary use of both. For instance, a Traitor, or a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer being excommunicated by the Church, is by the blessing of God gained to true repentance, humiliation, and confession, whereupon hee is loosed and remitted, and again received into the bosome of the Church: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse the civill sword falleth upon him; were hee never so penitent, shall such a one either escape the civill sword because reconciled to the Church, or shall he after God hath given him mercy, and a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of repentance, die under the dreadfull sentence of excommunication, because Justice must bee done by the Magistrate. There is no way of avo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ding great inconveniences on both sides, but by holding the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51035:11"/>
distinct uses both of the sword of the Magistrate, and censures of the Church. 4. And when they are most coincident, it is but materially or objectively, not formally: one and the same man must bee civilly punished, because justice and the law of the land so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and that the Common wealth may bee kept in Peace and Order; he must also bee Ecclesiastically cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that his soule may be humbled, that hee may bee filled with godly sorrow, and with shame and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of face, and drawn to repentance, (if possible) which the Church, not the Magistrate, driveth at.</p>

               <p>I have heard it asserted by some learned men, that among the Jewes, there was no government nor disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the Church distinct from the government of the State, yea, that there was no such distinction as Church and State, but that the Jewish Church was the Jewish State, and the Jewish State the Jewish Church; and if it was so among them (whose formes you take in many particulars for patterns) I would fain know why it may not be so among us.</p>

               <p>Though the Jewish Church and Common wealth were for the most part not different materially, the same men being members of both, even as in all Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publickes, yet they were formally different one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in regard of distinct Acts, Lawes, Courts, Officers, Censures, and Administrations. For, 1. The Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law given was given to them as a Church, the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law given to them as a State. 2. They did not worship, doe sacrifice, pray, praise, &amp;c. as a State; nor did they kill malefactors with the sword as a Church. 3. As the Lords matters and the Kings matters were distinguished,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51035:11"/>
so there were two different Courts for judging of the one and the other, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8.11. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> took away the Jewish State and Civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet their Church did remain. 5.

               <p>I answer, men were excluded from the Temple and worship, either for ceremoniall or morall uncleanes, the former is particularly determined in the law, the latter not so, but left as a necessary consequence from the law, for if God would have men kept back for ceremonial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanes, it may be for touching (though casually and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly) a vessell, a seat, a cloth, a body, or somewhat else that was unclean; surely it was much more his will that such as are morally unclean by a prophane or scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life, should not be admitted. However it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51035:13"/>
that matters of fact should bee examined by a Court, whether they did fall within the verge of the law or not. But what will you say, if I give you scripture for excommunication, by a judiciall sentence. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.8. we read of a mixed meeting of the Princes, Elders, Priests and Levites, where it was decreed that whosoever would not come to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> within 3. dayes, should be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, with the forfeiture of all his substance; <hi>and himselfe separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</hi> A double punishment Civil and Ecclesiastical, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture and excommunication, according as that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occasion made a conjuncture and concurrence of the Civill and the Ecclesiasticall Sanedrim at that time, <hi>Lyra, Hugo Cardinalis, Cajetan,</hi> and of ours <hi>Diodati,</hi> and <hi>Lavater,</hi> all upon the place (beside others who cite the place occasionally) do agree that the separation from the congregation (<gap reason="foreign">

So in the new Testament this iniquity was established by a law, that whosoever should confesse that Jesus was the Christ, should be cast out of the Synagogue, 10.9.22. and 12.42. and 16.2.</p>

               <p>I know that both Jewish and Christian Interpreters have much differed among themselves, in expounding that commination of the Law. But I shall only offer my reasons against these two Glosses which you have mentioned, and then tell you what I conceive to be the true meaning. To expound all those places of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates cutting off men by death, were to make the Laws of God more bloody then <hi>Draco's:</hi> I appeal to your self, doe you thinke it at all credible, that God would have men put to death for eating of the fat, or the blood, though by chance, for making a perfume like the Preistly perfume to smell, for touching a dead body,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.38 Lev. 7.15.17. Num. 29.13. 20.</note> or a grave, or a Tent, wherein a man had died, or for touching something which he that was uncleane had touched, and not being sprinkled thereafter with the water of seperation: yet for these and the like ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall defilements and tresspasses, men were to be cut off from the Congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> Now for that other Exposition, of cutting off by the hand of God, that which they take for the ground and foundation of it, that is, that the cutting off, mentioned in the Law, is understood only of private sinnes, known to God only, and which could not be proved by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, this I say, if it could be proved, would indeed make good their Interpretation, but the truth is, it is a meere conjecture, for which they have no warrant in the Word. Nay, the Word is against it: for the end of that cutting off, w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> might feare to doe that, which they s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> so sore punished, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 17 4.5. Which use they could not make of a divine judgement inflicted for a private sinne. I know they doe further object from <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.5.6. that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51035:14"/>
the cutting off, was a work of God, not of men; But to that I say, it was not so, except in extraordinary cases, when men, who should have cut off the wicked; did it not: and this appears plainly from <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.4, 5. <hi>And if the people of the land hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: Then</hi> (marke <hi>then,</hi> and in that case) <hi>I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off.</hi> Wherefore I conclude, that the cutting off in the Law, and especially, in the Ceremoniall Law, can be nothing else but Excommunication from the Church, and Communion in the holy things. Which as it is most received among our Expositors, so the Apostle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. doth give us a hint of it: for as it is plaine from <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8. that he alludes to the history of the Passover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. so when he saith, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>Put away from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your selves that wicked person,</hi> he hath respect to, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.19. Where it it is said, <hi>Whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the Congregation of Israel.</hi> All this I conclude with a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his <hi>bloody Tenent, cap.</hi> 121. where though he doth not acknowledg a spirituall excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in the Jewish Church, yet he acknowledgeth such a coercive power in cutting off, as hath for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype and paralell of it Excommunication in the Ghristian Church. <hi>Out of that blessed temporall estate, (saith he) to be cast or carried captive, was their Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or casting out of Gods sight.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.23. <hi>Therefore was the Blasph<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

               <p>Though Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> be a man much esteemed by me, both for his sufferings, and much good service done by him in the Church, yet I must say, he wrongs both the Truth and himself, in taking upon him to goe against the whole current of Interpreters, antient and moderne, without any evidence of reason: and he must remember, that in these particulars, hee doth not so much oppose the Independents, as all the Reformed Churches, while as he goeth about to throw out of their hands the chief Scriptures upon which they ground Church Discipline. Now all the circumstances of the Text, make against that Exposition, and prove, That it is not a Civill, but a Spirituall Court, which Christ there establisheth. For 1. those words, <hi>If thy Brother trespasse against thee,</hi> are not ment of personall or civill injuries (of which our Saviour Christ would not be Judge, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.14.) but as <hi>Augustine, Tostatus,</hi> and others doe rightly expound them, they are to be understood, of all manner of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls, by which we trespasse against our Brother, in as much as we trespasse against the law of Charity, which commandeth us to edify one another, and to promote the spirituall good one of another: now when a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth not only not edify, but scandalize, which is a deterioration; yea, (so farre as lieth in him) a destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his brothers soule; this is undeniably a great trespasse against his brother: which kind of trespasse, as the King, and head of the Church, Jesus Christ,

               <p n="2">2. As the case supposed, so the end proposed is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, that is, that the offended brother should reprove the offanding brother; and tell him his fault, and that for the good of his soul: <hi>If he shall heare thee, thou hast gained thy brother</hi>; that is, thou hast rescued his soule by Repentance, from sinne, and so from the wrath of God: wherein Christ had respect to that Law. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sinne upon him.</hi>

               <p>I would rather heare some Arguments from the New Testament, for I doubt these from the Old Testament shall be more subject to exception.</p>

               <p>To me it is plaine, that these things doe as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne us now, as the Jewes of old, which whosoever denieth, must shew, that either we may take no rules nor patternes from the Old Testament: or that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Lawes and practises were not intended by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost to binde us, (as other things in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament doe) but were ceremoniall and typicall, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bind the Jewes onely. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> in his <hi>bloody Tenant</hi> (though I doe not remember that any where he answereth to those particular passages which I have cited, yet) perceiving that such arguments from the Old Testament can not be taken off without this answer, that all these were typicall and figurative: he therefore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much upon that ground, and so deviseth more types and figures in the Old Testament then ever any body did before him, and pleaseth himselfe with such fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and conjectures therein, as I dare say, will satisfie no indifferent Reader: and in effect making void by his principles all arguments from the Old Testament, so that we may not from the examples of the godly Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> teach Christian Magistrates what their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51035:19"/>
is, nor argue thus, God commanded that the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> should have a copy of the Book of the Law by them, and read therein, that they should not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply wives, &amp;c. Therefore Christian Princes should search the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.17, 18, 19.</note> should not multiply wives, &amp;c. or thus. The Priests and Levites had a sufficient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Therefore so should the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell: or thus; The Jewes were commanded to rest from all servile labour on the Sabbath day. Therefore so should Christians on the Lords day: or thus; Warres were lawfull in the old Testament; Therefore they are lawfull still. Or the like. All these shall be cast aside, upon this ground, they were tipicall, therefore no pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns to us.</p>
               <p>But because you desire an Argument from the New Testament: I will convince your judgement from thence also: Sure I am, I have better grounds in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, against the Toleration now in question, then Master <hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi> hath found for it, in his Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.38.39. He holdeth that we may build upon <hi>Gamali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> speech, as Authorised by God, <hi>there being nothing in all this speech (excepting only the Historicall Instances, the truth of which, it seems was generally known, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by Iosephus their great Historian) but what is fully consonant with the Word of God,</hi> saith he. And so he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the Sceptik Principles of that Nullifidian, who razeth the very foundation of the Christian Faith, and maketh it a very doubtfull case whether the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrine was from God, or from men. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to my Arguments. First, you shall doe well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I said concerning Church censutes, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. under which scandalous and obstinate delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, doe fall, the pretence of Conscience, being no

exception for them. The Ministers of the Gospel <hi>have in readinesse to revenge all disobedience,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.6.

Revel.</hi> 2.14.15. that is, because thou hast tolerated them, and hast not cast them out. It is thy fault, that they are there in the Church. The like challenge is sent to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> vers. 20. <hi>I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferedst that woman Iezebell, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her self a Prophetesse, to teach, and to seduce my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, &amp;c.</hi> That chapter is so cleare for the point, that Master <hi>Williams</hi> acknowledgeth it proves fully, that Christ hath endued the Ministers and Governours of his Church, with power to suppresse Heresy and errour, and the spreaders thereof, be who they will be.

               <p>I was about to answer the same, that if those places prove any thing, it is onely the suppressing of Hereticks and Schismaticks by Church censures, not at all by the civill coercive power of the Magistrate.</p>

having proved that Heriticks and Shismaticks, though miscarrying with so much opinion of conscience, as to thinke themselves Apostles or Prophets, may be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and cast out of the Church (which is the case, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.) I did never imagine but where the soule is punished with the greatest punishment which can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on earth, that is, Excomunication; much more may the body be punished by the Magistrate, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the offence shall require: especially considering that the Magistrat is a nursing father to the Church,<note place="margin">Isay 49.23.</note> and is to protect and assist her, not to suffer her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and censures to be despised and set at nought. But to satisfie you yet more touching the Magistrats part, consider well that passage <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>For he is the Minister of God to thee for good, but if thou doe that which is evill be afraid, for he beareth not the sword in vaine: for he is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.</hi>

               <p>But in the meane time I can tell you one thing, that it is a mighty prejudice that lies in the mindes of many against the Prysbetery, that tyranny and rigour doe accompany it. And this now bringeth into my minde some other prejudices. I have seene a Booke come from <hi>Oxford,</hi> entituled, <hi>An Answer by Letter to a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who desired of a Divine some reasons, by which it might appeare how inconsistent Presbyteriall Government is with Monarchy.</hi> In which I finde many things which breed an <hi>Odium</hi> of that Government. Among other things, it tells me,<note place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> that this is one of the Articles of the Presbyterian faith. <hi>No Minister preaching in Publike, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or Treason or railing at King, Councell, the Prince, Iudges, is accountable, or punishable by King, Parliament, Councell, or any Indicature whatsoever.

men, suffereth not Land-Lords to sue for their rents, and the like. That they bring all cases and causes under their cognition and judgement, <hi>sub formalitate scandali,</hi> under the notion of scandall, and for the glory of God.

               <p>I have seen and read the book, which surely was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the speciall inspiration of the father of lies, that the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But men of understanding will not be taken with such bold and shamelesse calumnies as come from the pen of that son of Belial. I could name both the Author, and the lying Records of a persecuting Prelate, whence he borrowed his stories, in which there are many known untruths; and where there is any truth in the matters of fact which he relates, there is such addition of his own Interpretations of mens actions, such variation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and such concealing of the true grounds, ends, and circumstances of such actions, as maketh them to appear quite another thing then they were. And if his stories of the speeches, actions, or opinions of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men were all true (as they are not) yet how doth that prove that Presbyteriall government is inconsistent with Monarchy. Magistracie, Laws, Trading, Peace. &amp;c. This must be proved from the principles or necessarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of Presbyteriall government, not from the actions or speeches of this or that private man, especially they having so said or done not in any reference to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall

clear account of our judgement concerning both these, in the words of the second book of the Discipline of the Church of <hi>Scotland, Chap. 1.

As the Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the sword of the Magistrate in things which concerne the Civill Peace: so the Magistrate</hi> (if Christian) <hi>is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the keyes of the Church, in matters which concerne the peace of his conscience, and the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> The latter cannot bee denied <hi>in thesi,</hi> no more then the former: and when it comes to the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> there is much to bee trusted to the prudence and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pastors and ruling Elders; and when all comes to all, the failing is more like to be in the defect, then in the excesse.
