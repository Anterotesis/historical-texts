            <title>Irenarches redivivus. Or, A briefe collection of sundry usefull and necessary statutes and petitions in Parliament (not hitherto published in print, but extant onely in the Parliament rolls) concerning the necessity, utility, institution, qualification, jurisdiction, office, commission, oath, and against the causlesse, clandestine dis-commissioning of justices of peace; fit to be publikely known and observed in these reforming times. With some short deductions from them; and a touch of the antiquity and institution of assertors and justices of peace in other forraign kingdomes. Together with a full refutation of Sir Edward Cooks assertion, and the commonly received erronious opinion, of a difference between ordinances and Acts of Parliament in former ages; here cleerly manifested to be then but one and the same in all respects, and in point of the threefold assent.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To our Lord the King, pray the Commons, <hi>That the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Peace may be of the moſt loyall and ſufficient men of the Counties, reſiding in the ſaid Counties, and not in forraign places, and of the Justices of Labourers in like manner; and that no Juſtice may

               <hi>In the Parliament of</hi> 2 R. 2. <hi>held at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>pars prima, n.</hi> 41. <hi>I finde this Act not printed:</hi> Item, <hi>the Commons ſhew,</hi> That whereas divers Sheriffs of Counties are divers times aſſigned by Commiſſion of our Lord the King, to be Juſtices of Peace in the ſame Counties where they are Sheriffs, do oftentimes hold their Seſſions of the Peace for to indite many people of felonies, and of other treſpaſſes, for this purpoſe, to take of the indited outragious mainprizes and fines, to the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction (or impoveriſhing) and oppreſſion of the people: that thereupon it would pleaſe our moſt gracious King and his Counſell ſo to ordain, that no man during the time that he ſhall be Sheriff, ſhall at all be ordained a Juſtice of Peace in the ſame County whereof he is Sheriff, in amendment of the miſchiefs aforeſaid.</p>

in every County of <hi>England</hi> there may be ordained fix or eight Juſtices of the Peace, whereof two ſhall be skilfull of the Law; and that they ſhall be firmly charged by our Lord the King and his Counſell, to keep their Seſſions four times a yeer at leaſt, according to the Statutes: and that all the Servants, Victuallers, Labourers and Artificers that ſhall be attainted before them of Exceſſe, and which ſhall make a fine for their treſpaſſe, that their fine ſhall not be leſſe then their Exceſſe, but more if there be cauie, by the diſcretion of the Juſtices; ſo to puniſh them, and by all other wayes as the Statutes which have been made concerning them purport; And that every one of the Juſtices for the time that they ſhall be preſent at any one of the Seſſions, ſhall have wages of our Lord the King, for every day a certain ſum for their Seſſions, to be paid by the hands of the Sheriffs where they ſhall be Juſtices, out of the iſſues of their Baily-wicks; and that the Juſtices may have freely Writs for their Fees under ſeal out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> to the Sheriffs, for to pay their Wages aforeſaid: And the Sheriffs may alſo have Writs out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> to the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to allow them ſuch payments upon their accompt: That none ſhall be aſſociated to the aforeſaid Juſtices by Writ out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> nor other manner: And that the ſaid Juſtices, Sheriffs, Lords of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Conſtables and Bailiffs in every County, may have power to attach and arreſt in their Baily-wicks, all thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants who are ſtrong of body to ſerve and labour, according to the Statute; and if they refuſe to ſerve, that they ſhall be committed to the next Goal, to continue in priſon untill they will juſtifie themſelves, according as the Statute hath ordained: and that a Statute may be made in this Parliament to endure perpetually, from the feaſt of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> next to come, and that at the ſame time Proclamation may be made by the Sheriff in every Market-town throughout the Realm, of the force of this Statute, ſo that the ſaid Servants, Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers, Artificers and Labourers, may withdraw themſelvers from their outragious priſes (or wages) if they will, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the ſaid Commons ſhall be in ſhort time deſtroyed and

            <p>Firſt, that the inſtitution of diſcreet, valiant, able and active Juſtices of Peace in every County of the Realm, in the judgement of our ancient Princes, Nobles, Peers, Knights and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, hath been alwayes reſolved and enacted to be the moſt probable, prevalent and ſuccesfull means, to ſuppreſſe all publike Malefactors of all

ſorts; to reform and redreſſe all publike oppreſſions, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, diſorders and miſchiefs in the Common-wealth; to ſettle all diſtractions, and to reſtore and preſerve the peace and tranquility of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that Juſtices of the peace in former times have frequently been nominated and appointed by the Knights, Commons and Lords in Parliament, by the Kings aſſent, as well as by the King, his Counſel, Chancellour and Treaſurer; that ſuch Parliamentary nominations and elections have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been beſt, and moſt beneficiall to the Common-wealth, and that the conſtituting of able and active Juſtices of Peace hath been one principall end of ancient Parliaments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that none are fit to be Juſtices of Peace but ſuch as are both <note n="a" place="margin">18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 2 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 1. 2 <hi>H</hi> 5 c. 1. 18 <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, that no Sheriff, under Sheriff, Coroner, Keeper of a Goal or Priſon, Retainer or Servant to great men, or perſon of mean fortune and quality (diſabled by the foreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Petitions and Statutes upon very good grounds) ought to be put into Commiſſions of the Peace (whiles they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch) to prevent extortion, bribery and oppreſſion of the People.</p>

            <p>Sixtly, that Juſtices of the Peace may ſometimes be put into, and ſometimes thruſt out of Commiſſion by corrupt and ſiniſter means and falſe ſuggeſtions, and that ſuch an abuſe is worthy the ſerious conſideration and reformation of a Parliament.</p>

            <p>Ninthly, that the power and juriſdiction of Juſtices of the Peace ſince their firſt inſtitution, hath been much enlarged by ſundry new Acts of Parliament and Commiſſions; and that the greater authority they have given them, the more are they enabled to promote the Republicks peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115458:17"/>
King, Lords and Commons in Parliament, and therefore Ordinances of Parliament bound the Subjects as really, as far and long as Statutes, as well after Parliaments ended, as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Seſſions wherein they were made: Which is evident by the premiſes, by moſt Prologues to our printed Statutes at large from King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, by ſome hundreds of printed Acts and Statutes, by this clauſe of the Writ for the election of Knights and Burgeſſes; <hi>Ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum &amp; conſentiendum his quae tunc ibi de communi conſilio Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni noſtri (favente Deo) contigerit ORDINARI,</hi> (from which word <hi>Ordinari,</hi> this title of <hi>Ordinance</hi> was derived:) and by the Rols of Parliament, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> make expreſſe mention of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Parliament as all one with Acts and Statutes, as 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 15, 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 8. 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 8, 16. 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 1. <hi>Rotulus Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinationum,</hi> 20 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 12, 13. 28 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 10, 16, 55. 37 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 12, 38. 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 11. 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 10, 12, 13, 75, 79, 34, 110, 186. 51 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 11, 47, 82. 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 56. 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 46. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 104, 106. with ſundry others, and the Year-books of 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 7. &amp; 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Indeed I find <note n="q" place="margin">4 Inſtit. p. 25</note> Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> putting this difference between an <hi>Act of Parliament, and an Ordinances; that an Ordinance wanteth the threefold conſent</hi> (which an Act alwayes hath) <hi>and is ordained by one or two of them:</hi> which he endeauours to prove by 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 16, &amp;c. 37 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 39. 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 56, &amp;c. to which he might have added, 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 19. But under his favour, theſe Records will neither prove nor warrant his difference: for firſt, there was the conſent of the King, Lords and Commons to the Ordinance concerning Apparell, 37 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 38, &amp; 39. which was commanded to be ſtrictly executed as a Law, till the next Parliament: So as this Record is point-blank againſt him in that very thing for which he cites it: and his firſt Record of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 16, &amp;c. hath not one ſillable in it concerning Ordinances of Parliament, or to warrant any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen Acts and Ordinances, for which he quotes it, which is cleerly refuted by this notably Record of 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 47. where <hi>The Commons Petition the King, That NO STAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TE NOR
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115458:17"/>
ORDINANCE may be made or granted at the Petition of the Clergie, without aſſent of the Commons; and that the Commons ſhall not be bound by any of the Clergies conſtitutions, made without their aſſent; for they will not be obliged to their</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Therefore the threefold aſſent was then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as well as Statutes.</note> STATUTES NOR ORDINANCES <hi>made againſt their aſſent.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>condly, the King's conſent was to all the Preſidents he cites, and no Ordinance nor Preſident is produced by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of any Ordinance made by the Lords or Commons joyntly or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, without the King's conſent thereto. Thirdly, 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 19. puts a difference between Ordinances of Parliament, and <note n="b" place="margin">Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> miſtakes an Ordinance of State for an Ordinance of Parliament, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the three fold aſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

Fourthly, all that 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 56. proves, is but this, That the Kings ſole anſwers to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (eſpecially without the Lords concurrent aſſent) makes them <note n="c" place="margin">See 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. n. 43, 46, 47, 52.</note> no Acts of Parliament, but meerly Ordinances of State, AS SOME AFFIRMED. Whereupon the Commons prayed, That their Petitions, to which King <hi>Edward</hi> the third in his Parliament held the 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeer of his reign, gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Le Roy le Voet;</hi> might be turned into into Acts. But it no wayes proves, that Acts and Ordinances of Parliament are different things, and not one and the ſame, ſince our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all Ages have reſolved the contrary. This I ſhall undeniably manifeſt by our printed Statutes at large, which every man may peruſe, becauſe ſome may deem it a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous paradox in this innovating and erring Age. That Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Acts and Ordinances of Parliament are all one, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Firſt, by the printed Prologues and preambles to moſt of our Statutes and Acts of Parliament. I ſhall begin with the Preamble to the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge</hi> made in the two and fiftieth yeer of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>In the yeer of grace 1267. in the two and fiftieth yeer of the reign of King <hi>Henry,</hi> ſon of King <hi>John,</hi> in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ias</hi> of Saint <hi>Martin; for the better eſtate of this Realm ef</hi> England, <hi>and for the more ſpeedy adminiſtration of juſtice, as belongeth to the Office of a King; the more diſcreet men of the Realm being called together,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:115458:18"/>
AS WELL OF THE HIGHER AS OF THE LOWER ESTATE; <hi>it was provided,</hi> AGREED AND ORDAINED, <hi>That whereas the Realm of</hi> England <hi>of late had been diſquieted with manifold troubles and diſſentions, for reformation whereof,</hi> STATUTES AND LAWES <hi>be moſt neceſſary, whereby the peace and tranquility of the people muſt be conſerved; wherein the King intending to deviſe convenient remedy, hath made theſe</hi> ACTS, ORDINANCES AND STATUTES <hi>underwritten, which he willeth</hi> TO BE OBSERVED FOR EVERMORE FIRMLY AND INVIOLABLY OF ALL HIS SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECTS, <hi>as well high as low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then follow twenty nine Statutes, continuing yet in force, all uſhered in with this <hi>generall Preamble:</hi> from which I ſhall obſerve,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that Acts, Ordinances and Statutes were all one and the ſame, and uſed as <hi>Synonumaes</hi> in that Age. Secondly, that they were all equally provided, agreed and ordained by the King, and the more diſcreet men of the Realm called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well of the higher as of the lower eſtate: therefore Ordinances then, as well as Acts and Statutes, had the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold aſſent, and the King's as well as the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons concurrence, not the aſſent only of one or two of them. Thirdly, that thoſe Acts which are termed Statutes and Laws right neceſſary, in the former clauſe of this Preamble, are called Acts, Ordinances and Statutes in the later. Fourthly, that Ordinances then, were to be obſerved for evermore ſirmly and inviolably of all Subjects, as well high as low; and not meer temporary Lawes expiring with the uery Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that made them, or before; and obliging ſome, but not others, as moſt new Ordinances now do. Which had Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook</hi> obſerved in his <note n="r" place="margin">2 Inſtit. p. 101, 102.</note> 
               <hi>Comentary</hi> on this very Preface and Statute, it is probable he would have retracted his miſtaken difference, between Statutes, Acts and Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hath ſeduced others, as well in point of practice as opinion.</p>
            <p>In 50 E. 3. we have this generall Preamble to the printed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115458:18"/>
Acts of Parliament, and Statutes then made. <hi>By aſſent of the Prelates, Dukes, Earls, Barons, and others aſſembled at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, holden at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>at the fifteenth of Saint</hi> Hillary, <hi>the yeer of the reign of our ſovereign Lord the King, that now is, of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>the fiftieth: the ſame our ſoveraign Lord the King much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the Peace of his Land be well kept, &amp;c. hath for ſo much made and eſtabliſhed certain</hi> ORDINANCES, <hi>&amp;c. which</hi> ORDINANCES <hi>he will that, to the honour of God, and of the Church, and quietneſſe of his people, they be firmly kept and holden in all points.</hi> Theſe Statutes (being eight in number) are onely termed <hi>Ordinances</hi> in this Prologue, though <hi>Statutes</hi> in the Title; and cloſe to, <hi>Thus endeth the Statutes, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I have taken thus much pains (in an untrodden path) to prove Statutes, Acts and Ordinances of Parliament to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways anciently &amp; really one and the ſelf-ſame, made by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the King, Lords and Commons joyntly, not of Lords and Commons alone without the King, or by King &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons without the Lords, not any wayes to invalid or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach any late good and abſolutely neceſſary Ordinances of Parliament, which the exegences of our unhappy diſtracted times have enforced the houſes to paſſe without the King's conſent (being abſent from, and in Arms againſt them) for their own and the <note n="a" place="margin">See my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power of Parliaments and Kingdoms</note> Kingdoms preſervation, or any Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the neceſſary reformation or puniſhment of any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grievances or abuſes, according to Law, or preventing any publike miſchiefs in a regular manner, by way of Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or aſſiſting of the common Law: <hi>Salus populi &amp; Reipub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae,</hi> being <hi>ſuprema Lex,</hi> and extraordinary Remedies to be preſcribed by the Houſes in ſuch extraordinary caſes and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, when ordinary can finde no place at all; but for theſe enſuing reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to refute the commonly received errour of theſe times, and of ſome pretended Grandees of the Law, <hi>That Acts and Ordinances of Parliament in former ages, were distinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, not one and the ſame; and that the royall aſſent was then held onely neceſſary to Acts, but not to Ordinances of Parliament:</hi> for which there is not any one ſingle pregnant convincing preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent extant to my knowledge, in any Parliament Rolls or printed Acts: which errour hath been principally propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sir <hi>Edw.

            <p>Secondly, to abate the exceſſive fees now taken by Officers in both Houſes of Parliament for private Ordinances, as high (or higher) for the moſt part, as the ancient or late Fees for private Acts of Parliament, which had the Royall aſſent; a great grievance and oppreſſion to the Subject, generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, fit to be examined and redreſſed in theſe reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, when private Ordinances and exactions for them are ſo frequent, without any preſident in former Parliaments to warrant ſuch new exceſſive Fees.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to perſwade and induce the Members of both Houſes of Parliament, not to multiply theſe new kind of Parliamentary Ordinances (deſtitute of Royall aſſent, and the peoples generall approbation in full Parliament) to the impeachment or infringement of any ancient Ordinances ſtill in force, the Statutes or common Law of the Realm, the invaſion of the peoples undoubted Liberties, Rights or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, which they have ſo long fought for, and dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chafed with the expence of ſo much treaſure and blood, or to the inveagling of the conſciences of Judges or Lawyers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Oaths and Duties.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to adviſe both Houſes to turn all their former and future neceſſary, uſefull Ordinances into Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to preſſe the King's Royall aſſent to them in their expected approaching perſonall Treaty with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, for the greater indemnity and ſecurity of thoſe who have acted on, or received, or enjoy any monies, lands, offices or emoluments by them, to avoyd all queſtions and ſcruples in ſucceeding Parliaments and Ages.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, to admoniſh Committees of all ſorts, not to rack or ſtrain any new Ordinances wanting the threefold aſſent, (eſpecially ſuch as are penall) beyond their Letter, or true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to the Subjects oppreſſion, who had many times no legall notice of them; an int<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

purpoſes, on whom ſundry Committees and their under-Officers extravagancies in this kind, have drawn much hatred and ſcandall; the ſad effects whereof begin now viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to appear in the late inſurrections and diſtempers of the people in ſundry Counties, and hatred of Committee-men, which will hardly be cordially pacified or allayed, but by the ſpeedy ſuppreſſion of all ſuch arbitrary, lawleſſe Committees and Officers, and calling them to a ſtrict and juſt accompt both for their receipts, disburſments, and malicious, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, injurious actions, to the publike prejudice, and the peoples generall grievance, oppreſſion and diſcontent.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, to induce the Houſes of Parliament to conform all their future new Ordinances, and the execution of them, as neer as poſſible, to the forms and rules of Law; and to be very carefull of ſetting up any ſuch new Ordinances (without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable neceſſity, and generall inconveniences of dangerous ſequell) to repeal, controle, or give checkmate to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall known Lawes and Statutes of the Realm, or ſtop the current of the common Law, and publike juſtice: it being an abuſe, a uſurpation of very dangerous and pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, contrary to many Declarations and Remonſtrances of both Houſes, and the very tenour of the <hi>ſolemn League and Covenant;</hi> wherein they have ſolemnly engaged all three Kingdoms: The bitter fruits of ſuch deſtructive Ordinances we may chance to taſte of, and bewail, when it is too late; ſuch arbitrary and illegall Ordinances wanting pure mettal, as well as the Royall impreſſe, will in concluſion but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, endanger the <hi>Coyners</hi> of them, and be branded, rejected for counterfeit Coyn, when brought unto the <hi>teſt.
