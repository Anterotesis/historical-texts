            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The occasion of the Disputation.</head>
            <p>SIr <hi>William Harington</hi> Knight, hauing a Kinsman
of the Romish Catholike Religion, by much
reasoning with him, and many perswasions had
brought him to wauering, so that he stood in doubt
which was the true religion, and desired to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
The forenamed Priest Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> alias Dr.
<hi>Norrice</hi> for the setling and hardening of him in the
popish religion, told him that the Protestant
Church of <hi>England</hi> vnto which he seemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
had no faith, neither indeed was it any
Church of Christ at all: and also challenged his
kinsman Sir <hi>William Harrington</hi> to bring any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the English Church whatsoeuer into any
conuenient place of meeting, and he would by
disputation, and by inuincible arguments proue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him before their faces, and in their hearing,
<pb facs="tcp:28014:3"/>
that English Protestants had neither Church nor
faith. Sir <hi>William Harrington</hi> did take his offer, vpon
condition that he would answer to such questions
as the Diuine which he would bring should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
against the Romish religion; it was agreed;
the day and place appoynted. Whereupon Sir
<hi>William</hi> requesting a reuerend Doctor of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
to take the charge vpon him; hee being
to preach in his charge vpon a necessary occasion
the very day which was appointed: sent him to
Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> whom he assured him to be a man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for such a purpose, And who at the first motion
vpon a dayes warning embraced the offer, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to come the next day to Sir <hi>William,</hi> and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him to the place of meeting, And Sir <hi>William</hi>
requesting him to name before hand some questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
opposite to the Romish religion which hee
would dispute vpon against the Priests; he gaue
him these three following. 1. <hi>That the present Church
of Rome is the Whore of Babylon.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Pope is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</hi>
3. <hi>That the Popish doctrine of Peters being Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rome is a forged fable contrary to the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These positions Sir <hi>William Harrington</hi> sent to the
Priest, that he might arme himselfe for the defence:
The next day Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> came to Sir <hi>Williams</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to dinner, and accompanied him and Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Harwood,</hi> with some other Gentlemen to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
house by the Thames side, where they found
some Romish Catholike Gentlemen, and they said
<hi>Smith</hi> with other Priests. Before they entred into
disputation, Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> alias <hi>Norrice,</hi> called Master
<hi>Walker</hi> a side, and desired that the disputation might
<pb facs="tcp:28014:3"/>
be performed louingly and sweetly with all milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and without bitter words or byting speeches.
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> answered, that he desired to byte and
gall no aduersary but with sound reasons, which do
most commonly cut to the quicke, such as defend
errors: as for other speeches, he promised for his
part to be milde or sharpe, according to the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of his Aduersaries. And thus they proceed
to a formall manner of disputation, the one sitting
downe at the one end of a Table, the other at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end, and the auditors sitting along on both
sides, and some standing about in a large vpper Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
But first Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> desired a Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto which
they might appeale, and by which testimonies of
Scriptures; which both parties alleaged might bee
tried; whereupon there were two Bibles brought,
and agreed vpon; the one a vulgar Latine, which
the Counsell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the whole Romish
Church holds to be most authenticall; the other
an English Bible, for the standers by to looke vpon.
Then Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> alias <hi>Norrice,</hi> begins first with an
apologie for himselfe, telling the gentlemen that
he had of late by reason of some bodily infirmity,
beene forced to take Phisicke, and to vse a dyet
drinke, and therefore if his memory should faile, or
if paine in his head should force him to breake off
abruptly, desired them to beare with him, and to
haue him excused; By which he seemed wisely to
prouide before hand for a lesse shamefull flight, if
he found the fight too hot and sharpe for him to be
endured. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> on the other side desired, that
they might goe to it hand to hand, and but one
<pb facs="tcp:28014:4"/>
speake at once for auoiding of confusion; that the
disputation might be in short syllogismes: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
also that the Arguments &amp; the answers might
be writ downe, for preuenting all false relation and
misreports afterward, and withall, did put it to the
Aduersaries choyce, whether he would oppose or
answer first? Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> desired, that hee might first
dispute vpon his owne questions, and promised that
afterwards he would answer Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> disputing
vpon his questions: It was agreed vpon; And
thereupon he putting off his hat, and crossing his
face and breast, began to speake to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith, <hi>alias</hi> Norrice.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I haue here receiued three questions from you,
which you haue taken vpon you to proue by Argument, I
haue here written downe, and will relate them vnto you:
First you say you will proue the Pope to be <hi>Antichrist:
2. The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be the whore of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:
3. <hi>That</hi> St. Peter <hi>was not Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>as we
hold;</hi> These questions are such as are not fit to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
much lesse to be disputed or answered; they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
in tearmes very vnseemely and vnmannerly: for
what can be more vnfit or vnseemly then this, <hi>that you
should call the holy Father the Pope Antichrist, and
the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>the whore of</hi> Babylon <hi>now in
these dayes,</hi> when it pleaseth the Kings Maiestie to giue
the Pope that honour, as to send and sue to his holinesse
for a dispensation for the marriage of thr Prince his
sonne: I pray you therefore let vs haue no more of these
questions, but let vs haue some other, or else propound
them in other tearmes, as <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is
<pb facs="tcp:28014:4"/>
not the true Church or the like:</hi> As you see I haue
done, in that I haue vsed milder words in my questions:
holding that you protestants in England, <hi>haue no
Church nor faith.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing it is your pleasure thus to speake at large
in loose speech, and not in strict Syllogisme, I will
answer you in your kinde. First, I maruell that you
are not ashamed to slaunder the Kings Maiestie with
honouring of the Pope, by suing to him for dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
which we all know he will neuer doe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath not onely said, that he is Antichrist,
but also publikely in his learned writings proued
him so to be, and the <hi>Romish Church to be the whore of
Babylon.</hi> I warrant you our King will marry his Son
and aske the Pope no leaue, if the other party will
aduenture it as well as he. It is most intollerable,
that you should so boldly slaunder his Maiestie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the tearmes of my questions, which
you call vnmannerly, they are the same which it
pleaseth Gods spirit to vse in the holy Scriptures;
and his holinesse hath in his wisedome been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to stile the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the
same titles, as I shall quickly proue, if you will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to answer me. And therefore you are too
bold to taxe Gods spirit of vnmannerlinesse: But
perhaps this is a shift of yours, to put off our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
vpon these poynts which pay you home,
with a cleanely excuse of vnmannerly tearmes: yet
it shall not serue your turne; for the more vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the questions are, the more disgrace it will
be to me, and the more hard taske to proue them:
<pb facs="tcp:28014:5"/>
and to you it will be more credit and ease to defend
the contrary, so that this is no excuse for you at all.
Thirdly, in that you doe charge vs here at home so
manifestly contrary to common sense, that we haue
neither Church nor Faith, when as we beleeue and
professe all holy truthes taught in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which by your selues cannot be denyed to be
Gods infallible word. But I pray you let vs leaue
all loose and idle discourses, and come to a strict
forme of Disputation, writing downe the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and answers which doe passe betweene vs.
Your taske which you haue vndertaken is to proue,
that we haue no Church nor Faith: let vs heare
your arguments briefly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>Well, that we may come quickly and closely come home
to the matter, let me aske you a question, and doe you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me, that I may ground my Arguments vpon your
owne words, and I shall quickly proue against you my
assertion, and make the truth of it plainely appeare.
First I aske whether the true Catholike Church be visible?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Walker.</speaker>
               <p>The true Catholike Church is not visible, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it be seene with eyes of any mortall man
on earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>Marke Gentlemen, he will deny this Canon: he saith
the Catholike Church is not visible, which I will proue
to be against all reason.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Walker.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed if I should say that it were visible, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb facs="tcp:28014:5"/>
it as it now is, I should speake against all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
For the greatest part of it being Saints in
heauen are without the reach of mans eyes, and
cannot be seene.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>You doe but equiuocate of purpose to decline all Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
you know that I meane, not the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
in heauen, but the Catholike Church militant on
earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, rather doe you equiuocate or worse; for
to say that the Catholike Church is militant on
earth is as absurd, as to say that all mankinde, euen
the whole vniuersall race of <hi>Adam</hi> are now liuing
on earth, when reason and experience teach vs, that
the greatest part are dead, and many also yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne:
I hope you know that the word Catholike,
signifies vniuersall: and therefore the Catholike
Church is vniuersall company of the Elect and
faithfull, and includes in it euery one whosoeuer

               <p>I iudge of your meaning by your words, and
therefore I cannot conceiue this Church which
you doe speake of, to be the Catholike, that is the
vniuersall Church: for euery true particular
Church, in which euery true Christian doth loue,
and whereof he is a member, is that which he ought
to heare and to obey, because by reason of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and elect which are in it, it is the house of God,
and the pillar and firmament of truth. Now euery
such Church is partly visible, and partly inuisible.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Walker.</speaker>
               <p>Euery such true Church hath in it elect and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men, professing outwardly in word, and practise
true Christian religion, who doe belong to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church, and are true liuely members of
Christ: It hath also some hypocrites and carnall
professors, which doe also make an outward show
and profession of christianity, but are not truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
into Christ, by vnion and communion of
the Spirit, neither haue the true holy sauing Faith,
and by consequent are not members of the true
Catholike Church. Now the men who professe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the Church, and are the members of it, if
we consider them as they are men, and as they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
and performe outward duties of christians, as
preaching and hearing of the word, administring
and receiuing the Sacraments publike outward
worship and such like, they are visible: But as for
the election faith, spirituall, and in word graces and
<pb facs="tcp:28014:6"/>
deuotion in the one sort, by which they are indeed
true christians, &amp; belong to the Catholike Church:
and the hipocrisie and carnall corruption lurking
inwardly in the other sort, by meanes whereof, they
are seperated from communion with Christ in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
they are things inuisible, and to be discerned spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
not with bodily eyes. Thus euery true
Church is partly inuisible, to wit, in respect of the
spirituall graces, which make men true Christians
indeed; and partly visible, to wit, in respect of the
outward profession, common both to elect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
to faithfull men and hypocrites.</p>

to the standers by, that Doctor <hi>Whitakers,</hi> Doctor
<hi>Reignolds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and many other chiefe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
did euer grant, that the true Catholike Church was
visible. Another Priest sitting by, scornefully repeated

               <p>Mr <hi>Walker</hi> moued with the falshood of the one,

that none could count Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> silly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
but either out of ignorance or wilfull mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice:
and that he knew it to be the fashion of popish
Priests, outwardly to sleight &amp; vilifie before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
such as do most cut and gall them. To Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:28014:7"/>
he answered, that if he would grant that Protestants
haue a true Church, and the true faith, as truely as
that which he affirmed of Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> and the
rest was false, he would desire no more for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:

had said was true, and the more to perswade the standers
by, he added more specially, that Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> doth
in his writings maintaine, that the whole essence of the

               <p>Because I will not spend time in contesting with

let vs send for Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> workes, and if I doe
not shew that he doth proue against <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that
the Catholike Church is inuisible, and that this is a
maine point largely disputed by him, and a maine
controuersie betweene him and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> let mee
be branded with the marke of a wilfull lyer, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
and false prophet. But if I shew it presently
before them all out of his owne writings, then shall
you confesse your selfe a forger and falsifier, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor,
and a priest of <hi>Baal;</hi> The Gentlemen all
confessed that this was faire play, and desired it
might bee so. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> began to
draw backe, and shewed himselfe vnwilling, and
much affraid to hazard his credit so quickly, and
would gladly haue left this point, and fallen into
another, But Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> proceeded on this wise and
said: Gentlemen it is true, that Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi>
maintaines, that the Word truly preached, and the
<pb facs="tcp:28014:8"/>
Sacraments rightly administred, are the certaine
and infallible notes and markes, by which euery true
particular Church may be discerned to bee Christs
true church: and you know that the markes of a
thing differ from the essence and substance of it: as
the signe hanging at the dore of a Tauerne, and
shewing that house to be a Tauerne, differs from the
Tauerne it selfe: and the habit and Cowle of a
Monke or Frier, which is the marke of his order,
differs from the Monke himselfe, and is not any
part of his essence. I beseech you therefore take
notice of the boldnesse and impudency of popish
Priests, how they can snatch here and there a speech
out of our learned mens writings, without any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of it, and thereby make show, as if they
had throughly read those Authors; yea, and can in
common talke, and in titles of their printed pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
professe, that they haue confuted <hi>Whitakers,
Reignolds, Field, Perkins,</hi> and many others, whose
bookes they neuer durst reade throughly, neither
haue the hardinesse to sift any of their maine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
I assure you, that as you see this which I say
here verefied, so I finde it a common thing among
them all.</p>

vnwilling to insist any longer vpon this point, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
answered nothing; but presently proceeded to another
question, and asked <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>Whether the whole
militant Church on earth may erre?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>I answer, that this question is captious and
<pb facs="tcp:28014:8"/>
ambiguous, and cannot directly in one word nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
or affirmatiue bee answered: my reasons are
these; First, because the whole militant Church, if
such a Church may be acknowledged, is nothing
but the whole number of particular Churches mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
on earth; and in diuers points they doe differ
among themselues: and it is impossible for any
man to finde out the iudgement of them all in euery
point, as it is impossible to gather them all at once
into one place. Secondly, it may bee said both that
it may erre, and also that it cannot erre in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
and considerations, if wee consider it by it
selfe alone, as it is militant, and according to the
militancy and weaknesse of it (as I may so speake)
we grant that it may erre, and in euery particular
part of it, there may bee found some errors: but if
we consider it according vnto the relation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
which it hath vpon the Triumphant
Church, and the assistance which it hath from
Christ, his Prophets and Apostles, vpon whose
doctrine and Scriptures it doth wholly cast it selfe,
and builds all the doctrines of faith,, so it cannot
erre, for in so doing it doth follow infallible guides:
euen as the Apostle saith of a man regenerate and
borne of God, that he cannot sinne, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. to wit,
in the maine, against the maine precepts of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<hi>Beleeue</hi> and <hi>Repent,</hi> for he cannot fall into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency
and infidelity, because the seede of God,
euen his holy Spirit abides in him: But that he hath
sinne, and doth lie if he saith he hath none, to wit,
through infirmity and weakenesse of the flesh: So
likewise it is truely said of the true Church, and
<pb facs="tcp:28014:9"/>
euery part thereof, that as it builds onely on the
Scriptures, and doth vrge no doctrine of faith of
necessity to be beleeued, but such as the Scriptures
teach: So it cannot erre no more then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for this is a work of infallible faith. But because
all men liuing in the Church; haue as infirmities of
life, so imperfections in iudgement, and some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersnesse
in affections, and therefore may faile in
conceiuing some doubtfull and obscure places of
Scripture amisse, or in cleauing not so close to the
word as they ought, or following their owne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to much, as we see in all the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and in the most part of the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
in this respect we truly say, that the Church
militant may erre.</p>

to the former diuers respects and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>

               <p>Whether is the Church of <hi>England</hi> so tyed to the word
of God, and such helps, that it cannot erre nor misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Scriptures in fundamentall points of Faith?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>I answer, that as in all other particular Churches
<pb facs="tcp:28014:9"/>
so in the particular Churches of <hi>England,</hi> there is a
double voice, one of the Church, as shee is the true
Church of Christ, and that is both her voice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the Scriptures, onely to bee beleeued as
necessary for sauing knowledge and true faith, and
also the voice of GOD plainely speaking in the
Scriptures, in this respect she is so tyed that shee
cannot erre. There is another voice which the
Church vttereth not immediately from her selfe, by
the Commission which Christ gaue vnto her; but
by her fraile members, suppose a Synode and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Pastors taking vpon them to determine
things doubtfull out of obscure places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to make them more plaine then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
doe vpon which they build; This voyce may
erre, and by it the Church may be said after a sort to
erre in some part, though not wholly, nor finally,
nor obstinately: because if it bee a true Church, it
will not absolutely and peremptorily determine
that which the Scriptures leaue doubtfull: neither
will it persist alwayes in the errors if they be deadly,
but either the whole number, or at least some in the
number of the Church will renounce it; and so the
whole shall not erre finally. This is my answer; But
because I would giue you some ground whereon to
fasten, that we may not spend time in questions, but
may come to disputation, which is the intent of our
meeting; I will grant you thus much, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> may erre for a time, and after
some manner in a point fundamentall or necessary
to saluation. Ground what you can vpon this,
and let vs haue some disputation by way of
<pb facs="tcp:28014:10"/>
strict Arguments and Syllogismes.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith</speaker>
               <p>I haue enough out of your owne confession to proue
that you haue neither Church nor Faith. And I pray you
Gentlemen to marke and take notice, he grants that the
Protestant Church of <hi>England</hi> may erre in a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point, if in one, then as well in another, and so
from one to another till it erre in all, and so haue no faith
at all, and hauing no faith it is no Church. Thus you see I
haue proued that Protestants haue neither church nor
Faith: and therefore I beseech you all take heede of them,
who by their owne confession haue forsaken the Catholicke
Church and faith, and doe wilfull runne into all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
errors and heresies, and lead men into destrustion.
You see how plainely they are conuinced; and I appeale
to you all, Iudge whether I haue not plainely proued that
which I did vnder take, to wit, that they haue neither
Church nor Faith, and so are in a most damnable estate.</p>

action of the hands and whole body, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>
standing vp, and putting of his Hat made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:
First (saith hee) though it was your motion, and
my desire that I might talke mildly without bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
words: yet seeing hee first breakes out so
vnreasonably, and goe about by bitter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
words and gestures to beare downe the
truth: I must craue leaue of these Gentlemen to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
you in your kinde, though it be very vnseemly
that in my manner of answer, you may behold the
vnseemlynesse of your disputing: and then with
like words, voice, and gestures, he answered to this
<pb facs="tcp:28014:10"/>
effect: First, where as you say that you haue proued,
that which you did vndertake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you shew your selfe
without wit or reason: for you are not able to bring
one word of reason by way of argument, till I doe
lay you a ground, as all here doe see; and therefore
if you seeme to proue any thing, you must thanke
me for it, who doe yeeld more then you can proue:
Secondly, your argument is without all forme, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or reason; for it doth not follow, that euery
Church which may erre in one point, may erre in all
points at once, and fall wholly away, because God
hath promised, that the gates of Hell shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
against his Church so farre as to put it quite
from the foundation, though it may Build stubble
and straw vpon the foundation, by erring in some
points for a time. Thirdly, though it bee not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the true Church to erre yea though it
were granted that it might wholly fall away from all
faith: yet it doth not there vpon follow that it doth
so, and that now presently it hath no faith, neither
is a Church at all: Thus Gentlemen you see how I
haue proued this man by his owne speech to bee
without wit, reason modesty or honesty, roauing
without wit or reason, railing without modesty, and
falsly charging vs against all shew of honesty: But
I feare me that this kind of Frier-like preaching, is
odious and distastfull to all iudicious beholders: I
pray you let vs dispute orderly, and according to
art: And if you be able to dispute Scholler-like, let vs
haue one argument framed into a short Syllogisme.</p>

               <p>I distinguish vpon the Maior proposition: For if
you meane the word truly preached, and infallibly
deliuered in euery particular point, so that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
erre any manner of way in any such point. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the <hi>Maior</hi> vpon example and warrant from the
Apostles: and doe hold that a true Church may for
a time haue the word not truly deliuered, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
in some point, and yet be a true Church: But if
you vnderstand a totall erring in all points, and a
preaching of the whole word vntruly: then is your
<hi>Minor</hi> most false, for Protestant Churches doe not
preach the whole word vntruly at any time. Now
proue you which of your propositions you please:
For in these senses which I haue named both are
false.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is so manifest that it needs no proofe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can be denyed, for how is it possible for any Church to
be a true Church which hath not the word truly preached

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>I proue it thus. That Church which hath not the word
of God truly preached, but falsely translated, is no true
Church. Such is the Church of England. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>But the thing which you were to proue, was that
the Church which hath not Gods word truly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and infallibly deliuered in euery point at all
times, is not a true Church. This because you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell how to proue as you did vndertake, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you flee to another new Argument, to which
also I doe answer, as I did to the former: First, that
the <hi>Maior</hi> proposition is false: For a Church which
hath the word of God falsely or erroneously trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in some parts, and so not truely preached in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
part, may be a true Church. Secondly, if you
meane falsely translated, and not truely preached of
purpose and wilfully, then the <hi>Minor</hi> is false, for
though the translation of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
may faile and misse of the true meaning of diuers
places, (as all the best translations, especially the
<pb facs="tcp:28014:12"/>
vulgar Latine approued by the Romish Church
doth,) yet it is not so erroneously translated of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
neither doe all the Preachers thereof build,
certainly on such erronious and false translations,
but many doe discerne them, and preach and teach
the true oppositions; and the Church alloweth
them so to doe, when they shew good reasons for
their doings, from the circumstances of the Text.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>But I will shew plainly by diuers Examples, that you
haue diuers places of Scripture falsly translated in your
translation of set purpose, and wilfully contrary to the
words of the Hebrew Text, contrary also to the Greeke and
Latine, receiued in all ages and Churches heertofore.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You threaten largely in wordes which are but
winde; but indeede you can neuer performe that
which you say. Let vs see if you bee able to shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of our translation, wherein one word is
falsely translated of purpose: I desire no more but
to ioyne a Combat with you hand to hand about the
Hebrew text, and about the truth of our translation,
and the agreement of it with the Originall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>I shall quickly proue what I say, and what you require.
First, I haue a plaine example, <hi>Malachi</hi> 2. 7. where your
translators read the words thus, <hi>The Priests lippes
should keepe knowledge, and they should seeke the
Law at his mouth.</hi> First this translation is false, because
it is contrary to the Hebrew text, wherein the words are
Iishmeru <hi>they shall keepe, and</hi> Iebakshu <hi>they shall seek:</hi>
and not, <hi>they should keepe,</hi> nor, <hi>they should seeke.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:28014:12"/>
Also it is contrary to the Greeke, wherein the words are,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to the Latine translation of
St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> which is <hi>Custodient,</hi> and <hi>requirent.</hi>
Secondly, it teacheth heresie and false doctrine, namely;
that Gods Priests, &amp; they who sit in <hi>Moses</hi> Chayre, may
erre, contrary to the words of Christ who commands his
Disciples to heare all such as sit in <hi>Moses</hi> Chayre, because
they shall not erre, but their lips shall preserue knowledge.
Thirdly, it is thus corrupted of purpose, to gainsay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Pastors of the Church, who doe succeed
in the Chayre of the Apostles, and to blinde the peoples
eyes, that they may not see the certainty and infallibility
of iudgement in the Priests and Pastors who sit in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
Chaire, &amp; how they are bound to seek the Law at their
mouth: but may follow any vpstart teachers which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the Catholicke Church. Thus you see Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
all, how plainely I haue proued that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> hath of purpose corrupted the Scriptures, and
therefore is no true Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Indeed if that which you say were true, you did
speake something to the purpose; but great words
and protestations cannot make truth to be falshood,
nor falshood truth, as for the Example which you
cite out of our English translation. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. I deny
it to be contrary to the Hebrew text: yea I will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
proue both from the Hebrew words, which you
haue here shewed in the Hebrew Interlinear Bible,
and also from the whole scope, and all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the place, that the English is the best transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; more perfect then either the Greek or Latine.
First, though the Hebrew words <hi>Iishmeru</hi> &amp; <hi>Iebakshu</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:28014:13"/>
be of the Futuretense, yet this doth not proue: that
they should be translated so in our tongue, because
you cannot but know, if you haue any skill in the
Hebrew tongue, that the future tense in Hebrewe,
sometime simply, and sometime by meanes of <hi>Vau
conuersiue</hi> signifies time, either perfectly or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
past; somtimes it stands for the Optatiue,
Potentiall, and Subiunctiue moode; therefore our
translation is not differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor irregular from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe,
which is the originall. Secondly, it was neuer
the purpose of Gods spirit in that place, or by these
words to teach, that the Lawe should alwayes bee
taught truly and infallibly by the Priests and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
who succeede <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Apostles locally in
the Church by a continued succession: for that is a
falshood contrary to the experience of all ages: this
very place confutes it most euidently; For the
Priests vnto whome the Prophet here speaks in these
places were Leuites, and succeeded <hi>Aaron</hi> in the
Priesthood: and yet they were departed out of the
way <hi>they caused many to fall in the law by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
glosse, and their abuse of the Couenant of Leui.</hi> As
it appeares in the next words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
yea some of them had sacrificed to <hi>Idolls,</hi> as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
shewes in his History of those times, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord threatens to corrupt their seed by
cutting off the male progeny, and <hi>to cast the dung of
their Sacrifice in their faces:</hi> so that the Priesthood
of <hi>Phineas</hi> should by a sister married into the Tribe
of <hi>Iudath</hi> to one of <hi>Dauids</hi> line fall to Christ, who
desended of her, and hee should take it away to
himselfe for euer as is intimated in the 3. verse of the
<pb facs="tcp:28014:13"/>
same Chapter. So then it is no heresie but Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
truth, that Priests succeeding in the place and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> may erre and haue erred:
<hi>Moset</hi> his Chaire in which the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
did sit, was the seat wherein they were wont to
read the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the expositions of
the Prophets to the people, and therfore what they
there did teach was true, and Christ commanded
his Disciples to obey it: But in their owne glosses
and traditions they erred damnably, &amp; made void
Gods Law,<note place="margin">Math. 13. 4. 16. 12.</note> and their Doctrine our Sauiour called
soure leauen, and warned his Disciples to beware of
it. Thirdly, they who translate the words thus:
<hi>The Priests lippes shall keepe knowledge, and they shall
seeke the Law at his mouch:</hi> Did neuer intend to shew
thereby, that God did make here a promise, that so
it shall bee for euer, but onely to shew that this is
the Law and Commandement of God, teaching
what the Priests and People should doe and ought
to doe, euen as in the Commaudement, <hi>Thou shalt
haue no other Gods but me.</hi> The words doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that <hi>the Israelites should alwaies acknowledge and
worship Iehouah the true God alone,</hi> (for the euent
shewed the contrary within 40. payes) but shew
what they ought to doe; but the words are a coms
mandement recited, not a promise made, the word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the 4. verse shew. Therefore our English trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is most perfect of all, shewing not onely the
sense and meaning of the Law, but also how it did
binde the Priest and People, and how they ought
to obey it. Thus you see how your example doth
make for vs against your selfe.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> finding worse successe then hee expected
in this example, and perceiuing the standers by to be well
satisfied with this answer, flees presently to another, to
wit, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. where in our English Translation the
words run thus. <hi>Breake off thy sins by righteousnes,
&amp; thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poore:</hi>
Here saith he, the word in the Chaldee, which is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,
<hi>Perok,</hi> signifies to <hi>Redeeme,</hi> and so the Greeke
and Latine Translations render it; but your Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of purpose, contrary to all the ancient receiued Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators,
and to the nature of the word in the originall, do
translate it, <hi>Breake off,</hi> and that of purpose to oppose
the true doctrine of satisfaction &amp; merit by good works.
Therefore your Church is a false Church.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Howsoeuer other translations run, I am sure our
English is in sense most sound &amp; Orthodoxe. That
translation which counsels <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
his sins by righteousnesse, is (as the words
doerun) senslesse and against all reason; For God
neuer appointed that mens sinnes should bee redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
but his will is, that they should bee mortified
and destroyed, and he so hates them, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
leaue them vnpunished, but will haue iust ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
to be executed for them, eithervpon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
himselfe, or on his surety. If you vnderstand
the words (as you seeme to vrge them) that <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi>
a wicked Heathen King, should by his
own righteousnesse redeeme himselfe from his sins;
you doe make <hi>Daniel</hi> a teacher of heresie and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie:
for it is no lesse then blasphemy, to hold
<pb facs="tcp:28014:14"/>
that an Idolatrous Pagan may by his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
redeeme himselfe: it makes void the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Christ the Redeemer. But our English
translation doth teach excellent truth; to wit, that
a true conuert ought not only to beleeue in Christ,
and by faith to put on the Robe of Righteousnesse,
that therin he may appeare righteous before God,
and comely in his sight; but also to breake off his
sinfull course of life, and neuer to goe on any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in any knowne sinne, as Papists doe, in hope of
absolution by confession and pennance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I doubt not, but the word in the originall will
be more agreeable to our translation, when wee
come to see and examine it, if you be pleased to let
me see your Hebrew Bible.</p>

               <p>Yea, it signifies all kinde of breaking, euen brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
asunder, breaking a pieces, and breaking off;
for indeed it is an Hebrew word, and the Caldee
<pb facs="tcp:28014:15"/>
borrowes it form the Hebrew, the first and most
proper signification of it, is to breake asunder, or to
breake off: and it doth signifie to Redeeme only in
a trope by a Metominie of the cause for the effect,
for men are redeemed out of bondage, by hauing
their yoke of bondage broken off from their necke,
and their chaines and fetters broken in sunder, and
that that breaking is the meanes of their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
That it signifies properly to breake off, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
by the common vse of it in the Scriptures,
as <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 40. where <hi>Isaac</hi> saith to <hi>Esau. Thou shalt

in many things, and that it was written of old with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pricks, vntill the Iewish Massorites did inuent pricks
and vowels, by which we doe reade it, diuers hundreds

               <p>Now (saith Mr. <hi>Walker)</hi> you shew you selse
what you are in your owne colours, euen one who
esteemes no authority or testimony either of God
or man, further then they serue your owne turne:
while you immagined that the Hebrew Text was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our translation, you did vrge it with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie,
as the authority and testimony of God.
Now when it failes you and contrary to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
doth make for vs: you vilifie it and reiect
it, as a thing corrupted by the Iewes, and formed
according to the minde and pleasure of the Iewish
Massorites: wherein you shew not onely vanity of
mind and inconstancie: but also malice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
ioined with wilfull ignorance. For how soeuer
<hi>Elias Leuita</hi> a turnecoate Iew of later times, may
seeme to affirme such a thing (perhaps to please his
Patron <hi>Aegidius)</hi> that the Vowels were inuented
by the Massorites of <hi>Tiberias:</hi> yet it is the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the best learned, both Iewish Rabbins
and Christians, that the pricks, vowels and accents,
were from the beginning. And the Massorites were
Iewes gathered both out of the East and West of
purpose, to compare their most auncient and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Manuscrips together, and when they found
them all to agree in Letters and points, they made
their Massorah, and noted how many times such a
word was written with such pricks in the Scripture;
how many verses, words, yet letters were in the
Law, and which was the middle verse, word and
letter, so that by their Massorah, if it hab beene kept
<pb facs="tcp:28014:16"/>
perfect, a man might finde out, if there were but
one word, letter, or prick altered or taken away out
of all the old Testament. All the differences which
were found between the Bibles of the Easterne and
Westerne Iewes, are recorded and kept to this day,
the one set down vnder the names of the Sonnes of
<hi>Ashur,</hi> the other vnder the names of the Sonnes of
<hi>Nephtali,</hi> and they are such as do not alter the sense
at all, as may bee seene in all our great Rabbinicall
Bibles; The end therefore of the Massarites mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and of their worke, was not to inuent vowels
and prickes, but onely to note how they did finde
the Scriptures pricked and vowelled from the daies
of old, and to set downe rules from the knowledge
thereof, and for the preseruing them without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or corruption to all posterities: Thus much I
haue learned out of the Rabbins, though my skill
bee but small in their Language, and though I haue
had no time to spend in the study of them, but such
as I haue stollen from my other necessary studies of
Diuinity, which properly concerne my Calling.
And if you know not this to be true, I am sure you
are but a weak Hebrutian, and slenderly read in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew

you, and if you can finde any of them to be of that
opinion, I will yeeld vnto you in this point. Nay,
more then that, I will shew out of the Scriptures
written by <hi>Moses,</hi> that the originall Scriptures of
<hi>Moses</hi> his Law, which were kept in the Tabernacle
by the Priests, were written, not single without
pricks as common coppies were, but double, both
with letters and pricks, so that none could doubt of
the right reading of them.</p>

that there was a booke of the Law appointed
to be kept before the Priests &amp; Leuites in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary;
out of which, the King was commanded to
write him a double written Copie of the Law, that
is a copie written both with letters and pricks, and
so most easie to be read and vnderstood; for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word there vsed is <hi>Mishneth,</hi> which signifies
Double, and so you see here in your interliniall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> being confounded with this proofe could
answer nothing, &amp; therfore another Priest who did sit by
to assist him, answered for him, that the Hebrew word
<hi>Mishneth</hi> doth not signifie the originall Scriptures, but
<pb facs="tcp:28014:17"/>
the exposition of the Rabbins vpon the text of Scripture.</p>

               <p>It is true that the Rabbins call their Expositions
somtimes by this name, as for example <hi>Rabbi Moses,
Maymonides</hi> call his Summe of the <hi>Talmid, Mishueth
Torah:</hi> But you must know that in <hi>Moses</hi> his dayes,
when he wrote this Booke of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> there
were no Rabbinical Commentaries, nor for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares after; only the Law it selfe was kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Priests, and the King was commanded to
write it onely into a Booke; There <hi>Mishueth</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
here signifie any thing but the Text of the Law
written in double forme, which double forme of
writing was easie to bee read and vnderstood, and
was an exposition in respect of the single writing
without prickes. Whereupon this word <hi>Mishueth</hi>
came to signifie an Exposition or Commentary
which doth largely expresse the meaning of the
Law, which is more short and obscure: and the
Iewes do call by this name the Book of <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
because it is an Exposition of the Lawes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
more obscurely in the other bookes: And their
Expositions of the Law set down in their <hi>Talmud:</hi>
they also call <hi>Mishueth</hi> and <hi>Mishuai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The word <hi>Mishueth</hi> doth not signifie properly the
Scripture, but the doubled Law: for the Scripture is
called <hi>Mickra</hi> in the Hebrew tongue.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>The Law is the first Scripture which was written,
and therefore the word <hi>Mishuith</hi> by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
signisying the Law doubled, is written in
<pb facs="tcp:28014:17"/>
double forme, signifies the Scripture written both
with letters and pricks, and so you contradict your
selfe in your speech: Whereas you alledge another
name, by which the Hebrewes call the Scripture, to
wit, <hi>Mickra,</hi> and from them would inferre, that the
Scripture is neuer called <hi>Mishueth</hi> by them: I answer,
that your reason is ridiculous, for one name of the
Scripture doth not take away the rest, but it hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
names in all languages: we in English call it the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and the Bible, and the Booke of God, and
Gods word: So in Hebrew the Scripture is called
by diuers names; sometimes <hi>Torah,</hi> that is, the Law,
because it is the rule of Life; sometimes <hi>Chethab,
The Scripture or writing,</hi> because it is written. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Mickra,</hi> because it is read of all Gods people.
And as it is written full and plaine in letters and
pricks, it is called <hi>Mishueh.</hi> The Priest hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to reply to this answer, but holding his peace.
Some of the Gentlemen desired, that these disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about the Hebrew text, which they could not
vnderstand might cease, and that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> would
dispute in plaine English by way of Syllogismes;
To which motion both parties agreed. And so Mr.
<hi>Smith</hi> proceeded to another Argument, which was
written downe first, and then answered.</p>

Syllogisme, because it hath foure tearmes. For the

it is no true Church. Thirdly, the proposition is
false, for actuall erring in one point, doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

That Church which may erre for a time in a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall

in a fundamentall point, doth depriue a Church of
the whole infallible faith. Thus you bring in againe
as your <hi>minor,</hi> though it hath before beene denyed:
and therefore I will still put you to proue it. But I
pray you let your assistant write downe your Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes,

               <p>I am sure I shall quickly bring my Argument into
forme, if you stand so strictly on artificiall Syllogismes:
Hauing thus sayd, he arose from the table, as if hee would
breath himselfe; and after much scratching of his head,
and other gestures, he turnes to the Priest his assistant and
bids him write: and did dictate vnto him another false
Syllogisme of some tearmes: which <hi>Mr. Walker</hi> reiected
and derided; And after that another, which was so reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
And after that a third, and so on till he had spent a
side of a leafe in <hi>folio</hi> in writing downe fallacies, and a
large halfe houre and more of time.</p>
               <p>So that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> began to intreat him that he
would giue him leaue to make his Syllogisme for
him, for he perceiued what he intended</p>
               <p>Whereat Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> chafed, and sayd to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
he confounds me, or else I could haue long agoe
brought it into a Syllogisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:28014:19"/>
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> answered: you doe me wrong to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to mee the honour which belongs to God
and his truth, for they confound you and not I.</p>
               <p>Then one of the Roman Catholikes began to sweare by
God, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> did make a true Syllogisme, which
<hi>Mr. Walker</hi> had without cause reiected.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>VValker</hi> desired him to repeat it, and to shew
it to be regular, according to moode and figure.</p>
               <p>The Roman Catholike swore againe divers great
oathes, and sayd that he would take the Sacrament vpon
it, and renounce his salvation if hee did not heare <hi>Mr.
Smith</hi> make a true Syllogisme, and that one of them
which <hi>Mr. Walker</hi> reiected was it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>VValker</hi> answered, that oathes could not proue
false Syllogismes to be true, neither could the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
turne a fallacy into a sound Argument. And
told him that if he were so prodigall of his saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he might sooner lose his soule, then make a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme
out of Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> confused speeches and
fallacies. At length after much adoe Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered

               <p>Now sir I thanke you, that you haue bestowed a
Syllogisme vpon me, to proue the proposition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
But I must tell you, that your <hi>maior</hi> proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is false. For a Church may be so far subiect to
error, that it may haue a possibility to erre, and yet
not be voide of the whole infallible faith: It is one
thing to be subiect to error, and another thing to
erre actually: we hold that our Church or any other
particular Protestant Church may erre; but doe not
thinke that our Church doth erre in any fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

               <p>You doe but cavill; for if it may erre, it is as bad as if
it did erre, and therefore I haue sufficiently convinced
you by my argument.</p>

               <p>I hope you doe not speake as you thinke, nor
thinke as you speake: For you know that by our
Law euery Seminary Priest is subiect to hanging
and quartering, and there is no impossibility of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
the Law vpon them; And yet you hope
that all or the most part of them in <hi>England</hi> shall not
be actually executed; and you know that they are
not all in the same case, as if they were hanging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually:
For an Argument doth not follow a <hi>posse ad
esse,</hi> as we Schollers speake. But now seeing your
argument is hanged vp, and wee haue spent foure
houres and more in hearing you dispute to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
I pray you let mee prosecute one of my

questions against you for the time which remaineth,
and I hope to make more Syllogismes in an houre,
then you haue done in foure, if you will answer me
directly.</p>
               <p>Here some of the Roman Catholikes said that it
was full sixe a clocke, and now there was little time
left. But some of the Protestants desired to heare
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> dispute vpon his questions. Which when

and the Gentleman who began to distrust his
former professed Popery comming to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi>
and standing at his backe desired him to presse one
Argument against Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> question. Whereupon
Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> thus began to proue, <hi>That a true Christian

               <p>It is now a point of faith, but it was not then, because
the Scriptures had not expressely revealed, that Christ
should rise from death.</p>

               <p>That which Christ had expresly taught by word
of mouth, was thereby made a point of Faith, and
they were bound to beleeue. But he had told them,
that he must suffer and rise againe the third day:
and that in plaine words, as the Gospell testifies,
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here some of the Gentlemen said, that the point
was sufficiently proued.</p>

                  <hi>It is testified</hi> Ioh. 20. 9. That they knew not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that he must rise from the dead. <hi>Loe thus it is testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

               <p>I say still, that the Scriptures had not reuealed it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,

               <p>The text shewes that the Scripture had reuealed,
for else how could it truely say, that they knew not
the Scripture; if the Scripture had not taught it?
It is no ignorance of Scripture, not to know what
the Scripture neuer taught.</p>

               <p>O well sayd, I protest I neuer heard any point so plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proued; and then turning himselfe to the wauering
Gentleman said: Now cousen, if euer thou wilt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,
be conuerted with these proofes.</p>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>But yet I will proue it more fully, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 44. 45.
Our Sauiour there saith, that he had told them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that he must die and rise againe, and that it was
written in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and in the Prophets,
and in the Psalmes, and it is said there, that he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their vnderstanding, that they might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Scriptures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Smith.</speaker>
               <p>This was an error of ignorance or forgetfulnesse, for
want of instruction and exercise in the Word, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Churches haue more aboundantly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>You cauill against common sense, for I dispute
<pb facs="tcp:28014:22"/>
not whence this error proceeded, but whether they
erred in that maine point of the resurrection or not;
and that you cannot deny, so that the point is fully
proued which I vndertooke. Againe, I can shew
you yet further, that Christ having instructed them
in the Scriptures, and from his owne mouth, it could
not be for want of instruction that they erred, but
this error proceeded from incredulity and hardnes
of heart in them, so it appeares, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 14. where
it is said that our Sauiour appeared to the eleven A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and <hi>vpbraided them with their incredulitie and
hardnesse of heart, because they beleeued not them which
had seene him after he was risen.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Another Priest.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> being put to silence with those proofes, the
other Priest to make vp this breach, fled to another shift,
and denyed the Apostles to haue beene a Church at that
time, because the holy Ghost was not yet come downe, nor
the Euangelicall Law reuealed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker.</speaker>
               <p>Vpon this, Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> first spake to the wauering
Gentleman, and asked him, whether he thought it
not well for him to be of such a Church as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
was, when Christ said. <hi>Math. 16. Happy art thou Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
&amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>vpon this rocke I will build my Church.</hi>
Who answered, that he desired to be of no better
Church. Secondly, he proceeded thus; <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God which comes by the Preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is the true Church.</hi> But that was come alreadie, as
our Sauiour himselfe testified, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. and
<hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 20. It is a base shift, to say that the comming
downe of the holy Ghost made them a Church:
<pb facs="tcp:28014:22"/>
For his extraordinary gifts came not to make them
Christians, and members of the Church of Christ,
but to make them fit messengers to Preach to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to euery people, in their proper tongue.
But if all this will not conuince you, let vs know
who were the Church in those dayes, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were not. <hi>Peter</hi> had receiued that commission
and promise long before, vpon which you build the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if it was not then able to make
him of the Church, how can it now vphold your
Church against all the gates of hell? Now then to
conclude, I beseech you as you loue your soules,
take heed of sinning against your owne Conscience,
and of rebelling against the light: you know that
the Apostles were elected from all eternitie; they
were effectually called by Christ himselfe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beleeue, and to be Christians and open profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
but also to be Apostles and Preachers, and by
the Gospell Preached and Miracles wrought, they
had conuerted many to the faith, as the Gospell testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth;
And therefore nothing being wanting in
them, which is required to the essence of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church: vndoubtedly they were a true Church,
and to deny this, is to resist the manifest truth of the
Gospell. Thus the disputation ended; for the Priests
did not giue any answer, but were very willing to
make an end. The Protestant Gentlemen seemed
well satisfied, and made them readie to depart. And
one of the Roman Catholikes calling Mr. <hi>VValker</hi>
aside, began to collogue and flatter with him; telling
him, that he was a good Logician, a good Linguist,
and well read, and that God had giuen him a sharpe
<pb facs="tcp:28014:23"/>
wit and ready tongue: And therefore no maruell
though he preuailed and made a good cause seeme
bad, when he opposed it, and a bad seeme good
when he defended it: But saith he, take heed that
you do not trust to your wit and learning too much,
least they deceiue you, and make you triumph ouer
the truth.</p>
               <p>To him Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> answered, that he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
inferiour to many hundreds in the Church of
<hi>England;</hi> that it was not any power in himselfe, but
the power of the true cause which made him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile.
For, <hi>Magnus est veritas &amp; praeualebit, Great is
truth and will preuaile.</hi> A Gentleman ouer-hearing,
laughed and sayd, I am glad that you finde some of
our Ministers more learned then your Priests; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your common bragging and boasting, that
all learning is among your Priests and Iesuites. And
so they parted. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> alias <hi>Norrice</hi> embracing
Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and saying; I pray God we may meet in
heauen; and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> replying and saying, I
desire so also, and hope we shall so doe, if
you will forsake your errours and
embrace the truth, which is
professed in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches of
CHRIST.</p>
