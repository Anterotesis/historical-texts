            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

alow no Officer but our <hi>Houswife,</hi> to whom wee onely speake in this booke, she shall first marshall her sallets, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering the grand Sallet first, which is euer more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; then greene Sallets, then boyld Sallets, then some smaller compound Sallets. Next vnto Sallets she shall deliuer forth all her Fricases, the simple first, as Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops, Rashers, and such like; then compound Fricases, after them all her boyld-meates in their degrees, as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-broths, stewd-broth, and the boylings of sundrie Fowles.

Then bak't-meates, the hot first, as Fallow-deare in Pastie, Chicken, or Calues-foote pie and Douset. Then cold bak't-meates, Pheasant, Partridges Turky, Goose, Woodcock, and such like. Then lastly, Carbonados both simple and compound. And being thus marshald from the Dresser, the Sewer vpon the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them on the table, shall not set them downe as hee receiued them, but setting the Sallets extrauagantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the table, mixe the Fricases about them; then the boild-meates amongst the Fricases, Rost-meates amongst the boyld, Bak't-meats amongst the Rost, and Carbona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos amongst the bak't; so that before euery trencher may stand a Sallet, a fricase, a Boyld-meate, a Rost-meate, a Bak't-meate, and a Carbonado, which will both giue a a most comely beautie to the Table, and very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the Guesse.

Then the greater wild-fowle; as Bitter, Hearne, Shoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Crane, Bustard, and such like. Then the greater land-fowles; as Peacocks, Pheasant, Puets, Gulles, and such like. Then hot Bak't-meates; as Marrybone-pie, Quince pie, Florentine, and Tarts.

But in case it bee for much more humble meanes, then lesse care and fewer dishes may discharge it; yee, before I proceed to that lower rate, you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that in these great Feasts of Princes, though I haue mentioned nothing but Flesh, yet is not fish to be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for it is a beautie and an honour vnto euery Feast, and is to be placed amongst all the seuerall seruices, as thus; as amongst your Sallets all sorts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now to these full dishes may bee added in Sallets, Fricases, quelquechoses, and deuised paste, as many dishes more, which make the full seruice no lesse then two and thirtie dishes, which is as much as can conueniently stand on one table, and in one messe; and after this manner you may proportion both your second and third course, holding fulnesse in one halfe of the dishes, and shew the other, which will be both frugall in the spender, contentment to the guest, and much pleasure and delight to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

seuerall colours meet for your purpose, and haue also dried it well: then you shall take it foorth, and toase it ouer againe as you did before: for the first toasing was to make it receiue the colour or die: this second is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the oile, and make it fit for spinning; which assoone as you haue done,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The mixing of colours.</hi>
                  </note> you shall mixe your colours together, wherein you are to note that the best medley, is that which is compounded of two colours only; as a light co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and a darke: for to haue more is but confusion, and breeds no pleasure, but distraction to the fight therefore for the proportion of your mixtures, you shall euer take two parts of the darker colour, and but a third part of the light. As for example, your web containes twelue pound, and the colours are red and greene to you shall then toke eight pound of the greene wooll, and but foure pound of the red; and so of any other colours where there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of brightnes.</p>
               <p>But if it be so that you will needs haue your cloth of three colours,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as of two darke and one light, or two light and one darke: As thus, you will haue Crimson, yellow, and puke; you shall take of the Crimson and yellow of each two pound, and of the puke eight pound: for this is two light colours to one darke; but if you will take a puke; a greene and an orenge tawny wich is too darke, and one light; then you shall take of the puke and greene, and the orenge tawny of each a like quantity; that is to say, of either foure pounds, when you haue equally diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your proportions; then you shall spread vpon the ground a sheete, and vpon the same first lay a thinne layre or bed of your darker colour, all of one euen thicknesse: then vpon the same layre, lay another much thinner of the brighter quantity, being so neere as you can guesse it, hardly half so much as the darker: then couer it ouer with

another layre of the sad colour or colours againe, then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it another of the bright againe: And thus lay layre vpon layre till all your wooll be spread; then beginning at one end role vp round and hard together the whole bed of wooll; and then causing one to kneele hard vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the roule, that it may not stirre nor open, with your hands toase, and pull out all the wooll in small pieces: And then taking a paire of stocke Cards sharpe and large, and bound fast to a forme, or such like thing, and on the same Combe, and Carde ouer all the wooll, till you see it perfectly, and vndistinctly mixed together, and that indeed it is become one intire colour of diuers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spots, or vndeuided locks or knots; in which doing you shall bee very carefull, and heedfull with your eye: And if you finde any hard knot, or other felter in the Wooll, which will not open, though it be neuer so small, yet you shall picke it out and open it, or else being any other fault cast it away: for it is the greatest Art in House-wifery to mixe these wools right, and to make the Cloth without blemish.</p>

                  </note>Your wooll being thus mixed perfectly together, you shall then oile it, or as the plaine House-wife termes it, grease it: In this manner being laid in a round flat bed, you shall take of the best rape oile, or for want thereof ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wel raynd red Goose grease, or Swines grease, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing melted it with your hand sprinkle it all ouer your wooll, and worke it very well into the same: then turne your wooll about, and doe as much on the other side, till you haue oiled all the wooll ouer, and that there is not a locke which is not moistened with the same.</p>

                  </note> you shall then tumme it; which is, you shall pull it foorth as you did before, when you mixe it, and card it ouer againe vpon your Stocke cards: and then those cardings which you strike off, are called tummings, which you shal lay by, till it come to spinning. There be some Hous-wiues which oile it as they mix it, and sprinkle euery layre as they lay it, and worke the oile well into it: and then rouling it vp as before said, pull it out, and tumme it; so that then it goeth but once ouer the stocke-Cards, which is not amisse: yet the other is more certaine, though somewhat more painefull.</p>

So likewise if you

draw a course thread from a wooll of a fine staple, it will then so much ouer thicke, that you must either take away a great part of the substance of your wooll in flockes; or els let the cloth weare course, and high, to the disgrace of good House-wifery, and losse of much cloth, which els might haue been saued.</p>

the manner of gathering of the same: you shall vnderstand that it must bee pulled vp by the rootes, and not cut as Corne is, either with sithe or hooke: and the best time for the pulling of the same is, when you see the leaues fall downeward, or turne yellow at the tops, for then it is full ripe, and this for the most part will be in <hi>Iuly,</hi> and about <hi>Mary Maudlins</hi> day.

Now there be some which ripen their Hempe and Flaxe vpon the ground where it grew, by letting it lie thereon to receiue dewes and raine, and the moistnesse of the earth, till it bee ripe; but this is a vile and naughty way of ripening, it making the Hempe or Flaxe blacke, rough, and often rotten: therefore I would wish none to vse it, but such as necessity compelleth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and then to be carefull to the often turning thereof, for it is the ground onely which rots it.</p>

                  </note>Touching the bignesse of bone, the larger that euery cow is, the better she is: for when either age, or mischance shall disable her for the paile, being of large bone she may be fed, and made fit for the shambles &amp; so no losse, but profit, and any other to the paile as good and sufficient as her selfe.</p>
               <p>For her shape it must a little differ from the Butchers rules;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Shape of Kine.</hi>
                  </note> for being chose for the Dairie, she must haue all the signes of plenty of milke, as a crumpled horne, a thinne necke, a hayrie dewlappe, and a very large vdder, with foure tears, long, thicke, and sharpe at tke ends, for the most part either all white, of what colour soeuer the cow be; or at least the fore part thereof, and if it bee well haird before and behinde, and smooth in the bottome, it is a good signe also.</p>
               <p>As touching the right breed of Kine through our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on generally affoordeth very good ones,<note place="margin">

Now those Kine are said to be deepest of milk, which are new bare; that is, which haue but lately calued, and haue their milke deepe springing in their vdders, for at that time she giueth the most milke; and if the quantity then be not conuenient, doubtles the cow cannot be said to be of deepe milch:<note place="margin">

This office or place of knowledge belongeth particularly to the Hous-wife; and though we haue many excellent Men malsters, yet it is properlie the worke and care of the woman, for it is a house-worke, and done altogether within dores, where generally lieth her charge; the Man only ought to bring in, and prouide the graine, and excuse her from portage or too heauie burthens; but for the Art of making the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12338:102"/>
Malt, and the seuerall labours appertaining to the same, euen from the Fat to the Kilne, it is onely the worke of the Houswife and the Maid-seruants to her appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>To begin then with the first knowledge of our Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Election of Corne for Malt.</hi>
                  </note> it consisteth in the election and choise of graine fit to make Malt on, of which there are indeed truly but two kinds, that is to say, Barley, which is of all other the most excellent for this purpose; and Oates, which when Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is scant or wanting, maketh also a good and sufficient Malt: and though the drinke which is drawne from it be neither so much in the quantitie, so strong in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, nor yet so pleasant in the taste, yet is the drink ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good and tolerable, and nourishing enough for any reasonable creature. Now I do not denie, but there may be made Malt of Wheate, Pease, Lupins, Petches and such like, yet it is with vs of no retained custome, nor is the drink simply drawne or extracted from those graines, either wholsome or pleasant, but strong and fulsome; therefore I thinke it not fit to spend any time in treating of the same. To speake then of the election of Barly, you shall vnderstand that there be diuers kinds thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the alteration of soyles, some being big, some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, some full, some emptie, some white, some browne, and some yellow: but I will reduce all these into three kinds, that is, into the Clay-Barly, the Sand-Barly, and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which groweth on the mixt soyle. Now the best Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make Malt on, both for yeelding the greatest quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of matter, and making the strongest, best and most wholsome drink, is the Clay barly wel drest, being cleane Corne of it selfe, without Weede or Oates, white of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, full in substance, and sweete in taste: that which groweth on the mixt grounds is the next; for though it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12338:103"/>
be subiect to some Oates and some Weedes; yet being painefully and carefully drest, it is a faire and a bould corne, great and full; and though somewhat browner then the former, yet it is of a faire and cleane complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The last and worst graine for this purpose is the sand Barly, for although it bee seldome or neuer mixt with Oates, yet if the tillage bee not painefully and cunningly handled, it is much subiect to Weedes of diuers kinds, Tares, Fetches, and such like, which drinke vp the liquor in the brewing, and make the yeeld or quantitie thereof very little and vnprofitable: besides, the graine naturally of if selfe hath a yellow, withered, emptie huske, thicke and vnfurnished of meale, so that the drinke drawne from it can neither be so much, so strong, so good, nor so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; so that to conclude, the cleane Clay-barley is best for profit in the sale-drinke for strength and long lasting. The Barly on the mixt grounds will serue well for hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and Families: and the Sand-barly for the poore, and in such places where better is not to be gotten. And these are to bee knowne of euery Husband or Huswife; the first by his whitenesse, greatnesse and fulnesse: the second by his brownenesse, and the third by his yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with a darke browne nether end, and the emptines and thicknesse of the huske (and in this election of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley you shall note, that if you find in it any wild Oats, it is a signe of a rich clay-ground, but ill husbanded, yet the Malt made thereof is not much amisse, for both the wilde Oate and the perfit Oate giue a pleasant sharpe rellish to the drinke, if the quantitie bee not too much, which is euermore to be respected. And to conclude this marter of election, great care must be had of both Husband and Huswife, that the Barley chosen for Malt, bee exceeding sweete, both in smell and taste, and verie cleane drest: for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:12338:103"/>

Now ouer against the Kiln-hole or furnace (which is euermore intended to be on the ground) should a conuenient place be made to pile in the fuell for the Kilne, whether it bee Straw, Bracken, Furres, Wood, Coale, or other fewell; but sweet Straw is of all other the best and nearest. Now it is intended that this Malt-house may be made two sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in height, but no higher: ouer your Cesternes shalbe made the Garners wherein to keepe your Barley before it be steeped: in the bottoms of these Garners, standing directly ouer the Cesterns, shall bee conuenient holes made to open and shut at pleasuer, through which shall run downe the Barley into the Cesterne. Ouer the bed of the Kilne can be nothing but the place for the Haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and a spacious roofe open euery way, that the smoke may haue free passage, and with the least ayre bee carried from the Kilne, which maketh the Malt sweete and pleasant. Ouer that place where the fewell is piled, &amp; is next of all to the bed of the Kilne, would likewise bee other spacious Garners made, some to receiue the Malt assoone as it is dried with the Come and Kilne-dust, in which it may lie to mellow and ripen; and others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Malt after it is skreened and drest vp; for to let it be too long in the Come, as aboue three moneths at longest, will make it both corrupt, and breed Weeuels and other Wormes, which are the greatest destroyers of

For it is to be noted, that all bee housewiues doe giue ouer the making of Malt in the extreame heate of Summer, it is not because the Malt is worse that is made in Sommer then that which is made in Winter, but because the flowres are more vnseasonable, and that the Sunne getting a power into such open places, maketh the graine which is steeped to sprout and come so swiftly, that it cannot indure to take time on the flowre, and get the right seasoning which belongeth to the same: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as these kind of vaults being drie, and as it were coucht

vnder the ground, not onely keepeth out the sunne in summer, which maketh the Malt come much too fast, but also defendeth it from frosts and cold bitter blasts in sharpe winters, which will not suffer it to come, or sprout at all; or if parte doe come and sprout, as that which lieth in the hart of the bed; yet the vpper parts and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side by meanes of extreame cold cannot sprute; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe dried, hath his first hardnes, and is one and the same with raw Barley; for euery Hus-wife must know, that if Malt doe not come as it were altogether, and at an instant, and not one come more then another, the Malt must needs bee very much imperfit: The next flower to the Caue, or drie-sandy rocke, is the Flower which is made of earth, or a stiffe strong binding Clay well watred, and mixt with horse dung, and soape-ashes, beaten and wrought together, till it come to one solled firmnes; this Flower is a very warme comfortable Flower in the winter season, and will helpe the grayne to come and sprout exceedingly, and with the helpe of windowes to let in the cold aire, and to shut out the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reflection of the sunne, will serue very conueniently for the making of Malt, for nine monthes in the yeere, that is to say, from September till the end of May; but for Iune, Iuly, and August, to imploy it to that purpose, will breed both losse, and incumbrance: The next flower to this of earth, is that which is made of plaster, or plaster of paris, being burnt in a seasonable time, and kept from wet, till the time of shooting, and then smoothly laid, and well leuelled; the imperfection of this plaster Flower is onely the extreame coldnesse thereof, which in fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and colde seasons, so bindeth in the heart of the graine, that it cannot sprout, for which cause it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth euery Maltster that is compelled to these Flowers,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12338:105"/>
to looke well into the seasons of the yeere, and when hee findeth either the Frosts, Northerne blasts, or other nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping stormes to rage too violently, then to make his first couches or beds, when the graine commeth newly out of the Cesterne, much thicker and rounder then otherwise he would doe, and as the cold abateth, or the corne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth in sprouting, so to make the couches or beds thinner and thinner; for the thicker and closer the graine is coucht and laid together, the warmer it lieth; and so catching heate, sooner sprouteth, and the thinner it lieth the cooler it is, and so much the slower in sprouting. This flowre, if the windowes be close, and guard of the Sunne sufficiently, will (if necessitie compel) serue for the making of Malt ten moneths in the yeere, onely in Iuly and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust which containe the Dog-dayes, it would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, nor in the time of any violent Frost, without great care and circumspection. Againe, there is in this flowre another fault, which is a naturall casting out of dust, which much sullieth the graine, and being dried makes it looke dun and foule, which is much disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Malster; therefore she must haue great care that when the Malt is taken away, to sweepe and keepe her flowres as cleane and neate as may be. The last and worst is the boarded flowre, of what kind soeuer it be, by reason of the too much heate thereof, and yet of boarded flowres the Oaken boarded is the coolest and longest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting; the Elme or Beech is next; then the Ashe, and the worst (though it be the fairest to the eye) is the Firre, for it hath in it selfe (by reason of the Frankensence and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine which it holdeth) a naturall heate, which mixed with the violence of the Sunne in the Summer-time, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the graine not onely to sprout, but to grow in the couch, which is much losse, and a foule imputation. Now
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:12338:106"/>
these boarded flowres can hardly be in vse for aboue fiue moneths at the most, that is to say, October, Nouember, December, Ianuarie and Februarie; for the rest, the Sun hath too much strength, and these boarded flowres too much warmth; and therefore in the coolest times it is good to obserue to make the couches thin, whereby the aire may passe thorow the corne, and so coole it, that it may sprout at leasure. Now for any other flowre besides these already named,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Imperfect Flowres.</hi>
                  </note> there is not any good to malt vpon; for the common flowre which is of naturall earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Clay, Sand or Grauell, if it haue no mixture at all with it more then it owne nature, by oft treading vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, groweth to gather the nature of saltnesse or Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it, which not onely giueth an ill taste to the graine that is laid vpon the same, but also his moysture and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, which in the moyst times of the yere arise from the ground, it often corrupteth and putrifieth the corne. The rough paued flowre by reason of the vneuenes, is vnfit to malt on, because the graine getting into the crannies doth there lie, and are not remoued or turned vp and downe as they should be with the hand, but many times is so fixed to the ground, it sprouteth and groweth vp into a greene blade, affording much losse and hindrance to the owner. The smooth paued slowre, or any flowre of stone whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, is full as ill; for euery one of them naturally against much wet or change of weather, will sweate and distill forth such abundant moisture, that the Malt lying vpon the same, can neither dry kindly and expell the former moisture receiued in the cesterne, but also by that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much moysture many times rotteth, and comes to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vseles. Lastly, for the flowre made of Lime and Haire, it is as ill as any formerly spoken of, both in respect of the nature of the Lime, whose heate and sharpnes is a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12338:106"/>
maine enemy to Malt, or any moist corne, as also in respect of the weaknes and brittlenes of the substance thereof, being apt to molder and fall in peeces with the lightest treading on the same, and that lime and dust once mixing with the corne, it doth so poison and suffocate it, that it can neither sprout, nor turne seruiceable for any vse.</p>

                  </note> our Malster shall haue a great care in the framing and fashioning of the Kilne, of which there are sundrie sorts of moddles, as the ancient forme which was in times past vsed of our fore-fathers, being only made in a square proportion at the top with small splints or rafters, ioyned within fower inches one of another, going from a maine beame crossing the mid part of that great square: then is this great square from the top, with good and sufficient studds to be drawne slopewise narrower and narrower, till it come to the ground, so that the harth or lowest part thereof may bee not aboue a sixth part to the great square aboue, on which the Malt is laid to be dried, and this harth shall bee made hollow and descending, and not leuell nor assending: and these Kilnes do not hold any certaine quantitie in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per square, but may euer bee according to the frame of some being thirty foot each way, some twenty, and some eighteene. There be other Kilnes which are made after this maner open and slope, but they are round of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but both these kind of Kilnes haue one fault, which is danger of fire; for lying euery way open and apt for the blaze, if the Malster be any thing negligent either in the keeping of the blaze low and forward, or not sweeping e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part about the harth any thing that may take fire, or foreseeing that no straws which do belong to the bedding of the kilne do hang downe, or are loose, wherby the fire may take hold of them, it is very possible that the Kilne

Of the forme or modell whereof, I will not here stand to intreate, because they are now so generally frequent amongst vs, that not a Mason or Carpenter in the Kingdome but can build the same; so that to vse more words thereof were tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to little purpose. Now there is another kind of Kilne which I haue seene (and but in the West-countrie onely) which for the profitable quaintnesse thereof, I tooke some especiall note of, and that was a Kilne made at the end of a Kitchin Raunge or Chimney, being in shape round, and made of Brick, with a little hollownesse narrowed by degrees, into which came from the bottom and midst of the Kitchin-chimney a hollow tunnell or vault, like the tunnell of a Chimney, and ran directly on the back-side, the hood or backe of the Kitchin-chimney; then in the midst of the Chimney, where the greatest
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:12338:107"/>
strength of the fire was made, was a square hole made of about a foote and a halfe euery way, with an Iron thicke plate to draw to and fro, opening and closing the hole at pleasure; and this hole doth open onely into that tunnell which went to the Kilne, so that the Malt being once laid, &amp; spread vpon the Kilne, draw away the Iron plate, and the ordinarie fire with which you dresse your meate, and performe other necessarie businesses, is suckt vp into this tunnell, and so conuaieth the heate to the Kilne, where it drieth the Malt with as great perfection, as any Kilne that euer I saw in my life, and needeth neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance or other ceremony more, then once in fiue or sixe houres to turne the Malt, and take it away when it is dried sufficiently: for it is here to bee noted, that how great or violent soeuer the fire be which is in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet by reason of the passage, and the quantitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it carrieth no more but a moderate heate to the Kilne; and for the smoke, it is so carried away in other loope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes which run from the hollownesse betweene the tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell and the Malt-bed, that no Malt in the world can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be sweeter, or more delicately coloured: onely the fault of these Kilnes are, that they are but little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, and so cannot drie much at a time, as not aboue a quarter or ten strike at the most in one drying, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are no more but for a mans owne particular vse, and for the furnishing of one setled familie; but so applied, they exceede all the Kilnes that I haue seene whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12338:108"/>
draw them. But first to shew you what the bedding of a Kilne is, you shall vnderstand, that it is a thin couering laid vpon the open rafters, which are next vnto the heate of the fier, being made either so thin or so open, that the smallest heate may passe thorow it, and come to the corne: this bed must be laid so euen and leuell as may be, and not thicker in one place then another, lest the Malt drie too fast where it is thinnest, and too slowly where it is thicke, and so in the taste seeme to bee of two seuerall dryings: it must also be made of such stuffe, as hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued heate, it will long continue the same, and be an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant to the fire in drying the corne: it should also haue in it no moyst or dankish propertie, least at the first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the fire, it send out a stinking smoke, and so taint the Malt: nor should it bee of any rough or sharpe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, because vpon this bed or bedding is laid the haire-cloth, and on the haire-cloth the Malt, so that with the turning the Malt, and treading vpon the cloth, should the bed be of any such roughnesse, it would soone weare out the haire-cloth, which would be both losse and ill hous-wifery, which is carefully to be eschewed. But now for the matter or substance whereof this bedding should bee made, the best, neatest, and sweetest, is cleane long Rie straw, with the eares onely cut off, and the ends laid euen together, not one longer then another, and so spread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rafter of the Kilne as eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12338:108"/>
to danger of fire, by reason of the quicknesse to receiue the flame, yet in the French Kilnes (before mentioned) it is a most safe bedding, for not any fire can come neere vnto it. There bee others which bed the Kilne with Mat; and it is not much to bee mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, if the Mat bee made of Rye-straw sowed, and wouen together according to the manner of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Mats, or those vsuall thin Bent-Mats, which you shall commonlie see in the Summer time, standing in Husbandmens Chimnies, where one bent or straw is laid by another, and so wouen together with a good strong pack-thread: but these Mats according to the old Prouerbe (More cost more Worship,) for they are chargeable to bee bought, and verie troublesome in the making, and in the wearing will not out-last one of the former loose beddings; for if one thread or stitch breake, immediatelie most in that row will follow: onely it is most certaine, that during the time it lasteth it is both good, necessarie and hansome. But if the Mat bee made either of Bulrushes, Flaggs, or any other thicke substance (as for the most part they are) then it is not so good a bedding, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the thicknesse keepeth out the heate, and is long before it can bee warmed; as also in that it euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cooled, naturally of it selfe draweth into it a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine moysture, which with the first heate beeing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in smoke, doth much offend and breed ill taste in the Malt. There bee others that bed the Kilne with a kind of Mat made of broad thinne splints of wood wrought checker-wise one into another, and it hath the same faults which the thicke Mat hath; for it is long in catching the heate, and will euer smoke at the first warming, and that smoke will the Malt smell on
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:12338:109"/>
euer after; for the smoke of wood is euer more sharpe and piercing then any other smoke whatsoeuer. Besides, this wooden mat, after it hath once bedded the Kilne, it can hardly afterward bee taken vp or remoued; for by continuall heate, being brought to such an extreme drie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if vpon any occasion either to mend the Kilne, or clense the Kilne, or doe other necessarie labour vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the bedding, you should take vp the wooden mat, it would presently crack and fall to peeces, and bee no more seruiceable. There be others which bed the Kilne with a bedding made all of wickers, or small wands foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one into another like a hurdle, or such like wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke; but it is made very open, euery wand at least two or three fingers one from another: and this kind of bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is a very strong kind of bedding, and will last long, &amp; catcheth the heat at the first springing, only the smoke is offensiue, and the roughnesse without great care vsed, will soone weare out your haire-cloth: yet in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where straw is not to bee got or spared, and that you are compelled onely to vse wood for your fuell in dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Malt, I allow this bedding before any other, for it is very good, strong and long-lasting: besides, it may be taken vp and set by at pleasure, so that you may sweepe and clense your Kilne as oft as occasion shall serue, and in the neate and fine keeping of the Kilne, doth consist much of the huswiues Art; for to be choakt either with dust, durt, soote or ashes, as it shewes sluttishnesse and sloth, the onely great imputations hanging ouer a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, so they likewise hinder the labour, and make the Malt drie a great deale worse, and more vnkindly.</p>

much heate, that it will rather burne then drie, if it be not moderated, and the smoke is also much offensiue. Next to this Beane-straw is your Furres, Gorse, Whinnes, or small Brush wood, which differeth not much from Beane-straw; onely the smoke is much shaper, and tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Malt with a much stronger sauour. To these I may adde Braken or Braks, Ling, Heath, or Brome, all which may serue in time of necessitie, but each one of them haue this fault, that they adde to the Malt an ill taste or sauour. After these I place Wood of all sorts, for each is alike noysome, and if the smoke which commeth from it touch the Malt, the infection cannot bee recouered; from whence amongst the best husbands haue sprung this opinion, that when at any time drinke is ill ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bricke, because it is laid with Lime, is altogether vnholsome, for the Lime being apt at change of weather to sweat, moystneth the graine, and so tainteth it, and in the driest seasons with the sharpe hot taste, doth fully as much offend it: those which are made of Stone are much more noysome, both in respect of the reasons before rehearsed, as also in that all Stone of it selfe will sweate, and so more and more corrupteth the Graine which is harboured in it. Lime and Haire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same nature, carrieth the same offences, and is in the like sort to be eschewed. Now for Mud, Clay, or Loame, in as much as they must necessarily be mixed with wood, because otherwise of themselues they cannot knit or bind together, and besides, that the clay or loame must bee mixt either with chopt-hay, chopt-straw, or chopt-litter, they are as great breeders of wormes &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min as wood is, nor are they defences against Mice, but easie to be wrought through, and so very vnprofitable for any husband or huswife to vse. Besides, they are much too hot, and being either in a close house neere the kilne,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12338:111"/>
or the back or face of any other Chimney, they drie the Corne too sore, and make it dwindle and wither, so that it neither filleth the bushell, nor inricheth the liquor, but turnes to losse euery way. The best Garner then that can be made both for safetie and profit, is to be made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of broken tile-shread, or broken bricks, cunningly and euen laid, and bound together with Plaster of Parris, or our ordinarie English Plaster, or burnt Alablaster, and then couered all ouer both within and without, in the bottome and on euery side, at least three fingers thicke with the same Plaster, so as no bricke or tile-shread may by any meanes bee seene, or come neere to touch the Corne; and these Garners you may make as bigge, or as little as you please, according to the frame of your house, or places of most conuenience for the purpose, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would euer bee as neere the Kilne as may be, that the ayre of the fire in the dayes of drying may come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same, of else neere the backs or sides of Chimneis, where the ayre thereof may correct the extreame cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>After these Garners, Hutches, or large Keepes for Corne are perfitted and made, and fitly adioyned to the Kilne, the next thing that our Maulster hath too looke vnto, is the framing of the Fats or Cesterns, in which the Corne is to bee steeped, and they are of two sorts, that is, either of Coopers worke, being great Fats of wood,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12338:111"/>
or else of Masons worke, being Cesternes made of stone; but the Cesterne of stone is much the better, for besides that these great Fats of wood are very chargeable and costly (as a Fat to containe foure quarters of graine, which is but two and thirtie bushels, cannot bee afforded vnder twenty shillings), so likewise they are very casuall and apt to mischance and spilling; for besides their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie wearing, if in the heate of Summer they be neuer so little neglected without water, and suffered to ouer-drie, it is ten to one but in the Winter they will bee ready to fall in peeces; and if they be kept moyst, yet if the water be not oft shifted and preserued sweet, the Fat will soone taint, and being once growne faultie, it is not onely irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable, but also whatsoeuer commeth to be steeped in it after, will be sure to haue the same sauour, besides the wearing and breaking of Garthes and Pluggs, the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, clensing, sweetning, and a whole world of other troubles and charges doe so daily attend them, that the benefit is a great deale short of the incumbrance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Gesterne is euer ready and vsefull, without any vexation at all, and being once wel and sufficiently made, will not neede trouble or reparation (more then ordinary washing) scarse in an hundred yeeres. Now the best way of making these Mault-cesterns, is to make the bottomes and sides of good tile-shreads, fixed together with the best Lime and Sand, and the bottome shall bee raised at least a foote and a halfe higher then the ground, and at one corner in the bottome a fine artificiall round hole must be made, which being outwardly stopt, the Mault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may through it draine the Cesterne drie when shee pleaseth, and the bottome must bee so artificially leueld and contriued, that the water may haue a true descent to that hole, &amp; not any remaine behind when it is opened.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12338:112"/>
Now when the modell is thus made of tile-shread, which you may doe great or little at your pleasure, then with Lime, Haire and Beasts-blood mixed together, you shall couer the bottome at least two inches thick, laying leuell and plaine as is before shewed: which done, you shall also couer all the sides and top, both within and without with the same matter, at least a good fingers thicknesse, and the maine wall of the whole Cesterne shall bee a full foot in thicknes, as well for strength and durablesse, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate reasons for the holding the graine and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose poyze and weight might otherwise indanger a weaker substance.

                     <hi>The manner how to make Malt.</hi>
                  </note>I will now speake a little in generall as touching the Art, skill and knowledge of Malt making, which I haue referred to the conclusion of this Chapter, because who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is ignorant in any of the things before spoken of, cannot by any meanes euer attaine to the perfection of most true and most thriftie Malt-making: To begin then with this Art of making, or (as some terme it) melting of Malt, you shall first (hauing proportioned the quantitie you meane to steepe, which should euer be answerable to the continent of your Cesterne, and your Cesterne to your flowres) let it either run downe from your vpper Garner into the Cesterne, or otherwise be carried into your Cesterne, as you shall please, or your occasions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and this Barley would by all meanes be very cleane, and neatly drest; then when your Cesterne is filled, you shall from your Pumpe or Well conuey the water into the Cesterne, till all the Corne be drencht, and that the water floate aboue it: if there be any Corne that will not sinke, you shall with your hand stirre it about,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12338:112"/>
and wet it, and so let it rest and couer the Cesterne; and thus for the space of three nights you shall let the corne steepe in the water. After the third night is expired, the next morning you shall come to the Cesterne, and plucke out the plug or bung-sticke which stoppeth the hole in the bottome of the Cesterne, and so draine the water cleane from the Corne, and this water you shall by all meanes saue, for much light Corne and others will come forth with this draine-water, which is very good Swines meate, and may not be lost by any good huswife. Then hauing drained it, you shall let the Cesterne drop all that day, and in the euening with your shouell you shall empty the Corne from the Cesterne vnto the Malt-flowre, and when all is out, and the Cesterne clensed, you shall lay all the wet corne on a great heape round or long, and flat on the top; and the thicknesse of this heape shall be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the season of the yeere; for if the weather bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame cold, then the heape shall be made very thicke, as three or foure foote, or more, according to the quantitie of the graine: but if the weather be temperate and warme, then shall the heape be made thinner, as two foote, a foote and a halfe, or one foote, according to the quantitie of the graine. And this heape is called of Malsters a Couch or Bed of raw Malt. In this couch you shall let the Corne lie three nights more without stirring, and after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the three nights, you shall looke vpon it, and if you find that it beginneth but to sprout (which is called coming of Malt) though it bee neuer so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as but the verie white end of the sproute peeping out (so it be in the outward part of the heape or Couch) you shall then breake open the Couch, and in the middest (where the Corne lay neerest) you shall find the sprout or Come of a greater largenesse; then with your
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12338:113"/>
shouell you shall turne all the outward part of the couch inward, and the inward outward, and make it at least three or foure times as big as it was at the first, and so let it lie all that day and night, and the next day you shall with your shouell turne the whole heape ouer againe, increasing the largenes, and making it of one indifferent thicknesse ouer all the flowre; that is to say, not aboue a handfull thicke at the most, not failing after for the space of fourteene dayes, which doth make vp full in all three weeks, to turn it all ouer twice or thrice a day according to the season of the weather, for if it be warme, the malt must be turnd oftner; if coose, then it may lie closser, thicker and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er together; and when the three weeks is fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht, then you shall (hauing bedded your kilne, and spread a cleane harie-cloth thereon) lay the malt as thinne as may be (as about three fingres thicknes) vpon the hariecloth,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now for the dressing and clensing of Malt at such time as it is either to be spent in the house,<note place="margin">

                  </note> or sold in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, you shall first winnow it with a good wind either from the ayre, or from the Fan; and before the winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you shall rub it exceeding well betweene your hands to get the Come or sproutings cleane away: for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and goodnesse of Malt is when it is most smug, cleane, bright, and likest to Barley in the view, for then there is least waste and greatest profit: for Come and dust drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp the liquor, and giues an ill taste to the drinke. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is well rubd and winnowed, you shall then ree it ouer in a fine siue, and if any of the Malt be vnclensed, then rub it againe in the fiue till all bee pure, and the rubbings will arise on the top of the siue, which you may cast off at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and both those rubbings from the siue and the Chaffe and dust which commeth from the winnowings should be safe kept, for they are very good Swines meate, and feede well mixt either with whay or swillings: and thus after the Malt is red, you shall either stacke it vp for espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vse, or put it into a well clensed Garner, where it may lie till there be occasion for expence.</p>
               <p>Now there be certaine obseruations in the making of Malt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the making of Malt.</hi>
                  </note> which I may by no meanes omit: for though diuers opinions doe diuersly argue them, yet as neere as I can, I will reconcile them to that truth, which is most consonant to reason, and the rule of honestie and equalitie.</p>
               <p>First, there is a difference in mens opinions as touching the constant time for the mellowing and making of the Malt; that is, from the first steeping to the time of drying; for some will allow both Fat and Flowre hardly a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12338:114"/>
some a fortnight and two or three dayes, and doe giue this reason; first, they say it makes the Corne looke whiter and brighter, and doth not get so much the fully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and foulenesse of the flower, as that which lieth three weekes, which makes it a great deale more beautifull and so more sallable: next, it doth not come or shoote out so much sprout, as that which lieth a longer time, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth more heart in the graine, makes it bould and fuller, and so consequently more full of substance, and able to make more of a little, then the other much of more; and these reasons are good in shew, but not in substantiall truth: for (although I confesse that Corne which lieth least time of the flowre must be the whitest and brightest) yet that which wanteth any of the due time, can neither ripen, mellow, nor come to true perfection, and lesse then three weekes cannot ripen Barley: for looke what time in hath to swell and sprout, it must haue full that time to flourish, and as much time to decay: now in lesse then a week it cannot do the first, &amp; so in a week the second, and in another weeke the third; so that in lesse then 3. weekes a man cannot make perfit Malt. Againe, I confesse, that Malt which hath the least Come, must haue the greatest kernell, and so bee most substantiall; yet the Malt which putteth not out his full sprout, but hath that moysture (with too much haste) driuen in which should be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, can neuer bee Malt of any long lasting, or profitable for indurance, because it hath so much moyst substance as doth make it both apt to corrupt &amp; breed worms in most great abundance: it is most true, that this hastie made Malt is fairest to the eie, and will soonest be vented in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; and being spent assone as it is bought, little or no losse is to be perceiued, yet if it be kept 3 or 4 months, or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (vnlesse the place where it is kept be like a Hot-house)
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12338:114"/>
it will so danke and giue againe, that it will be little better then raw Malt, and so good for no seruice without a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond drying: besides, Malt that is not suffred to sprout to the full kindly, but is stopt as soone as it begins to peepe, much of that Malt cannot come at all, for the moystest graines doe sprout first, and the hardest are longer in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the huske; now if you stop the graine on the first sprouts, and not giue all leisure to come one after another, you shall haue halfe Malt and halfe Barley, and that is good for nothing but Hens and Hogs Trough. So that to conclude, lesse then three weeks you cannot haue to make good and perfect Malt.</p>
               <p>Next there is a difference in the turning of the Malt, for some (and those be the most men Malsters whatsoeuer) turne all their Malt with the shouell, and say it is most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, most speedy, and dispatcheth more in an houre, then any other way doth in three; and it is very true, yet it scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth much, leaueth much behind vnturn'd, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which was vndermost, it leaueth vndermost still, &amp; so by some comming too much, &amp; others not comming at all, the Malt is oft much imperfect, &amp; the old saying made good, that too much haste, maketh waste. Now there are others (and they are for the most part weomen Malsters) which turne all with the hand, and that is the best, safest, &amp; most certaine way; for there is not a graine which the hand doth not remoue &amp; turne ouer &amp; ouer, and layes euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall heape or row of such an euen &amp; iust thicknesse, that the Malt both equally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, &amp; equally seasoneth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without defect or alteration: and though he that hath much Malt to make, will be willing to hearken to the swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test course in making, yet he that will make the best Malt, must take such conuenient leisure, and imploy that labour which commeth neerest to perfection.</p>
               <p>Then there is another especiall care to bee had in the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12338:115"/>
coming or sprouting of Malt, which is, that as it must not come too little, so it must not by any meanes come too much, for that is the grossest abuse that may be: and that which we call comed or sprouted too much is, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by negligence for want of looking to the couch, and not opening of it, or for want of turning when the Malt is spread on the flowre, it come or sprout at both ends, which Husbands call Akerspyerd; such corne by reason the whole heart of substance is driuen out of it, can bee good for no purpose but the Swine-trough, and therefore you must haue an especiall care both to the well tending of the couch, and the turning the Malt on the flowre, and be sure (as neere as you can by the ordering of the couch, and happing the hardest graine inward and warmest) to make it all Come very indifferently together. Now if it so fall out that you buy your Barley, and happen to light on mixt graine, some being old Corne, some new Corne, some of the heart of the starke, and some of the stadle, which is an ordinarie deceit with Husbandmen in the Market, then you may be well assured, that this graine can neuer Come or sprout equally together; for the new Corne will sprout before the old, and the stadle before that in the hart of the starke, by reason the one exceedeth the other in moistnesse: therefore in this case you shall marke well which commeth first, which will be still in the heart of the Couch, and with your hand gather it by it selfe into a seperate place, and then heape the other toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe; and thus as it cometh and sprouteth, so ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it from the heape with your hand, and spread <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t on the flowre, and keepe the other still in a thicke heape till all be sprouted. Now lastly obserue, that if your Malt be hard to sprout or Come, and that the fault consist more in the bitter coldnes of the season, then any defect of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:12338:115"/>
corne, that then (besides the thicke and close making of the heape or couch) you faile not to couer it ouer with some thicke wollen clothes, as course Couerlids, or such like stuffe, the warmth whereof will make it Come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently: which once perceiued, then forthwith vncloth it, and order it as aforesaid in all points. And thus much for the Art, order, skill &amp; cunning belonging to Maltmaking.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the making of Oates into Malt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Oate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale.</hi>
                  </note> which is a thing of generall vse in many parts of this Kingdome where Barley is scarce, as in <hi>Chesheire, Lancasheire,</hi> much of <hi>Darbisheire, Deuonsheire, Cornwall,</hi> and the like, the Art and skill is all one with that of Barley, nor is there any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation or change of worke, but one and the same order still to be obserued, onely by reason that Oates are more swift in sprouting, and apter to clutter, ball and hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the length of the sprout then Barley is, therefore you must not faile but turne them oftner then Barley, and in the turning bee carefull to turne all, and not leaue any vnmoued.

                  </note>To speake then first of the vertues of Oates, as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to Cattell and creatures without doore, and first to begin with the Horse; there is not any food whatsoeuer that is so good, wholsome, and agreeable with the nature of a Horse, as Oates are, being a Prouendar in which hee taketh such delight, that with it he feedeth, trauelleth, and doth any violent labour whatsoeuer with more courage and comfort, then with any other food that can be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as all men know, that haue either vse of it, or Horses; neither doth the Horse euer take surfeit of Oates, (if they be sweet and dry) for albe he may well be glutted or stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon them (with indiscreet feeding) and so refuse them for a little time, yet he neuer surfeiteth, or any present sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse followeth after; whereas no other graine but glut a Horse therewith, and instantly sicknes will follow, which shewes surfeit, and the danger is oft incurable: for we reade in <hi>Italy,</hi> at the siege of <hi>Naples,</hi> of many hundred Horses that dyed on the surfeit of wheate; at <hi>Rome</hi> also dyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred Horses of the plague, which by due proofe was found to proceed from a surfeit taken of peason &amp; fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and so I could runne ouer all other graines, but it is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:12338:116"/>
needlesse, and farre from the purpose I haue to handle: suffice it, Oates for Horses are the best of all foodes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, whether they be but onely cleane thresht from the straw, and so dryed, or conuerted to Oatmeale, and so ground and made into Bread, Oates boyl'd and giuen to a Horse whilst they are coole and sweet, are an excellent foode for any Horse in the time of disease, pouerty, or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for they scower and fat exceedingly.</p>
               <p>In the same nature that Oates are for Horses, so are they for the Asse, Mule, Camell, or any other Beast of burthen.</p>
               <p>If you will feede either Oxe, Bull, Cow, or any Nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sheepe or Goats may likewise be fed with Oates, to as great price and profit as with Peas, and Swine are fed with Oates, either in raw Malt, or otherwise, to as great thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as with any graine whatsoeuer; onely they must haue a few Pease after the Oates to harden the fat, or else it will waste, and consume in boyling. Now for holding Swine, which are onely to be preserued in good flesh, nothing is better then a thin mange made of ground Oates, whey, Butter-milke, or other ordinary washe or swillings, which either the Dayry, or Kitchin affordeth; nor is there any more soueraigne or excellent meate for Swine in the time of sicknesse, then a mange made of ground Oates and sweete Whey, warmed luke-warme on the fier, and mixt with the powder of Raddle, or red Oaker.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:12338:117"/>
Nay, if you will goe to the matter of pleasure, there is not any meate so excellent for the feeding, and wholesome keeping of a kenell of hounds, as the Maugge made of ground Oates and scalding water, or of beefe-broth, or any other broth, in which flesh hath been sodden; if it be for the feeding, strengthning and comforting of Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, Spaniels, or any other sort of tenderer Dogges, there is no meat then sheeps-heads, haire and all, or other intralls of sheepe chopt and well sodden, with good store of Oate-meale.</p>
               <p>Now for all manner of Poultrie, as Cocks, Capons, Hens, Chickens of great size, Turkeys, Geesse, Ducks, Swannes and such like, there is no food feedeth them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Oates, and if it bee the young breede of any of those kinds, euen from the first hatching or disclosing, till they be able to shift for themselues, there is no food bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatsoeuer then Oate-meale greetes, or fine Oate-meale, either simple of it selfe, or else mixt with milke, drinke, or else new made Vrine.</p>

                  </note> therefore I thinke it not much amisse to speake a word or two touching the making of Oatmeale, you shall vnderstand then, that to make good and perfit Oate-meale, you shall first drie your Oates exceeding well, and then put them on the Mill, which may either be Water-mill, Wind-mill, or Horse-mill (but the Horse-mill is best) and no more but crush or hull them; that is, to carrie the stones so large, that they may no more but crush the huske from the Kirnell: then you shall winnow the hulls from the kirnels either with the wind or a Fan, and finding them of an indifferent cleannesse (for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to hull them all cleane at the first) you shall then put them on againe, and making the Mill goe a little clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, run them through the Mill againe, and then winnow them ouer againe, and such greets or kirnels as are cleane huld and well cut you may lay by, and the rest you shall run through the Mill againe the third time, and so win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now them againe, in which time all will be perfit, and the greets or full kirnels will seperate from the smaller Oate-meale; for you shall vnderstand, that at this first making of Oate-meale, you shall euer haue two sorts of Oate-meales; that is, the full whole greete or kirnell, and the small dust Oate-meale: as for the course hulles or chaffe that commeth from them, that also is worthy sauing, for it is an excellent good Horse-prouender for any plow or labouring Horses, being mixt with either Beanes, Pease, or any other Pulse whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Now for the vse and vertues of these two seuerall kinds of Oate-meales in maintaining the Family,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The vertues of oate-meale.</hi>
                  </note> they are so many (according to the many customes of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that it is almost impossible to reckon all; yet (as neere
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12338:118"/>
as I can) I will impart my knowledge, and what I haue cane from relation: first, for the small dust or meale Oat-meale, it is that with which all pottage is made and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether they be meate-pottage, milke-pottage, or any thicke or else thin grewell whatsoeuer, of whose goodnesse and wholsomnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it is needlesse to speake, in that it is frequent with euery experience: also with this small Meale Oat-meale is made in diuers Countries sixe seuerall kinds of very good and wholsome bread, euerie one finer then other, as your Anacks, Ianacks, and such like. Also there is made of it both thick and thin Oaten-Cakes, which are very pleasant in taste, and much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but if it be mixed with fine Wheate-meale, then it maketh a most delicate and daintie Oate-cake, either thick or thin, such as no Prince in the world but may haue them serued to his table; also this small Oate-meale mixed with blood, and the liuer of either Sheepe, Calfe or Swine, maketh that pudden which is called the Haggas or Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, of whose goodnesse it is in vaine to boast, because there is hardly to bee found a man that doth not affect them. And lastly, from this small Oat-meale by oft stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it in water and clensing it; and then boyling it to a thicke and stiffe Ielly, is made that excellent dish of meat, which is so esteemed in the West parts of this Kingdome, which they call Wash-brew, and in <hi>Chesheire</hi> and <hi>Lanka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheire</hi> they call it Flamerie or Flumerie, the wholsomnes and rare goodnesse, nay, the very Physick helpes thereof, being such and so many, that I my selfe haue heard a very reuerend and worthily renowned Physition speake more in the commendations of that meate, then of any other foode whatsoeuer: and certaine it is, that you shall not heare of any that euer did surfeite of this Wash-brew or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lammerie; and yet I haue seene them of very daintie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12338:118"/>
and sicklie stomacks which haue eaten great quantities thereof, beyond the proportion of ordinary meates. Now for the manner of eating this meate, it is of diuers diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed; for some eate it with Honie, which is reputed the best sauce; some with Wine, either Sacke, Clarret or White; some with strong Beare or strong Ale, and some with milke, as your abilitie, or the accommodations of the place will administer. Now there is deriued from this Wash-brew another courser meate, which is as it were the dregges, or grosser substance of the Wash-brew, which is called girt-brew, which is a well filling and sufficient meate, fit for seruants and men of labour; of the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations whereof, I will not much stand, in that it is a meat of harder disiestion, and fit indeed but for strong able sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, and such whose toyle and much sweate both libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally spendeth euill humors, and also preserueth men from the offence of fulnes and surfeits.</p>
               <p>Now for the bigger kind of Oate-meale, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gerts, or Corne-Oate-meale, it is of no lesse vse then the former, nor are their fewer meates compounded thereof: for first, of these Gerts are made all sorts of Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, or Pots (as the West-countrie tearmes them) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be blacke, as those which are made of the blood of Beasts, Swine, Sheepe, Geesse, Red or Fallow Deere, or the like, mixt with whole Gerts, Suet and wholsome Hearbs: or else white, as when the Gerts are mixt with good Creame, Egges, Bread-crummes, Suet, Currans, and other wholsome Spices. Also of these Gerts are made the good Friday pudding, which is mixt with egs, milt, suet, peniroyall, &amp; boild first in a linnen bag, &amp; then stript and butterd with sweet butter. Againe, if you rost a Goose, &amp; stop her belly with whole gerts, beaten together with egs, and after mixt with the grauie, there cannot bee a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:12338:119"/>
better or more pleasanter sauce: nay, if a man bee at sea in any long trauel, he cannot eate a more wholesome and pleasant meate then these whole greetes boild in water till they burst, and then mixt with butter, and so eaten with spoones; which although sea-men call simply by the name of Loblolly, yet there is not any meate how significant soeuer the name be, that is more toothsome or wholsome. And to conclude, there is no way or purpose whatsoeuer to which a man can vse or imploy Rice: but with the same seasoning and order you may imploy the whole greetes of Oate-meale, and haue full as good and as wholesome meate, and as well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And thus much touching the nature, worth, vertues, and great necessitie of Oates and Oate-meale.</p>

                  </note>Now for the brewing of strong Ale, because it is drink of no such long lasting as Beere is, therefore you shall brew lesse quantitie at a time thereof, as two bushels of northerne measure, (which is foure bushels or half a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the South) at a brewing, and not aboue, which will make fourteene gallons of the best Ale. Now for the mashing and ordering of it in the mash-fat, it will not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing from that of beere; as for hops, although some vse not to put in any, yet the best Brewers thereof wil allow to fourteene gallons of Ale a good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Touching the brewing of Bottle-ale,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brewing of Bottle Ale.</hi>
                  </note> it differeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all from the brewing of strong Ale, onely it must be drawne in a larger proportion, as at least twentie gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of halfe a quarter; and when it comes to bee changed you shall blinke it (as was before shewed) more by much then was the strong Ale, for it must be pretty and sharpe, which giueth the life and quicknes to the Ale: and when you tun it, you shall put it into round bottles with nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row mouths, and then stopping them close with corke, set them in a cold sellar vp to the wast in sand, and be sure that the corkes be fast tied in with strong packethrid, for feare of rissing out, or taking vent, which is the vtter spoile of the ale. Now for the smal drinke arising from this bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ale, or any other beere or ale whatsoeuer, if you keep it after it is blinkt and boiled in a close vessel, and then put it to barm euery morning as you haue occasion to vse it, the drinke will drinke a great deale the fresher, and bee much more liuelie in taste.</p>

                  </note> which are drinks much vsed in the west parts, and other Countries wel sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with fruit in this kingdome; you shall know that your Perry is made of Peares only, and your Cider of Apples; and for the manner of making thereof, it is done after one fashion, that is to say, after your Peares or Apples are well pickt from stalkes, rottennesse and all manner of other filth, you shall put them in the presse mill which is made with a mil-stone running round in a circle, vnder which you shall crush your Peares or Apples, and then straining

them through a bagge of haire-cloth, tunne vp the same after it hath beene a littlr setled into Hogs-heads, Barrels and other close vessels.</p>
               <p>Now after you haue prest all, you shall saue that which is within the haire cloth bagge, and putting it into seueral vessels, put a pretty quantity of water thereunto, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath stood a day or two, and hath beene well stirred together, presse it ouer also againe, for this will make a small perry or cider, and must be spent first. Now of your best sider that which you make of your summer or sweet fruite, you shall call summer or sweet cider or perrie, and that you shall spend first also; and that which you make of the winter and hard fruite, you shall call winter and sowre cider, or perry; and that you may spend last, for it willen dure the longest.</p>
