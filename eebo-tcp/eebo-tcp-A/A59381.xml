            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from the Commissioners of the Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the Four and twentieth of <hi>Iune, 1652.</hi>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce the late Agreement at <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the Lord
of <hi>Muskerry</hi> in the south, and the Lord <hi>Clanric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card</hi>
in the north, have not onely declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
not to accept of that Capitulation, but
have gathered together considerable Bodies of the Irish
in both places; as to <hi>Clanriccard,</hi> since the reducing
of <hi>Balleshannon,</hi> Sir <hi>Charls Coot</hi> with his own and part
of Commissary General <hi>Reynolds</hi> party, have reduced
<hi>Sleigo,</hi> and since that the Commissary General is come
to him, and as we hear from the Commissary General
of the Eighteenth instant, from the Camp before <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemote,</hi>
are now before that Castle, being the Castle of
the Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> in the county of <hi>Catrim:</hi> Colonel <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables</hi>
with his Party are at <hi>Belturbet</hi> in <hi>Cavan,</hi> a place
very considerable to be made a Garrison in order to
the reducing of the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> and those Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
thereabouts; and we do believe, part of the
<hi>Leimster</hi> Forces are with <hi>Venables,</hi> or near to him; and
<hi>Clanriccard</hi> doth lie in Fastnesses between <hi>Ballimote</hi>
and <hi>Belturbet,</hi> with Four thousand Horse and Foot, but
hath refused to engage with either party of ours, but
hath sent for a Treaty, and hath sent to the Lieutenant
General and to us to appoint Commissioners, and hath
sent Articles to the Commissary General; our Answer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118363:3"/>
thereto we send inclosed, and have advised the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
General to that purpose: And <hi>Grace,</hi> another
of the Irish Rebels, hath gathered a Body of the Irish
that formerly were of the <hi>Leimster</hi> Rebels; and being
beaten from his Fastnesses in <hi>Leimster</hi> by Colonel <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Sankey,</hi> got over the <hi>Shannon</hi> and
have burnt the Town of <hi>Portumney,</hi> and threatned the
Castle of <hi>Portumney;</hi> but Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick</hi>
going to assist our Friends there, heard that
<hi>Grace</hi> had joyned with <hi>Burk,</hi> and were about <hi>Lough-Reagh,</hi>
and were about Three thousand Horse and
Foot, and so Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> fell on the Enemy;
and as we heard from Major <hi>Smith</hi> from <hi>Limerick</hi> the
Twenty second instant, That certain Intelligence was
come to him, that <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> had totally routed the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
horse &amp; foot, being got into a Bog, he had encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
the same with his Horse and Dragoons; and was
in that posture when the Messenger came from him to
<hi>Limerick.</hi> As to the Enemy with the Lord <hi>Muskerry</hi>
in <hi>Kerry,</hi> the Lieu: General and the Major General
with what Party could be spared from other Parts, are
marched to <hi>Ross,</hi> the chief Hold of the Enemy there,
and having left two Troops of Horse, one of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
and Four hundred Foot in a Fort before <hi>Ross:</hi>
The Lieutenant General with the Body of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
did the thirteenth instant meet with a Party
of the Enemy and routed them, and took some Fifty
Horse and some Prey, and Abby called <hi>Killara,</hi> where
they found some Four barrels of Powder: And in those
parts they have been till the Boats and other necessaries
sent them from <hi>Kingsale</hi> came to them; and on the
Nineteenth instant we received Letters from them, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118363:3"/>
that day they marched up with their Party to the Fort
near <hi>Ross</hi> Castle, and thither they have sent the Boats
and Provisions; but on the Eighteenth instant <hi>Musker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
sent for a New Treaty, but the Lieutenant General
hath limitted it to conclude on the One and twentieth
instant at six in the night, and in the mean time are
preparing their Boats for service; but this last Sabbath
being twentieth instant, a Party of <hi>Muskerry's</hi> Forces
having ioyned with other the Rebels Party that lie in
the Bogs and Mountains of <hi>Cork,</hi> did come into this
county to drive the Cattle about <hi>Macroom,</hi> to carry
them into their Quarters; but the Lord <hi>Broghil,</hi> who is
left behinde to secure the Quarters, after a March of
Twenty Miles, fell on the Enemy who were more then
double in number to the Lord <hi>Broghil's</hi> Party, but the
Enemy would not Engage, so as the Lord <hi>Broghil's</hi>
Party on the Rere of the Enemies Body, took
about Eighty Horse, killed about Fifty, took Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Colonel <hi>Supple</hi> that commanded the Rere-guard
of the Enemy, and got Two Colours and some good
quantity of Arms, and regained two hundred Cattel
the Enemy were carrying away, and the rest of the
Enemy by the favor of a Mist; and our Party being
much spent with a long March before the Skirmish,
and the Impassableness of those parts, could not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them above a Mile or two. Colonel <hi>Clark's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
is safely arrived at <hi>Waterford,</hi> which doth come
very seasonable to strengthen our Forces in these parts.
These Wonder-workings of our God we hope will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
glorious in your eyes, and we hope will clearly
evidence unto you the Diligence and Fidelity of your
poor Servants here, who in order to your Service are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118363:4"/>
dispersed into all parts of the Land, and yet their small
scattered Parties (through the Goodness and Help of
the Lord) have put to flight the Armies and great
Bodies of the Enemy. We shall onely adde that
we are,</p>

the high Trusts and Authorities reposed in you, that
are not to be so freely exposed to Hazards and Affronts,

Gatherings together, Authorities and Combinations,
shall go in the discharge of that Duty committed to us,
to take all Opportunities God shall please to put into
our hands, to revenge the innocent Blood that hath

Letters came to hand, which gives you an Account

            <head>Colonel Venables Letter to the Scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Master
General, of 17 Iune, 1652.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving carried on our fortification at this place
unto some good forwardness, we thought it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to be attempting upon the Enemy as our intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
should guide us, and accordingly yester-evening
Sir <hi>Theophilus Iones</hi> was designed with six Troops of
Horse and one of Dragoons, and about three hundred
commanded Foot, which were judged sufficient to
bring in some Cows (our men being in some want of
Provisions) and if any advantage offered it self to do
service upon the Enemy; he marched all night, and the
next morning the Enemy had notice of him (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth upon the same occasion with twelve hundred
Horse and Foot) and striving to gain a Pass betwixt
them and home, got betwixt a Party of ours (that had
some Cows) and him, both sides finding themselves
engaged prepared to fight; the Enemy had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of higher ground and numbers, ours of wind and
sun; the charge was very gallantly performed by the
Enemy, who disputed it with the Swords point and
push of Pike: but the Lord who ever standeth by us
in all our difficulties shewed himself a Man of War,
and by a third part of their number (many of ours
being abroad in Parties) quite brake them, there
being about three hundred of them slain, some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and Letters found with the Dead assure us, that
there was one Colonel, one Lieutenant Colonel, three
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118363:6"/>
Majors, and ten Captains slain, besides inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
We hope this will much discourage them and
cause them to disperse, however we desire unfeignedly
to bless God for the same, looking upon it as the earnest
of a greater Mercy, if the Enemy do engage, as they
absolutely affirm they will: We lost not one Officer,
and only one Lieutenant wounded, and Major <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redith</hi>
hath a slight Scar on the Chin; I cannot yet
hear of one Man of ours that was slain, but above sixty
wounded with Sword and Pike; both sides being so
eager to fight, that they had almost forgot to fire. I
have here inclosed sent you a Copy of a Letter from
<hi>Philip Mac Hughe</hi> to <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> being found in
Colonel <hi>Garret Moores</hi> Pocket, I doubt not but the
Commissioners of Parliament, will make good use of
it, I have no more to adde, save that I am,</p>

the desire, that God, not themselves, might have the
Honor; besides, all have deserved so well, that I cannot
name any but I must omit others (except I name all) that
have in their respective places behaved themselves
with Honor and Gallantry; Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones</hi> and
Major <hi>Meredith</hi> were both engaged in the midst of the
Enemy, but both are come off safe.</p>

            <p>IUst now came to my hands the certain Intelligence
of a fresh Mercy cast in by our gracious Father:
A Party commanded by Colonel <hi>Abbot</hi> sent from
Colonel <hi>Sankey,</hi> joyned with a Party from <hi>Limerick,</hi>
commanded, as I am informed, by Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi>
fell upon <hi>Grace</hi> and others joyned with him, and killed
and took full One thousand, some Intelligence saith
One thousand was slain; but if it be so many slain and
taken, it is an exceeding Mercy, and so much you may
believe to be true; so soon as the Particulars come, I
shall present them to you: I dispatched a large Packet
this day by a Party of Horse, some of them came
from <hi>England,</hi> others were brought from <hi>Dublin</hi> by a
Footman, who would not deliver them but against his
will, he is gone with them to get Answer. I am</p>

            <head>Major Smiths Letter to the Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear and therefore much Honored,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOurs of the One and twentieth instant I have
received; the good news therein I heartily bless
God with you for; I shall, God willing, faithfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what hath been hinted in your Honors Letter:
Just now I have received a Letter from Colonel <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldsby,</hi>
who is on his march from <hi>Loughreagh,</hi> and he
is bearing his Sheaves, blessed be God, who doth still
appear for us in all places: He lighted on <hi>Graces</hi> Party
in a great hastiness after he was beaten off from <hi>Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reagh,</hi>
which he attempted to storm, but missed, and
left there about Eighty men, but Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby's</hi>
Party disputed the Pass into the Fastness as abovesaid
near half an hour, which was justified with Twelve
hundred Foot and One hundred and fifty Horse of the
Enemies; but at length forced them, and killed upwards
of two hundred, about sixty Horse taken, <hi>Grace</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
escaped over the <hi>Shannon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Redman Hurk</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Mac Gawly</hi> are killed and some other field
Officers, besides six or seven Captains, some few Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
were taken, which are with Colonel <hi>Abbot</hi> to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;
we lost but three more that we can yet here of,
and nine Dragoons wounded with some few Troopers.
I trust these renued Mercies will be renewed Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on all our hearts, to be more through, and close,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118363:8"/>
and upright hearted with our God, who is dayly seen in
the Mount; may it please you to take notice that we
are exceedingly straightned, in doing many things of
high importance to your Affaires in this Place for want
of Incident Money, as for Lading and Unlading
Ships, for fitting some little Friggots and Boats that
we have constant use for on the <hi>Shannon.</hi> I hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these two dayes fifteen hundred Irish will be shipped
for <hi>Spain,</hi> which we have had much ado to furnish with
a Moneths pay given there by their Articles, and
have wholly undone the County of <hi>Clare</hi> for that end;
so that it is not possible for your Forces to get the one
third of the eight hundred pounds <hi>per Mensem</hi> laid on
that County; the people dye under every Hedge there,
and is the saddest place (reported by all that are there)
as ever was seen, the good Lord help your Honors to
be sensible thereof, and carry you on in the undergoing
the great burthen laid on you; give me leave to tell you
that my heart is much drawn out (without any vanity
I speak it) to bless God for you, that he hath endued
you with Zeal and Unweariedness, Faith, Tenderness,
and Conscieous of doing the work of the Lord, which I
am Confident all Godly ones shall in due time have
their Mouthes filled with praise to the name of their
God; Sir, pardon I beseech you my prolixity, my
heart is full,</p>
