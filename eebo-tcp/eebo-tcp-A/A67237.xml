            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I know not whether any of you may be convinc'd or no; yet, at the least, I am desirous (as never affecting Fire-side or Table-disputes of this Nature) to let you see, upon what Grounds my Judgment leads me to stand off from you, in those Principles, which admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster sad occasions of Contention to all the (Christian) World, and wherein only, you can, at any time, be disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto him, who is</p>

                  <hi>YOU</hi> have now spent a Lustre and an half, or thereabout, in that Adventurous Calling, which hath let you see the Wonders of the Deep; and acquainted you with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably various Dispositions and Customs of several People and Places: <hi>It</hi> has been a Joy to my self, with many others of your Friends and Well-wishers, to hear that in your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments abroad, you have gone through much, both with Reputation and Success. <hi>Of</hi> late a Rumour (for I would not willingly think it any more) hath arrived here, as if you should have made Shipwrack of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not past <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis</hi> in safety, without drinking in, or rather being swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of, the <hi>Italian</hi> Delusions.</p>

                  <hi>I am</hi> no affector of scurrilous or foul Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; yet, if I should enquire of you, with what deceitful tincture that <hi>Roman</hi> Curtizan

had washt over her Deformities so, as you could become inamoured on her, the nature of her Apostasie would, perhaps, justifie the Term. <hi>I</hi> shall endeavour in this Address, to wipe off the Varnish (whereby, I know well, she allures a great Part of the Prejudiced or Interessed World) and discover to you Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of too large a Size to pass for Beauty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And,</hi> whilst I declare unto you what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations they were, which, by God's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, removed out of my way all those stumbl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blocks that I found cast in it, and whereby I was reduced into the right Paths, even when my feet had almost slipt; <hi>I</hi> do humbly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the Father of Mercies, That it may please him to inable you, and all that desire to seek him in Truth, to see through the dark Mist which Popery draws before the eyes of its Proselytes, stuffing the Phancies even of her Babes and Sucklings (in stead of wholsom food drawn from the sincere Milk of God's Word) with I know not what Conceits of <hi>Romes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie, Perspicuity, Succession, Supremacy, Perpetuity</hi> and the like, till she have brought them under a gross and blind Submission to all her Dictates; and, before they understand things that differ, made them ready <hi>to swear</hi> to all the words of that most Imperious Mistress.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> let us remember we are advised to be able to give a reason of the Faith that is in us; and take Courage to Examine how sufficient the Foundation is, whereupon the Church of <hi>RomÃ¨</hi> would build so vast a Claim to Perpetual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from Error, and fix the Pillars of Truth within her Territories only: <hi>Yet first</hi> I think it necessary to desire you not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the Animadversions I offer you, because they are transmitted from an hand which you know weak and insufficient for the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. There is here little of mine besides what is, indeed, the only Culpable part, the Composure, or lying together; the Materials being decerped from many Learned and Pious Authours, who now, most of them, rest from their Labours, and enjoy that Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which they strove for in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations.</p>

                  <hi>When</hi> did the great Disposer of all things devest himself of that Prerogative, whereby he usually punisheth the sins of any Nation, by removing his Candlestick from thence? Doth not the very appellation of Catholick (given to the Gospel Church, in opposition to that Administration, whereby it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the Pale of the Jews Synagogue) strongly intimate, That all the Climates of the World are equally Gods Temple? What reason I pray to terminate all the Promises at <hi>Rome?</hi> If you will argue, as I know those of that Communion do, from the words of our Saviour to St. <hi>Peter, Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Quaere</hi> will arise, Whether the Promise relate to <hi>Peter's</hi> preceding words, which had newly poynted out the Chief Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Stone; Or, whether the Design of it were to fasten an Infallibility of Judgment, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon <hi>Peter,</hi> but to convey it even to his Heirs and Successors till the end of time? <hi>It

               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> for the solving of your doubt; We willingly do acknowledge, That at <hi>Rome</hi> there was a very early and famous Church; her Faith was spoken of through the whole World: And when it pleased God by the Conversion of the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> to clear a way for the farther Increment of the Gospel, she grew in Eminency and Splendour; till over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, as it were, with the Indulgence and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of him and some of his Successors, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to recoyl, and study Grandeur, more than Grace. <hi>We</hi> do not imagine that all in one day, or year, or age, she became so infected, that it was presently necessary to separate from her: But we think the manner of her Defection was well foreshewen (and perhaps aimed at) in that Parable of the Tares, injected by night, and hardly discerned in their growth; yet increasing still, as the Negligence, Avarice or Ambition of the Priests and People did serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an opportunity. <hi>Thus,</hi> the Wisdom of the Primitive Church, dispensing her <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,</hi> her <hi>Suspensions, Excommunications,</hi> her <hi>Pennances, Relaxations, Absolutions,</hi> &amp;c. in such manner as the Condition of her refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, or penitent, Delinquents might require, (things conducing meerly to the outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101827:8"/>
&amp; Discipline of those times) degenerated at last into such Conceits, as kindled the Fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and gave birth to <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi> prodigally extended to whole Families and their Descendants, for many Ages yet to come: And by this means were the Purses, in a manner, of the whole World opened, and their owners made inclinable to pour out their Treasure into the Popes Lap. <hi>For,</hi> who would not, both easily be perswaded to taste the tempting Sweets of Sin here, and to part with a good proportion of his worldly Goods at his death, under the Notion of bringing so much health to the Estate of his Soul in the next Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus</hi> the Stile which the Ancient Fathers thought fit to use when they<note place="margin">The Authors of <hi>France</hi> painted to the life, pag. 16.</note> treated of the Lords Supper, wherein they often held to the Tropes and Metaphors of the Institution, was at length perverted into the opinion of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> a <hi>Pyx</hi> commanded to be made for a Cover to the Bread, and a <hi>Bell</hi> to ring before it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1215. <hi>Adoration</hi> of it enjoyned, <hi>Anno</hi> 1226. <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Day instituted, <hi>Anno</hi> 1264. and further confirmed in the Council of <hi>Vienna, Anno</hi> 1310. <hi>All</hi> which served well to settle in the people a greater Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration towards the Workers of such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, the Priests. And that such a thing was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101827:9"/>
much in the business may surely seem not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable to any, that will impartially Eye the Posture and Inclination of those times, <note n="*" place="margin">For if ordinary Priests could do such things; what submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions could be thought enough, towards the supreme Bishop, as Men were then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to call him. <hi>Ep. fol. 885.</hi>

Prophet, with an assurance, That there were seven thousand who had not bowed the knee unto <hi>Baal,</hi> would have been at a sore loss. <hi>And,</hi> however those who sat in <hi>Moses's</hi> Chair had, at our Saviour's Coming, made the Law of God of none effect by their Traditions; yet many believed on him (old <hi>Simeon, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> &amp;c.) who Communicated in the outward Sacraments, and Discipline of the Church, but were the Flock of another Fold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will reply</hi> here, perhaps, The Word of God is large in Promises concerning the great Extent, and flocking of the Gentiles to the Church of Christ. <hi>How</hi> are they fulfill'd? The very taking down the Partition-Wall, when the whole World was cried free to come to God; and the enlarging of the Churches Bounds (till then impaled within the Confines of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) even to as many as the Lord our God shall (before his second Coming) call, was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very glorious Work, and the main end of such Predictions. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms the Gospel to have, in his time, been preached to every Creature under Heaven; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there was grand access to the Church by the Labours of the Apostles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors: <hi>Yet</hi> we are told of a <hi>Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> beginning to Creep even then; and ought not to forget, that we are fore-warned of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101827:10"/>
season, when the Woman was to be forced into the Wilderness. The Estate of the Church is like that of the Moon, sometimes in the Wane, and sometimes, by God's permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, suffering grievous Eclipses: but since by his goodness she can again, at other seasons, elevate her head, the Gates of Hell cannot be said to have prevailed against her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> let me intreat you to put one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to those ne'er-erring Doctors; and, if they give you a positive Answer, it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to take more of<note place="margin">Strongly disputed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, as may be seen in <hi>Bellarmine de Concil. &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

                  </note> they are at variance amongst themselves.

                  <hi>ALthough</hi> it be an old received Truth; That Discords in Religion are the most bitter, and for the most part prosecuted with most violence; I shall desire to contract, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than widen, the Differences betwixt us; and (leaving the Out-works which fortifie our Cause in other points we hold in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to stand a while upon their own Guard) set my self, at present, to the defence of that which is most oppugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Papists, against which the Jesuites have raised their fiercest Batteries; I mean our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Justification.</hi> Our answers are so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant in the first <hi>Quaere,</hi> that, one would think we were almost agreed, and Dispute at an end; for this Maxim is, as I conceive, imbraced on both sides, <hi>We <hi>are saved by Grace.</hi> But,</hi> alas! they have framed such strange Comments, and affixed so perverse a Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the nature of their Grace, as will, and must needs, keep us at a grand and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual distance: <note n="*" place="margin">With them, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to perform, in our own persons (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have received to believe the Word of God) such obedience to the Law, as, for that, we become righteous, and deserve, by equal Compensation, the Kingdom of Heaven.</note> Forasmuch as I have observed most of the Objections brought in against
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101827:14"/>
us, to arise merely from a mis-understanding of that Faith to which only we dare trust our Justification; I will in the first Place sub-joyn it's Nature and Office in three Propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Faith we desire to establish, is not a bare Opinion, is not a mere Notion, but it is <hi>a Grace, a purifying, a cleansing, reforming Grace of God's Spirit.</hi> And though the Principal and main Act of Faith be an <hi>Accepting, Receiving</hi> and <hi>Resting upon</hi> Christ alone for Justification, by vertue of the Covenant; Yet they who are Effectually called and Regenerate, have a new heart Created in them, and are farther Really and Personally sanctified; the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the whole Body of Sin destroyed, the several Lusts thereof by degrees mortified; and they more and more strengthned in all saving Graces to the practice of true <hi>holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. <hi>Nor</hi>
                  </hi> do we say that good Works done by such an one are, of their own Nature, sins (as we are slanderously reported to do;) No, so far as they are good, they are the Product of God's own Spirit, and he approves them: But because of a mixture of Imperfections, adhering to the best of men, in this Life, and their Works; <hi>We</hi> think they are no better than the Reeds of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which if a man lean on them, with hopes of Justice from them, will break and wound his sides. <hi>We</hi> are Justified by Faith alone
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101827:15"/>
without Works; Not that Works are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Faith, or can be; But only exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Act of Justifying. A<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Allen.</note> Dead Faith cannot Justifie; a Living Faith cannot be Idle. The Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Works is Certain, their Agreement Amiable, in the Life of one Justified: Yet their Contrariety irreconcileable in the procurement of Justification. Those terms<note place="margin">Justifying Faith is, When a man does, practically, believe the two great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 6. of <hi>Justifying the Ungodly,</hi> and of <hi>Imputing Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness without Works,</hi> are not so to be taken, as if God ever did, or ever would, save any Person, who resolved to continue impious, or contemn the practice of good Works; but they stand in opposition to all conceit of any Justifying power in good Works; and may teach us, That no man's holiness can be such in this Life, but he will at God's Tribunal, stand in need of that Covering, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> fetcheth out of the 32. <hi>Psal.</hi> and points out to us in ver. 7. Ponder too ver. 8. and tell me then, whether you can conceal from your self the whole Plat-form of the Protestant Doctrine in this point: For, the not Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sins, and the Imputing of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness without Works, make up the Whole of our Belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:101827:15"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> a Sinner is not Justified by Faith, as it is a Quality which deserves remission of Guilt, and the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle in the terms of, <hi>toward God Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith toward Christ,</hi> clearly points out this Office of Faith, <hi>Acts 20. 21.</hi>
                  </note> nor as it is by God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance, taken for the whole and perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the Law; But it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies only with reference to its Object Christ; Faith being that Grace which the Soul makes use of to close in with him, receive, and imbrace the Promises; by it we are ingrafted into that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-tree,<note place="margin">It's strange how those that hold a Treasury of Saints Merits, can term our Doctrine of Imputation an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Speculation: For, Is there a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Members one with another, and not with the Head?</note> and are made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that glorious Head. We do not here (as some traduce us) erect a Justification merely supposititious; or state, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and the Believer, only an imaginary Relation; But we hold the Interest we have in him to be of most real and true Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; Forasmuch as (having by God's effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and gratious Ordination, taken upon him the Humane Nature, so entirely put on) he communicates (by vertue of the Mystical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion through the Covenant, whereto God the Father, the Son, and Man, are Parties) really, his Satisfaction and Merits to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31.

               <p>
                  <hi>Let</hi> but Faith be <hi>the Substance of things hoped for, the Evidence of things un-seen;</hi> whereby we Receive and Imbrace, as well as are Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of, the Promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Suffer us but to draw Consolation, by laying hold on the Hope set before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. Let it be an Eying of Christ offering his Body, shedding his Blood, and fulfilling the Law perfectly, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> speaks in the Homilies of Salvation, very clearly; Let it be a Fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Recumbence upon our Saviour in his whole Mediatorial Office; which is, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our Duty, as well as Privilege; And we desire no more. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The <hi>Free Gift,</hi>
                  </hi> which is said to come upon all men to the Justification of Life, is held forth as the immediate Consequence and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that exact and complete Justice which was in our Saviour Christ only, and the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <item>2. <hi>The Righteousness</hi> wherewith we shall be clothed in the World to come, is both Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Inherent. The former in Christ, the latter in us.</item>

               <p>

                  <item>1. <hi>Justificatio apprehensiva,</hi> called often Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, is not properly Justification, but an apprehension or knowledge of it.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Justificatio Effectiva,</hi> termed Causal Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, none but Christ can have a Claim unto.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Justificatio declarativa</hi> is by St. <hi>James</hi> sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Justifying by Works, as it is the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or testimony of true Conversion.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus</hi> those Scriptures do sweetly agree, which say we are Justified, sometimes by Grace, sometimes by Faith, sometimes by Christ; and, that once, by Works. <hi>Let us do Evil that Good may come thereof,</hi> Rom. 6. 1. was the Devil's Rhetorick, in the mouths of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men, to bring an obloquie upon St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Doctrine of free Grace: But, doubtless, Satan is a more cunning Sophister than to frame
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101827:17"/>
an Argument of so much Inconsequence as to say, Continue in Sin, that inherent Grace may abound. Whence I think, we may, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably, conclude, That nothing else is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the preceding Discourse, but the Gracious Act of Almighty God, whereby he absolves a believing Sinner at the Tribunal of his Justice, Pronouncing him Righteous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting, and accepting him to Glory only for Christ's sake. Thus when he had assigned to sin, its proper Effect, due Wages, and Merit, Death; coming to speak of Life Eternal, we find no such terms in his mouth; but he sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cuts off the File of his<note place="margin">How insincerely the the Rhemists do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this place see in Dr. <hi>Fulk.</hi>

                     </gap>, The Free Gift</hi> of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. There is Justification by Remission of Sins; there is Justification, by having the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law fulfilled in us; there is the Justification of Life, or the Receiving that Crown of Life. All these are laid up in the Person of Christ for the use of his Church; and brought home to every true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by the hand of Faith. There is, too, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Sort of Justification, <hi>viz.</hi> At the Bar of Conscience, and in <hi>Foro Humano,</hi> by Works of Righteousness which we are to do, <hi>after the Pattern,</hi> but cannot do <hi>up to the measure</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Mount; not <hi>for</hi> these, nor yet <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

                  <hi>This</hi> Confession, or rather Complaint, of the Jesuite, might save us a labour of culling out the Testimonies of such Learned men as, even
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101827:20"/>
through the Umbrage of Popery, had Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pses of so pure a Truth; since he grants, That if our Works (<hi>before</hi> or without<note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> the Promise, Covenant, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, of God) were <hi>not worthy;</hi> and (<hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> such promise) became <hi>worthy;</hi> it would thence follow, That to this Dignification, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Promise, the Application and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Christ's Merits must, of necessity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene: A thing, it seems, he is afraid to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. <hi>We</hi> are thus far of <hi>Vasquez</hi> his mind, rather than of those other <hi>Romanists;</hi> That the Promise of God does not affix any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity to the Works of the Regenerate, by changing their Quality, so as to render them, in themselves Meritorious: but whereas he will have them not need such Indulgence, we know they need much more; and the Tenour of God's Promise to be this, That he will look upon Christ, our Mediatour (who is <hi>the End</hi> (or chief aim) <hi>of the Law,</hi> Rom. 10. 4. for it was given with a Design to drive us to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. and is <hi>a Yoak, which we nor our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to bear,</hi> Acts 15. 10.) and (in Contemplation of that Righteousness he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in our Nature, for us) by vertue of the Covenant of Grace, deal with us and our Works, so as the Imperfections, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and bewail in them, shall never come in sight. Well-fare those men, (if they

can) for the Condignity of their Services: It is enough for us (under the sense of the Skars and Blemishes in our, too often, lame Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to look up to the Hills, from whence cometh our Help; and to shelter our selves under his Feathers who hath Healing in his Wings.</p>

                  <hi>And</hi> therefore, waving them; the next Point wherein I shall endeavour, if it may so please God, to rectifie your Judgment, is that much Controverted business of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Which are <hi>visible Signs of invisible Grace given, and conferred unto us; Instituted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101827:26"/>
by Christ himself, and ordained to be a means to Receive, and a Seal to Confirm the same.</hi> Let us review this Definition, and draw from it some Observations in the words of a Learned Author. <hi>Many</hi> things do here<note place="margin">The. <hi>Trent</hi> Faith is, That Sacraments cause Grace, not by the Devotion of him that worketh, nor of him that receives the work, but by virtue of the work it self, <hi>Hist. of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> fol. 230.</note> occurr, which require a deep and serious Consideration by those who desire throughly to understand the Nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential parts of Sacraments: For first, there must be a <hi>Conferrence of Grace,</hi> of which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are termed <hi>Seals:</hi> (yet this Conferrence of Grace, is not causatively, but instrumentally, not Physically, but Metaphysically in them.) Therefore those are not properly Sacraments, which relate to any thing but matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. By this Argument is <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matrimony<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </note> excluded from the List, as not being in it self considered a Religious Work, neither is any Grace at all conferred or exhibited thereby. So that (though Marriage doth <hi>Legitimate</hi> many) one may say, it self is but a <hi>Bastard</hi> Sacrament.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Next,</hi> these Signs of Grace ought to be <hi>subject to the Senses:</hi> For so it seemed good to God, by sensible and external things, to lead by the hand, as it were, us who, for the most part, live by sense, towards Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, Internal and Spiritual matters: They
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101827:26"/>
must, farther, be visible and subject to the Eyes; Hence <hi>Absolution</hi> and <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Absolution <hi>and</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</note> cannot fall within the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sacraments, not having any visible Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Material Sign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They are said to be <hi>ordained,</hi> and <hi>instituted by Christ:</hi> Signs they are by the Institution of him, and not of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; He only, who created the Elements, can by his word make of them Sacraments: nor is it from the choice of Men that the Signs become Sacraments; but by the Ordinance of God, who super-added the word to the sign. The Relation is mutual, betwixt the Word and the Sign, as betwixt the Form and the Matter. The Word as the Form, the Sign as the Matter: Conjoyn them, and they are a Sacrament: By the Word we are to understand the Mandate of Christ, enjoyning us to use them, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect spiritual Grace thereby. <hi>So</hi> we think, we have good right to root out the other two, and whole five supernumerary Sacraments: since <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Confirmation <hi>and</hi> Extreme Unction <hi>no</hi> Sacraments.</note> have, indeed, the Element but, wanting the Word, ought not to be accounted Sacraments; since <hi>Absolution</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> have no Element; since <hi>Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> has no promise of Grace. <hi>And</hi> thus we may more than ghess at the just number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wherefore laying aside the Supposititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101827:27"/>
we find but two Sacraments of the Gospel, <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>

                  <hi>Yet</hi> first I will give you in a few places out of the Fathers which speak my very thoughts, to the full, as to this point. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> askes; <hi>What Scripture hath delivered any thing concerning this?

                  </hi> Mary <hi>be in honour; but let the Father, Son and holy Ghost be worshipped: This Mystery is appointed, I do not say for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor for a man, but for God: <hi>The</hi> Angels themselves are not capable of such kind of glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Although</hi> Mary <hi>be most excellent, and holy, and to be honoured, yet she is not to be worshipped; the Virgin, indeed, was a Virgin, and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not given unto us for Adoration,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>WHat</hi> hath been said, as to the <hi>Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints,</hi> will necessarily lead us on to make some Enquiries into the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Adoration of Images;</hi> a Practice, which seeing it is every where spoken against in the Old Testament, and has not so much as one syllable to countenance it in the New, we may justly wonder, how it could gain so much ground, even as to set a foot on, in the Christian Church; especially since the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Champions and Defenders of the Faith did so strenuously oppose it.</p>

                  <hi>If yet</hi> you will plead for the use of Images, as not Worshiping them, but God, or the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101827:38"/>
Saint they do represent; and argue for them, under the Notion of instructing the ignorant by the Eye: Be intreated to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what has already been said, doth not quite overthrow that end; and whether, in the Judgments of those, whose sentence we have laid before you, the Ignorant would not be in more peril of Idolatry by them, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. <hi>Indeed</hi> they had never been tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated so much as they were, unless they had crept in by that pretence of being Lay-mens Books; but, because they proved rather their bane, they are, with Justice enough, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>There</hi> is one Consideration which relates to our Saviour alone, from whence I cannot but think it's very absurd to make his Image. <hi>As</hi> he is to us a <hi>Jesus,</hi> it was necessary to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite both the Natures, Divine and Humane; Why then should we hold it convenient, to fix him before our eyes, and consequently in our minds, by halfs, when we go to speak to him, to perform his Office of Mediator to the Father for us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Custom of representing God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like an old Man, is so gross, as, I hope, you will not put me to disprove it; If you do, I shall only mind you, <hi>It was he</hi> asked <hi>Moses,</hi> whether he had seen any Image in the Mount, and so left him with <hi>Cave ne facias.</hi>

                  <hi>Our</hi> Saviour Christ's <hi>Satisfaction</hi> takes in the common Lump of Humane Nature, making it capable of redintegration with God, and a fit subject for mercy; a thing denied to the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels, whose Nature he assumed not; and, without which, none of Humane race, no more than they, had been within possibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His <hi>Intercession</hi> (that other part of his Priestly Office) makes particular application of that benefit, and brings it home to those the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given him, even to as many as the Lord our God shall effectually Call. These know, they are to give him the Glory of his Works in them and for them: whilest those that are left to their own devices know too, they justly suffer (for those wickednesses they have adhered to, and perpetrated of their own accord, and with full bent of Will, so as they must needs say, <hi>Ex me perditio mea,</hi> Hosea 13. 9.) Let those whom this will not satisfie, ponder what is written for their learning, and to stop their mouths, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>We</hi> willingly grant, we are so much dissatisfied with their Doctrine of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> which they place in <hi>inherent</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, that we think we do well when

we oppose it in the first Seeds thereof, the opinion of <hi>Free-will.</hi> Is it not enough to say, that when God hath, in the first Act of Conversion, made the Will free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by quickning, enabling, rectifying, reforming it, then it acts, and operates, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its true, proper, and original Principles, in some good measure, and is, forthwith, not meerly passive? Or must we hold, that he only proposes to the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Will of Man, the choice of Life, or Death, and leaves him room<note place="margin">Man is not active but passive in rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: In repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance man is the doer, complies with God in it, and turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Ephes. 2. 1.

Or shall we take out of the Crown of the Almighty's Prerogative, so fair a Flower as that of Election, by saying, He offereth the means of Salvation alike, to all, both in their sufficiency and efficacy? <hi>UUe</hi> all know that Man is not drawn up to Heaven (as the bulk of a Tree from the place where it grew, with a Team and strength of Oxen) by the Cords of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute

Violence; We think<note place="margin">That power of God which subjects a man to Christ, comes not by moral perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, or violent impulses; but is tempered to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Will.</note> not, that God so compels him to come in, as he has (through the whole) neither Sense, nor Motion, or acts not in the Duty: But we say with Saint <hi>Augustine: To will, God works without us;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de gratia &amp; libero arbitr. cap. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>but when we do will, and so will that we Act, God co-works with us. <hi>UUe</hi>
                  </hi> say not that any is made a Believer without Free-will; yet are we made Believers only by his Grace that freed the Will. We do not absolutely deny the freeness of the Will; but we deny that the Will is free of it self. For, whether out of a true Judgement it move one way, or out of a false another; yet, in both, it moves naturally, in a manner sutable to its own Condition; either as depraved in it self; or freed by God's effectual Operation. Those very things which he himself works in the Soul, he produceth in it by such Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Threats, Expostulations and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, as are sutable unto, and fit to move a rational Creature, and make the Will follow without Constraint. For that power of God which subjects a man to Christ, comes not by moral Perswasion only, nor yet by violent Impulses; but is sweetly tempered to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101827:47"/>
of the Will it self; which is so drawn with these Cords, as that it cannot resist, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot but yield. <hi>None</hi> of those Scriptures (usually brought in opposition) are such Conditions, whose Effects stand deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable by Man himself: but they are such Motives as God makes instrumental, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his own purposes, and manuduct us to our Duties. This obviates all contrary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, drawn from some passages in holy Writ, clearly reconciles those with other parts of the same undoubted Verity (unpossible to be done by any other Doctrine;) and ascribes most Glory to God, bottoming all our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing only in him, wherein there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Mr. <hi>Gery,</hi> a late Writer, explicates this in a fivefold Order.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, <hi>saith he,</hi> though we have no power, now, to turn, since we are fallen in our first Parent, yet he, and we in his loins, might have stood: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's no Severity in God to require that at our hands, which he once gave us, both a Command, and power to do.</item>
                  <item>2. God's Commands, as (since that) directed to us, do not alway import what we can do, but what we should; they do not argue, ever, our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but our duty.</item>
                  <item>3. God requires it, though we cannot perform it of our selves, to put us in mind of craving his Aide.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:101827:48"/>4. God's end in this proceeding is to excite us to joyn in with such Means as are by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conducible and available thereunto.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly and lastly, such Commands aim not only at our first Conversion; but at our secondary and subsequent returns to God, upon our prevarications from him, and after the first Infusion of his Grace; when, we grant, the Will hath some power and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to co-operate, but not at all before.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>They</hi> who would introduce that Free-Will, which will not down with us, besides many other pernitious Consequences, put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves a necessity of holding; That sufficient Means is afforded to all, whereby they may come to Salvation if they list: than which, what can be uttered more alien to Truth? For, how great a part of the World do we know not to have any Means at all; not any, either <hi>Notional</hi> as to the Adult, or <hi>Foederal</hi> Interest as to <hi>Infants,</hi> amongst them. <hi>If you</hi> admit of Original Sin ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Guilt, or Contagion it brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind, we have there a sufficient ground for God's Election of some, and Derelicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others; since the whole Lump being equally subject to Wrath, it's Mercy and mere Grace that saves any. If you deny it, why are Children, who have not yet sinned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Similitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, subject to Death, which had never
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101827:48"/>
invaded the world, but for sin? I use St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of arguing, in a Case much like this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13, 14. where he proves the Obligatory power of the Law to antecede the promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by <hi>Moses,</hi> from this very ground: Or, how would such children be under a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Regeneration, as all are declared to be? <hi>John</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>But,</hi> if it be true, as needs it must, even by this last proof, That we have a delinquencie and vitiousness of Nature too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, even from, and in the Womb; How can the Will be free to any thing but evil, till it be healed, rectified, and made-a-new by God. There is no hope, that a sinner of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, no nor by any arguments (and, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the Papists with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Gurnal's Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in Compleat Armour, <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 526, 527. 530.</note> allow to the Grace of Vocation no more but a Moral Swasion, or probable inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Will, which they say, the outward preaching of the words may effect) should be won over to like the Motion that Christ makes, so long as the ground of the dislike remains in Man's earthly, sensual, and devilish Nature, <hi>James</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> therefore, God, by his Spirit, makes approach to the <hi>Understanding,</hi> and on it puts forth an Act of <hi>Illumination;</hi> he beats out a Window in the Soul, and lets in light from Heaven, renewing the spirit of the mind in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101827:49"/>
knowledge, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 23. with <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> an Act of <hi>Conviction,</hi> which is a reflection of that light, formerly wrought, in the Understanding upon the Conscience: by it we feel the weight and force of those Truths we know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> an Act of <hi>Renovation,</hi> whereby he doth both powerfully and sweetly incline the Will to accept of Christ, and to make a free, deliberate choice of him: without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, other than such, as wherewith the Soul cannot chuse but most willingly go along. And certainly, they stand upon very hard terms with God Almighty, who are loth to ascribe to him as much as this comes to, in a work which is not brought to pass without his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and mighty Power, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>And</hi> take the sum of all, that I desire should be lookt at as my belief, in reference to those points here touched, from no less Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox a Pen than St. <hi>Augustins: <hi>Many</hi> hear the Word of Truth,</hi>

                  <hi>but some believe, others do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict. Therefore these have a will to believe, the others have not. Who is ignorant of this? who would deny it? But seeing the Will is to some prepared by the Lord, to others not; We are to discern what doth proceed from his Mercie, and what from his judgement.</hi> That which Israel did seek, <hi>saith the Apostle,</hi> he obtained not: but

Indeed the fulness of perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is more commended, than commanded: It is not absolutely necessary to the very being of a Christian, but it is of great importance to his well-being. <hi>It's</hi> not an absolute Precept, but a gracious privilege: without it a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may dye well; but without it he cannot dye so comfortably: Neither, if he seek it right, can he be too covetous of it. <hi>What</hi> if some vain persons, by a preposterous haste (never staying to take in truly those Principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Ladder is framed that should help them to ascend) will yet pretend to have reach'd the top of this excellent knowledge, (which is too hard for the most, yea, scarce atteined by any, but after long experiences of the ways of God) if such will needs perish in, because they are, no better than players with, these flames? <hi>Shall,</hi> for this, the Doctrine of the Saints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance be thought criminal? without which I cannot see, how in certain cases and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, any Balm can be found that's likely to heal a wounded Conscience. Every one that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101827:51"/>
has been present at the pressing of this Point, might hear the Preacher say, In seeking after the Grace of Assurance, you must not begin where God begins, but where God ends; you must not begin at the root to find the branch, but by the branch and fruit to descry the root; you must not, at first dash, eye Gods Decree in Predestination, but through Regeneration take view of, and judge your interest. The truth is; He that will not believe, until<note place="margin">A late Treatise pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy.</hi>
                  </note> he reads Gods Decree in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, must never look for any assurance of Heaven here, nor fruition of it hereafter. It's more possible for the Sun to co-habit with undissolved Ice, than for true Faith to lodge in an heart hardned to sin: Every right Believer applies Christ to himself, and himself to Christ; the Promises to himself, and himself to the Condition of those Promises. If thy hearing of free-Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. of Gods good pleasure to give thee a Kingdom, and of his promise to keep thee by his power, through Faith unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13. make thee not to stand in awe, and not sin, because his Mercy is great; thou hast not yet, either part or share in any of them. But if upon good and infallible grounds, thou hast arrived at the blessed knowledge, that God in Christ is at peace with thee; yet take heed of slipping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101827:52"/>
sin, or growing careless of duty; lest he hide the light of his Countenance, withdraw from thee the Testimony of his Spirit (that main part of thine evidence) and leave thee to roar day and night, for the very disquietness of thy Soul, till thou becomest like a Pelican in the Wilderness, or an Owl in the Desert. If such a Night of Desertion come, if a dark cloud be quite drawn over thy once-enjoyed comforts, thou wilt soon confess, thy best pleasing, or most gainful sin, to have been full dear bought, and that sweet condition of peace and joy in believing far to fetch. So that thy self shall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after, be a witness, That the Doctrine of Perseverance, rightly understood, brings along with it, what is as proper to the repelling of sin, as it is to the establishing of Consolation: Since the fear of losing Gods favourable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, hath something more of terrible in it, than the unconverted, who never had any feeling of such matter, can apprehend.</p>

                  <hi>HAving</hi> made some reflections upon those words of yours, when in our last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course (we rambled over many things very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodically) you named a great and pious Doctor of the Protestant<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctor</hi> Sibbs <hi>at</hi> Grays-<hi>Inn Chappel.</hi>
                  </note> Church, who, from the Pulpit, had long since told you; that the difference betwixt the Papists and us lay principally in this, That we believed not so much as they. So great an inadvertencie was then upon me, that I made but little reply, not indeed reaching so far as to deduce any objection which might concern us, from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors words; nor, I dare answer for him, did he dream of such an acception of them, as might represent the choice betwixt the Religions any way indifferent. But by the manner of your speech I have since conjectured, you perhaps thought there might be some weight in a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which would flow from the assertion, as if they went beyond us in credible things; or that our belief, consisting more in Negatives, were not sure, but it might come short of what it ought to be; whilst theirs, taking in all, might be look'd upon as safe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I hope</hi> the former Letters, if you please to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101827:53"/>
re-view them, will give you some satisfaction, and may serve to demonstrate that we, who dare not go beyond the Pillars set up by God himself, in the holy Scriptures, to bound our Faith, are in a far safer way and posture, than they who leap over, or trample them down at their pleasures; <hi>And,</hi> that if we leave not them till they forsake the guidance of Gods Word, and primitive practice of his Church, we run no hazard at all, nor ought to find less esteem upon that score; but do indeed shun and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the danger of Will-worship, than which there is nothing more prejudicial to man, nor more displeasing to God, because of ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his Truth.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>We do know,</hi> That no man is made a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever without a freeness of Will; that is, he is not drawn up to Heaven, whether he will or no, and all along by meer compulsion, or without acting in the Duty (as the Papists, with other adversaries of the Protestant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, seem to mistake us:) But he is made a Believer, by Gods Grace, that frees the Will, and inables it to act according to the motions of the Spirit, and to follow him in the way of his Precepts, Promises, Threats and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>But, we acknowledge not,</hi> That the will of man (on which, in its natural capacity, the Apostle <hi>James</hi> hath fixt the Appellations of <hi>Sensual</hi> and <hi>Devilish</hi>) can of it self, chuse the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101827:53"/>
better part, being only help'd forward by some perswasions, or probable inclinations, such as the outward Preaching of the Word may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, till God by an act of Renovation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compulsion, other than such as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Soul cannot chuse but willingly go along (so sweetly are his operations tempered and suitable to the disposition of the Will) hath brought to pass a work, which never would be effected, but by his exceeding great and mighty power. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>We do know,</hi> That in the Lords-supper all Christ, with all the benefits of his Life and Passion, are (not barely represented but) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly, yet spiritually exhibited to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faithful, Penitent, Humble, Charitable Communicant. <hi>But we acknowledge not,</hi> That all Receivers do, in a corporal and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner (<hi>John</hi> 7. 37, 38.) tear their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer with their teeth; since the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal way of locution in the Old Testament leads us to the true understanding of <hi>This is my body,</hi> in the New. Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10, 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. with <hi>John</hi> 6. 47, 48. <hi>&amp;</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We do know,</hi> That the act of Justification passeth not upon the Soul, without a work of Sanctification in the Soul. That good works are of such necessity in the business of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that there can be no Justification where the practice of them is contemned. That the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101827:54"/>
good works of the Regenerate (so far as they are good, and the product of Gods own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) are not displeasing to him, nor of their own nature sin: yet, that in regard of much imperfection (which the best of men will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess is adherent to their works, in this life) we take a safe course not to place confidence, or set any value upon them; but on him, who is <hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> and our <hi>Advocate with the Father, Jer.</hi> 23. 6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1. <hi>But we acknowledge not,</hi> That the good works of just persons do truly merit, and deserve Grace, in this world, and glory in the next: Nor, that such good works are of themselves, without any Covenant or acceptation on God's part, worthy of Eternal Life, and<note place="margin">Vasquez <hi>Disput.</hi>
                  </note> have an equal value of condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the obtaining of everlasting Glory: Nor, that that is the just stipend, crown or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, answering to the weight and time of our labours, rather than a free gift: Nor, that no accession of Dignity comes to the works of the Just by the Merit or Person of Christ, which they should not have, if they were done by the same Grace bestowed, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, by God alone without Christ: Nor, that it's vain, after Grace received, or infused, to expect a continued imputation of Christs Righteousness.</p>
               <p>According to the best Definitions of that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101827:54"/>
Grace which the Romanist allow to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for us by Christ, their plea for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven must run after this manner: <hi>Lord, by the strength of that Grace, which (because thou didst foresee, I would use it well) thou hast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to me, I have so performed my duty in doing or suffering for thee, as thou canst not in justice deny me (for that) the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> See the <hi>Rhemish</hi> Annotations upon 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>But let them consider what Reply they could make, if God should enter the lists with them, and say: <hi>I have a Law that requires perfect, unerring, universal, constant, perpetual obedience; a Law that exacts Truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, that is a discerner of the thoughts and spirit, that is not satisfied without the whole heart: I have said,</hi> not one jot or tittle of it shall pass away, till all be fulfilled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17, 18. 22. 37, 38. <hi>These habits and acts of righteousness which thou seemest to relye upon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thine own conscience will tell thee have been imperfect, unconstant, partial, yea, sometimes, none at all, but thy soul hath frequently been inslaved to contrary vices; therefore, thou must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of more integrity, a more immaculate and spotless obedience, to present me withal, and make out thy interest therein too, before thy claim be just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us see what answer the Protestant
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101827:55"/>
Principles will put into our mouths; and let the safer, the truer, the modester carry it.</p>
               <p>Thus then:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord, I know thy Law is holy just and good, 'tis likewise eternal: by the righteousness of this Law, Justification is to be had even yet, as well as in the Covenant of works, made with</hi> Adam, <hi>before his fall; onely here is the difference: It's now accepted in the hands of a Mediator,</hi> The Lord our Righteousness, <hi>who, as surety of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant, and as Head of his Body the Church, hath fulfill'd the Law in its utmost De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. My faith, my obedience, my charity, are all weak, poor inconsiderable things; Eternal life, and the whole of my salvation from the one end to the other, is purely a free gift. Though I have had some Graces of thy Spirit, in such a measure as have been a comfortable evidence, that my heart was set aright to serve thee (for without a conformity to thy Son in holiness, begun in the life below, no flesh may hope with joy to see thy face above) yet I dare not, I ought not, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent these unto thee as the matter of my justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; I have through thy mercy been sincere, but it is in Christ only that I am compleat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We do know,</hi> That we ought to have in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Saints departed; and not to think meanly of the Angels, those ministring Spirits. <hi>But we do not acknowledge,</hi> that we ought to invocate them, or direct our prayers or vows
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101827:55"/>
unto them, much less place confidence in the wearing their Reliques or Pictures, to prevent lightning, sudden death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>We do know,</hi> That an high and profound reverence is due to Fathers, Councils, voice of the Church. <hi>But we acknowledge not,</hi> That any particular place, or succession of men, is exempt from all possibility of Error: Nor, that <hi>Rome</hi> keeps her first Principles.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>We do know,</hi> That men of ungodly, unstable, contentious dispositions, do not look upon the Bible, without danger to their own souls, and pervert many things therein to their destruction. <hi>But we acknowledge not,</hi> That, therefore, the sincere milk of the Word is to be lock'd up from those that might grow thereby: Nor, that meat is to be kept from the children, because it is sometimes abused to excess and riot, by dissolute and licentious men.</p>

for Righteousness; and he obtained the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, (that is, saw Christ afar off, and had his share in him) not by Working, but Believing. And if Works merely Natural had been in Question, why comes in the Example of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> rather than of <hi>Abimelech, Socrates,</hi> or the like. <hi>That</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> meant not to reach beyond Justification in <hi>Foro Humano,</hi> by that which he attributes to Works, is evident from what he subjoyns, ver. 18. <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works.</hi> He denies a saving power, only, to such a Faith as is not Operative; and to such a one, neither do we ascribe any thing at all.

               <p>
                  <hi>I once</hi> had from the mouth of a Romanist, (whose memory has all the reason in the world, to be ever dear to me) an expression where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was much taken, as neighbouring very near unto Truth, and far from the malignity of some I have before cited. When I insisted upon the Righteousness of Christ, as our justification; it was answered, The difference laid only in the means of applying it; and, that, not only faith, but the exercise of all other vertues was that means. <hi>I have</hi> already declared, how this is attributed to the instrumentality of Faith; it alone being that Grace which is capable of laying hold upon Christ, held forth to the Soul, in the promises of the Gospel; and as it is a quality inherent, it does not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,<note place="margin">Faith does not consist in a belief that we do believe; but in an affiance bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon such Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als as Scripture holds out.</note> no more than other Graces. <hi>Now,</hi> if all Papists would grant, that only the Righteousness of Christ is to be brought before the Tribunal of Gods justice; I should, without any difficulty, yield, that all other vertues are inseparable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts to Faith, and admit them to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of applying (as without which Faith has no such power, nor indeed can at all subsist) though not to the Office of justifying.

            <argument>
               <p>Some Rubs laid in the way of those <hi>Jehu</hi>'s, who at this time seem to drive-on so furiously; which they must, necessarily, either remove, or leap-over, before they can arrive at the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F those words, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him in an absolute prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency over the rest; Why did the Apostles afterwards ask, which of them should be Chief? And why did not our Saviour thereupon plainly satisfie them; but chose so to determine the Question, as to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101827:60"/>
convince them of the vanity in that Enquiry? <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 34, 35. But if an infallible Judge, in all Controversies, were thereby to have been for ever introduced, the Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Almighty God would not have left a Point of so vast concernment to the whole World (in all its successive Generations) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a clear and evident Precept.</p>
            <p>2. From that minatory Exhortation (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 18, 19, 20, 21.) we collect a possibility (for it's indifferently level'd at all <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches) and particularly directed to <hi>Rome</hi>) that no less She, than any other, may be cut off.</p>
            <p>3. Where St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. magnifies his Office in reference to his Apostleship over the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and seems to confine the jurisdiction of St. <hi>Peter</hi> within the limits of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Pale; he ought, rather, without more to do (if a succession of infallible truth, to be derived from <hi>Cephas,</hi> to the Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> had been foreknown by him) to have directed our Eyes thither.</p>
            <p>Again, where <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30, 31, 32. he sadly foretels the Church, that after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, grievous Wolves should enter in, and amongst them many should arise speaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse things: He adviseth them, not to make (in that case) their addresses to him, that should then happen to be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successour at
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101827:60"/>
               <hi>Rome;</hi> but commends them to the word of God's Grace to be built up and established by it.</p>
            <p>4. St. <hi>John</hi> an Evangelist and the beloved Disciple (out-living <hi>Peter</hi> about thirty years) should have ought subjection and obedience to <hi>Linus</hi> or <hi>Cletus,</hi> if the primacy of <hi>Rome</hi> had risen out of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ashes.</p>
            <p>5. The Apostles send from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John, Acts</hi> 8. 14. which is not, certainly, any great sign of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the rest; since the <hi>very</hi> best in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are never sent out, be the Embassage ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great or honourable; and where those that seemed Pillars are named, <hi>Cephas</hi> has but the second place.</p>
            <p>6. When that Article which relates to the Catholick Church was made a part of the Creed; there was not a Bishop, nor a form'd Church, nor peradventureso much as any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Christian at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Ere ever <hi>Rome</hi> durst be so hardy, <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> (in the person of <hi>John</hi> her Bishop) grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Title of Universal; which, then, was lookt at as so prodigious a Claim, that for it <hi>Gregory</hi> the First pronounced whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should aspire towards it Anti-Christian. And good reason had he so to do, since the third Council of <hi>Carthage, Canon</hi> 26. provides, The Bishop of the first should not be termed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101827:61"/>
Head or Prince of Priests. And when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome</hi> would needs challenge an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative Supremacy (not from the Emperours Laws or Presence, which, indeed, was the true foundation of all the preheminency the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents do at any time give her; but) from St. <hi>Peter;</hi> She should have remembred that St. <hi>Basil,</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> 32. gives to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in his 50. to <hi>Antioch,</hi> the better right: Which yet he speaks not as conceding to any of the Seats of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Infallibility or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy over the Rest: But to convince the Western great Pretenders, by their own way of Argument, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers of the Resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29.) having in his 10. left something of another nature for the Westerlings to chaw upon. And in truth that smoaky Pride he there mentions, could never ascend to its heighth, or any fixation, till in the midst of the distractions that fell upon the Empire, the bargain was (add <hi>fairly,</hi> if you can) struck up with <hi>Phocas</hi> that murthering Usurper of his Masters dignity; and the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session continued by the weak Concessions upon strange Interests, and Perswasions, of some late converted, and but lately Catechised Princes.</p>
            <p>8. The contradictory Sentences of Pope <hi>Sextus</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, as to the use of their different Editions of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101827:61"/>
The inconsistent results of Councils, the First of <hi>Nice,</hi> and those Later of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> as to the Priests marrying, and the Cup to the Laity; That general one, the Seventh of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Frank ford</hi> compared with the Second of <hi>Nice,</hi> as to the use of Images; Nay, the undoubted mistakes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Council approved by <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Second (<hi>vide Daven. de Jud. cap.</hi> 23.) of that held at <hi>Neocaesaria,</hi> confirmed by <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, do clearly speak out thus much, That Infallibility is not to be expected below the Moon. During the great <hi>Arrian</hi> deluge, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral General Councils obtruded their Errours upon the World; and at last, <hi>Liberius</hi> subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; whether through fear, infirmity of old age, tediousness of Banishment is not material, done it was; and what hath been, may be.</p>
            <p>9. The Contests betwixt Councils and Popes for Superiority, could never have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; nor would so many learned men have militated, with their Pens, so freely on the Councils part, if then, or in the Ages before them, the Popes Infallibilitie had been setled an Article (yea the chief Article, as now 'tis held forth) of the Christian Faith: Nay sure those of <hi>Constance,</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> durst not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed themselves above the Pope.</p>
            <p>10. If his Holiness have indeed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101827:62"/>
Privilege of <hi>never erring Decision,</hi> he might do well to exert its vertue in those Points of the <hi>Seat of Supremacy, the power of the Will,</hi> and the <hi>reason</hi> or <hi>ground of Merit.</hi> Why will he suffer, for want of clear speaking, his own great Doctours to clash, and the whole World to fluctuate in uncertainties, and under dis-satisfactions?</p>
            <p>11. If we had lived when two or three Popes were up together, each one Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the Adherents of his Antagonist (which was once and more for a long time the case) what course could we have taken to discern the infallible Head?</p>
            <p>12. Since <hi>Hieroine</hi> informs us, <hi>Si authoritas quaeratur, orbis major est urbe,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> Printed at <hi>Basil, Anno</hi> 1565. Since <hi>Cyprian</hi> assures us, <hi>Pari omnes inter se fuisse au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate Apostolos, Tract. de Simplicitate Praet.</hi> Printed at <hi>Colen, Anno</hi> 1544. (neither was St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself, if we consult his first Epistle <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and 3. at all ambitious of being Chief amongst his Fellow-Elders, or a Lord over God's Heritage.) Since <hi>Amb. de Poen.</hi> hath taught us to say, <hi>Non habent Haereditatem Petri qui fidem Petri non habent.</hi> But especially since we find the <hi>Bereans</hi> not only approved but commended for searching (even in case of the Apostles own Doctrine) the Scriptures, whether these things were so; we are bold to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101827:62"/>
call them (our Adversaries) to that Test. And since the value of this Cardinal Point (for no less than the whole Frame of their Religion, as it is distinguished from ours, turns with it) must stand or fall, according to the success of the several Controverted Heads; I shall single out one which seems to me to be more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than any of the Rest, and give a short, but, I hope, a clear prospect, into the grounds whereupon we build our Dissent from them, in the great Doctrine of Justification. And if that Church may be discovered to have trod awry in one particular, the more than stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fabrick of her Infallibility, <hi>Mole ruet suÃ¢,</hi> must fall of it self. Reflect then upon it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion (for I desire rather to contract than widen our differences; though I have not a few things to say against that congruous kind of merit, which they'l have to deserve the Grace which makes their after good works meritorious) of that by them termed the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Justification,</hi> that inherent Righteousness, whereby, they say, they may perfectly fullfil and keep all Gods Commandements, truly deserve Grace in this World, and Glory in the next, together with remission of sins (<hi>Prog. of Catho. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. which their <hi>Rhemists</hi> rather chuse to say is recompensed than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded (because that word is sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Alms we bestow upon a meer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101827:63"/>
Beggar, who deserves nothing at our hands) with eternal life; Justly and equally answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the weight and time of our travel; a Debt, but by no means a free gift, on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. In respect to which <hi>Vasquez</hi> is not afraid to affirm, <hi>Post infusam Gratiam,</hi> after Grace infused our Works are so perfectly meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of eternal life, that it cannot in Justice be denied them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frustra igitur,</hi> In vain therefore after such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Grace were it to expect a continued imputation or application (by faith) of Christ's merits. Yea so violent is that Jesuite, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning these audacious Expressions, that he lets flie on all sides against both antient and modern Divines, that flie not to the same height, calling in the definitions of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council to bear witness, That inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness has (of it self, without being eased or lightned by the favour or condonation of God) power enough to wipe off the staines of sin. And to clear all, he will have us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that they never request of God, that by the merits of Christ the reward of life may be given to their worthy and meritorious Works, but that Grace may by Christ be given them, whereby they may be inabled worthily to merit that reward; and, that no Accession of dignity does come to the Works of the Just by the Merits or Person of Christ, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101827:63"/>
should not have had, if done by the same Grace bestowed by God alone without Christ. These are <hi>duri sermones,</hi> hard of digestion; and yet they would have us by one strenuous Act of implicit Credulity, to down with them, and to suspend our whole Belief, upon the most imperious dictates of their supposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church: But we have not so learned Christ. And (as to my part) after a long and diligent search (whereto never any could be more ingaged than my self) I despair of ever finding any more sure, or near way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</p>

            <p>6. Another from <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>That one destitute of Works should be Justified by Faith, might, perhaps, seem well to be: But that one adorned with vertues and good works should, yet, be justified not by them, but by Faith only, is admirable.</hi>

               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:101827:67"/>From these premises we, I hope, may with safety and confidence (after it is past for Law, upon the venerable Bench of Primitive Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and <hi>veritas,</hi> truth, is, <hi>non quod antiquum,</hi> not what had got a prevalence in our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers or Great-grand-fathers days; but, <hi>quod antiquissimum,</hi> what from the beginning was so) affirm, That even now, under the Gospel, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification cannot be absolved towards a Sinner, but in the contemplation of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, whereby he, and none but he, fully answered all the demands of the Law. Nor is it any prejudice to our Cause at all, that in the writings of the Latin Fathers. the Terms <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita, mereri,</hi> and <hi>Justificationes</hi> do frequently occur; since their importance with them for the most part is, singly, <hi>works,</hi> not the <hi>desert</hi> of working, but particular Acts of Justice; and <hi>mereri,</hi> to attain unto, or procure (as the way whereby, not the cause wherefore) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Heaven: which is largely, as well as clearly manifested by our Bishops, <hi>Usher, Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and <hi>Downham;</hi> their true sence and meaning being not contrary, but subordinate to our Doctrine. We shall not fear therefore to say with St. <hi>Paul</hi> (compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Ja.</hi> 2. 21.) That the best man living must expect Blessedness without Works, by Faith alone; and yet that Faith must not, nor indeed can, be alone in any good man: For it is as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101827:68"/>
true, which St. <hi>James</hi> tells us <hi>cap.</hi> 2. That Works do in the sight of men, and to our own Consciences justifie us: supposed or mistaken Faith alone, being dead and ineffectual, can do nothing at all thereto. How this goodly Building of condign merit, or Justification by the desert of inherent Righteousness, hath a very congruous foundation on the doctrine of Free-Will, <hi>Alphonsus Ã  Castro</hi> gives us to understand, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de haeres.</hi> when he says; <hi>For this, even because we consent to God's Monition, when we might have dissented, Wages are ow'n to us, and from thence is our merit.</hi> If by this Monition they intend but a bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual swasion, and then leave Nature to determine in that work, which is not brought to pass but by the mighty power of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. the difference betwixt them and the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> of old, is sure but very minute, and scarce perceptible: The one (though they would not hear of the energy of Grace, yet) acknowledge, that Nature, which they so much exalted, was the gift and work of God: The other (though they seem to assign a kind of Grace to the Conversion of a sinner) coarct its operation under such Terms as render the whole business, in a manner, the Fruit of a man's own acquisition.</p>

               </gap>, which being resolved, are
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101827:68"/>
so determinative of the Point, as leaves the Judgement no more room further to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate.</p>
            <p>1. What state the Father of the Faithful was in, whenas St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4. assures us, he was Justified without Works? The <hi>Romanists</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that this is to be understood of <hi>Natural</hi> Works, done <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>without Faith.</hi> Well, but <hi>Abrahani</hi> was called of God, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered his call, had received and imbraced the Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. built an Altar, and twice thereat invoked the Name of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. had solemnly been blessed by <hi>Melchizedek, Gen.</hi> 14. had a Testimony given by God, that he was his particular care, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed several Acts of Righteousness in Faith, as is apparent from <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9. and was now about an hundred years old, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19. yet after all this, of him it is spoken, and by St. <hi>Paul</hi> drawn to general application, That by Faith without Works, (this is without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration had on God's part to their merit) he was Justified.</p>
            <p>2. What Law is it whereby St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. that no Flesh can be justified? Even that Law which to other necessary uses he was careful to establish, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. by which <hi>cometh the knowledge of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7. 7. which <hi>is holy, just, and good,</hi> ver. 12, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> ver. 14. Encomiums that cannot be given
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101827:69"/>
to the Ceremonial, and therefore must be of force against that Doctrine, whereby Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made to consist, in either habitual, or actual holiness; all which is nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Moral-Law, too weak, through the flesh, for such an end.</p>
            <p>3. What sort of Grace is there designed, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> (having by all his preceding discourses, thereto ascribed Justification) sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. this caution, <hi>What then? Shall we continue in sin, that Grace may abound?</hi> It's not at all possible, or imaginable, that any body, how egregiously wicked, or how stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly gross and dull soever he were, should be of opinion, that by continuing in sin Grace inherent could abound. By infallible deduction, then, it follows, That the power of justifying is not by the Apostle left in the hands of such Grace, but rests in that gratious imputation of Righteousness through Faith, which makes our Salvation from one end to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the free gift of God; as we find it contradistinguished to the wages of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Let not any Romanist, here, think to come off by alleging, that they hold the eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of sin to be remitted by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ; which being done, there then remains their good deeds to merit glory in Heaven: For, pardon relates only to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the repenting sinner, not at all unto the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101827:69"/>
devious works, so as to render legitimate what was in the commission criminal. But the Law, which takes no notice of Pardon, remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulfilled by the party absolved, still: And a righteousness, adequate to that, must be found, before we can claim the rewards of life. Nor let them imagine the business is salved, because some of them build the reason or ground of merit on the promise and acceptation of God: for neither can they shew that ever God made his promise of such a Tenure; nor yet will <hi>Vasquez</hi> (and therein he pretends fully to know the mind of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council) suffer that to pass as Catholick Doctrine: for he tells us, <hi>If our works be not of themselves, before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, worthy; and after the Promise do become worthy; it must follow, that for their dignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to make them acceptable, the Merit of Christ must needs intervene, and be imputed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Disp.</hi> 214. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. That what I have delivered in this Point, is the very Mind, Sence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the <hi>English</hi> Church, whereto I desire to approve and submit my self, is manifest by her eleventh Article, thus made up: <hi>That we are justified by Faith alone, is a most wholesome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> referring us for farther explication to her Homilie of Salvation: and there we are directed to the right Object of Faith, as it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies, <hi>viz. Christ suffered death for us, Christ fulfilled the Law for us.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:101827:70"/>As Utensils, or a kind of hang-by's on to their main Point of <hi>Justification by the merit of works,</hi> follow an whole Legion of <hi>vendible Pardons, Indulgences, Dispensations;</hi> Termes which in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> signified no more than certain relaxations of Penances imposed upon Delinquents, and upon evident signs of their amendment mitigated to the persons yet living: Whereas, in the after practice of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> they degenerated into such notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous superstition (as applyed to the dead,) and into so great impiety (as extended to the living,) that they have left skars upon the face of their Church, which cannot pass for beauty-Spots.

They usher in all the rest by this comprehensive one, which might have indeed a great many in the belly of it: And, as we pass the threshold, we cannot but take up this Note, They fix the blame not upon the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular exorbitant actings of some particular ill-governing Minister. But the Preamble runs thus:
<q>An hundred grievances of the sacred Roman Empire, Princes and Nobles, which they put up to his Holiness his Legate against the Roman Chair, and the whole Ecclesiastical Order. <hi>Anno 1522.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> 
               <q>This is not the least, nor the last to be mentioned, that many things are prohibited, many things imposed, by humane constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are not commanded or forbid by any Divine Precept: Of such sort are, The innumerable obstacles invented for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Marriage, drawn through so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees of affinity, and consanguinity: The injunction to forbear meats, which God, notwithstanding, has created, indifferently,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101827:71"/>
for the use of Man; and the Apostle so teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, They may be taken with thanksgiving: These and the like stand in force, till money (which thus makes the <hi>same</hi> thing lawful to rich, and criminal to poor) procure a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. By the casting of such illegal nets, not only a vast quantity of Treasure is caught in <hi>Germany,</hi> and hoysted over the <hi>Alpes;</hi> but a most unreasonable iniquity is exercised upon persons equal in Christianity: Whence arises great scandal, and heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whilst the less able sort do find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves intrapped and held fast, only because they have not those Thornes of the Gospel riches; as Christ more than once terms them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. <q>Of the same stamp are the proceedings as to set times for marriage; done it must not be at such and such seasons; that is to say, if the parties think to do't for nothing; though in the mean time both Ecclesiasticks and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars live most luxuriously: but if Coyn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough appear, that makes all pass into just and right: this likewise is a cunning pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock to the <hi>German</hi> Coffers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. They tell him how long this unsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table burthen has laid upon their backs; that, <q>Whensoever some Church is pretended to be in building at <hi>Rome,</hi> or an expedition to be made against the Turk, then, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101827:71"/>
of a pious Contribution, the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>German</hi> bags must be turned out; and, what is more considerable, by these Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures managed by a sort of Preachers for the carrying on that work purposely set, true Christian Piety is almost justled out of the Nation. For, (<hi>that they may to most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage put off that sort of Ware</hi>) no end is made of crying up those Bulls, ascribing thereto a wonderful and unutterable power of pardoning sins, not only past and to come unto the living, but also, unto the dead, who are, as they call it, in the fire of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> yet not unless something jingle from the fist. By these mercenary Indulgences, not only our Country is drayn'd of Treasure, but the fear of God extinguished, when every one must needs frame to himself a perswasion, that he has purchased a secure liberty of sinning. Hence are Whoredoms, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Perjuries, Slaughters, Thefts, Rapines, Extortions, and the whole kennel of such<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like wickedness. For who will any more be aw'd from evil, when once he is brought to think, that for money he may have a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to sin here, and impunity in the world to come? Especially (<hi>add they</hi>) our <hi>Germans,</hi> who are behind none in forwardness to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any thing, that has the countenance of Piety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:101827:72"/>4. But they assure him, <q>The people are now grown by use so knowing of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, (since they discern the Corn goes to the wrong Mill) that now when there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a need of their aid, they will not part with it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Next is represented, how <q>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Causes are referred to <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and there, if the just have no money, he cannot be quit; if the unjust have, he may return home not freed from censure, but fenced with a Dispensation for the future: and then, what cares he how flagitiously he live, since every Hedge-Priest has power by the already procured Indulgence to absolve him?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then they follow another sort of Indulgence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers (their <hi>Stationary</hi> Preachers of them) through all sorts of Villages and Habitations of men; standing amazed to hear how confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they bear the vulgar in hand, that it will make highly for the thriving of their Families, if they give somewhat yearly to such a Saint, whose prayer they set forth (suppose St. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine,</hi> St. <hi>Hubert,</hi> &amp;c.) but this Pension must go through the hands of those Priests. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they inroll every one of these poor men for a reward, under the protection of some Saint, making them believe an immunity from some disease or other, which would for the year be the consequent thereof. In all which there is no greater design, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101827:72"/>
their wealth. This custom taking its rise from St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> has now got an universal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon all maladies; for you cannot name one, over which these Stationaries do not assign some such Saint to superintend: by this, sucking the very heart-bloud from these credulous persons, and eating the very bread out of their Childrens mouths. Then they lay open all the practices of another sort of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging-Fryars <hi>Terminarii,</hi> who play their pranks too, and put in for a share of the Peoples suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Next they travel forward into a large Field, fruitful beyond measure, in Enormities of various kinds, as <hi>abuse of Church-Censures, Multitude of holy days,</hi> &amp;c. At length bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to the sight of one, which though I had formerly heard of from Authors of unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable credit, yet could not take root with me, till I viewed it irrefragably made out by this authentick Copy of so solemn and great a Transaction, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (for it's not to be considered singly as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, in the managements of some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons) could suffer a Weed of so vile and poysonous nature, to spread its branches so far and so thick: We see it full blown, and bearing fruit too, where their complaint is thus renewed.</p>
            <p>75. <q>Furthermore, the Officials, drawn with infamous and insatiable thirst after Gold,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101827:73"/>
not only not discountenance Usury and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Gain, but do every where advance it. They suffer Clergy-men and Religious of all sorts, (for money still) freely to enjoy Concubines, Whores, Strumpets, and on them to beget Children.</q> But,</p>
            <p>91. This Grievance is superadded, <q>That in most places, even chaste Priests, such as had no intent to use Concubines, are, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, compelled to pay the Rate that such Dispensation would come to, and then let them chuse whether they will take it out or no.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These are Corruptions that naturally, and almost necessarily flow from the Doctrines of Indulgences, Pardons, Dispensations, of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick (I mean Universal) practice amongst the Pontificians; for, with us in <hi>England,</hi> we find Grants of the same frame, nay worse, if worse can be: Two Towns in <hi>Essex</hi> given to the Church of <hi>Ely,</hi> by <hi>Leofwin,</hi> to expiate and satisfie for the murther of his Mother. (<hi>Cambd. fol.</hi> 440. of the large English Edition.) And <hi>Alfrid,</hi> the relict of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> founded a Nunnery near <hi>Ambersbury,</hi> having made away <hi>Edward,</hi> who was by the former Wife, that her Son might succeed, <hi>Cambd. fol.</hi> 254. These are deeds of darkness acted in the light: And must we have the Gate of Heaven shut against us, because we cannot but believe, That the Pope,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101827:73"/>
who interdicteth marriage to men in Orders, and yet by a Law establisheth the Iniquity of Concubination, who winked at such things as these, might, at length, fall asleep, and give the envious Man large opportunities to sow Tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and 25. or because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not swear to all the words of that most imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Master.</p>
            <p>Let us now crave, or if that will not be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, take lieve to examine how well they have stated this business amongst themselves; how, or whether at all, they agree therein. Some would have us to think (for so 'tis often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in gross, and so the greatest part of their own, especially Laicks, understand it) That the high-Priest of <hi>Rome</hi> is no way subject to mistake. But that's not to be defended. Then they inform us, That in Matters of Faith, he cannot err. When they are driven by the Testimony of their best Historians, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Liberius, Honorius,</hi> and many others, to confess, that this has come to pass: Then; Not when he undertakes to teach the Church. Which likewise being demonstrated by the instance of <hi>John</hi> 22. who both believed, and proposed to others a notable Error about the Souls of the departed: And of <hi>John</hi> 23. who publickly taught, that there was no life after this: Oh then; Not in a General Council.

to be consulted, continually necessary Judge of Controversies: for under these Notions they commonly infer the reasonableness of their Tenent. The 300 years next to the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick times knew no such thing as an Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Assembly: the first that ever was would not (if all truth had been to be fetch'd, if all power had been to be derived, from <hi>Rome</hi>) by their quadripartite division of Jurisdiction, have limited <hi>Sylvester,</hi> as well as the other three, to his proper bounds. The third of <hi>Carthage</hi> would not have made a Decree to the contrary: Nor that of <hi>Milevetum</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Excommunication against all such as should appeal beyond their Sees. Neither would the sixth <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Council, so stifly, have opposed <hi>Zosymus,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his successour <hi>Boniface;</hi> till at last they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced his pretensions to be false, by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation which <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Atticus</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> gave to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Canons. The Pope had his Deputy at the Council of <hi>Basil:</hi> Its Decrees, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with those of <hi>Constance,</hi> confirmed by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Letters of <hi>Eugenius, Anno</hi> 1449. ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by <hi>Nicholas</hi> 5. In them the Authority of a Council is set above the Pope, and he is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to it. This is certainly to them a very pungent Dilemma: Either let them confess that a Council confirmed by the Pope may err; or
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101827:74"/>
let the Decrees pass for Catholick Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> For our parts, we think, we can bring an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible instance from this Council, I mean of <hi>Constance,</hi> that they may err: Since in that very Decree which they dared to make against the Communion in both kinds, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they went against the first Institution. But the Jesuites now at last (for what reason they know best) will, after all this poother, have the whole privilege fitted to the narrow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of the Pope's Breast. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Conc. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. Thus at last, all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils must be brought back to the Bishop of <hi>Rome's</hi> Examination, that what he approves may pass, what he is not satisfied in may fall to the ground: <hi>Gregory de Valentia Ann. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Thus the Pope indeed ought to use all good means and diligence to find out Truth: But whether doth he so or no? If he undertake to determine, in a Controversie, he always does it infallibly. This is well and soundly to the purpose: yet before they do vest him with that Prerogative, or ascertain it to him, they put such conditionary Qualifications upon him (he must be duly elected, whereto abundance of odd things must concur: he must not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor in his heart, which no body can ever understand, be a favourer of Heresie, and the like) as 'tis the hardest thing in the World to know when it is fix'd, and therefore no
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101827:75"/>
competent ground-work to rear our Faith upon.</p>
            <p>Popery has its several Depths, wherein the Members of the Romish Communion (however they would bear others in hand, and divers of them may themselves believe, that there's nothing but Unity among them) are more or less immers'd. Yet from a concession made by their daring <hi>Vasquez,</hi> though not made with any design of reconciliation, but upon grounds that must perpetuate the Breach, I can (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) bring the most of our English Papists, and a great part of their more ancient and more modest Writers, within the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of true, though not in all regards sound, Belief. That bold Jesuite, where he so eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contends for the condigne Merit of Works done by infused Grace, and scorns to derive it from any Covenant or Acceptation, on God's part made, thus argues: (And indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is very strong, though the use he would make of it be very impertinent.) His words are: <hi>If our Works were not (of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) before any Promise worthy, but became so by vertue of a Promise; the Merits of Christ must necessarily be applied, and imputed, to bring such Dignification to them.</hi> (<hi>Quaest.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Disp.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.) Now for such among them, as do owne a Tenent that will undeniably fetch in the Merits of Christ (though it be not in a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101827:75"/>
way so explicit as is proper for the raising the Soul to those discoveries of strong Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may flow from the Doctrine right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood) I dare not but be so charitable as to think, That if they joyned a sincere Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to that measure of Faith, they shall have their share in the Resurrection of the Just, at the last Day. Their Notions seem (as to this great business) to run into disorder upon a supposition, That the Merits of Christ are applied to the Works, not to the Persons of the Regenerate.</p>
            <p>To sift, therefore, these things a little; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider:</p>
            <p>1. That the gratious Condonation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is pleased not to animadvert the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquities, nor the gratuitous acceptation, which he vouchsafes to our best Actions, can neither of them relate to the Works themselves, nor have such influence upon them, as to render them (now) Legitimate, which were (before) Anomious. Will any body say, or think, That those illegal proceedings, whereof many in <hi>England</hi> were guilty, ceased to be Treason, as soon as the King's Grace had, by the Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, quitted their Persons from punishment? Though God, in like manner, through the greatness of his mercy, do let all our guilt pass into the Land of forgetfulness; yet, there is an holy, just, good, eternal, exceeding broad
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101827:76"/>
Law, which must <hi>not pass away till all be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> which requires the whole heart, and reaches the very inmost thoughts. Notwithstanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, this Law remains unfulfilled still; and poor Dust and Ashes (in whose hands, through the weakness of the Flesh, it fail'd of its End) would be left groveling on this side heaven, if the glorious light of the Gospel did not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest a new way thither; not by patching up or ekeing out the rags of our Works, but by putting on us the Garments of our elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by directing us (when we plead with our Maker, for the blessing) to <hi>make mention of his Righteousness only.</hi> The clearest intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this is had from <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. and 33. 16. laid together; where the Spouse and her Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bridegroom are united, and put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under one Appellation, <hi>He shall be called,</hi> yea and <hi>She shall be called too, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</hi> 'Tis prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously strange, it should seem strange to any, that there should be a Communication betwixt the Head and the Members, such as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the fulness which is in the one (purposely for that end) unto the other (see <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 9. 10.) especially when they admit of a Communication of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, one with another, by Supererrogation, whereof Scripture is absolutely silent.</p>

               <head>Of Prayer to Saints.</head>
               <p>THE Agents for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (who have, indeed, a singular Dexterity in adapting their Discourses to the frame of the times wherein, and to the temper of the persons wherewith, they are conversant) do think fit to assault this Generation (train'd up to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable inadvertency, through the unsetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and discomposure, which lately was upon us) by mincing, or veiling those Doctrines and Practices, most lyable to exception; putting upon them such a varnish as may look best to the eyes of transient, slight beholders. Thus they bear us in hand, that the Adoration paid by them to Saints and Angels, is an innocent, humble, safe thing, whereby they only bespeak (and who will not desire to make a friend in the Court?) those favourites of Heaven to be on their side.</p>
               <p>If this were all; yet, since we are sure, that he with whom we have to do, perfectly discerns all the desires, all the necessities of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants: (a Prerogative no<note place="margin">Ambrose <hi>on</hi> Rom. 1.</note> Potentate on Earth is capable of, and therefore several Patrons are there sought out, the more effectually to inform them:) Since we are sure, there's no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101827:77"/>
betwixt God and man, but the Man Christ Jesus: Since to be adored is so peculiarly due to our great Creator: Since to intercede, is, exclusively to all others, in things pertaining to God, the Office of our Saviour: We dare not make the Angels or Saints departed the Objects of our Devotions; especially since it is written (certainly for our instruction) <hi>See thou do it not,</hi> Revel. 22. 9. But they will give us (or at least we must take) lieve to view a little, by the perspective of their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, those immediate, down-right Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they would have it believed, St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> (for they are publisht with the third part of his Epistles, though the style plainly speaks them five hundred years younger) had not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but rewarded; being now in Heaven a favourite.</p>
               <p>1. Therefore we must make no question, but St. <hi>Hierom</hi> is equal to any of the Apostles; <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> having accompanied him (soon after his departure out of this life) unto St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Cell, purposely to assure that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would not take it ill, if St. <hi>Hierom</hi> were as much venerated as himself, and to be feared above the rest of the Saints, having more power to prevail with God for whatsoever he please, than almost any other has. We must understand too, that Christ himself, with all the glorified Souls, and the Blessed Virgin,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101827:77"/>
went out to meet the Spirit of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> the same instant it left the flesh, to conduct it with more honour into Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. Where it had not been long, before, three men, dying all about a time, were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgement Seat of God, and were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of being condemned to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chains; when St. <hi>Hierom</hi> (accompanied by <hi>John Baptist</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi>) desired those three <hi>might be given back to him, for the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devotion,</hi> (I use the very words I find) <hi>they had always born him.</hi> His suit would not be denyed. He then takes them, shews them Heaven, Hell, yea and Purgatory; then joyns them to their bodies again, and sends them unto earth for twenty days, under this condition, that, if in that space they could perform the Penance due to their sins, they should then be admitted into Heaven.</p>
               <p>3. During which twenty days, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with several persons here, told many strange and wonderful things (particularly one of them said, That whilst he was dying, many Devils beset his bed, till St. <hi>Hierom</hi> came to send them away, and gave him a better guard of Angels) at the time prefixed departed this life over again, and were buried together in the Yard of that Church where St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lyes: And our Author is confident of their Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:101827:78"/>4. Thither, upon a certain day, when his body was to be removed from its first earthy into a Marble Tomb, an innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of people came crowding: The restoring of sight to the blind; the freeing of Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks, upon the touch of his Reliques, were at that time nothing: But a certain poor Widow, having one only little Son, was there, and the Child pressed to death in the throng: In a sad ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king she carries her lifeless darling to the Grave, whence St. <hi>Hierom</hi> had been taken; with these words: <hi>Holy, Glorious</hi> Hierom, <hi>I will never go hence, till thou restorest me my boy:</hi> As soon as ever his body touch'd the ground, the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd again. And the like befel another also, that had been no less than three days before buryed, whom his father took up and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sepulchre of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> receiving him immediately from thence alive, whole and sound.</p>
               <p>5. We are reminded that St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> made one expedition more, on his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, into the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> both clad alike in rich and precious Garments: In great State and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty they came hand in hand through the body of the Church, top-full of people, and in two golden Chairs (placed there, by something like two most beautiful Youths, for the very nonce) set themselves directly before the Altar; a good
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101827:78"/>
while they remain'd silent, civilly offering to each other the precedence of speech; at last it was agreed, that because the day was solemn for St. <hi>John</hi>'s Birth, the other should first chaunt his Praises, which he did succinctly and elegantly beyond humane expression: But then St. <hi>John</hi> fell to work, and so extol'd his Companion, that he left in the good Bishop <hi>Cyril</hi> (whose Vision this was) a great deal of joy and admiration; and he published what he had seen unto all the people.</p>
               <p>6. A certain man was infinitely troubled to think what condition his Nephew's soul (a fine, but wild, young man lately dead) was in: at last, by importunities, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> set him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, manacled all in burning fetters; because he had forgot, at his last Confession, to acknowledge how vainly he had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Plays.</p>
               <p>7. Subjoyn to this another story of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently featured young man, who had entred into the Monastical life, but was by his elder Brother over-perswaded to marry; which having done, the same brother of his abused his Bed, and both he and the offending wife were slain by the hand of this youngster: After which he fled the City, turn'd High-way-man, committed many flagitious Acts; but in the midst of all, forgot not to recommend himself to St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and let scarce any day go over
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101827:79"/>
his head, but, once before night, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form something that was good to his honour. Well, at last St. <hi>Hierom</hi> catcht him, by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; He put himself on the way, where this Votary of his used (with his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to play his pranks, habited like a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Merchant; is assaulted by him; but the lifted-up arm, and drawn sword, both remain'd unmoveable in the Air: at which being strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inraged, the Robber call'd his fellows to fall on: The seeming Merchant besought him (even for St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s sake) to hear him, which words, being uttered by St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself, wrought so, as they all listned to his advices, and became new men.</p>
               <p>8. Let us fetch our next remarque (as my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has done) out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> One of the same long Robe, a Monk I mean, had, for twelve years, been an example of singular Piety to all his fellows, and so chaste he was, that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor'd the sight of a woman, worse than of a Toad: The Devil though, that old Serpent, made many assaults upon, and grievously tempted, him night and day; for two months he valiantly resisted him by fasting, prayer, and providently putting himself under St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s protection: At length, it so fell out, that his Father fell desperately sick, and above all things desired to have one sight of this long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented son before his death, which would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101827:79"/>
be hastned and ascertained to him, if he had it not. The scrupulous vertue of the man was such, as (had not all the Convent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him) he would sooner have suffered his father to dye for sorrow, than run the hazard of coming where a Female might happen to be: Over-ruled, home he went: After a while, a Sister of his (who, at his going away, had not age enough to bear a Temptation about her, but was now a very Miracle for beauty) and he, from adverse-sides of the sick mans bed, met with their bare hands, whilst they were performing some necessary office about him: the touch set him all in a flame, and that so burnt up all devout inclinations in him, as, after their Fathers recovery, he lingred there a long time without thought of returning to the Monastery, till as well shame, as his Parents commands, drove him back: But, alas! he was there so perdidly given up to that new and vile affection, as after some while, he, knowing where the Keys lay, resolved to steal out by night, and run all hazards for its satisfaction: This he attempted several times, yet was still so led in a maze, that he could never light on the place where the Keys were, but run from place to place, till morning overtook him. And what, think we, was the cause of this? He had in his Cell the Image of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and every day on bended knees before it, did
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101827:80"/>
commend himself to the protection of that Saint; and therefore, that his admirable cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency might be known to all, he kept him from perpetrating the evil he intended: Till seeing him obstinately bent, he appeared to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother holy man of that fraternity, and sent him to tell this erring sheep, that (for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence he accustomed to do him) he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto secured him: but, if he gave not over his folly quickly, he would throw him out of his protection. The admonition was scorn'd, the poor Monk derided as an idle dreamer, and the next night the Keys were found, and the man let loose to reap the shame and danger of his attempt: But yet St. <hi>Hierom</hi> (for he still kept some kind of Devotion towards him) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got him not; he suffer'd him to make this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of his folly for his own good: By his intercession it was, the man came afterwards to true penitence, and underwent such auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities for years almost two, as is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; dying, at length, very happily.</p>
               <p>9. Take notice of a certain Priest-Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals story, <hi>Andreas</hi> by name. He, dying at <hi>Rome,</hi> was accompanied to his Grave by the whole Clergy, people, and his Holiness to boot; all on a sudden the Corps stood up, as from sleep. Whereupon, the Pope (which of them, tell you that can, for my Author fails me here) puts all out, and enters into conference with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101827:80"/>
revived <hi>Andrew,</hi> who tells him, That whilst he stood at Gods Tribunal, and was even go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be transmitted into everlasting torments, for the excess in meat, drink, and fine clothes, he had given himself unto, a certain man more glorious than the Sun, and whiter than Snow, whom he understood by others that stood by to have been St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> came, and with bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knees supplicated the Judge, that his soul might return again into the body, which was granted and done, in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
               <p>10. Worse fared poor Cardinal <hi>Caelestinus,</hi> who being (it seems) an emulator and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> on a day when they had a great meeting (in the Conclave, I suppose) used some rash and audacious expressions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; upon which he was suddenly taken with horrible pain in his Bowels; and thinking to get ease, by the ordinary way of evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, retired himself, where he extruded guts and life together, never more returning to his Companions.</p>
               <p>These are, doubtless, Phancies of too gross and course a thred, to work up an acceptable Devotion, or a reasonable service withal: But we'l go a little farther, and see whether those Ejaculations, and Orasons, they bestow on (or rather throw against) the Mother of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, be such, as she is at all like to take in good part.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After all this, deserves it not a full Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, That it is expresly hinted (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 30.) that <hi>God only knows the hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men?</hi> and this spoken in direct reference to the Duty of Prayer.</p>
               <p>We have good information from <hi>Matthew,</hi> our honest Monk of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> in what chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel the Zeal, Devotions, Pietie, Learning, and Studies of that Age (<hi>viz.</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second) did run. To say nothing of all that bustle and disquiet this Kingdom suffered about the Rights, Privileges, Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, Jurisdictions of Abbies and Bishopricks,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101827:82"/>
whereby he renders the Designs, Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Imperiousness of <hi>Rome</hi> so plain, that one who runs may read, and discover, That they were both new and unjust. Let us here transcribe, as near as we can to his own sence, a Story or two, <hi>ejusdem farinae,</hi> of the same frame with those already noted.</p>
               <p>It was in those days that one <hi>Godric,</hi> brought up at first a Pedlar, then a Merchant, would leave all and go a Pilgrim to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> return'd from thence, he must foot it to <hi>Rome;</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also will not stay behind; whom he dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried upon his back as often as any rugged or uneasie way opposed it self. This journey happily effected, he brings back to his aged Father his long absent Wife again: But im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately betakes himself to an Hermit's Life. Passing therefore out of <hi>Northfolk</hi> (for there he had his Nativity) Northward, he comes at length to <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and there by a Kinsman was presented with a <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Psalter; which in a short time, he was able not only to read, but say all without Book. Then he slips from all his acquaintance, and to the wild Woods he goes, which afford him herbs and fruit, his only sustenance for a great while. The ravenous wild Inhabitants of Desarts, (that is, Wolves, Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) would often come and look him in the face, and so quietly pass away. On a certain day, he stumbled upon a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101827:83"/>
certain Den or Cave, into which as he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, he heard one bid him, by name, <hi>Welcome;</hi> whilest he returned the salute, by name too, to old <hi>Ailric,</hi> though they had never seen, or heard of one the other, in their lives before. Well; the space of two years, these two made a shift to live together: And then <hi>Ailric</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to his departure, <hi>Godric</hi> solemnly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures (by what warrant is worth a <hi>Quaere</hi>) the Soul of his Comrade, that it should not leave that feeble Body, without giving him notice. Very shortly after <hi>Ailric</hi> breathes his last, and something of a round form, after the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a fervid, burning wind (this is the first time I have ever noted a Similitude given to wind) all shining like clear glass, and encircl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round with incomparable white, appeared to <hi>Godric:</hi> But yet (as our Author with great modesty and prudence adds) it is beyond any man's reach absolutely to explicate <hi>Modum Qualitatis Animae. Ailric</hi> is now committed to the Dust, and <hi>Godric</hi> comes back again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cell, to listen what God will farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal unto him, as to his future Course of life. After many Prayers, not only a Voice, but St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> appearing, tells him, It will be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to go the second time to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and promises he will be his Adjutor and Patron, not only in all things during that journey, but afford him a safe place to serve God
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101827:83"/>
in (<hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Finchale</hi>) upon his return.</p>
               <p>Let us briefly post over that Peregrination, which cost him many a weary step, and meet him again in <hi>Esk-dale,</hi> where he had (forgetful, as should seem, of St. <hi>Cuthberts</hi> invitation) an huge mind to settle; for he built him a little Hut of Boughs and Sods, where he continued a year and some months; till the rough-hewn Lord of the Soyl gave him Disturbances so many, that he removed to <hi>Durham.</hi> There he again conn'd his Psalter with other Hymns and Prayers, till he had got learning even to his own Wish. He took a walk, on a certain time, to a Neighbour Grove, and heard a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Shepherd calling his fellows, to go water their Flocks at <hi>Finchale. Godric,</hi> hearing this, gave the poor fellow all he had (an half-penny) to be his guide to that place: got thither, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens into the thickest of all the Wood, and is encountred by an huge fierce wolf, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced the tearing him to pieces: But <hi>Godric</hi> well aware that it was the Project of the old Serpent (shewing him the sign of the Cross) adjured him, in the name of the Trinity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, which the Beast did, crouching on his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious knees, as if he had begged pardon. Thus far well: But let us now see at what rate this Man of God sets himself to do him service at <hi>Finchale.</hi> Upon those banks of <hi>Were</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Durham</hi> gave him lieve to erect a little
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101827:84"/>
Cottage, where he inhabited among wild Beasts only; not unfrequently the Devil presented himself to his view, in the shape of a Bear or Lyon (the only mention that I find of wild ones in <hi>England,</hi> but take it as it comes to me) of a Bull, or a Wolf. He laid, to tame his flesh, not upon any bed, but on an hair-Cloth upon the cold ground: Nay, (because Satan tempted him often that way) to suppress the burnings of lust, he would (besides other severe remedies) on frostie snowie nights stand up to the neck in the River, offering himself (in that manner) a Sacrifice to God, and reciting Prayers and Psalms. Yet, even in this posture the Devil was often busie about his (only not immersed) head; but, when he seemed ready to rush up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and overwhelm him, he was sure to set him packing by the sign of the Cross.</p>
               <p>On a certain day (for I must needs keep to our Author's words) whilst he was sitting in his Oratory, and ruminating on (this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phrase) his Psalter; a little boy seemed to come out at the mouth of his Crucisix, and go straight into the lap of the Virgin's Image, which was placed on the North-side, and bow'd it self so much to help her child up, that the beam it stood on seemed to threaten a fall, and ruin to the whole Structure, both at his ascent and descent; but after three hours time, he crope quietly in again, whence he had come out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:101827:84"/>At another time he saw two fair persons of the female Sexe standing at the corners of his Altar: He stood amazed, yet observed them well, and sometimes bowed himself, and said his prayers. At length they drew near to him, and she that had stood on the right hand, said; <hi>Godric,</hi> knowest thou not me? He replying; Lady, that's a thing none can do, but he to whom thou wilt reveal it. The Virgin answered; Thou hast said right: I am the Mother of Christ; and by my aid thou maist obtain his favour: That other is <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the Apostoless of the Apostles. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric</hi> did all his Devoyrs, committed himself for ever to her Patronage: They went off stroking his head, and leaving an admirably sweet Scent behind them.</p>
               <p>Whether it were at this time or no, I do not certainly find; but the blessed Virgin did not only present to <hi>Godric,</hi> but sang to him, as well as taught him to sing, a short Song; which he by often repeating, committed to safe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thus it went:

               <p>He that would master the Original must stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Chaucer</hi> a long time; but in our <hi>Matthew's</hi> plain Latin it sounds thus:
<q>
                     <l>Sancta <hi>Maria,</hi> Christi Thalamus,</l>
                     <l>Virginalis Puritas, Matris Flos;</l>

                     <l>Due me ad foelicitatem Cum solo Deo.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in my plainer English thus:
<q>
                     <l>Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> Christ's Bed,</l>
                     <l>Virginal Purity, Flower of thy Mother;</l>
                     <l>Blot out mine Offences, reign in me</l>
                     <l>Guide me to Felicity, where God only is.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether this were likely to be either sent from Heaven, or fit to be sent towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, let the Reader judge: We must return to our Hermite. The Parents of one only Daughter, his Neighbours brought (in a sack) their dead Child, beseeching him to trie if he could not restore its life. The humble man (far from holding himself worthy to work such a miracle) seemed not to heed, and went out to his accustomed work. They had shak'd
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101827:85"/>
the Corpse out on the floor: finding it at his return, he fell to his Prayers, and continued his importunities, till on the third day he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Girl coming towards him, as he was prostrate at the Altar, and delivered her to her joyful Father and Mother. This was done at our Lord's Altar; but, lest our Ladies Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar be thought to come short, know, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid another dead male Child on it, their Son came smiling off to the admiring old people.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Godric</hi> (having lived threescore long years in this Wilderness) had two sore bouts more with <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> He betook him to his Bed the last eight; not able to stir without lifting: Two Divels come suddenly, and (hale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bed and all) said, they would hurry him into Hell for a doting old man, that had out-lived all his wisdom, and was become a fool. But he fortified himself with the sign of the Cross, and upon his prayer they quit the place.</p>
               <p>The last Encounter I find recorded was thus. He laid, one day, all alone upon his Bed; those that used to be about him, heard him (though then at some distance) calling aloud: They found him, lying all along on the floor naked; after they had laid him in bed again, they askt him, Why he would do so? He replied; The Devil came on me so suddenly that I had not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101827:86"/>
time to hold up my Cross; shewing them a lump upon his head, which he had got by that Malignant's so violent thrusting him against a Block. At length, he found Death there, and lies buried in the North-side of his Oratory, below the Steps of St. <hi>John Baptist's</hi> Altar.</p>
               <p>The same Author affords us a trim relation, concerning a certain Monk of <hi>Evesham,</hi> who (having by a voluntary abstinence and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not only neglected, but done outrage to his body) fell at last into a Temptation, (as <hi>Matthew</hi> styles it, and so he might well.) He must needs know, by some extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, what the treatment of Souls was presently upon their dissolution. To this end, he makes importunate Applications to Christ, to the blessed Virgin, but with special expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> his intercession. At length, that Saint manuducts him into three or four sorts of Purgatories, where he finds se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his known friends, under divers sorts of inexpressible Punishments, which (as some of them said) they must undergo till the day of Judgment, unless (before that) either the Justice of God were fully satisfied by their sufferings, or the munificent Devotions of the living gave them freedom. Then going on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe (for such as had attained that immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) pleasant Fields <hi>&amp;c.</hi> just like those the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Poets, or Poetick Philosophers
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101827:86"/>
(long since) made for the old Heathen. But in order to this Discovery, and to confirm the poor delirous Monk in a belief, that what he should see (touching this) was infallible, he must first find, behind the Altar dedicated to St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> in their Oratory, a Cross, which they used to adore, on such a day: With joy enough, it comes to pass even so: He falls a kissing the mouth and eyes of this Crucifix: when (by and by) he felt something (with a grateful warmness) trickle down upon his face, and wiping it off with his hand, he found it Pure blood. Well; beyond measure (now) transported, he saw flow from the Image full as much as a Phlebotomist would ordinarily take, when he had struck a Vein: Whereupon (though he were not sure whether he might sin in so doing, yet) he could not chuse but swallow down a little thereof; but the rest he carefully preserved. What is (let me tell you) very strange, this weak decrepid Man could not merit to have all these Celestial discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, till he had not only undergone the usual Discipline of Rods, from the Fraternity; but, not till he had received (I know not how many) lashes (six times over) from the hands of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> himself, who, it seems (or else the Monk was mistaken) afforded him both Instruction and Correction, in manner and form aforesaid. <hi>Vide</hi> Matth. Paris <hi>circa Annum</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I cannot but here insert what I find our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor very intent upon in two several places; The Fate of <hi>William Rufus.</hi> This King had (indeed) not only a close hand, but something an heavy hand towards the Clergy, especially Abbots, and in time of their Vacancies would often keep them long in his own hands (indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced perhaps thereto by what he had seen in the days of his Father, when he of St. <hi>Albans</hi> put fair for the depriving <hi>William</hi> the first of his newly setled Royalty.) For this, these Men, from whom nothing of God's secret Judgment must be concealed, tell us; That the very night before <hi>Rufus</hi> received his deaths wound (by the glance of an Arrow from a Tree) in the new Forest, <hi>Anselm</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop had an admirable Vision; and thus it was. All the English Saints in Heaven put up a complaint against the King; Almighty God (in wrath) bids St. <hi>Alban</hi> draw near, gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand a burning Dart, and bids him take revenge (for himself and all the rest) upon the Tyrant. He takes it, throws it down to the Earth, and gives Satan commission to put all in execution. Well, <hi>William</hi> is slain, and his dead Body, at the same hour, met two days journey from the place by the Earl of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal</hi> (I do not remember any such Title on foot at that time) on the back of a shag-hair'd,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101827:87"/>
ugly, black Goat. The Earl adjur'd the beast to speak what that was: It replied; He was carrying <hi>William Rufus</hi> to his Judgment. Yet, we are informed too (by honest <hi>Matthew</hi> as well as by all other Historians) That his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was solemnly interr'd (the very next day after he was slain) at <hi>Winchester.</hi> Do but lie all this together, and you will find somewhat (I can tell you) worth your noting.

               <p>Touching it, I cannot but make two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</p>
               <p>1. That it is not true, what some Papists (when they would insinuate (to such as they endeavour to make Proselytes) that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning Prayer to Saints is an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent safe thing) do affirm: <hi>viz.</hi> That they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101827:88"/>
never pray to them for spiritual Grace, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>2. That it is a strange thing they should publickly authorize, in a prayer, such a Clause, as is very stiffly denied by one half, I believe, of their Church; <hi>viz.</hi> That the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin was not born with Original sin: or, That her own Conception was immaculate.</p>
               <p>Such a Reverence towards the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as exerts it self in thanks to God for them, and excites in us a desire to follow their good examples, all Christians, doubtless, are bound to retain: But with such Sacrifices as the voluntary and culpable humility of Multitudes, have, it seems, obtruded on them, 'tis as certain, they themselves are far from being well, or at all, pleased.</p>
               <p>If the present <hi>Romanists</hi> will owne practices, like these above; their next Task is to defend them: If they disclaim them, they must disprove the relations: In both Cases, we are not without something more to say.</p>

               <p>THere is no Controversie, wherein I found it more difficult to give my thoughts a settlement, than this. It was, strongly, the dictate of my Nature, not to omit any Office, which might possibly avail a dear departed friend: It was, hugely, my inclination to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject my Judgment to the Dictates of Antiquity: And, indeed, the Writings of some, justly to be reputed Fathers old enough, are not without Expressions, such as, taken in gross, and at first view, may seem to lean towards the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Romish Church.</p>
               <p>But, upon the most sollicitous scrutinies I have been able to make, little is the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, betwixt its Doctrine, and the Notions of those Venerable Persons. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (in his second Book and 18th. Chapter of <hi>Purgatory</hi>) will have it to be most certain, that Prayers bring no advantage either to the blessed or damned; only, then, to such as he places in Purgatory. But a man with half an eye may discover, That those laudatory Nominations, those gratulatory Commemorations, those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Options, which, here and there, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in the Antient Doctors, with reference to the deceased, had no design to kindle that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101827:89"/>
imaginary Fire, which hath, since, been made so terribly to Flame in the faces of departing Souls; unless, by a liberal Donation, they would make the Pot to boil lustily in the Pope's Kitchin.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Augustine</hi> seems (<hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. of his <hi>Confessions</hi>) rather to indulge himself (newly got from under some extraordinary transports upon the death of his Mother) than to give determinate Laws for a necessary rite: For having signified his full belief, that the thing he prayed for was done already; He intreats Almighty God (not without something of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitancy) to approve <hi>Voluntaria cordis sui,</hi> words too feeble to sustain half the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures that <hi>Rome</hi> would rear thereupon. In another place he solemnly professeth, That having wearied themselves to find out what manner of sins those could be, which should impede our Admission into Heaven, and yet receive pardon by the Intercessions of our friends remaining on this Earth, he was not able to attain the knowledge thereof; and gives us lieve (elsewhere) to dissent from him, where there is not evident Scripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve our Faith into: of which sort their own <hi>Bredenbachius</hi> doth acknowledge, the Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sacrifices for the dead to be. <hi>Vide</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's <hi>Appeal, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> praying for <hi>Caesarias,</hi> since
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101827:89"/>
                  <hi>Ambrose,</hi> praying for <hi>Theodosius,</hi> do at the same time profess a confidence that the Persons did possess <hi>Christi requiem:</hi> Nay since we read of certain Liturgies wherein, not only Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, but even for the blessed Mother of our Lord were inserted (yea and termed Sacrifices too;) what can we judge, but that those addresses were either merely gratulatory, or proceded more from the Zeal they had of expressing their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to those parties, than from any settled opinion of their necessity. The truth is, a Phancie had then got some footing, which will not now generally pass for Orthodox, either with them or us, <hi>viz.</hi> That Souls (of best Saints) departed were reserved in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court of Heaven (not in the Verge of Hell, nor under Satan's Jurisdiction, let this be noted by the way) before they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the full fruition of God, nay even till the Resurrection of the Body.

               <p>WHether it be a Sacrament or no is not here the Question.

               <p>Amongst the Genuine Concomitants of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance St. <hi>Paul</hi> enumerates (with <hi>godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, indignation, fear</hi>) also <hi>Revenge:</hi> And, in some other places, and cases, we understand <hi>Restitution, Reparation, Satisfaction</hi> to take place; but, in reference to all these, there may be a dead flie, to make them justly stink in the nostrils of God; yea, there may be (and 'tis to be feared the thing falls out too often) Death in the Pot. Where the conscience is guilty of, and the Church scandaliz'd by enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, it is absolutely necessary (so far as means or opportunities are given) to be much in exercise of such good works and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as are contrary to the vices we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given up unto; both to ascertain peace at home, and to cause others to say of us, as 'twas said of <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> Our sins that were

many are shewn to be remitted, for we love much. But, if Queen <hi>Alfrida,</hi> or <hi>Leofwin</hi> (who were both deep dyed in bloud guiltiness) give liberally to build Monasteries, under a belief that by the merit of the work, they might leave this world in safety, and escape the punishment due to those crimes, after dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or that the Prayers, there to be ratled over by the living Monks, should merit remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for them, being already dead: There was, sure, an horrible indignity offered <hi>to our great High-Priest, who, by once offering himself, hath perfected for ever, those that are sanctified</hi> (Heb. 10. 12, 14.) There's no doubt, but it's universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a duty, to curb the flesh, to keep under the body, and so to bridle the appetite, as to bring them under the yoke of obedience; yet, if any Monk, Anchorite, or other person (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you may see many Examples in <hi>Matth. Paris</hi>) should macerate his carcase, and deny himself all use of wholesome food, till he becomes fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Enthusiastical dosings; at last (when he felt the infallible prodromes of approaching death) engaging the whole Convent to flea him unmercifully with Rods; from a conceipt, that (merely) for such Penances here, he should escape wrath to come, or deserve a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Glory; what can we say, or think, but that he was, in a manner, <hi>Felo de se;</hi> and that the best he shall, at any time, hear from

               <p>His own Paraphrase, on what he had said, cannot deceive me, in the sence I ought to give them.

And, since he declares (<hi>vers.</hi> 35.) after he had termed himself <hi>the Bread of Life,</hi> that <hi>whoso cometh to him</hi> (which is the peculiar act of Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.) <hi>shall never hunger;</hi> and, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes most clearly, in pursuit still of the same Metaphor, <hi>the quenching of thirst</hi> to <hi>believing,</hi> as well in that place, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37, 38, 39. I
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101827:92"/>
can doubt no more concerning the matter. He takes not off their amazement, nor gives stop to their murmurs (<hi>vers.</hi> 61.) by assuring them; That, though they were to see him ascend up where he was before; yet they were ere long to have him corporally present, in the form of Bread, upon ten thousand Altars at once; nay, in the very jaws of every person (how wicked soever) that comes but to eat there: He does not, I say, make his return, at this rate, but instructs them how to spiritualize the whole business, in their apprehensions; as is evident from <hi>vers.</hi> 62, 63. Neither would any thing obscure or difficult be found in the words of institution, afterwards; for (besides that Christ had, as we see in this Chapter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and pre-instructed his hearers) there was almost nothing among the Jews, which had Type, or significancie in it, but was expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this manner: Circumcision, the Pascal Lamb, Manna, the Rock were all sufficiently known to carry the names of those things they did but adumbrate. If we may believe St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> (in <hi>Psal.</hi> 98.) with the most holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Not the flesh which was crucified, is carnally eaten; but the vertues of that flesh are, really, eaten by the Soul, in such manner as the soul can eat; that is, spiritually, by her affections, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immanent real Acts, or internal Operations.</hi>

               <p>ALL that dust, wherewith the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would blear our eyes, in reference to the use of Images, is easily blown away by the breath of that one Text, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 15) which plainly speaks no less, than that it is mainly the mind and intent of God, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, severely to prohibite all representations of him in his worship. The well-meaning Papist makes, perhaps, full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, that he worships not the Image, but God (or some Saint) by the Image: But, let them know, that most of their great Doctors have determined it lawful (yea, absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary) to terminate a religious worship in the Image it self; and that even <hi>it</hi> is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with the same sort of Devotion, as is due to the Anti-Type: For instance; If it be the Image of a Saint, I must adore it with <hi>Doulia;</hi> If of God, with <hi>Latria.</hi> In this doughty dispute, they have been so keen and eager, as whoever notes it, can be no more, surely, of opinion that Romanists are (more than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants) at unity amongst themselves.</p>

We have, farther, a clear caution, that we expose not (by too easie a credulity) our selves to such deceptions (<hi>Mark</hi> 13. 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 11.). We have, too, an evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that it should so fall out; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the Earths inhabitants should be led away by the prevalencie of certain stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works done by such as were, nevertheless, great Impostors (<hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 13, 14, 15.). We read again, of some that were casters out of Devils, yet followed not Christ (<hi>Mark</hi> 9. 38, 39.) And if we should follow them into Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which are without the concurrence of his Word (whether this be the case or no, betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and us, may be decided elsewhere) we might easily go astray. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> tell us, (<hi>cap<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

                  </hi> And this leads us on to enquire after <hi>Historical</hi> discoveries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:101827:94"/>2. Whence, it will not be hard to learn what the Church, in times ancient enough, held as to this question. It was, evidently, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion (of old) that the ordinarie working of Miracles ceased, when the Apostles deceased: That they were of use to allure Heathens, and Unbelievers then; but, not to be expected, or singly relyed on, for the determination of a controverted Point, where Christianty has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been setled: That they have been done by some persons (in justification of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents) when Truth was not on that side: That they may, indeed, soberly be eyed, as a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Testimony (where it pleases God they happen) for establishment of a Truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures; but, not for the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of any belief or practice, without or against it. As to the former of these, <hi>Gregory,</hi> commonly called <hi>the Great,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about <hi>an.</hi> 600, hath affirmed; That, <hi>as water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to young Plants is necessary; but not to root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oakes: so Miracles to the infant Church, but not when grown up (Hom. in Evang.</hi> 43.) And St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> about two Ages before, makes a wonder, not only at, but of those that pinn'd their faith on wonders. That reverend <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> has taught me to say after him; <hi>Against the Miracle-mungers</hi> (he meant the Donatists) <hi>the Lord hath made me cautious by saying,</hi> In the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101827:94"/>
last times, false Prophets shall arise, and shall shew signs and wonders, but take heed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I have told you (<hi>Tom.</hi> 29. <hi>Tract.</hi> 13. in <hi>Jo.) Mark</hi> 13. 22, 23, 24. The false Prophets there said to do signs and wonders, were not to be Ethnicks, without Christ, but only to obtrude false Christs, or a fallacious way to him. What need we say more, than what we have full and clear authority for, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22.) signs are not to them that do believe, but to them that believe not?</p>
               <p>That great wonders have been done, or at least undeniably urged, by some that had not right on their side, may visibly be made good, from the Testimony of <hi>Bede,</hi> who informs us, that the argument from Miracle-working was very rife, on both parts, in that grand contest about the time of celebrating <hi>Easter, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. 16, 29. This may serve, as to the two first enquiries: and so let us pass to the third Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I would know, since sundry other miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous operations, as well as casting out Devils, are enumerated, in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. and said to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany those that were sent; why do not our Romish Priests appropriate and take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all the rest, as well as that domination over unclean Spirits? Let us hear them, having never been taught, speak with strange
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101827:95"/>
Tongues; let us see them, unhurt, touch all sorts of venomous Creatures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let them shew us that, immediately and infallibly, they can cure all manner of Diseases. For, I see not any differences in the Grant, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional end, or in the time of continuance. Again, the Promise may seem made to all true Believers, not restrain'd to Priests only: and it's more than probable, that those Exorcists (<hi>Mark</hi> 9. 38.) were not in Orders; Why then do they monopolize it, and think themselves as sure of it as the Coats on their backs? We acknowledge, there was, in the infant-Churches, a sort of Faith sometimes found, even amongst miss-believers, which was productive of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable events; (not of Satan's operation nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) This Faith having for its object only that essential Attribute of God, his Power, and relying thereon by a strenuous Act of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, particular to that business, impetrated frequently then (and may peradventure do so yet sometimes) wonderful things at his hands; though neither the Person, nor the Cause stood upon a right foot. St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> not denying but the Hereticks of his time might do true Miracles (I mean, things strange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond understanding) forbore not though to dehort his people from listening to them upon that accompt, as may be seen, <hi>Tract. de Unit. Eccles. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. Why may not we
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101827:95"/>
also, though we should see wonders done, (even such as are mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.) bring them to the Test of Gods Word, and require proof from thence, that those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines designed for establishment thereby are true?</p>
               <p>4. But let us in the last place do what we can to see through the <hi>darkness of their practice.</hi> And, seriously, we can hardly be brought to think, that to out the Devil of his hold, is the common, usual effect of their <hi>Sprinklings, Fumings, Crossings;</hi> of their <hi>Beatings</hi> with the Priestly stole, <hi>repetitions</hi> of <hi>Latin Words,</hi> &amp;c. since we find not any of all these used by Christ, nor instituted to any such end. Again, we must not, nor can forget, what palpable collusions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts they have been found to use in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every place, where they met with any body that durst but peep under the veil, they at such times do hang before the eyes of the vulgar. Let the boy of <hi>Bilson</hi> (as yet, I think, living a Shooemaker in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi>) speak. And it is not so very long ago (about a dozen years) since a most gross cheat, of this sort, was re-acted, and fully discover'd at <hi>New-Castle</hi> upon <hi>Tine.</hi> But, whoever shall peruse the twenty fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>THe bitter Contests which had arose, and for some Ages continued, betwixt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and <hi>Manacheean, Pelagian,</hi> but especially the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereticks, had now alienated the minds of men, one from another, interrupted the correspondences they used formerly to hold, and so shaken the Foundations, laid by the first Master-Builders; when the sudden rise of the <hi>Sarazen</hi> in the East, and the violent rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of other Barbarians upon the Western Empire, had either induced or compelled the most (for the sense of danger is more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ordinarily, in temporal than in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Concerns) to suspend the care of Religion, and lay it out more sedulously about their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Condition. It pleased the most High to permit those Infidels to prevail to such a degree, as the World was (in a manner) turn'd up-side down: And, amongst those violent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, Theology was forced to seek Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (a thing that might happen to the greater part, since we know, 'twas so here in this Island,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101827:97"/>
upon the Invasions of <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi>) so, as it was not easie to retain, either Principles or Practices right. It's, beyond exception, certain, That by those Perturbations, Barbarism got so much the upper hand in the Common-wealth of Learning, that what we have in writing, from that time till <hi>Erasmus,</hi> is (the most of it) very litte above Pedantry; and it's probably true, That the marrow of Religion was (so far) consumed, amidst these broils, as the drie Bones thereof were much without life.</p>
               <p>From the days of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> downward, a kind of Lethargick Temper, as to the more Spiritual part, did strangely, by little and little, insinuate it self; till at last, the total of the <hi>Credenda</hi> was summed up in the <hi>Romish</hi> High Priest's supposed <hi>Infallibility:</hi> And, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreable thereto, the <hi>Agenda</hi> consisted in <hi>Pilgrimages,</hi> made Meritorious by his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>Offerings,</hi> paid to Saints of his Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, in <hi>Prayers</hi> to relieve Souls out of a <hi>Purgatory</hi> of his Erection, in seeking after <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> for Sin and <hi>Indulgences,</hi> of his Invention. It was not hard to rivet these perswasions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minds of a People, the main body of whom was either lately converted, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably perverted. Neither yet do I believe that every particular Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry singular great Man, who cooperated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Introduction of these things, did
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101827:97"/>
act absolutely contrary to their Consciences, or merely by Rules of Policy (though the course of story informs us sufficiently, that many of them were of such Frame) but, one may, without violence (I hope) offered to Reason, Truth, or Charity, entertain a Conjecture, That, after their hold of right Notions was lost, their very Judgment might suffer depravation, and lead them to build with Hay, and Stubble, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of more precious and durable Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. However it came to pass (letting the contract with wicked <hi>Phocas,</hi> the Forgery of Decrees and Donations alone, till the review of the last day) we find the Pontifical See, in the 9th. and 10th. Century, arrived at this height, to tread upon the Necks of Princes, to suffer them to hold his Stirrop, to dispense with Oaths of Allegiance, to arm not only their Subjects, but their Sons against them, and, by an unheard of Example, to kick off, or trample on their Crowns and Scepters; whilest the Parish Priests stuff'd their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, with wonderful relations of Visions, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, Revelations, which solitary Monks or voluntary Hermites (those first Enthusiasts) obtruded on the World; all tending either to advance the Reputation, or inhance the Revenues of the Clergy. For, who would not lie at the feet of such men, as (as they conceived) did, ever and anon, bring them
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101827:98"/>
News from Heaven? Or, who would not lie out their worldly Substance in such ways as (those men taught them) were available to the Redemption (out of a firie Lake) of their own and all their Friends Souls?

During the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders brought upon Christendom (touched before) the Writings of the Primitive Fathers were lock'd up in the privatest retirements of Monasteries, rarely seen by the Sun; where they suffered a greater Corruption than of Moths, and were taught (in several things) to speak the Language of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> after the Tone, and in the Tune of the Superstitions growing more and more Epidemical: A great Instance whereof I have, now, by me, an Episte pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s (bound up with the 3d. part of St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s) but without any thing that savours either of his Style, Spirit, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

               <p>OF all the Rules that ever were given to judge of Religions by, you offer me the most fallacious, <hi>The Examples of Professors:</hi> For, if the Austerity and strictness of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be it, we must look after; the <hi>Bonzi</hi> amongst the <hi>Chinoyse</hi> carry it away from all I read of. If we must go to preciseness of Conversation, or demure carriage, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Quaker might lay before us a great temptation. But, to speak seriously, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life, being the great Duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian, is, doubtless, too, a grand Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any Church; and that Religion, the Principles whereof do most effectually lead to sincerity therein, does deserve to bear away the Bell. Yet to constitute the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any man (the outside whereof only is to us descernible) the main Guide in Religious Elections, cannot be other than a most unsafe course.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:101827:99"/>'Tis the Roman Examples of Life (not the Controvertists) you would have me to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template: Well! But here you must not be allowed, to appropriate in gross to your side (a Conceit I have always observed you apt to take up at adventure) the Fathers of the Primitive Church, who had served their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, before you put your Tenents (those, I mean, wherein we do not, nor dare go along you) as a Law upon the World: No! You may find them, in a matter of Twelve or Thirteen Points, wherein we think you Innovators, more Ours than so.</p>
               <p>I suppose, then, the best way, to apply your Directions to our purpose, will be, by examining the Lives of Popes, to discover, whether they have been universally endued with Cardinal Vertues. Inform your self, I pray, by your own Historians (for such words from my pen might look like Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) what pretious men your Church was headed with, in the Persons of <hi>John</hi> the Thirteenth, <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, <hi>John</hi> the Twenty third, <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth. What great Scholars, the late <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, and before him many others of them were? Is there any Credit to be given <hi>Plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nÃ¡,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:101827:99"/>
who acquaints us freely, That all the Popes, from <hi>Sylvester</hi> the Second, to <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Seventh, in number about eighteen, were, What? heark in your Ear, and I'le tell you, <hi>Magicians.</hi> Can we stop our Ears against the out-cries of all <hi>Germany,</hi> about the Hundred Grievances (some of them thwackers?) We cannot hood-wink our selves so much as not to discover, a little, how things have gone, seeing we find Cardinal <hi>Julian</hi> telling <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, That all Councils, since that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> have been instituted, Not for the Investigation of Truth, but for the defence or increase of Power to Clergy-men.</p>
               <p>Will you suffer us to put any weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a known Saying of St. <hi>Basil</hi>'s; where, in his Tenth Epistle, he tells <hi>Nazianzen</hi> thus; <hi>If the Wrath of God continue, what help shall we have from those Westerlings</hi> (so he terms them of <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>who neither know the Truth, nor can endure to be taught it?</hi> If this be the case, and I were to chuse a Religion; I do seriously think, I might close in with any, now upon the face of the earth (that does not in plain Terms deny the Lord who bought us) less timorously than with <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:101827:100"/>I am somewhat confident, and do hold it for a great Truth (which I speak nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther timorously, nor temerariously) That the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, and the <hi>Turkish</hi> Arms, which pull'd all other things, where they came, down; lifted up the Pope (by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and Divine Permission) into his Chair.</p>
               <p>For the Eastern Prelates, and men of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, being under persecutions at home, had a safe retreit into the West: And therefore made that Patriarch their <hi>Asylum:</hi> In order to which, or by way of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for benefits received, they often made the frame of their addressive Epistles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of complemental Elogies; these (being no more than what the kindness and hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, wherewith they had been entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did seem to deserve) were yet due only to the Persons, then sitting at the Stern (nor farther intended:) But, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, cunningly made use of, and represented to the Credulous World for the Popes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>One Observation more, and I have done.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (or at least her darling Sons the Jesuites) will have the Pomise of Christ, That the holy Spirit shall
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101827:100"/>
lead his People into all Truth, to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended unto that very Moment, wherein their Bishop shall assent to the Results of a Council; and the performance to depend on this Contingency (amongst a many more) whether he will (at all) confirm them or no: Then, at last, they judge them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, when the Pope, either present or absent, signifies his pleasure so to declare them. Well! But <hi>Liberius</hi> (as above hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) himself confirmed the <hi>Arrian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions of the Council at <hi>Sermium.</hi> And the Pope had his Deputies at <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Constance,</hi> those Decrees were confirmed by the Apostolick Letters of <hi>Eugenius.</hi> Yet I suppose few Romanists will grant, these were infallible: And I think we may continue our Opinion upon good ground, That the Roman Bishop's Vote is but a sandy Foundation to build our Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I shall, last of all, request you, not to refuse your joyning with me in those Words of our (and I think too of your) Liturgy:</p>
               <p>
