            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Now I have in part drawn, to the knowledge of all, your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitudes, yet not one hundred part of what they are, and for their hainousness deserve onely a Pen of Steel, to Record them in the wrinkled brow of time, there to remain to posterity.</hi>

            <p>Give me leave to expostulate with you, for I in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and as an <hi>English</hi> man, cannot but pay that duty which I in honour owe to this famous Nation, but ask who made you so far our Surveyors, as to limit out the extent of their conveniencies, that are found to have laid out themselves to purchase yours?</p>
            <p>Was ever so high an intrusion offered, as for a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prescribe how another should be regulated in matter of Trade, and what Bottoms are fittest to be imployed? Would you not scorn the like Usurpation, though made by your â€” <hi>France,</hi> or new sworn <hi>Ally Denmark,</hi> who for so many years hath ground your faces with a Tole, never yet imposed upon you by our Kings in our Seas?

               <hi>There are three things principally insisted upon, by which the Vnited <hi>Provinces</hi> pretend to have fixed an Obligation upon <hi>England</hi> and expunged their former Score, which nevertheless upon an impartiall debate will rather prove wholly chargeable upon their own account then ours; so far are they from having given a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all the Love, Cost, and Bloud, expended by us in their preservation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is the assistance lent us in <hi>Eighty Eight</hi>

which was no more then the profest Antagonists to the quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> did freely contribute against the common Enemy in the battle of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> who did there oppose the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in relation to their Respective safeties. Besides it was a true received maxime in the wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of <hi>Spain</hi> and holds so still;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he that desires to subdue the Vnited Provinces, must first Conquer</hi> England, <hi>or draw her from their succour</hi>;</p>
            <p>And finding the latter impossible, they fell upon the the other as more feazible.</p>

            <p n="3">3. For the third is your entertainment likewise which you gave his Sacred Majesty in his exile and those of his Loyal Nobility &amp; followers, that run the same hazard with their dear Master in his afflictions, during the Usurpers, the which truly was no more but house room. It is true, you did it, but wherein could you be endangered by it, for by that Act you had only showed some part of your acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements to the living branches, nay the very Images and children of those famous men that had formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in your preservation, but also purchased that, from the Princes in the world, which you could never have

I need not give the Reasons for what I say, I say I need not, for I am sure that there is scarce a Man amongst you all but were the better by it, and you know it too too well ever to demand the same, therefore I shall wave all that touches that matter.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Whether such as do now Foment this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, do not Act the Ingenious Policy of the Wolf in the Fable, that perswaded the Sheep to give over their Mastives?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What other Alliance can afford you so safe Harbourage, in case of foul weather at Sea, as <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi> if none; whether Contingencies driven in by storm under our shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, your <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-India,</hi> and <hi>Straits</hi>-men, may not exceed all the Coals and Tobacco-Prizes <hi>De Rutyer,</hi> or young <hi>Van-Trump,</hi> shall scrape up upon the Sea?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the raising a flying Army in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> may not one time or other be reduced to such a Faction, especially when headed by one that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep the same consort with you; be a great cause of Resolving you into your first Principle of both <hi>Poor, Distressed,</hi> and <hi>Oppressed.</hi> Nay, it may be, further reduce you to be <hi>Vassals</hi> to some of your right or left-hand Neighbours, whose Aim is wholly to Root up that Vine, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is likely to Eclipse their Glories in Traffick and Trade?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If <hi>Venice</hi> may not unproperly be called the Signet on <hi>Neptunes</hi> Right-hand; Whether <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> being in a straight Confederacy, may not be stiled his two Arms? By which, in relation to their Shipping, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the Universe.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98592:13"/>5. Whether your Maiden-Towns, as you call them, may not longer enjoy that Title under the Alliance of <hi>England,</hi> who hath many more rich and beautiful Harbours and Havens then the French King, that cannot brag of the like Plenty, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency for Scituation, by the half?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether your admitting those <hi>Taterdema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Mushrooms</hi> of Fortune, (the French) into your Country, may not conjure up the Old Devil, which they were ever possest of, <hi>to be no mans friend, but for their own end</hi>?

Which if so, I can but smile to think how your High and Mighty Cedars will so Artificially be turn'd into poor and low Shrubs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether the sixth Querie does not come too late?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Whether the making an honourable Peace with <hi>England,</hi> by complying to her Demands, may not be said putting of mony to Interest?</p>
            <p n="9">9. In case it so happens, whether their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes do not cease two dangerous and chargeable Wars, the which if not done, may not (if there be any such thing as a British spirit) be the sole cause of having it said, <hi>Their bloud was upon their own heads?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. If a Candle being extinguisht, whether the snuff is pleasing to any of the senses?</p>

            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Whether the Dutch are not convinced of an heresie that they broacht, that their Highnesses died, and rose again the thirtieth day after?</p>
            <p n="13">13. Lastly, Whether the World may not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Us, and You, sufficient Trade, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding on each others Interests?

If an English-man but fights them, they look as if their eyes would run into their souls, and their souls out of their eyes, for the sight of an English Sword wounds those Water-Rats more sensibly then a stroak, and that's the reason they dam up their Windows with Brandy, and are drunk ever when they engage: Every English man is his <hi>Hogan Mogan,</hi> that dare beat him; and every one that knows him dare do it.
