            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following <hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> contain a full and distinct Answer to the late <hi>Dialogues</hi> of <hi>T.G.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Reader may perceive what an easie Victory, Truth, when it stands its Ground, will obtain over Wit and Subtilty. When the man who fell in the <hi>Olympick Games,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:50112:4"/>
by his Eloquence to perswade the spectators he was never down, it is possible he might meet with some weak and others partial enough to believe him; but the Judges could not but smile at their folly who did not discern the difference between the firmness of the ones stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the others artificial ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; the one might shew more art and dexterity, but the other had more strength or some other advantage. I shall leave the Reader to judge in these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats who maintains his Ground best, and who seeks chiefly to avoid the dis-reputation of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:50112:4"/>
it. He that keeps close to his Adversary, declines no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, uses no reproachful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or disingenuous dealing, hath certainly greater assurance of the Goodness of his Cause and more hopes to prevail; than he that studies for shifts and evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, avoids the strongest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and flyes out into imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent cavils and personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; which are great signs that the man is conscious of the badness of his Cause, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs of success by any other means. And the Author of these Discourses desires that his Adversary and himself may
<pb facs="tcp:50112:5"/>
stand or fall according to these measures.</p>
            <p>As to the manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here used, <hi>viz.</hi> by way of <hi>Dialogue,</hi> it is that which his Adversary led him to; and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, where the decency of it is well observed, it may make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie go down more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly than otherwise it would. For there appears more life and vigour in a Discourse carried on by several persons of different humours and opinions, than in one continued deduction of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And the Author declares he intended no reflection on any sober party of men among us in
<pb facs="tcp:50112:5"/>
the representation made of the <hi>Army-Chaplain,</hi> who bears the third Part in the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;</hi> but only to shew the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Popish Party takes from the weak and peevish ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which some men have made against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and how they insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themselves into them on the account of their prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and have made use of their indiscreet zeal to compass their own ends.</p>
            <p>Which is so far from being a <hi>Romance</hi> or <hi>Fiction,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the footsteps which may be yet traced of these transactions,
<pb facs="tcp:50112:6"/>
by the means and instruments which were imploy'd about them; we find that one of the most busie <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>actors of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n he most confidently denyed the other parts of the late horrid design, did not stick to avow and own this, that they did hope to prevail at last by joyning their strength with the obstinate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters in procuring a General Toleration; which was all the Visible Design they were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, when these Discourses were written. Since which, the face of things hath been so much alter'd among us, and the times appear'd so busie and dangerous,
<pb facs="tcp:50112:6"/>
that it was thought more advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to respite the publishing of these Controversial Discourses till mens minds were a little calmed; lest the Author of them should seem guilty of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent diligence of <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, viz.</hi> of drawing lines in the Dust, when the enemy was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to destroy us.</p>
            <p>Had the Author had any occasion to have run away from the Argument under debate between him and his Adversary, he did not want a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the present state of things, to have put him in mind of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very different from an
<pb facs="tcp:50112:7"/>
               <hi>Irenicum.</hi> But he desired me to acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> that he does so perfectly abhor this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and disingenuous way of writing, especially about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, that he could neither be provok'd nor tempted to it, no not by so great and fresh an Example as he had all along before his eyes.</p>
            <p>May that Wise and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God who hath hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the cruel and malicious designs of our Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, still preserve it under <hi>the shadow of his Wings,</hi> and continue it <hi>a praise in the Earth.</hi>

               <p>Yes; a great many have written for and against it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>

               <speaker>F. C.</speaker>
               <p>To tell you the truth, some of the same who wrote against it heretofore; but they are now more enlightned; as those who wrote against Separation when time was, are now the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for it. For, there are some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Truths, which vary according to circumstances. Do not we see the Papists, who were thought the greatest enemies to toleration in the world, now plead most vehemently for it? and are even angry with us for not acting suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in this cause against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But because I take you for a friend by your enquiring after these Books, I must tell you, it is yet a dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50112:14"/>
point among us, how far we may joyn with <hi>Antichrist,</hi> to promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Christ;</hi> And some insist on that place to prove the unlawfulness of it, <hi>Be ye not unequally yoked;</hi> others again prove it lawful, because it is said, <hi>Yet not altogether with the Fornicators of this world—or with Idolaters:</hi> whence they observe, that they may joyn with them in some things, or for some ends; but <hi>not altogether, i. e.</hi> they must not joyn with them in their <hi>Idolatries,</hi> but they may against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>

               <p>This is too publick a place to talk of these matters in: but may we not withdraw into the next room; for I have a great mind to set you right in this main point of present concernment. And if the <hi>Papists</hi> should be found not to be <hi>Idolaters,</hi> a great part of your difficulty is gone. Do you think, it is not fit for you to be better informed in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when a thing of so great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence depends upon it, as your delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the persecution of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> which you know, we have all sighed and groaned for, a long time. It is in vain for any of you to expect favour from thence, as long as she is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50112:15"/>
able to stand. For if the <hi>Bishops</hi> were never so much inclined to it, how could they possibly give ease to you without destroying themselves? And since the dissenting parties are so different among themselves in their light and attainments, it is impossible to please any one party, without displeasing all the rest. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi> is a meer snare and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Brethren, being a design to prefer some, and to leave the rest in the lurch. Let us all joyn our strengths together, to pull down this <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and then, though there be <hi>a King in</hi> Israel, <hi>every one may do what seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his own eyes.</hi>

               <p>I doubt you are not well seen in Scripture; for the Text is, <hi>In those dayes there was no King in Israel, and every one did what seemed good in his own eyes:</hi> whence you may observe a special hint by the by, that <hi>Toleration</hi> agrees best with a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> But this to your self: and you might justly wonder at this freedom with you; but that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you many years ago, when you and I preached up the Fifth Monarchy together in the Army. Those were glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dayes! Ah the Liberty we then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed! Did we then think, the good
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50112:15"/>
old Cause would ever have ended thus? Well! It is good to be silent in bad times. But methinks you and I howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may retire and talk over old stories, and refresh our memories with former out-goings together. For here is little at present for us to do.</p>

What prices do they give for a <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> or <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> or <hi>Philo,</hi> who they say was a meer <hi>Jew?</hi> How must they starve their people with the <hi>Divinity</hi> of these men? How much of the good <hi>Divinity</hi> of the late times might they have for the money? We cannot but pity their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

               <p>This is not fair, Gentlemen; but one at once I beseech you. As to your charge of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> I shall be ready to answer it, when you can agree to bring it in. I now desire to know, what evidence <hi>T. G.</hi> brings to prove the Charge of Idolatry not to be agreeable to the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Hath he brought other <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> other <hi>Injunctions,</hi> other <hi>Rubricks,</hi> other <hi>Convocations,</hi> or at least other <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> generally received and owned for the <hi>Genuine Sons</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> who have from time to time freed the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and looked upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50112:19"/>
the charge, not only as unjust but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and destructive to the Being of a Church? Nay, can he produce any one <hi>Divine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Convocation</hi> MDCXL, that ever said any such thing, or did wholly acquit the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from this charge? If not, let him not think, we have a new Church made after another model, and upon new principles, or that those can be esteemed the genuine Sons of it, who contradict the sense of the Church ever since the Reformation. If there be any such among us, they ought first to be proved to be true Sons of our Church, before their testimony be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which if I be not mistaken, will be much harder, than to prove the Charge of Idolatry to be agreeable to the sense of it. But what method doth <hi>T. G.</hi> take in this matter?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>T. G.</hi> like a wary man disputes in <hi>Masquerade.</hi> For he doth not think fit to appear in his own Person; but he brings in a <hi>Conformist,</hi> and a <hi>Non-conformist</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing the point. And the <hi>Conformist</hi> speaks <hi>T. G.</hi>'s sense in acquitting the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Non-conformist</hi> vindicates Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and makes a pitiful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of him.</p>

               <p>It was very wittily done.

But to what purpose are all those personal reflections: and some repeated over and over, with so much appearance of rancour and ill will, as doth not become a man of any common ingenuity? Can the <hi>Catholick Cause</hi> be maintained by no other Arts than these? Methinks <hi>T. G.</hi> might have let the little <hi>Whifflers</hi> in Controversie, such as the <hi>Authour</hi> of the <hi>Address to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and of that precious Pamphlet called <hi>Jupiter Dr. St's supreme God,</hi> &amp;c. to have made a noise at they know not what; crying out upon him <hi>as an enemy to the Church of</hi> England, (because he defends her cause to their great vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and <hi>as a friend to Pagan Idolatry,</hi> (because he hath laid open the folly of yours.) These are such weak assaults as expose your cause to the contempt of all wise men; who expect reason should be answered with reason, and not with calumnies and reproaches: which in my apprehension Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ought to rejoyce in as the marks of victory; for while they have any other ammunition left,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50112:20"/>
no enemies will betake themselves to dirt and stones. When I read through the <hi>First Part</hi> of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and observed how industriously he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to bespatter his Adversary, and raked all the Kennels he could for that purpose, (especially that of the <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus bonae Fidei, &amp;c.</hi>) I could not but think of an animal, which being closely pursued and in great danger, gets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the most convenient place for mire and dirt, and there so layes about him with his Heels, that no one dares to come near him. It was certainly with some such design that <hi>T. G.</hi> hath at last taken sanctuary in a bog; hoping his Adversary will never pursue him thither. But notwithstanding this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his, we will try, whether in spite of his heels we cannot bring him to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Therefore I pray let us set aside all rude and unbecoming reflections, and calmly consider, how <hi>T. G.</hi> proves that the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <p>If it be so, I cry <hi>T.G.</hi> mercy. For, I thought he designed to prove this charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> not to be agreeable to the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But you say <hi>T. G.</hi> now denies it; and if I were as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> I would thank him for it. For, would any man say this, that thought it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50112:21"/>
could ever be proved to be against the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>? And what could have been more material to his purpose than this, if it could have been done? Well fare <hi>T. G.</hi>'s ingenuity for once! that finding it impossible to be done, he now denies that he ever attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the doing it. But the first question in a fray is, <hi>how fell they out?</hi> we shall better judge of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s design by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirmed that in the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> he did not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Did he, or did he not? If he did not, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> was in the right: if he did, why did not <hi>T. G.</hi> shew it? But after this yielding up the main point in effect, it is easie to prove that <hi>T. G.</hi> did design to shew, as well as he could, that the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> was against the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but finding it would not do, he now disowns it. For (1.) Doth not <hi>T. G.</hi> appeal to the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the most au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick declaration of her sense? and because the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is not there charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> doth he not hence dispute <hi>ex professo,</hi>

                     <hi>Cath. no Idol. p.</hi> 197.</note> that it was against her <hi>sense?</hi> To what purpose was that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Criticism, of being <hi>rather repugnant

to the word of God;</hi> which he interprets as though the composers of our Articles <hi>had done their endeavour to find a command against the Worship of Images, but could not.</hi> What do you think of this argument? what did <hi>T.

Is it not as clear as the Sun, that it was to shew that the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> was against the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Why then is <hi>T. G.</hi> ashamed now of it, and denies he had any such design? There must be some more than ordinary cause of a mans denying what he once so openly avowed to do. Nay, in these very <hi>Dialogues,</hi> after repeating his former words, <hi>T. G.</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 62.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus clearly hath</hi> T. G. <hi>evinced the sense of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in this matter.</hi> Say you so? and yet never designed to dispute <hi>ex professo,</hi> whether it were the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> or not? Who is it I pray hath the knack of <hi>saying,</hi> and <hi>unsaying;</hi> of affirming and denying the very same thing in a few leaves? or did <hi>T. G.</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intend any such thing; but the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> of her own accord, knowing <hi>T. G.</hi>'s good affections to her, stept into the <hi>Court,</hi> and declared her sense? Have we not the best natured <hi>Church</hi> in the world that is so kind to her enemies, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50112:22"/>
expresseth her sense to be on their side, whether they will or not? Our Church then is like the Countrey mans River which comes without calling; alas! what need <hi>T. G. dispute ex professo,</hi> what her sense is; she offers her own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and desires to be heard in the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute</hi> whether <hi>T. G.</hi> will or not. Let any man judge by these words what <hi>T. G.</hi>'s design was then, whatever he thinks fit to own now. (2.) He shews, <hi>that if it had been the sense of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in the Articles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preface to <hi>Cath. no Idol.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>were guilty of Idolatry in the Worship of Images, Adoration of the Host, or Invocation of Saints, all those who denyed it, would have incurred excommunication</hi> ipso facto, <hi>as appears by the Canons.</hi> What was <hi>T. G.</hi>'s design in this, if it were not to prove the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be against the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Is this <hi>only to shew the Witnesses Dr.</hi> St. <hi>produced to be incompetent?</hi> What a benefit it is, for a man to forget what he hath no mind to remember! And then to deny as stoutly as if the thing had never been done. (3.) Is it not <hi>T. G.</hi> who in terms asserts <hi>that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>betrayed his Church in advancing such a medium, as contradicts the sense of that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50112:22"/>
Church,</hi> (mark that.) <hi>It is true,</hi> he adds, <hi>if it be to be taken from the sentiments of those, who are esteemed her true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Sons.</hi> Was it <hi>T. G.</hi>'s design then, <hi>not to dispute what was the sense of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>nor whether Dr.</hi> St. <hi>dissented from it?</hi> I will not meddle with that, whether <hi>T. G.</hi> be a competent judge <hi>who are the true and genuine Sons of the Church of</hi> England. No doubt in his opinion, those who come nearest the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are such; and advance such speculations as lay the charge of Schism at her own door. But <hi>true Sons</hi> are no more for laying <hi>division</hi> to the charge of their <hi>Mother,</hi> than the <hi>true Mother</hi> was for <hi>dividing</hi> the <hi>Son.</hi> Those are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the most <hi>genuine Sons</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> who own her doctrine, defend her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, conform to her Rules, and are most ready to maintain her <hi>Cause</hi> against all her enemies. And among these there is no <hi>difference,</hi> and there ought to be no <hi>distinction.</hi> But if any frame a <hi>Church</hi> of their own <hi>Heads,</hi> without any regard to the <hi>Articles, Homilies,</hi> and current <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and yet will call that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>the only genuine Sons</hi> of it, I do not question <hi>T.

be glad to have them thought so, to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen our number and impair our interest; but none that understand and value our <hi>Church,</hi> will endure such a pernicious discrimination among the <hi>Sons</hi> of the same <hi>Mother;</hi> as though some few were fatally determined to be the <hi>Sons</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> whatever their <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> were; and others absolutely <hi>cast off,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the greatest <hi>service.</hi> I should not mention this, but that I see <hi>T.

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>With all my heart. The <hi>First</hi> was from the <hi>Book of Homilies,</hi> not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed, but subscribed to, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining godly and wholsome doctrine very necessary for these times; which owns this charge of Idolatry not in any doubtful, or single passage, but in an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Discourse intended for the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as well as the People. To which he added, that the Doctrine of the Homilies is allowed in the thirty nine Articles; which were approved by the Queen; confirmed by the subscription of both <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Convocation,</hi> A. D. 1571. And therefore he desires <hi>T. G.</hi> to resolve him, whether men of any common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing would have subscribed to the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Homilies</hi> in this manner, if they had believed the main doctrine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50112:24"/>
of one of them had been false and pernicious? If, saith he, any of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had at that time thought the charge of Idolatry unjust, and that it had subverted the foundation of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Authority, would they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted this into the Articles, when it was in their power to have left it out? and that the Homilies contained a wholesome and godly Doctrine, which in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences they believed to be false and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious? He might as well think, he saith, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> would have allowed <hi>Calvins Institutions, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a wholesome and godly Doctrine,</hi> as that men so perswaded would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Homily against the peril of Idolatry.</hi> And how is it possible to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the sense of our Church bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than by such publick and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Acts of it, which all persons who are in any place of trust in the Church must subscribe and declare their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of? This Homily hath still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the same, the Article the very same, and if so, they must acknowledge this hath been and is to this day the sense of our Church. And to what <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>that this doth not evince every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular doctrine contained in the Homilies to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50112:25"/>
be godly and wholesome, because the whole Book is subscribed to as containing such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> he answers, that there is a great deal of difference to be made between some particular passages and expressions in these Homilies, and the main doctrine and design of a whole Homily: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween subscribing to a whole Book as containing godly and wholsome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, though men be not so certain of the Truth of every passage in it; and if they are convinced that any doctrine contained in it is false and pernicious. Now those who deny the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be guilty of Idolatry do not only look on the charge as false, but as of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous consequence; and therefore such a subscription would be shuffling and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest. From these things laid together, in my mind Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath not only clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved that the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> was not only owned by the composers of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> but by all who have honestly subscribed to the <hi>Articles</hi> from that time to our own. And I would be glad to hear what answer <hi>T. G.</hi> gives to all this.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>He answers, first by repeating what he said before; and then by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that subscription is no good argument,</hi>

                  <hi>considering what had been done and undone in that kind in the Reigns of K.</hi> Henry 8. Edw. 6. <hi>Q.</hi> Mary, <hi>and Q.</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>not to speak of latter times.</hi>

               <p>What is this, but in plain terms to say the subscribers of our <hi>Articles</hi> were men of no honesty or conscience; but would say or unsay, subscribe one thing or another as it served their turn? If this be his way of defending our Church, we shall desire him to defend his own. But yet, this doth not reach home to the <hi>Doctors</hi> argument, which proceeded not meerly on their honesty, but their having common understanding. For here was no force or violence offered them, they had the full power to consider the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and to compose the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and would men of common sense put in things against their own minds, and make and approve and recommend Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies which they did not believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? This evidently proves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of the <hi>Homilies</hi> and <hi>Convocation</hi> at that time, did approve the doctrine of these <hi>Homilies,</hi> for it was in their power not to have passed them. Thus far it is plain <hi>that</hi> was the doctrine of the Church then, and why should we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any subscribers to take them in any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50112:26"/>
other sense, than the Church did then mean them? Nay, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> challenged him, to produce any one Divine of our Church, who through the long reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did so much as once questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the truth of this charge.

Although therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>Q.</hi> Elizabeth <hi>might suffer such things to be printed in her time, yet B.</hi> Laud <hi>would not allow the Reprinting of them;</hi> because Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> might out of State policy suffer the violent transports of irregular zeal, by reason of her personal quarrels with the Pope; yet now those reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, B. <hi>Laud</hi> would not suffer them to come abroad again.

               <p>That cannot be, for <hi>Pet.

               <p>This is very subtle, and like <hi>T. G.</hi> himself. But I pray observe, <hi>P. Heylin</hi> when he gives an account of the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> saith, <hi>when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which first began in the Schools came to its growth, what fruits could it bear, but most gross Idolatry, greater than which, was never known among the Gentiles?</hi> Mark that for your satisfaction. What <hi>fruit could the doctrine bear,</hi> and that after <hi>it came out of the Schools to its growth.</hi> And when he saith, <hi>they might conceive
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50112:28"/>
that</hi> Rome <hi>was once again relapsed into her ancient Paganism;</hi> the meaning is, Those that saw their Worship of Images in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Rome,</hi> and compared it with what was done in old <hi>Rome,</hi> would see no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; the Idolatry was so gross in both, that if there were nothing else to make a distinction, a man might easily conceive <hi>Rome</hi> was relapsed into her <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Paganism.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But what other argument have you to prove that <hi>P. Heylin</hi> could not speak this of the charge of <hi>Idolatry?</hi>

               <p>Because in his <hi>Introduction</hi> he owns the doctrine of the <hi>Homilies</hi> as to this point of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the <hi>Homilies</hi> were the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>in this point of removing or excluding Images,</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50112:28"/>
was quite spent in the time of B. <hi>Laud;</hi> since not only <hi>P. Heylin,</hi> but the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> himself saith,<note place="margin">Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with <hi>Fisher. p.</hi> 277.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Modern Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is too like Paganism in the Worship of Images, and driven to scarce intelligible subtilties, in her servants wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that defend it; and this without any care had of millions of souls unable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand her subtilties or shun her practice.</hi> And in his defence against the charge of the <hi>Commons,</hi> he said,<note place="margin">History of his Tryal. <hi>p.</hi> 472.</note> 
                  <hi>that he had written against the adoration and superstitious use of Images as fully as any man whatsoever.</hi> What think you now Sir? was this a <hi>heat</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; and when men in <hi>Archbishop Lauds</hi> time, more duly weighed the consequences of this charge, they grew both cooler and wiser? what evidence doth <hi>T.

and the concurrence of those of his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> calls them; and yet in that very <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Pet. Heylins,</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. C.</speaker>
               <p>Look you to that, I alwayes took the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> for an <hi>Idol,</hi> but I did not think, I had proved it now.</p>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I shall endeavour to undeceive you in this matter. Since we are not pure spirits, but must worship <hi>God</hi> with our bodies, by <hi>kneeling</hi> and looking towards something in our <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>; we must not determine that to be the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Worship</hi> which our bodies are bended towards, or we look upon in our <hi>worship,</hi> unless there be some other <hi>reason</hi> for it; for then <hi>Idolatry</hi> would be necessary and unavoidable. For we cannot kneel with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50112:33"/>
our eyes open, but we must look upon some creature, which according to your way of arguing, must be the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Worship.</hi> I pray Sir, without being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, give me leave to ask you, whether a man kneeling in the Fields and praying with his eyes lifted up to <hi>Heaven</hi> be an <hi>Idolater</hi> or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. C.</speaker>
               <p>I think not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Yet he kneels towards some creature, and looks upon some creature when he worships; therefore you must prove by some other way, that we do make the <hi>bread</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Worship.</hi> But this we utterly deny; and say <hi>the doing it is</hi> Idolatry <hi>and to be abhorred of all faithful Christians.</hi> And will you make us worship it, whether we will or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. C.</speaker>
               <p>But you use the same postures which the <hi>Papists</hi> do, and yet you charge them with <hi>Idolatry?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Because this is a thing many of you stumble at, I will make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our case, and theirs plain to you. In all moral Acts we are to have a great great regard to their <hi>circumstances,</hi> from whence they take a different denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that kills a man by accident, and he that kills a man out of malice, do the very same thing as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50112:33"/>
of the <hi>Act;</hi> yet no man will say it is the same act upon a moral consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. We kneel, and the <hi>Papists</hi> kneel: but we declare <hi>when we kneel, we intend no adoration to the Elements:</hi> but the <hi>Papists</hi> cannot deny that they do give <hi>proper adoration</hi> to that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; which we say is <hi>bread,</hi> and they say, <hi>the Body of Christ under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of bread;</hi> and yet not meerly to the <hi>invisible Body of Christ,</hi> but taking the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> as <hi>united</hi> to that <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so directing their worship to these two together as the <hi>proper objects of divine adoration.</hi> And to make this evident to you, their <hi>adoration</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the <hi>Elevation</hi> of the <hi>Host;</hi> and at the <hi>carrying it about in processions,</hi> and at the <hi>exposing it on their Altars</hi>; and not meerly in the <hi>participation</hi> of it. Whence it is observable, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not strictly require <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at the <hi>participation,</hi> which it would do, if it looked on the <hi>kneeling</hi> at recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as a proper <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Adoration.</hi> The <hi>Rubricks</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> do not, that I can find, require the <hi>Priest</hi> to <hi>kneel</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>receiving;</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> when he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates, <hi>receives sitting. Espencaeus</hi> saith, in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> many of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50112:34"/>
                  <hi>People</hi> did not receive kneeling; and upon complaint made about it, they were by the advice of two <hi>Cardinals</hi> left to their old custome. And I wonder your Brethren have not taken notice of the difference of <hi>kneeling</hi> at the <hi>elevation</hi> of the <hi>Host,</hi> and in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>receiving</hi> it; the one was required by the <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and was intended for an act of <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>Host:</hi> the other was derived from the <hi>ancient Church,</hi> which although it did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes use the <hi>same posture</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> that we do; yet it is sufficient for our purpose, if they received the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the <hi>same posture in which they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped God.</hi> And this I could easily prove, if this were a place or season for it.</p>

               <p>Sir, I thank you for the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion you have given us, if you please I will now return to the place where we left; I was about to tell you the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>T. G.</hi> gives to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s third <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> from the <hi>Rubrick</hi> at the end of the <hi>Communion.</hi> The words are, <hi>It is here declared that by kneeling no adoration is intended or ought to be done, either unto
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50112:34"/>
the Sacramental bread or wine, there bodily received, or unto any corporal presence of Christs natural Flesh and Blood. For the Sacramental bread and wine remain still in their very natural substances, and therefore may not be adored, for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Christians; and the natural Body and Blood of Christ are in Heaven; and not here, it being against the truth of Christs Natural Body to be at one time in more places than one.</hi> About which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> charges <hi>T. G.</hi> first with <hi>Ignorance</hi> in saying, <hi>it was not yet above a douzen years since it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into the Communion Book; whereas he might have found it above a hundred years before in the Liturgie of</hi> Edw. 6. To which <hi>T. G.</hi> answers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>That the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fate of this Rubrick, first in not being annexed till the second Liturgie of</hi> Edw. 6. <hi>and being cast out again in the year</hi> 1562. <hi>and then admitted again almost a hundred years after, is no eviction to him, that the charge of Idolatry is the dogmatical doctrine of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>If this were all the declaration our <hi>Church</hi> had made of her sense, and the intention of this <hi>Rubrick</hi> were only to declare this point of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there were some probability in what <hi>T. G.</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50112:35"/>
But I have shewed already, how fully our <hi>Church</hi> hath declared her sense about <hi>Romish Idolatry</hi> by other wayes; and the design of this <hi>Rubrick</hi> was not to express her sense of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> so much as to give satisfaction to those who scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>kneeling.</hi> For which cause it was first put in, and afterwards not thought necessary to be continued, when persons were better satisfied about the intention of our <hi>Church.</hi> But when after long disuse and violent prejudices the <hi>dissenters</hi> were grown unacquainted with the design and intention of our <hi>Church,</hi> there was the same reason for inserting it again, which held at first for putting it in. And what now hath <hi>T. G.</hi> gained by this observation? If it had been, as he imagined, what he had gotten in one point, he had lost in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for then it would appear, that there was <hi>no such heat in the beginning of Q.</hi> Elizabeths <hi>dayes,</hi> if they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave out such a <hi>declaration</hi> of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> at that time when <hi>Q.</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Title was the most disputed at</hi> Rome; so that from hence appears the vanity of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer observation, and how far they were from taking things into our <hi>Liturgie</hi> out
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50112:35"/>
of spite to the <hi>Pope;</hi> nay, so far were they from this, that in the first year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that petition in the <hi>Letany</hi> was left out, which had been inserted by <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and continued in both <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cypr. Angl. p.</hi> 418.</note>

And was not the title of <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> taken by her <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Brother</hi> so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and explained then, as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any occasion of quarreling at it by the most captious persons? Do these passages look like doing things on purpose to provoke and exasperate, and out of pure spite to the Pope, or like putting in things on purpose to heighten the differences, when <hi>T. G.</hi> himself confesses, <hi>they left out this Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi> and it is evident they did leave out some of the most provoking expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>

               <p>I am so much his Friend, that at this time I will undertake this task for him. First, We must consider the <hi>words</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:50112:36"/>
of the <hi>Rubrick.</hi> (2.) How this sense of it can be reconciled with the <hi>real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> as owned by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> (1.) For the meaning of the <hi>Rubrick.</hi> We are to consider that the <hi>Rubrick</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <hi>adoration to be intended, either unto the Sacramental bread and wine, or unto any corporal presence of Christs natural flesh and blood.</hi> And after, it gives two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct reasons for denying <hi>adoration</hi> to <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of these. 1. <hi>To the Sacramental bread and wine,</hi> for this reason, <hi>because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still in their very natural substances, and therefore may not be adored, for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Christians.</hi> 2. <hi>To the corporal presence of Christs natural flesh and blood;</hi> because <hi>the natural body and blood of our Saviour Christ are in heaven, and not here, it being against the truth of Christs natural Body, to be at one time in more places than one.</hi> You see, here are two plainly distinct reasons given for denying <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and to <hi>the Natural Body of Christ.</hi> The former is said to be <hi>Idolatry;</hi> the latter to be <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repugnant to the truth of Christs body to be in more places than one at one time.</hi> So that the sense of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> lyes in these two propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50112:37"/>1. That it is <hi>Idolatry</hi> to give <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>elements remaining in their natural substances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is absurd to believe <hi>Christs natural body to be present, because then it must be in more places than one, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the truth of a body.</hi> These things to my apprehension are the plain and natural sense of this <hi>Rubrick.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But we do not give adoration to the <hi>Sacramental elements,</hi> but to the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I do believe I can prove that you give <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>Sacramental E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,</hi> as they make up <hi>one entire object of adoration with the body of Christ;</hi> but that is not my present business; which is to shew the sense of our <hi>Church,</hi> which lyes in these particulars. 1. That <hi>the Sacramental Elements do remain in their natural substances after consecration.</hi> 2. That, <hi>to adore them so remaining is Idolatry, and to be abhorred of all faithful Christians.</hi> No one questions the former to be the sense of our <hi>Church;</hi> the only question lyes in the later, whether that be <hi>Idolatry</hi> or no? It is no question, that to give divine adoration to <hi>any creature</hi> is <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and it is so acknowledged on all sides; the only question then can be,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50112:37"/>
whether the <hi>substance of bread and wine be a creature</hi> or not? and this is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with any man in his wits: therefore to give <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>substance of bread and wine</hi> is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> No demonstration in <hi>Euclid</hi> is plainer than this.</p>

               <p>I tell you again, <hi>if there be a creature you do worship it,</hi> for you give adoration to what is before you, be it what it will; if it be a <hi>creature</hi> you adore it.</p>

               <p>Do not you give <hi>adoration</hi> to that which is <hi>consecrated,</hi> whether it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a <hi>creature</hi> or not after <hi>consecration?</hi> At the <hi>elevation</hi> of the <hi>Host,</hi> at the <hi>carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it about,</hi> at the <hi>exposing of it on the Altar,</hi> you worship that which was <hi>consecrated</hi> do you not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>We worship <hi>that which was bread</hi> before <hi>consecration,</hi> but after, is no longer so but the <hi>body of Christ.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But if it should remain <hi>bread</hi> after <hi>consecration,</hi> what do ye adore then? is it not the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>bread?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Yes, but we believe <hi>it is not the bread.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>That is not the question, <hi>what you believe;</hi> for they that believed <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>soul of the world,</hi> worshipped the parts of it upon a supposition, which if it had been true would have justified their worship, every jot as well as yours can do you, and yet they were <hi>gross Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> for all that. Nay, I will say more to you, there never were <hi>Idolaters</hi> in the world, that did not proceed upon a false supposition, and it may be not so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable as yours. This cannot therefore excuse you, if your supposition proves false; as no doubt it is; that the <hi>substance of the bread doth not remain after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But I now ask you what your <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is, in the opinion of those persons who do firmly believe the <hi>Sacramental Elements to remain in their natural sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi> Is it not the <hi>giving divine worship to a creature?</hi> And is not the <hi>giving divine worship to a creature Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</hi> so that according to the <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Host</hi> must be <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But what have you got by all this? for we confess our selves, <hi>that if the substance of bread and wine do remain after consecration we are as great Idolaters as they that worship a red cloath.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word, you had need then to be well assured, <hi>that the substance of Bread and Wine do not remain;</hi> and yet I must tell you, we can be certain of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world, if we are not certain <hi>that the substance of bread and wine do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after consecration.</hi> For if we are certain of nothing by our senses, but of the <hi>outward accidents</hi> (which is all your best men do say in this case) we cannot be certain of any <hi>visible substance</hi> in the world, for no <hi>bodily substance</hi> can be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned, but by our <hi>senses;</hi> and so all foundation of <hi>certainty by sense</hi> is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nay, farther, it takes away all <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> by <hi>reason,</hi> for it confounds the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est maxims of it, by overthrowing all Mathematical proportions of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>small, whole</hi> and <hi>parts;</hi> by destroying all <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>distance</hi> and <hi>place;</hi> by jumbling the <hi>notions</hi> of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it takes away all <hi>certainty</hi> by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> which can never come to us, but upon the supposition of the <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>

               <p>O Sir, I see what you would be at; you would fain draw me into a dispute about <hi>transubstantiation,</hi> upon <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Reason;</hi> I beg your pardon Sir. This is a matter of <hi>faith,</hi> and must

               <p>I was only giving you some cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the by, how much you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to look about you; but since you are resolved to shut your eyes, I return to the sense of our <hi>Church</hi> about the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Mass;</hi> and it follows necessarily from our former discourse, that since our <hi>Church</hi> believes the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Elements do remain, and that your worship doth really fix upon that <hi>substance,</hi> whatever your intentions be, it is really <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>However this only proves it to be <hi>material Idolatry,</hi> and not <hi>formal.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I have often heard of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, but I could never be satisfied with it: For what is <hi>material</hi> and <hi>formal Idolatry?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Material Idolatry</hi> I take to be <hi>mistaken worship; i. e.</hi> I do give divine worship to a false object, but I do not intend to give it to a false object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but to a true one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then <hi>Formal Idolatry</hi> must be <hi>giving divine worship to a false object of Worship, knowing it to be a false object.</hi> And where are there any such <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50112:39"/>
to be found in the world? Did not the Heathens believe that to be <hi>God</hi> which they worshipped? And is not <hi>God</hi> a <hi>true object of worship?</hi> only they mistook that to be <hi>God</hi> which was not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so were only <hi>material Idolaters;</hi> Even those that worshipped their <hi>Images for Gods,</hi> were only mistaken; for they had a good intention only to worship <hi>God,</hi> but they unhappily took their <hi>Images</hi> for <hi>Gods.</hi> And I must needs say, they who took the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> for <hi>Gods,</hi> and worshipped them as such, were very excusable in comparison of those who take a <hi>piece of bread for God,</hi> or that which <hi>appears like it.</hi>

               <p>Yes, I tell you there is, but not much to your comfort.

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But may not a man innocently mistake? as if in the dark, a <hi>Child</hi> should ask blessing of one that is not his <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50112:40"/>
would his <hi>Father</hi> have reason to be angry with him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Not for once, or if it were in the dark; but if he should see him every day go very formally to a <hi>joyn'd Stool</hi> in the <hi>Hall,</hi> or to a <hi>Brown Loaf</hi> in the <hi>Buttery,</hi> and there very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly down upon his knees to them, and beg their blessing; tell me what you think the Father would say, to such a mistake? Would he excuse him, saying, Alas poor Child, he intended all this to me, only he mistook the <hi>Brown Loaf</hi> or a <hi>joyn'd stool</hi> for me!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Forbear such comparisons; for we have divine Revelation, <hi>This is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>; and we believe his word against all you can say in this matter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But what will you say, if by the confession of many of the best and most learned of your own Divines, <hi>You have not Divine Revelation for it;</hi> and that those words cannot prove <hi>that the substance of Bread doth not remain after consecration,</hi> which is the thing we now enquire after: and if it were not to go off from our present business, I would undertake to prove this evidently to you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But what say you to <hi>T. G.</hi>'s reasons, <hi>why this must be understood of a corporeal presence of Christs natural Body, because you else overthrow the doctrine of a real presence which hath been accounted the doctrine of the Church of</hi> England.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>To this I answer, (1.) The <hi>Rubrick</hi> saith expresly, <hi>that it is against the truth of Christs natural Body to be at one time in more places than one.</hi> It doth not say <hi>against the corporeal presence of his natural Body,</hi> but the <hi>truth of it;</hi> from whence it follows, that our <hi>Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the <hi>true natural body of Christ,</hi> which was born of the Virgin, suffered on the Cross, and ascended into Heaven, <hi>can be but in one place</hi>; which is declared
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50112:41"/>
in the foregoing words, <hi>And the natural Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ are in Heaven and not here: i. e.</hi> in Heaven exclusively from being in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Which are not true, if the same <hi>natural Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> could be at the <hi>same time</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and in the <hi>Host.</hi>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>How then can your Divines hold <hi>a real presence of Christs Body,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> saith they do?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>You had heard if you had staid till I came to my second <hi>Answer,</hi> which is, that notwithstanding this, our <hi>Church</hi> doth hold, that after Consecration, the Elements do become the Body and Blood of Christ, and so there is <hi>a real presence</hi> of <hi>Christs Body</hi>; but not of his <hi>natural,</hi> but of a <hi>mystical Body.</hi> I will endeavour to make this out to you, because you look strangely upon me, as if I were big of some mighty <hi>paradox.</hi> When <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schasius Radbertus</hi> did first broach the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> about the <hi>same body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> being in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was born of the B. Virgin,</hi> in the <hi>Western Church,</hi> he met with great opposition therein from the most learned Divines of that Age; among the rest, there lived then in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> a man very eminent for his <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50112:41"/>
called <hi>Joh. Scotus,</hi> or <hi>Erigena.</hi> This man at the request of <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his opinion directly contrary to <hi>Paschasius</hi>; for whereas he asserted, <hi>that the very same Body of Christ which was born of the B. Virgin, was invisibly present under the accidents of Bread and Wine, Scotus</hi> denyed, <hi>that the Elements were in any real sense after consecration the Body and Blood of Christ, the Sacrament being only a bare commemoration, or figurative representation of the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi>

He, (who is better known by the name of <hi>Bertram</hi>) gives, in his Preface, an <hi>Account</hi> to his <hi>Prince</hi> of both these opinions, and rejects them both, as against the sense of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> In the <hi>first part</hi> of his <hi>Book,</hi> he disputes against <hi>Scotus</hi> who would allow no <hi>Mysterie,</hi> and in the <hi>second</hi> against <hi>Paschasius</hi> who contended <hi>that the same Body of Christ was in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was born of the B.

Hierom, Fulgentius; <hi>from the Scriptures; and from the Offices of the Church,</hi> he concludes point-blank against <hi>Paschasius,</hi> that <hi>it was not the same Body of Christ in the Sacrament which was born of the B. Virgin.</hi> But then
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50112:42"/>
against the opinion of <hi>Scotus,</hi> he delivers his mind fully in answer to the first <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> saying, <hi>If there were nothing in the Sacrament but what appeared to the senses, it was unfitly called a Mysterie; and there would be no exercise for faith; no change at all wrought in the Elements; the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would fall short of Baptism and the Manna in the Wilderness: and lastly, to what purpose did Christ promise his Flesh to be the Food of his People, which being not to be understood carnally and literally must have a spiritual signification; so that, though as to their outward appearance the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Elements are Figures, yet according to the invisible Power and Efficacy they are the Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> And this he shews, to have been the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Christian Church.</hi> This opinion of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramnus, Paschasius</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degardus,</hi> calls <hi>the doctrine of those who deny the presence of Christs Flesh in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; but do hold an invisible power and efficacy in and with the Elements; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi> say they, <hi>there is no body but what is visible and palpable.</hi> And whoever will read that <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Paschasius</hi> will find the expressions, he answers, the very same that yet occur in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram.</hi> Of the same opinion with <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramnus</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:50112:43"/>
in this matter, was <hi>Rabanus Maurus,</hi> the greatest Divine accounted of his Age, who wrote his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Egilo against them, who had lately broached that doctrine</hi> (mark that) <hi>that the Body of Christ in the Sacrament, was the very same which was born of the B. Virgin, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the Cross and rose from the dead.</hi> And this appears from his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribaldus</hi> still extant; wherein he saith, <hi>he declared in what sense the Sacrament was the Body of Christ.</hi> Besides, the <hi>Anonymus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> published by <hi>Cellotius,</hi> (the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son about that time who appeared in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Paschasius,</hi> and very inconsiderable in comparison of his <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi>) confesseth the opposition made to <hi>Paschasius</hi> by <hi>Rabanus</hi> and <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and endeavours to excuse <hi>his simplicity in assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the same flesh of Christ was upon the Altar, which was born of the Virgin,</hi> by a new and extravagant supposition of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> being the <hi>medium</hi> of <hi>uniting two real bodies of Christ;</hi> viz. <hi>of his flesh and of his Church,</hi> and therefore that must be a <hi>real body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> too; which is so remote from justifying <hi>Paschasius</hi> his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that <hi>Cellotius</hi> himself is ashamed of him.

the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> because of his <hi>Spirit</hi> dwelling in them. So the <hi>Apology</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> saith, <hi>that in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per there is truly exhibited the Body and Blood of Christ, because that is the proper food of our souls, as Bread and Wine tends to the nourishment of our Bodiess</hi> And if the time would permit, I could not only more largely prove this to be the <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> but that it is the <hi>true</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine sense of the <hi>Fathers</hi> both of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine Church.</hi> And thus I hope, I have done that which <hi>T.

               <p>These were a notable sort of Hereticks, if they could be found; but it appears by the enemies of <hi>Berengarius</hi> that this opprobrious name was fixed by them on all those who asserted <hi>the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Bread to remain after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration;</hi>

and it would be very strange if <hi>Bertram</hi> should confute that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self asserts; for he saith, <hi>the Sacramental Elements do pass into the nourishment of our Bodies.</hi> But if any were lyable to this accusation, it must be <hi>Paschasius;</hi> if <hi>Pet. de Marca</hi>'s observation of him be true, <hi>that he held both substance and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Bread and Wine to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body of Christ</hi>; from whence it follows, that must be the <hi>subject</hi> of all those <hi>accidents which were in the Bread before;</hi> which is the very sink of <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coranism.</hi> Nay, I am very much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if <hi>Pope Nicholas</hi> 2. in the <hi>recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> prescribed to <hi>Berengarius</hi> did not fall into the filth of it far more than <hi>Rabanus</hi> or <hi>Heribaldus;</hi> for he asserts therein, <hi>that the Body of Christ is truly and sensibly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and broken by the hands of Priests and ground by the teeth of Believers.</hi> But what place could be fitter for this <hi>Heresie,</hi> than the <hi>Sedes Stercoraria?</hi>

               <p>A man had need look to his words, when <hi>Heresies</hi> are so common, and buz so about a mans ears. And some think they confute a man with a vengeance, if they can find out some Heresie with a hard name to fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. But if you did know wherein the <hi>heresie</hi> of <hi>Impanation</hi> lay, you would never charge this doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> with it. For I find two distinct wayes of <hi>Impanation,</hi> and this doctrine is lyable to neither of them. 1. By union of the <hi>Bread</hi> to the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and by <hi>that</hi> to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> which was the way of <hi>Joh. Parisiensis.</hi> 2. By an <hi>immediate conjunction of the Divine Nature to the Bread;</hi> not meerly by <hi>divine efficacy and power,</hi> but by an <hi>Hypostatical Vnion:</hi> which is the opinion not without ground, attributed to <hi>Rupertus Tuitiensis;</hi> and is lyable to this great absurdity, that all that befals the <hi>Bread</hi> may be attributed to the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>it is blasphemy to imagine.</hi> And then it might be said, <hi>that the bread is God, that the Word is made Bread,</hi> and <hi>that God is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50112:46"/>
both bread and wine.</hi> But all which the doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> implyes is only <hi>a real presence of Christs invisible power and Grace so in and with the Elements, as by the faithful receiving of them to convey spiritual and real effects to the souls of men:</hi> As the <hi>Bodies</hi> assumed by <hi>Angels</hi> might be called <hi>their Bodies,</hi> while they assumed them; or rather as the <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ,</hi> because of <hi>his spirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and enlivening the Souls of Believers:</hi> so the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> after <hi>consecration</hi> are the <hi>real</hi> but <hi>the spiritual and Mystical body of Christ.</hi> If any one yet thinks, that some at least of our <hi>Divines</hi> have gone farther than this, let them know, it is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> I am to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and not of every particular <hi>Divine</hi> in it; and if any do seem to speak of the presence of <hi>the very same Body which is in Heaven,</hi> I desire them in the <hi>first place</hi> to reconcile that <hi>doctrine with</hi> this <hi>dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical assertion</hi> at the end of this <hi>Rubrick; that it is against the Truth of Christs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body,</hi> (not against the <hi>corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of it) <hi>to be at one time in more places than one.</hi> Let men imagine what <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>presence</hi> they please of the <hi>same body,</hi> I only desire to know, <hi>whether to be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to be in the Sacrament,</hi> be to be

in the <hi>same or distinct places?</hi> If the <hi>places be distinct,</hi> as no doubt <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are, then <hi>our Church</hi> declares <hi>that it is contrary to the Truth of Christs Natural Body to be in more places than one at one time.</hi>

               <p>I think you have strained for this, and it is your last <hi>effort:</hi> to which I answer. (1.) It yields no advantage to <hi>T. G.</hi> for supposing that some of our <hi>Divines</hi> did hold it possible, <hi>that the same body might be present in several places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a different manner,</hi> yet how doth it hence follow, that the <hi>Rubrick</hi> doth not charge them who worship the <hi>substance of Bread and Wine with Idolatry?</hi> (2.) Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50112:47"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> did fix this charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those who worship the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> as present, I desire to know whether <hi>another kind of presence</hi> would excuse from <hi>Idolatry? i. e.</hi> supposing that to worship <hi>Christs Body as corporeally present be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> it would not be <hi>Idolatry</hi> to worship the <hi>very same Body</hi> as present after <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner?</hi> Which is all one, as to ask, whether if it be <hi>Idolatry</hi> to worship a man with his <hi>cloaths on,</hi> it be likewise <hi>Idolatry</hi> to worship him with his <hi>cloaths off?</hi> If it be, the <hi>very same body,</hi> let the manner of its <hi>being</hi> present be the same or different, it doth not alter the nature or reason of <hi>worship.</hi> Only of the two, it seems more unreasonable to worship an <hi>invisible Body</hi> than a <hi>visible one;</hi> for in a <hi>visible body,</hi> he that worships is sure of <hi>something</hi> that he <hi>sees,</hi> but when he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies an <hi>invisible Body</hi> present, he fancies something which <hi>if it were,</hi> must <hi>be seen,</hi> and yet though <hi>he cannot see</hi> it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to <hi>worship it.</hi> (3.) It is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as unreasonable to believe that a <hi>Body may be present in several places after a different manner,</hi> as <hi>after the same manner.</hi> For whereever a <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>really present,</hi> let it be with <hi>extension</hi> or <hi>without,</hi> it is so <hi>in that place</hi> as <hi>not to be in another; i. e.</hi> the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50112:48"/>
                  <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> being in the <hi>Host on the Altar,</hi> is so there, as not to be on the <hi>floor,</hi> or any other place about it; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it could not be said to <hi>be only under the accidents:</hi> I then ask, on what account <hi>the same body</hi> cannot be present in <hi>two places</hi> at once after <hi>the same manner,</hi> and yet may be <hi>after a different manner?

                  <hi>it doth imply a contradiction for the same Body to be in several places at once after the same manner,</hi> i. e. <hi>by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension or quantity;</hi> because, <hi>it is necessary for the same thing to be undivided from it self, but that which is in several places must be divided from it self.</hi> But as <hi>Conink</hi> well observes, <hi>this argument proves it as impossible for the same body to be in several places after a different manner,</hi>

                  <hi>for it is never the less divided from it self by being in one place after another manner than in the other: yea it will be more divided, because it will be after two several wayes repugnant to each other. And it is much more easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that a Body should be in two several places after a natural manner, than to be so in one place; and in another, after such a spiritual manner as is very hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</hi>

               <p>I will tell you; Among other <hi>Divines</hi> produced by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to prove the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> maintained against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in K. <hi>James</hi> his time, one was Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> in his <hi>answer</hi> to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. T. G.</hi> takes this to be Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and excepts against him <hi>as an abettor of the Puritan party,</hi> and tells from Dr. <hi>Heylin, that on that account it was thought necessary to suspend him from his Metropolitical Visitation;</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> makes sport with his Suspending a <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> from <hi>Metropolitical jurisdiction,</hi> and tells what strange things those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> can do with <hi>five words;</hi> and upbraids <hi>T. G.</hi> with <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of our <hi>Church;</hi> and in truth, <hi>is too Tragical</hi> upon such a slight occasion. Now <hi>T. G.</hi> proves, <hi>that it was only a mistake of the person, and not of his quality, although Dr.</hi> St. saith, <hi>that he was never till now suspected for a Puritan.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>However it is good to be sure. These are Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s words. <hi>The two first he excepts against, are the two Archbishops,</hi>

Whitgift <hi>and</hi> Abbot <hi>as Puritanically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; but as it unhappily falls out, one of them was never mentioned by me, and the other never till now suspected for a Puritan.</hi> I pray advise <hi>T. G.</hi> to read a little more carefully, before he confutes: Is it not plain, that he means, <hi>Archbishop</hi> Abbot <hi>was never mentioned by him, and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> Whitgift <hi>was never till now suspected for a Puritan?</hi> It could be no want of understanding in <hi>T.

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>From Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> whose <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> serve us to many a good purpose; for he saith, <hi>he was a Calvinian though a moderate one; that he was an enemy to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> Laud <hi>in the Vniversity, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Mr.</hi> Perkins, <hi>and wrote his last Book of Grace and Perseverance of the Saints.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Very wonderful proofs!

not possible, for men to be zealous for our <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> if they held the doctrine of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Perseverance!</hi> But we do not want those of the <hi>Highest Order</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> at this day, who are eminent for <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Church;</hi> who would take it very ill from <hi>T.

               <p>He saith, <hi>they do not impugn the doctrine it self of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>or

               <p>That will be best tryed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; the <hi>First</hi> of these is no less a <hi>Person</hi> than K. <hi>James,</hi> who calls <hi>the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images, damnable Idolatry;</hi> and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> shews <hi>that K.</hi> James <hi>takes off their distinctions and evasions;</hi> and saith, <hi>Let them therefore that maintain this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine answer it to Christ at the latter day when he shall accuse them of Idolatry.

               <p>A very notable thing I assure you. He saith, <hi>they only found fault with some abuses committed in our Church,</hi>

                  <hi>if truly stated out of the decrees of her Councils, or practice agreeable to that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which these Divines impeach as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, but the opinions of some School-Divines, or Abuses they conceived to be committed in the practice of it. And for this he instanceth in the decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Nice <hi>about the Worship of Images.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Who doth not know <hi>T. G.</hi> to be a man of art? and to understand the way of fencing in the <hi>Schools</hi> as well as another? Was it not skilfully done in this place to run to the <hi>point of Images,</hi> when we had been so lately upon the <hi>Idolatry</hi> in <hi>adoration of the Host,</hi> as it is declared in our <hi>Rubrick?</hi> For the <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is plain to all persons about <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Host,</hi> at the <hi>elevation</hi> of it, and <hi>carrying it about;</hi> but in the matter of <hi>Images</hi> they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>palliate</hi> and <hi>disguise</hi> their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>practices</hi> as much as may be. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer therefore on behalf of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> (1.) That when he speaks of what men are obliged to do <hi>by vertue of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church of</hi> Rome, he speaks of the things <hi>strictly required</hi> by the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>that Church</hi>; and since our <hi>Church</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>the Mass Idolatrous,</hi> he doth not in the least recede from the sense of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50112:53"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> in the disjunction he useth, either of <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> or <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and I have some reason to believe that was the thing he aimed at chiefly, when he spoke of <hi>the terms of Communion;</hi> because he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard of some persons who live in the <hi>communion</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not obliged to make the same <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions</hi> which <hi>Ecclesiastical persons</hi> are, do content themselves with doing the <hi>same external Acts</hi> which others do; but with a <hi>very different intention</hi>; who look upon <hi>transubstantiation,</hi> and many other doctrines as <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and yet think they may joyn with those who do believe them in all <hi>external acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> rather than break the peace of the Church they live in; such persons would say they <hi>never worshipped the Host,</hi> and therefore excuse themselves from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> but Dr. <hi>St.</hi> saith, <hi>they cannot then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselves from hypocrisie,</hi> because they seem to give the <hi>same Worship</hi> which the other doth. (2.) As to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed in the <hi>Worship of Images,</hi> we shall consider that in its proper place; but yet by vertue of communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> all persons are (1.) bound to declare the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> lawful as it is practised in that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50112:53"/>
                  <hi>Church.</hi> (2.) To <hi>worship Images</hi> upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion o<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

To <hi>Worship</hi> the <hi>Cross</hi> as it <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents Christ</hi> with that <hi>worship</hi> which is proper to his <hi>person.</hi> That which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us now, is to give an account of the judgement of these <hi>Persons,</hi> how far they suppose the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be guilty of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed in it. As to K. <hi>James</hi> we have seen already how far <hi>T. G.</hi> is from answering his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the next is <hi>Is. Casaubon,</hi> and he saith, <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>did affirm the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be joyned with great impiety.</hi> So that he speaks the sense of <hi>our Church</hi> and not barely his <hi>own;</hi> and surely when he wrote by K. <hi>James</hi> his direction and order, and had so great intimacy with Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> and other learned men of our <hi>Church,</hi> he would declare nothing to be her <hi>sense</hi> which was contrary to it. And as to his own private opinion, I could tell <hi>T. G.</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, <hi>viz.</hi> that when he was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently set upon by all the Wit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of <hi>Card. Perron,</hi> and disobliged by some persons of his own <hi>Communion</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> he set himself seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> in that <hi>Church,</hi> and whether he might with a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50112:54"/>
safe conscience embrace it; and I have seen in his own <hi>hand-writing</hi> the reasons which hindred him from it; and the first of them, was the <hi>Fear of Idolatry, which he saw practised in the worship of Images and Saints.</hi> Which is as full a proof as may be, that he did not think any person could embrace the communion of that <hi>Church</hi> without <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry</hi> as to the Worship of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi> The third is Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who not only charges the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> but he saith, <hi>that in their Brevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Hours, and Rosaries, they pray direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, absolutely and finally to Saints; and not meerly to the Saints to pray to God for them, but give what they pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:</hi> To this <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>they profess they do no such thing;</hi> as though we were enquiring what they professed, and not what Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> charged them with. If <hi>Idolatry</hi> according to Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> be required in the <hi>Authorized Offices</hi> of <hi>Devotion</hi> in their <hi>Church,</hi> how can the members of it be excused either from <hi>hyocrisie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry?</hi> The fourth is Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> who chargeth the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> with <hi>such superstition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as cannot be excused:</hi> The fifth Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> who saith, <hi>the Papists give divine
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50112:54"/>
honour to Images.</hi> The sixth Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who not only affirms the <hi>modern Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be too like to Paganism in the adoration of Images,</hi> but condemns <hi>the praying to Angels as the Idolatry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Council of</hi> Laodicea; as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> shewed from his <hi>M S. notes</hi> upon <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> To these Dr. <hi>St.</hi> added in his <hi>General Preface,</hi> the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of Archbishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> Bishop <hi>Montague, Pet. Heylin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thorndike;</hi> which three last were the very <hi>persons T. G.</hi> did appeal to; and the <hi>last</hi> of them did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>that the practice of Idolatry was such in the Roman Church, that no good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an dare trust his soul in the communion of it;</hi> which is all one as to say, they must be guilty of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

But if the Church only pray, that the Spirit of God, coming down upon the Elements, may make them the Body and Blood of Christ, so that they which receive them may be filled with the Grace of his Spirit; then is it not the sense of the Catholick Church that can oblige any man to believe the abolishing of the Elements in their bodily substance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause supposing that they remain, they may nevertheless come to be the instrument of Gods Spirit to convey the operation thereof to them that are disposed to receive it, no otherwise than his flesh and blood conveyed the efficacy thereof upon earth: and that I

               <p>Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was a man of very good parts and Learning, and who did write History pleasantly enough; but in some things he was too much a <hi>party</hi> to be an <hi>Historian,</hi> and being deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in some quarrels himself, all his Historical writings about our <hi>Church</hi> do plainly discover which side he espoused: which to me doth not seem to agree with the impartiality of an <hi>Historian.</hi> And if he could but throw dirt on that which he accounted the <hi>Puritan party,</hi> from the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> he matter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not though the whole <hi>Reformation</hi> suffered by it. But for all this he was far from being a Friend either to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and next to <hi>Puritanism,</hi> I believe he hated <hi>Popery</hi> most; so that if he had been alive, and you had gone to thank him for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had done you, in all probability you had provoked him to have written

And what then? doth this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him suspected for a <hi>Puritan</hi> at that time? when many of the greatest <hi>Anti-Puritans</hi> were zealous defenders of those opinions. In all Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time and after, the name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> signified <hi>the opposers of our Government, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Orders of our Church;</hi> and some have undertaken to name the Person who first applyed this name to the <hi>asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of these <hi>doctrinal points,</hi> towards the latter end of K. <hi>James.</hi> This is certain, (which is most material to our purpose) that when K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. published his <hi>Declaration</hi> to prevent unnecessary <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations</hi>

               <p>His words are these, <hi>I do as much mislike the distinction of the Papists and the intent of it, as any man doth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I go about to excuse them, from wicked and (without repentance, and Gods singular mercy,) damnable Idolatry.</hi> This is enough to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s purpose; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he saith, <hi>he placeth the Papists among wicked and damnable Idolaters.</hi> Is not this home do you think?</p>

               <p>It is notably argued, I confess; and thence it follows, if <hi>Archbishop Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> had understood the force of his own principle, he must have separated from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But is it not plain to the common sense of any man that Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> writing on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and against this very principle in <hi>T.

               <p>I think not truly. If this be the Fundamental principle of <hi>Puritans, that nothing is lawful in the Worship of God but what is commanded, then to charge the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with Idolatry is a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive sign of Puritanism.</hi> How many Cords are necessary to tye these two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? (1.) Can no one charge the <hi>Papists</hi> with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but by vertue of this principle? I do hold, whatever <hi>God</hi> hath not forbidden, to be lawful in his <hi>Worship;</hi> but may not I at the same time, hold some kind of prohibited <hi>Worship</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry?</hi> I can hardly imagine a man of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s subtilty could write thus. But that you have the Book by you, and tell me so, I could not have believed it.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50112:62"/>
(2.) Those who do hold this principle, do not presently make every thing <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> to be an <hi>Idol</hi> by vertue of it. For they do not deduce this unlawfulness from the <hi>prohibition</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but from the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> as a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and they say, <hi>we must not add thereto,</hi> and therefore no humane invention must be used in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Now judge you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to this principle there can be nothing <hi>unlawful,</hi> but it must be an <hi>Idol?</hi>

Readers will take his word without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther: and I scarce ever knew a Writer who stands more in need of the good opinion of his Reader in this kind, than <hi>T.

But this is too gross a way of imposing upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of Readers: yet this is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of dealing with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> When they intend to write against him; then, <hi>have you Dr.</hi> St.<hi>'s Irenicum?</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to find matter there to expose him to the hatred of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him as unfit to defend the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> If this takes not, then they pick sentences and half-sentences from the series of the discourse, and laying these together, cry, <hi>Look ye here, is this a man fit to defend your Church, that so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himself thus, and thus?</hi> when any common understanding by comparing the places, will find them either falsely represented, or easily reconciled.

What Dr. <hi>St.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. 3. Which way the sense of the <hi>Articles</hi> is to be interpreted. <hi>T. G.</hi> looks upon it as a notable observation, that the <hi>Compilers of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles (in which is contained the doctrine of the Church of</hi> England) <hi>sufficiently insinuate that they could find no such command forbidding the Worship of Images, when they rejected the adoration of Images, not as Idolatry, but only as a fond thing vainly invented, nor as repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, but as rather repugnant to the word of God;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50112:65"/>
which qualification of theirs gives us plainly to understand, that they had done their endeavours to find such a command, but could meet with none.</hi> To which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> gives this answer, that the force of all he saith lyes upon the words of the <hi>English translation,</hi> whereas if he had looked on the <hi>Latin,</hi> wherein they give account of their doctrine to foreign <hi>Churches,</hi> this <hi>Criticism</hi> had been lost, the words being <hi>immo verbo Dei contradicit;</hi> whereby it appears that <hi>rather</hi> is not used as a <hi>term of diminution,</hi> but of a more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement affirmation. And what saith <hi>T. G.</hi> I pray to this?</p>

to. If the Doctrine which the Church of</hi> England <hi>chargeth be that which is taught by some of her School Divines (which he takes to be her true meaning) this is also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed (at least by those very Divines who teach it) to be Idolatry.

               <p>And doth this mighty effort come to this at last? What pity it is <hi>T.

For 1.

G.</hi> saith
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50112:67"/>
not one word in his last Book, and I commend him for it) the <hi>Western Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> condemn <hi>adoration of Images: very true,</hi> saith <hi>T. G.</hi> and his Brethren, <hi>but all this was a bare mistake of the</hi> Nicene Council, <hi>which never approved</hi> adoration <hi>of</hi> Images, <hi>but only an</hi> inferiour Worship; but Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath shewed that the <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Council</hi> knew of this distinction well enough, and notwithstanding their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, the <hi>Western Church</hi> did not judge that the <hi>worship</hi> which they gave to <hi>Images</hi> was <hi>really adoration</hi> whether they called it so or not. Just so it is with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> this distinguishes <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from <hi>inferiour Worship,</hi> but our <hi>Church</hi> owns no such <hi>distinction,</hi> and calls that <hi>Religious worship</hi> which they give to <hi>Images, adoration;</hi> and supposing it were really so, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> saith, <hi>their own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines yield it to be Idolatry; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> calls their <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images adoration,</hi> or <hi>giving Divine Worship to a Creature,</hi> but their <hi>Divines</hi> do yield this is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth charge the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But how subtilly had <hi>T. G.</hi> altered the whole force of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument? by taking <hi>adoration</hi> not in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50112:67"/>
                  <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> but of their <hi>School-Divines,</hi> and then telling us, <hi>that even those School-Divines who teach adoration of Images deny it to be Idolatry.</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever expected they should confess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves guilty? But what is this, to the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> where doth it allow such a distinction of <hi>Divine worship</hi> into that which is <hi>superiour</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,</hi> or that which is <hi>proper to God</hi> and that <hi>which is not?</hi> 2. By <hi>Romish Doctrine</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth not mean the <hi>doctrine of the School-divines;</hi> but the <hi>Doctrine received and allowed in that Church</hi> from whence the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and practised. Such kind of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> I mean, as is justified and defended in <hi>common</hi> among them, without their <hi>School-distinctions; such worship</hi> as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired here in the <hi>Recantation</hi> of the <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards</hi> as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> observes,<note place="margin">Defence <hi>p.</hi> 581.</note> 
                  <hi>I do swear to God and all his Seynts upon this Holy Gospel, that fro this day forward I shall worship Images with praying and offering unto them in the Worship of the Seynts that they be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> such <hi>Worship</hi> as was required here by the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of <hi>Arundel,</hi> A.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50112:68"/>
Acts of Adoration;</hi> and this <hi>Constitution</hi> was a part of the <hi>Canon Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which all persons were then bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, or else might be proceeded against as <hi>Lollards.</hi> And this is that which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> insists upon, was the thing condemned by the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Church, viz.</hi> the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> which was required and practised here in <hi>England.</hi> And what reason have we to run to <hi>School-Divines</hi> for the sense of matters of daily <hi>practice,</hi> as the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> was before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?</hi> And so I conclude, if this be all <hi>T. G.</hi> in so long time hath had to say about this matter, (<hi>viz.</hi> above four years since Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s <hi>General Preface</hi> was Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished) he hath very unreasonably char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with <hi>dissenting</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

            <head>THE Second Conference, About the consequences of the charge of Idolatry.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>HOw long have you been at the Auction?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Above an hour; for I had a great desire to see how the Books were sold at them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>And I pray what do you observe concerning the buying of Books here?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I find it a pretty humoursome thing: and sometimes men give greater rates for Books, than they may buy them for in the Shops; and yet generally, Books are sold dearer here, than in any part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>What reason can you give for that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>One is, that the <hi>Scholars</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> allow themselves greater Liberty in <hi>Learning</hi> than they do in foreign parts, where commonly only one kind of Learning is in esteem in a place; but here a man that intends a <hi>Library,</hi> buys all sorts of Books; and that makes your Traders in Books bring over from all parts, and of all kinds, and when they have them in their hands, they make the buyers pay for their curiosity. In <hi>Italy</hi> it is a rare thing to meet with a <hi>Greek</hi> Book in the Shops; In <hi>Spain</hi> you see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almost besides <hi>Prayer-Books, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi> and <hi>School-Divinity.</hi> At <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Lions,</hi> School-Divinity and Lives of the Saints are most sold. At <hi>Paris</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is greater variety. But we observe it abroad, that in the best Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Countreys, Learning is in least esteem; as in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> And where Learning is more in vogue, as in <hi>France,</hi> you see how ready they are to quarrel with the Pope; and to fall into Heats and Controversies about Religion. And therefore to deal freely with you, I am not at all pleased to see this eagerness of buying of Books among you. For as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50112:70"/>
long as Learning holds up, we see little hopes of prevailing, though we and the Fanaticks had <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience:</hi> since upon long experience we find <hi>Ignorance</hi> and our <hi>Devotion,</hi> to agree as well as <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Daughter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad of any symptom that we are like to hold in our Wits; and I think your observation is true enough. I have only one thing to add to it: which is, that it was not <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius</hi> that contributed so much to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as <hi>Erasmus;</hi> especially among us in <hi>England.</hi> For, <hi>Erasmus</hi> was the Man who awakened mens understandings; and brought them from the <hi>Friers Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to a relish of general Learning; he by his Wit laughed down the imperious Ignorance of the Monks, and made them the scorn of Christendom; and by his Learning he brought most of the Latine Fathers to light, and published them with excellent Editions, and useful Notes; by which means men of parts set themselves to consider the ancient Church from the Writings of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> themselves, and not from the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> and <hi>School-men.</hi> So that most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impartial men were prepared for the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> before
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50112:71"/>
it brake forth. For it is a foolish thing to imagine that a quarrel between two <hi>Monks</hi> at <hi>Wittemberg</hi> should make such an alteration in the state of <hi>Christendom.</hi> But things had been tending that way a good while before; by the gradual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation of Learning in these Western parts. The <hi>Greeks</hi> coming into <hi>Italy</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Books</hi> with them, laid the first foundation of it; then some of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> advanced their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by the encouragement they gave to it: from thence it spread into <hi>Germany,</hi> and there <hi>Reuchlin</hi> and his Companions joyned <hi>Hebrew</hi> with <hi>Greek</hi>; from thence it came into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> When men had by this means attained to some skill in Languages, they thought it necessary to search the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> in their Original Tongues, which they had heard of, but few had seen, not above one <hi>Greek Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> being to be found in all <hi>Germany;</hi> then <hi>Erasmus</hi> prints it with his <hi>Notes,</hi> which infinitely took among all pious and learned men, and as much enraged the Monks and Friers, and all the fast Friends to their Dulness and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When men had from reading the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50112:71"/>
                  <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> formed in their minds a true notion of the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and of the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi> of the ancient <hi>Church,</hi> and compared that with what they saw in their own Age, they wondred at the difference; and were astonished to think how such an alteration should happen; but then, they reflected on the <hi>Barbarism</hi> of the foregoing Ages, the gradual encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the suiting of Doctrines and practices to carry on a temporal Interest, the complyance with the superstitious humours of people, the vast numbers of Monks and Friers, whose interest lay in the upholding these things; and when they laid these things together, they did not wonder at the degeneracy they saw in the Christian Church. All the difficulty was, how to recover the Church out of this state; and this puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled the wisest men among them; some thought the ill humours were grown so natural to the Body, that it would hazard the state of it to attempt a sudden purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them quite away; and that a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Reformation would do more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than good, by popular tumults, by Schism and Sacriledge; and although such persons saw the corruptions and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50112:72"/>
wished them reformed, yet considering the hazard of a sudden change, they thought it best for particular persons to inform the world better, and so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees bring it about, than to make any violent disturbance in the Church. While these things were considered of by wiser men, the <hi>Pope</hi> goes on to abuse the People with the trade of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and his Officers in <hi>Germany</hi> were so impudent in this Trade, that a bold Monk at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> defies them, and of a sudden lays open the Cheat, and this discovery immediately spread like Wild-fire; and so they went on from one thing to another, till the People were enraged at being so long and so grosly abused and Tyrannized over. But when <hi>Reformation</hi> begins below, it is not to be expected that no disorders and heats should happen in the management of it; which gave distastes to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as <hi>Erasmus</hi> was, which made him like so ill the <hi>Wittenberg Reformation,</hi> and whatever was carried on by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Tumults.<note place="margin">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50112:72"/>
and the Popes Crown; that his doctrine was true and certain, but he did not approve the manner of his Writing.</hi> But here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Reformation was begun by the consent of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Bishops,</hi> who yielded to the retrenchment of the Popes exorbitant power, and the taking away some grosser abuses in <hi>Henry</hi> 8's. time; but in <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.'s time, and Q. <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> when it was settled on the principles it now stands, there was no such regard had to <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> as to <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> whose learning and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were in greater esteem here, than the fiery spirits of the other.

So that I have a mind to hear what you can say in his defence about this, before I touch upon the other <hi>consequences</hi> which he urgeth upon this <hi>charge</hi> of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>

               <p>With all my heart. There are two things wherein the force of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s argument lyes. (1.) <hi>That which he calls his undeniable Maxim of Reason,</hi> viz. <hi>That no man can give to another that which he hath not himself.</hi> (2.) <hi>That Idolatry lays men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50112:73"/>
the Apostles excommunication, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are deprived of all lawful Authority to use or exercise the Power of Orders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to these, two things are already proved by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> (1.) That the sin of the Givers doth not hinder the <hi>validity</hi> of <hi>Ordination.</hi> (2.) That the Christian Church hath allowed the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority</hi> of <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>exercising</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Orders,</hi> in those who have been condemned for <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Which he proves more briefly in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and at large in his last <hi>Book</hi> from the case of the <hi>Arian Bishops.</hi> And now let any one judge whether <hi>T. G.</hi> had any cause to <hi>Hector</hi> about this matter for so many <hi>pages</hi> together, as though he had either not understood, or not taken notice of the force of his Argument. Concerning his undeniable <hi>Maxime</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it was the very argument used by the <hi>Donatists</hi> to prove the <hi>nullity</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> among <hi>Hereticks:</hi> and that the answer given by the Church was, that the <hi>Instrument</hi> was not the <hi>Giver,</hi> but the <hi>First Institutor,</hi> and if the <hi>Minister</hi> keep to the <hi>Institution,</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may be conveyed though he hath it not himself. This Dr. <hi>St.</hi> thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pertinent to shew, that where <hi>Power</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50112:74"/>
and <hi>Authority</hi> are <hi>conveyed</hi> by men only as <hi>Instruments,</hi> the particular default of such persons, as <hi>heresie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> do not hinder the derivation of that <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> to them. And this he proved to be the sense of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in the <hi>Ordinations</hi> of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> It is true, he did not then speak to <hi>Authority</hi> so much as to <hi>Power;</hi> nor to <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> as it is called by the <hi>School Divines,</hi> so much as to the <hi>validity</hi> of <hi>Ordination.</hi> But he proceeded upon a <hi>parity</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> in both cases; and could not imagine that any persons would suppose the Christian Church would allow a <hi>validity</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi> without <hi>lawful Authority</hi> to use and exercise those <hi>Orders.</hi> For in all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances produced by him from the <hi>second Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> wherein undeniable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples were brought of <hi>Ordinations</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi> allowed by the ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> (even those of <hi>Nice, Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi>) it was apparent that their <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>use</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> their <hi>power of Orders,</hi> was allowed as well as their <hi>Ordinations:</hi> For he there shews that <hi>Anatolius</hi> the <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>fourth Council</hi> was ordained by <hi>Dioscorus</hi> in the presence of <hi>Eutyches;</hi> that many of the <hi>Bishops</hi> who sat in the <hi>sixth Council</hi>

               <p>No; that is not the thing, but because he did not understand the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>jurisdiction.</hi>

               <p>Yes, he knew it well enough; but he thought if he proved the <hi>Validity</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> he proved the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction;</hi> because the <hi>giving Orders</hi> is part of <hi>Church Authority,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> is received in <hi>taking Orders</hi>; and the <hi>Church</hi> never allowed one, but it allowed the other also.

               <p>Let us then consider more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on which side the <hi>mistake</hi> lay; which will be discerned by this, whether we are to follow the <hi>Modern Schools,</hi> or the <hi>Judgement</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> in this matter. For Dr. <hi>St.</hi> spake according to the sense and practice of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>T. G.</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>modern notions</hi> and <hi>distinctions</hi> of their <hi>Schools.</hi> It is true, their <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> have so distinguished the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> that they make the one to depend upon an <hi>indelible unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible character,</hi> which no crime can hinder having its valid effect: but that <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> or the right of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and absolution may be suspended or taken away. Since the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>indelible Character</hi> given in <hi>Orders,</hi> is not to be disputed among them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50112:80"/>
they hold <hi>the character</hi> to remain wherever <hi>Orders</hi> are received in the due <hi>form;</hi> but then they say this <hi>character</hi> is capable of such restraints by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that it remains like <hi>Aristotles</hi> first matter, a dull and unactive thing till the Church give a new <hi>Form</hi> to it, and this they call the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>jurisdiction.</hi> But that all this, is <hi>new doctrine</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> and a late <hi>Monkish</hi> invention, will appear by these considerations.</p>

To name no more. If this had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the sense of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> that the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi> is <hi>indelible,</hi> but not that of <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> I desire <hi>T. G.</hi> to give an answer to those Questions; which, I fear, will involve several <hi>Heads</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> under that which he calls in Dr. <hi>St. an intolerable mistake.</hi> Did so many Popes know no better this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the <hi>Validity</hi> of <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Jurisdiction?</hi> I am sorry to see <hi>T.

But alas! This is the current <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Modern Schools</hi>; and what obliges them to look into the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of former Ages? Yet methinks a man had need to look about him, before he upbraids another with <hi>gross and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable errors,</hi> lest at the same time he prove the guilty person; and then the charge falls back far more heavily on himself.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Those who did hold the <hi>Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Ordinations</hi> did it chiefly on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the due <hi>Form</hi> that was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whoever the <hi>Persons</hi> were; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Let these considerations be laid together and the result will be, 1. Either Dr. <hi>St.</hi> was not guilty of <hi>an intolerable error and mistake</hi> in this matter, or so many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible <hi>Heads</hi> of the Church were guilty of the same. 2.

ages in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> did take away the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Orders.</hi> 3. <hi>T.

The ground assigned by those who held the <hi>validity</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> will hold for the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of exercising the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Orders,</hi> if not actually taken away by the <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> For every man hath the power which is given him, till it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him; every one that receives <hi>Orders</hi> according to the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> hath a <hi>power</hi> given him to <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> and <hi>absolve,</hi> therefore every such person doth enjoy that <hi>power,</hi> till it be taken from him. For as I have already shewed, this is part of the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Orders</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church, Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, Quorum remiseritis,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> determines the character to be imprinted upon the use of these words:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>defending the Ecclesiastical Authority of the Church of England:</hi> I assure you it is a very politick Discourse, and hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral deep fetches in it. <hi>First, he begins with his</hi> Irenicum, <hi>and there he lays the Foundation, that the Government may be changed.</hi> 2. <hi>The Book was reprinted since the Bishops were reestablished by Law.</hi> 3. <hi>He perswades the Bishops in that Book to reduce the form of Church Government to its primitive State and Order, by resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Presbyteries under them,</hi> &amp;c. 4. <hi>When this would not do, he charges the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>with Idolatry, and makes this the sense of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to make her contribute to the subversion of her own Authority.</hi> 5. <hi>When</hi> T.

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>A very great <hi>Discovery</hi> I assure you! and <hi>T. G.</hi> deserves a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than any common <hi>Mole-catchers</hi> do. But I never liked such <hi>Politick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi>; for if people are more dull and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50112:86"/>
quiet than they would have them, they make plots for them to keep up their reputation and interest. They must have always something to whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Great Mens Ears, and to fill their Heads with designs which were never thought of; by which means they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them with unreasonable suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tyrannize over them under a pretence of kindness. Just thus doth <hi>T. G.</hi> do by the <hi>Governours</hi> of our <hi>Church:</hi> he would fain perswade them, that there is one Dr. <hi>St.</hi> who hath undertaken to defend the Church, but doth carry on a very secret and subtile design to ruine and destroy it. If they say, <hi>they do not believe it;</hi> he seems to pity them for their incredulity and weakness, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to convince them, by a long train of his own inventions; and if they be so easie to hearken to it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his insinuations, then he flatters and applauds them as the only Friends to the Church, when in the meantime he really <hi>laughs</hi> at them as a sort of weak men, who can be imposed upon by any man who pretends to be a Friend, although even in that he doth them and the <hi>Church</hi> the greater mischief. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe such kind of insinuations as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50112:86"/>
these can prevail upon any one man of understanding in our <hi>Church,</hi> against a person who hath at least endeavoured his utmost to defend it. But since <hi>T. G.</hi> talks so politickly about these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I will convince you by one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of common prudence, that if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> be a man of common sense, (much more if he be so politick and designing as <hi>T. G.</hi> represents him) all these sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions must be both false and foolish. For that which all designing men aim at, is their own interest and advantage: Now can any man that hath common sense left in him, imagine that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> can aim at any greater advantage by <hi>ruining</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> than by <hi>preserving</hi> it? Are not his circumstances more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> than ever he can hope they should be, if it were destroyed? They who would perswade others that he carries on such a <hi>secret design,</hi> must suppose him to be next to an <hi>Ideot,</hi> and such are not very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Politicians. But what is it then should make him act so much against his interest? It can be nothing but folly or malice. But I do not find they have taxed him of any malice to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or of any occasion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50112:87"/>
for it which the <hi>Church</hi> hath given him, if he were disposed to it. Why then should any be so senseless them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or suppose others to be so, as to go about to possess men with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an underground plot Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is carrying on, not only to blow up the <hi>Thames,</hi> but the rising Fabrick of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> too: <hi>i. e.</hi> to ruine and destroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?

               <p>I will tell you freely; I believe there are many things in it, which if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> were to write now, he would not have said; For there are some things which shew his youth, and want of due consideration: others which he yielded too far in hopes of gaining the dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; but upon the whole matter I am fully satisfied the Book was written with a design <hi>to serve the Church of England:</hi> and the design of it, I take to be this; that among us there was no necessity of entring upon nice and subtile disputes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50112:87"/>
about a strict <hi>jus divinum</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> such as makes all other <hi>Forms</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>unlawful</hi>; but it was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us, if it were proved to be the most ancient and agreeable to <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal practice,</hi> and most accommodate to our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Civil Government</hi>; and there could be no pretence against sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to it, but the demonstrating its <hi>unlawfulness,</hi> which he knew was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be done. And for what propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals he makes about tempering <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> they were no other than what King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. and Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> had made before him; and doth <hi>T. G.</hi> think they designed <hi>to ruine the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> And as long as he declared this to be the design of his Book both at the beginning and conclusion of it, suppose he were mistaken in the means he took, must such a man be presently condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as one that aimed at the <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi>

               <p>That is as true as others of his suggestions. The <hi>Book</hi> was Printed while things were unsetled, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to remove the violent prejudices of the <hi>dissenting party</hi> against <hi>Episcopal
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50112:88"/>
Government;</hi> and I have heard, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable service that way, at least in a Neighbour Kingdom, and it happened to be reprinted afterwards, with the same Title it had before. But what then? Do not <hi>Booksellers</hi> look on <hi>Books</hi> as their own, and do what they please with them, without the Authors consent or approbation? Hath he ever Preached or Written any Doctrine since, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> Hath he made any party or faction to the disturbance of the Peace of the Church? Hath he not conformed to its Rules, observed its Offices, obeyed his Superiours, and been ready to defend its <hi>Cause</hi> against <hi>Adversaries</hi> of all sorts? And can <hi>malice</hi> it self after all this fasten such a calumny upon him, that <hi>he is a secret enemy to the Church of England, and designs to ruine and destroy it?</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a poor <hi>Englishman</hi> in <hi>Amboyna</hi> being cruelly tormented by the <hi>Dutch</hi>; and finding nothing he could say would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Tormentors to release him (and he said any thing that he thought would prevail with them) at last he prayed God, that he might tell them <hi>Probable Lies.</hi> I would advise <hi>T.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50112:88"/>
find out <hi>Probable Plots,</hi> otherwise he will lose all the reputation of an <hi>Informer</hi> and <hi>Discoverer.</hi> But I can hardly tell, whether his <hi>Plot</hi> or his <hi>Proofs</hi> were the worse; for as there appears no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the Plot, so there is no evidence in the Proofs. There being nothing pretended since the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> but this <hi>charge of Idolatry,</hi> and that hath been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared already, by shewing that it doth not <hi>subvert</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>I will tell you how. <hi>If the Church hath been guilty of Idolatry,</hi> (1.) <hi>Then she hath required and enjoyned Idolatry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 66, 67.</note> 
                  <hi>for many hundreds of years paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the Heathens.</hi> (2.) <hi>Then</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met <hi>had more wisdom and power to carry on his design than the Son of God, for his followers have been preserved from it by the grounds he laid above a thousand years.</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:50112:89"/>
(3.) <hi>Then our Fore-fathers had better been converted to Judaism or Turcism than to Christianity as they were.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I deny every one of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences. For our present dispute is only about the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Romes</hi> being guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and from thence (1.) it doth not follow, <hi>that the whole Christian Church must require Idolatry,</hi> if that doth; unless <hi>T. G.</hi> had proved, that all other <hi>Churches</hi> are equally involved in the same guilt, which he never attempted. (2.) It doth not follow <hi>that</hi> Mahomet <hi>was wiser than Christ;</hi> for if you compare the grounds laid for Divine Worship by <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Mahomet;</hi> I say that <hi>Christ</hi> did shew infinitely more <hi>Wisdom</hi> in them, than so vile an <hi>Impostor;</hi> and it is a shame for any <hi>Christian</hi> to suggest the contrary: but if <hi>T. G.</hi> speaks of <hi>Power to carry on his design;</hi> then it must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>Mahomets Power</hi> hath preserved the <hi>Mahumetan Religion</hi> so long free from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> although <hi>Christ</hi> hath not; which must imply the greatness of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets Power in Heaven;</hi> and so it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon <hi>blasphemy.</hi> (3.) It doth not follow <hi>that our Fore-fathers had better been converted to Judaism or Turcism than to Christianity.</hi> For they had incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50112:89"/>
greater advantages towards their salvation than either <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pagans;</hi> and such circumstances might accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their practice of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as might make it not to hinder their salvation. But I shall give you a full answer to this in the words of <hi>Bishop Sanderson,</hi> (who is another <hi>competent witness,</hi> if any more were needful, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> doth not in the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> contradict the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>)
<q>We have much reason to conceive good hope of the salvation of many of our Fore-fathers: who,<note place="margin">B. <hi>Sanders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>n.</hi> 17.</note> led away with the common superstitions of those blind times, might yet by those general truths, which by the mercy of God were preserved among the foulest over-spreadings of Popery, agreeable to the Word of God (though clogged with an addition of many superstitions and Antichristian Inventions withal) be brought to true faith in the Son of God; unfeigned Repentance from dead Works; and a sincere desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of new and holy Obedience. This was the Religion that brought them to Heaven, even Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Obedience. This is the true, and the Old and the Catholick
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50112:90"/>
Religion: and this is our Religion, in which we hope to find salvation; and if ever any of you that miscall your selves Catholicks come to Heaven, it is this Religion must carry you thither. If together with this true Religion of Faith, Repentance, and Obedience, they embraced also your additions, as their blind Guides then led them; prayed to our Lady, kneeled to an Image, crept to a Cross, flocked to a Mass as you now do: these were their spots and their blemishes; these were their hay and stubble; these were their errours, and their Ignorances. And I doubt not, but as S. <hi>Paul</hi> for his blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and persecutions, so they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy for these sins, because they did them ignorantly in misbelief. And upon the same ground we have cause also to hope charitably of many thousand poor souls in <hi>Italy, Spain</hi> and other parts of the Christian world at this day, that by the same blessed means they may attain mercy and salvation in the end, although in the mean time through ignorance they defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with much foul Idolatry, and many gross superstitions.</q>

from sin, is <hi>Ignorantia facti,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that hath been already declared; but theirs was <hi>Ignorantia juris,</hi> which excuseth not. And besides, as they lived in the practice of that Worship which we call Idolatry, so they dyed in the same without repentance; and so their case is not the same with S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> who saw those sins and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for them, and forsook them; but how can Idolaters, living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so without repentance, be saved?</q>

But I do not so excuse the Idolatry of our Fore-fathers, as if it were not in it self a sin, and that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance) damnable. But yet their Ignorance being such as it was; nourished by Education, Custom, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Tyranny of their Leaders, the fashion of the Times, not without shew also of Piety and Devotion; and themselves, withal, having such slender means of better knowledge; though it cannot wholly excuse them from sin

without repentance damnable, yet it much lesseneth and qualifieth the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of their Idolatry; arguing that their continuance therein was more from other prejudices, than from a wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful contempt of Gods Holy Word and Will. And as for their Repentance, it is as certain, that as many of them as are saved did repent of their Idolatries, as it is certain no Idolater nor other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can be saved without repentance. But then there is a double difference to be observed between repentance for Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances, and known sins; the one must be particular, the other general; the one cannot be sincere without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking, the other may;</q> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges upon, and then concludes,
<q>Some of our Fore-fathers then, might not only live in Popish Idolatry, but even dye in an Idolatrous Act, breathing out their last with their lips at a Crucifix and an <hi>Ave Mary</hi> in their thoughts: and yet have truly repented, (though but in the General, and the croud of their unknown sins) even of those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sins; and have at the same instant true Faith in Jesus Christ, and other Graces accompanying salvation.</q>

                  <hi>that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>ought to have assigned us some Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct in all Ages, from all Heretical and Idolatrous Congregations, which Christ hath preserved alwayes from Heresie and Idolatry?</hi>

Christians, which he never did. But he shewed the feebleness of that kind of arguing, from <hi>particulars</hi> to <hi>generals;</hi> as though all the promises made to the <hi>Church</hi> must fail, if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> be guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

               <p>But I will prove <hi>that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>ought to assign such a distinct Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, he saith, <hi>that a Christian by vertue of his being so, is bound to joyn in some Church or Congregation of Christians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be such a Church at all times to joyn with.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I answer, (1.) Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer doth imply no more than this, that a Christian is bound to joyn with other Christians in the Acts of Gods publick Worship; but withal he adds immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, that he is bound to choose the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the purest Church; which doth suppose a competition between two Churches, where a person may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Communion of either, as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that where there are distinct Communions, the best is to be chosen. (2.) Supposing no Church to be so pure that a mans Conscience can be fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in all the practices of it, yet he may lawfully hold Communion with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50112:92"/>
that <hi>Church</hi> he is baptized in, till the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful practices become the condition of his Communion. As here in <hi>England,</hi> the conditions of Communion are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as to <hi>Clergy-men</hi> and <hi>Lay-men;</hi> if the latter be satisfied in what concerns them, they have no reason to reject Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves, for what concerns others. (3.) Where any Church doth require Idolatrous Acts as conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>Cause</hi> of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made for a <hi>distinct Communion.</hi> So that there is no necessity of assigning a <hi>distinct Church</hi> in all <hi>Ages</hi> free from <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> since men may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with a corrupt Church, so they do not Communicate in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and when they come to that height to require this, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the <hi>Causes</hi> of the Separation which is made on the account of <hi>Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Still that promise sticks with me, <hi>that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against the Church:</hi> and are not <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> the two <hi>Posts</hi> of those <hi>Gates?</hi>

               <p>If you turn over that promise never so much, you will prove no more from it, than the continuance of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church</hi> in the World, with a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50112:93"/>
of <hi>salvation</hi> to the members of it. And this we do not deny: but it doth not prove that any particular <hi>Church</hi> shall be preserved in all Ages free from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For whatever may be consistent with the <hi>salvation</hi> of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a <hi>Church,</hi> may be consistent with the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> not prevailing against it; but <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the <hi>salvation</hi> of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a <hi>Church.</hi> Because there are so many cases assigned by <hi>Divines,</hi> wherein <hi>sins</hi> of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Errour,</hi> are consistent with <hi>salvation.</hi> I say then, that <hi>Christs Promises</hi> do prove a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> in all <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> but they do not prove the indefectibility of any distinct Church.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>First, <hi>There was in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Luther <hi>a distinct Church, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was necessary to salvation, but this was not the Protestant, for that came in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Luther, <hi>therefore it was the Roman.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This is very subtle reasoning, yet it is possible we may find out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it. There was in the World before <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> some Civil Society, in which it was necessary for a man to live for his own preservation; but this was not the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> for that rose up after him; therefore it was the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Common-wealth.</hi> But doth not this imply, that there was no other Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in the world, wherein a man could preserve himself, but the <hi>Roman Common-wealth?</hi> But I will put the case a little farther home; after <hi>Britain</hi> was made a <hi>Province,</hi> it became a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> and depended so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the strength and <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was not able to defend it self; it being
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50112:94"/>
sore distressed by enemies, and in danger of Ruine, sends to <hi>Rome</hi> for help; there it is denyed, and the <hi>Britains</hi> forced to look out for help elsewhere. Now after <hi>T. G.</hi>'s way of reasoning the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> must return to the <hi>Romans,</hi> because once they had been <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.</hi> The case is alike in the <hi>Church;</hi> the time was when the <hi>Western Church</hi> was united under one <hi>Head,</hi> but by degrees this <hi>Head</hi> grew too heavy, and laid too great a load on the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, requiring very hard and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conditions from them; upon this, some of the members seek for relief, this is denyed them, they take care of their own safety, and do what is necessary to preserve themselves. The <hi>Head</hi> and some corrupt <hi>members</hi> conspiring, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce excommunication, if they do not presently yield and submit. These parts stand upon their own rights and ancient priviledges; that it was not an <hi>Vnion</hi> of <hi>submission</hi> but <hi>association</hi> originally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween several <hi>National Churches:</hi> and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> assuming so much more to it self, than did belong to it, and dealing so <hi>tyrannically</hi>; upon just complaints our <hi>Church</hi> had Reason to assert her own <hi>Freedom,</hi> and to reform
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50112:94"/>
the abuses which had crept either into her doctrine or practice. And that this was lawful proceeding, it offered to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie by Scripture and Reason and the Rules of the Primitive Church. Now the question of Communion, as it was stated between <hi>T. G.</hi> and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> comes to this, whether any person being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in this <hi>Church,</hi> ought in order to his salvation to forsake the communion of it, for that of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And this being the true state of it, I pray, where lies the force of the argument? Dr. <hi>St.</hi> yields communion with some <hi>Church</hi> to be necessary: and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is so to one baptized in it; why must any such leave it for that of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome? Yes,</hi> saith <hi>T. G., there was a distinct Church before</hi> Luther, <hi>whose communion was necessary to salvation;</hi> and what then? what have we to do with <hi>Luther?</hi> we are speaking of the present <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which was reformed by it self, and not by <hi>Luther.</hi> Why is it necessary to leave this <hi>Church,</hi> in which persons are baptized, and not in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther?</hi> Here lyes the main hinge of the Controversie; to which <hi>T. G.</hi> ought to speak, and not to run to a <hi>Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50112:95"/>
                  <hi>Luther.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> before the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> as well as since; but it hath now reformed it self, being an entire body within it self, having Bishops to govern it, Priests and Deacons to administer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to preach the Word of God, to officiate in the publick Liturgie, in which all the <hi>Ancient Creeds</hi> are read and owned; the question now is, whether sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cannot be had in the communion of this <hi>Church?</hi> or all persons are bound to return to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> This is the point, if <hi>T.

But it proceeds upon such false supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as these. (1.) That Communion with the <hi>Roman Church</hi> as <hi>such, i. e.</hi> as a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50112:95"/>
Body united under such a <hi>Head,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, which we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and it can never be proved, but by shewing, that <hi>Christ</hi> appointed the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> which is an argument, I do not find that now adays, You are willing to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; being so thread-bare and baffled a Topick. (2.) That no Doctrines but such as are contrary to the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> can be any reason to hold off from the <hi>Communion</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi>; but we think, the requiring doubtful things for certain, false for true, new for old, absurd for reasonable are ground enough for us not to embrace the Communion of a Church, unless it may be had on better terms than these. (3.) That no <hi>Church</hi> can be guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> unless we can name some <hi>distinct Church</hi> from whose <hi>Vnity</hi> it separated; whereas we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proved, that imposing unreasonable conditions of <hi>Communion,</hi> makes the Church so imposing guilty of the <hi>Schism.</hi> Surely <hi>T. G.</hi>'s stock is almost spent, when he plays the same game so often over. These are not such terrible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be produced afresh, as if they had never been heard of; when there is

not a <hi>Missioner</hi> that comes, but hath them at his fingers end.</p>

               <p>O the vertue of sodden Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts! How often are they produced without shame! To be short Sir, (1.) We deny that the <hi>Church</hi> of which the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Head,</hi> was ever commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by St. <hi>Paul</hi>; or in any <hi>one Age</hi> of the Christian World, was owned by it to be the <hi>only true Church:</hi> which is very much short of <hi>the whole Christian World of all Ages.</hi> (2.)

               <p>So far then we have cleared Dr. <hi>St.</hi> from patronizing the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>separated Congregations.</hi> (2.)

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you; he supposes that some scrupulous and conscientious men after all endeavours used to satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, may remain unsatisfied as to the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of some <hi>imposed Rites,</hi> but dare not proceed to <hi>positive separation</hi>

from the <hi>Church,</hi> but are willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in all other things save in those Rites which they still scruple; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these he puts the Question, whether such bare-nonconformity do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve such men in the guilt of <hi>Schism?</hi> And this I confess he resolves negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so brings in that long passage <hi>T. G.</hi> produces out of him. I now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your self, whether <hi>T. G.</hi> hath dealt fairly with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in two things, (1.) In not distinguishing the case of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> from that of bare <hi>nonconformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> only in some suspected Rites; and in producing these words to justifie the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Congregations?</hi> (2.) In taking his judgement in this matter rather from his <hi>Irenicum</hi> written so long since, than from his late Writings, wherein he hath purposely considered the Difference of the <hi>Case</hi> of those who separate from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and of our sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50112:100"/>
had a mind to keep close to the point; but now he flags and draws heavily on: For he repeats what he had said before for some pages, and then quotes out of Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s other <hi>Books</hi> for several pages more, and at last it comes to no more than this, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> doth in some places of his Writings seem to favour the <hi>Dissenters.</hi> I am quite tired with this <hi>impertinency:</hi> yet I would fain see an end of these things, that we might come close to the business of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which I long to be at.</p>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>To please you I will bring this charge as near to the point of <hi>Idolatry</hi> as I can; the substance of it is this, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> saith, <hi>the Church of England doth not look on her Articles as Articles of Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 84, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>but as inferiour Truths;</hi> from thence <hi>T. G.</hi> infers, (1.) <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>doth not err against any Articles of Faith.</hi> (2.) <hi>Dr.</hi> St. <hi>doth not believe the thirty nine Articles to be Articles of Faith.</hi> (3.) <hi>Then this charge of Idolatry is vain and groundless, because Idolatry is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50112:100"/>
against a Fundamental point of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Here is not one word new in all this long charge, but a tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of what <hi>T. G.</hi> had said before. It consists of two points. 1. The charge upon Dr. <hi>St.</hi> for <hi>undermining</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> 2. The unreasonableness of the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> upon his own sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Because <hi>T. G.</hi> seems to think there is something in this business which touched Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to the quick, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he declined giving any answer to the <hi>First Part</hi> of it, I will undertake to do it for him. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> doth indeed say that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth not make <hi>her Articles Articles of Faith,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth his Creed. And did ever any <hi>Divine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> say otherwise? It is true the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from her insolent pretence of Infallibility, doth make all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the <hi>Church</hi> of equal necessity to Salvation; because the ground of <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing things to be believed. But doth the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> challenge any such <hi>Infallibility</hi> to her self? No. She utterly disowns it, in her very <hi>Articles</hi>; therefore she must leave matters of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50112:101"/>
Faith, as she found them; <hi>i. e.</hi> she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all the <hi>Creeds</hi> into her <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> but makes no <hi>additions</hi> to them of her own; and therefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> did with great reason say, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> makes <hi>no Articles of Faith,</hi> but such as have the <hi>Testimony</hi> and <hi>Approbation</hi> of the <hi>whole Christian world</hi> and of <hi>all Ages,</hi> and are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be such by <hi>Rome</hi> it self: from whence he doth justly magnifie the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this <hi>Church</hi> in comparison with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>That he hath degraded the Articles of the Church of</hi> England <hi>from being Articles of Faith, into a lower Classe of inferiour Truths.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive plainly <hi>T. G.</hi> doth not know what an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> means according to the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> He looks on all <hi>propositions</hi> made by the <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sense,</hi> and founded on the doctrine of <hi>Infallibility</hi>; but where the Churches <hi>Infallibility</hi> is rejected, <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are such as have been thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Salvation</hi> by the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>Christian world,</hi> which consent is seen in the <hi>Ancient Creeds.</hi> And whatever
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50112:101"/>
doctrine is not contained therein though it be received as <hi>Truth,</hi> and agreeable to the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yet is not accounted an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith: i. e.</hi> not immediately necessary to <hi>Salvation</hi> as a point of Faith, But because of the dissentions of the Christian world in matters of Religion, a particular <hi>Church</hi> may for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her own peace declare her sense as to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> of some controverted points of <hi>Religion,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from all persons who are intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Offices</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> to those <hi>Articles,</hi> which doth imply that they agree with the <hi>sense</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> about them.</p>

               <p>But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> saith from <hi>Arch-bishop Bramhall, that the Church doth not oblige any man to believe them, but only not to contradict them,</hi> and upon this <hi>T.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Why not over <hi>Arch-Bishop Bramhall,</hi> whose words Dr. <hi>St.</hi> cites? And was he a <hi>favourer of Dissenters,</hi> and an <hi>underminer of the Church of</hi> England? Yet Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself in that place owns a <hi>subscription</hi> to them as necessary; and what doth <hi>subscription</hi> imply less than
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50112:102"/>
                  <hi>agreeing</hi> with the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> So that he saith more than <hi>Arch-Bishop Bramhall</hi> doth. And I do not see how his words can pass, but with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, that when he saith, <hi>we do not oblige any man to believe them,</hi> he means as <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> of which he speaks just before. But I do freely yield that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth require <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> of those <hi>propositions</hi> which are contained in the thirty nine Articles: and so doth Dr. <hi>St.</hi> when he saith, <hi>the Church requires subscription to them as inferiour Truths, i. e.</hi> owning them to be <hi>true propositions,</hi> though not as <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as our <hi>Church</hi> calls them.</p>

                  <hi>If they are but inferiour Truths,</hi> saith <hi>T. G. was it worth the while to rend asunder the Peace of Christendom for them? Is not this a very reasonable account, as</hi> I. S. <hi>calls it, of the Grounds of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and a rare way of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from the guilt of Schism?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>T. G.</hi> mistakes the matter. It was not our imposing <hi>negative points</hi> on others; but the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Romes</hi> impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing false and absurd doctrines for <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Articles of Faith,</hi> which did break the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Christendom.</hi> We could
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50112:102"/>
have no communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> unless we owned her <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> her <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> her <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or the equality of <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> her doctrines of <hi>Purgatory, Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints, Worship</hi> of <hi>Images, Transubstantiation,</hi> &amp;c. and we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not only to own them as <hi>true,</hi> which we know to be <hi>false</hi>; but as <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> which we look on as <hi>great hinderances</hi> to it. What was to be done in this case? Communion could not be held on other terms, than decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring false opinions to be true, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Doctrines to be necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. On such terms as these we must renounce our Christianity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we believed falshoods for truths, and not barely as truths, but as necessary Articles of Faith. Therefore what <hi>Schism</hi> there was, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> must thank her self for. And when this breach happened, our Church thought it necessary to express her sense of these Doctrines, that they were so far from being <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that they were <hi>false and erroneous,</hi> having no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation either in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity:</hi> and required a <hi>subscription</hi> to this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, from such as are admitted to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50112:103"/>
teach and instruct others. How could our <hi>Church</hi> do less than she did in this matter, if she would declare her sense to the World, or take care of her own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity? And is this making <hi>Negative Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> about which <hi>T. G.</hi> and <hi>E. W.</hi> and others, have made such senseless clamours? when we only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare those things they would impose upon us to be so far from being <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that they are erroneous Doctrines, and therefore are rejected by us. And this I take to be a <hi>Reasonable Account</hi> of the <hi>Potestant Religion</hi>; which is more than <hi>I. S.</hi> hath given to those of his own <hi>Church</hi> of his <hi>Demonstrations.</hi>

                  <hi>But since Dr.</hi> St. <hi>grants the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to hold all the essential points of Faith, how can he charge her with Idolatry, since Idolatry is an Errour against the most Fundamental point of Faith?</hi> I pray answer to this, for this comes home to the business.</p>

               <p>I am glad to see you but coming that way. To this Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath already given a full and clear answer, in his late <hi>Defence.</hi>

               <p n="1">(1.) He saith, by the <hi>Church of</hi> Romes <hi>holding all essential points of Faith</hi> no more is meant than that she owns and receives all the <hi>Ancient Creeds.</hi>

                  <hi>T. G.</hi> was aware of this Answer, and thus he takes it off. <hi>To err,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 92.</note> 
                  <hi>strictly speaking, is to teach that which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to Truth; but if the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>teaches that the Worship she gives to Saints and Images is not a part of the Honour due to God, and yet it is; then she errs against the second Commandment, though she judges she doth not.</hi>

               <p>What is this to the purpose? the question is not whether <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth not imply a <hi>practical errour</hi> against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

Commandment; but whether it be consistent with the <hi>doctrinal points of Faith,</hi> such as are <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Church?</hi> For of this sort of <hi>Errours,</hi> all the dispute was, as is plain from Dr <hi>St.</hi>'s words, which gave occasion to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But is it not a Fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to destroy the doctrine of the second Commandment?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>If it be, The more care had they need to have who put it out of their <hi>Books,</hi> that it may not fly in their Faces. But who ever reckoned the <hi>Commandments</hi> among the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith?</hi> I do not deny it to be a very dangerous <hi>practical Errour</hi> to destroy the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi>; or rather to take away the whole <hi>force</hi> of the <hi>precept</hi>; but I say, this is none of those <hi>essential points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> spake of, and therefore this is no answer to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore <hi>T. G.</hi> adds, <hi>that this doth not proceed upon a general Thesis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 94.</note> 
                  <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some Idolatrous practice may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with owning the general principles of Faith; but upon a particular Hypothesis, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Worship of God by an Image, be not an errour against the doctrine of the second Commandment, if that be to forbid men
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50112:104"/>
to worship him by an Image? And therefore if it be a Fundamental point to believe that to be Idolatry which God hath expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Law under the notion of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and that be the worshipping of him by an Image, as Dr.</hi> St. <hi>asserts; 'tis clear that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in telling men it is not Idolatry, errs against a Fundamental point, and he cannot according to his principles maintain his charge of Idolatry without a contradiction.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This is then the thing to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore we must judge of it by what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> said, to which this is supposed to be a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> Did he ever say that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did not erre against the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</hi> Nay, he hath invincibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it hath. I say <hi>invincibly,</hi> since <hi>T. G.</hi> gives it up in these <hi>Dialogues</hi>; spending so many pages upon the repetition of his old arguments, and passing over all that elaborate discourse of Dr. <hi>St. about the sense of the second Commandment,</hi> on which the hinge of the <hi>Controversie</hi> depends. If then Dr. <hi>St.</hi> doth charge them with a very dangerous and pernicious errour in respect of this <hi>Commandment,</hi> that could not be the <hi>Fundamental errour</hi> he cleared the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> from, when
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50112:105"/>
he said, <hi>she held all essential points of Faith,</hi> (mark that) and he explained himself purposely to prevent such a mistake, to mean such <hi>doctrinal points of Faith</hi> as are <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>constitution</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>true Form</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi>; now the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether it be a contradiction for a man to say, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth hold all these <hi>essential points of faith,</hi> and yet is guilty of <hi>Idolatry?</hi> And how after all, hath <hi>T. G.</hi> proved it? <hi>It is a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point,</hi> saith he, <hi>to believe that to be Idolatry which God hath forbidden as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>; and so it is to believe that to be Perjury, and Theft and Adultery, which <hi>God</hi> hath forbidden under their notion. But will any man say the true notion of <hi>Adultery</hi> is a <hi>doctrinal point of Faith?</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore it be granted that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> do err <hi>fundamentally</hi> against the <hi>second Commandment;</hi> yet that doth not prove Dr. <hi>St.</hi> guilty of a <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> because he spake not of <hi>practical errours,</hi> but of the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>essential points of Faith.</hi> And now I hope we have done with all these <hi>preliminaries,</hi> and may come to the point of <hi>Idolatry</hi> it self.</p>

Rome <hi>is to be charged with Idolatry, then they are Articles of Faith:</hi> so that, as <hi>T.

For any doctrine plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in <hi>Scripture</hi> which is our <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> And did Dr. <hi>St.</hi> ever deny that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> opposed some things clearly revealed in <hi>Scripture?</hi> nay, it is the design of his <hi>Books</hi> to prove it doth. And if every doctrine which can be deduced from a plain command of <hi>Scripture,</hi> is to be looked on as an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:50112:108"/>
of <hi>Faith,</hi> then <hi>that the Cup is to be given to those who partake of the Bread,</hi> that <hi>Prayers are to be in a known Tongue,</hi> will become <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and do you think Dr. <hi>St.</hi> either <hi>Irenically</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemically,</hi> did ever yield that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did not oppose these? If T. G. lays so much weight on such slight things as these, I must tell you he is not the man I took him for: and I believe it was only civility in Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to pass such things by.</p>

               <p>But <hi>T.G.</hi> would know, <hi>what he means by expresly forbidden,</hi>

                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 121.</note> 
                  <hi>only that it is clear to himself, expecting that others should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his saying it, as the travellers did to</hi> Polus <hi>in</hi> Erasmus; <hi>or that it is clear or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest of it self? and that it is not so,</hi> he saith, <hi>appears by the pains and wayes he takes to find it out.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This is yet a degree lower. By <hi>clearly and expresly,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> means that which is so to <hi>an unprejudiced mind.</hi> For there is nothing so plain, but men may cavil at it. Not the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; not the <hi>certainty</hi> of our <hi>senses;</hi> not the <hi>differences</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> not the coming of the <hi>Messias</hi>; not the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> But will <hi>T. G.</hi> say, that none of these are <hi>clear,</hi> because men are
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50112:108"/>
put to pains and several wayes to prove them? If therefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath shewed that all the evasions of the force of the <hi>second Commandment</hi> are meer cavils, and would take off as well the force of any other Commandment, if men thought themselves as much concerned to do it; I think he hath proved the <hi>sense</hi> of the Commandment to be clear and express against the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by an <hi>Image.</hi> And for his <hi>Friend Polus,</hi> you know it doth not look well in conversation for a man to repeat his own Jests. But you named a third passage <hi>T. G.</hi> repeats out of his former Book. What is that, I pray?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>That concerns Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s <hi>first way of finding out the sense of the Law; For,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 125.</note> 
                  <hi>the Law doth only expresly forbid bowing down to the Images themselves, as the Heathens did, but speaks not one word of the lawfulness, or unlawfulness of worshipping God himself by them;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he upbraids Dr. <hi>St.</hi> that spending above a hundred pages about the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>second Commandment, he neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to remove the contradictions, nor to answer the arguments of</hi> T.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then truly he deserved pity, and to have his Friends come in to help
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50112:109"/>
him, they are such <hi>wonderful contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>mighty arguments.</hi> But Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath at large proved, (1.) That the <hi>Heathens</hi> did not take the <hi>Images</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for <hi>Gods</hi>;<note place="margin">Defence <hi>p.</hi> 465, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> in a large discourse to that purpose, and consequently this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was not express against the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatry</hi> in <hi>T. G.</hi>'s sense of it. (2.) That the <hi>Fathers</hi> did understand this Commandment to be <hi>expresly</hi> against the <hi>Worship of God by an Image</hi>;<note place="margin">From <hi>p.</hi> 419. to <hi>p.</hi> 431.</note> in another large discourse: which he concludes with those words of S. <hi>Ambrose, Non vult se De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in lapidibus coli, God will not be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Stones.</hi> And is this nothing to the answering <hi>T. G.</hi>'s arguments? (3.) That the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God before the Ark and the Cherubims</hi> (the only argument of <hi>T.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50112:109"/>
Arguments of</hi> T. G.? I never yet saw plainer evidence of a forlorn Cause, than these things give. By this taste, I begin to fear, when we come to the charge of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> we shall find very little new, or material.

            <head>THE Third Conference, About the Nature of Idolatry.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>WE are now entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a weighty business, and therefore without any preface to it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in his late <hi>Defence</hi> hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to clear the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by considering two things. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were consistent with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of one <hi>supreme God?</hi> 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Divine Worship</hi> lyes, which being given to a <hi>Creature</hi> makes it <hi>Idolatry?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To clear the former, he considered, who those are, which by common consent
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50112:111"/>
are charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and from thence he supposed the best resolution of the question might be gathered; and those were, (1.) the <hi>Ancient Heathens,</hi> (2.) <hi>Modern Heathens,</hi> (3.) the <hi>Arrians.</hi> And concerning these he proved, that they did all acknowledge one <hi>supreme God,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> could not consist in the Worship of many independent <hi>Deities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As to the <hi>Ancient Heathens.</hi> (1.) From the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> (2.) From their own <hi>Writers</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> of whom he names twelve considerable ones. (3.) From the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> and there he shews from a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of plain Testimonies, that the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi> about <hi>Idolatry</hi> between the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> was not about a <hi>supreme God</hi> which was acknowledged on both sides, but whether Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship were to be given to any Creatures on the account of any supposed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in themselves, or relation to God? And so he draws the History of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie through the several Ages of <hi>Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Origen, Cyril,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> &amp;c. In short, through all those who did with greatest reputation to <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:50112:111"/>
manage this Cause against the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolaters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As to <hi>modern Heathens</hi>; two wayes. (1.) From the <hi>Testimony</hi> of your own <hi>Writers</hi> concerning the <hi>Brachmans, Chineses, Tartars, Americans, Africans, Goths</hi> and <hi>Laplanders.</hi> (2.) From the Testimony of the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> in a remarkable case about <hi>Idolatry</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> wherein their resolution was desired.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) As to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> he proves from <hi>Athanasius, Gr. Nazianzen, Nyssen, Basil, Epiphanius, Cyril, Theodoret,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin</hi>; that the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were unanimously charged with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>; although they did acknowledge but one God, and supposed the greatest created excellencies to be in Christ, and believed the Worship of Christ tended to the honour of the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> He proceeds in this method.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To shew what <hi>Worship</hi> is; which he distinguishes from <hi>honour,</hi> the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to bare <hi>excellency,</hi> the other to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> which distinction he proves from the most eminent <hi>School Divines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:50112:112"/>2. What <hi>Divine Worship</hi> is; <hi>viz.</hi> such a subjection of our selves to God as shews his peculiar <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over us: from whence he proceeds to manifest, That there are some <hi>peculiar external Acts of Divine Worship,</hi> which he proves, (1.) From the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship;</hi> and here he enquires into the distinction of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Worship;</hi> which, he saith, as other moral actions, is to be taken from the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of them: and from hence came the institution of solemn rites for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship. And the best <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> do allow, that there ought to be some peculiar external Acts of Divine Worship; which he likewise proves from the infinite distance between God and his Creatures; and from the remarkable Testimonies of the <hi>Heathens</hi> to that purpose.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) From <hi>Gods appropriating some external Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> to himself; wherein he speaks to two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. What those <hi>Acts</hi> are which God hath appropriated to himself; of which he reckons up six.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sacrifice. 2. Religious adoration. 3. Erection of Temples and Altars.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50112:112"/>
4. Burning of Incense. 5. Solemn Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 6. Vows.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How far <hi>Gods</hi> appropriating these <hi>Acts</hi> doth concern us? Which he thus resolves. 1. It is granted there must be some peculiar Acts. 2. God is the best Judge of them. 3. What he hath once appropriated cannot be made common till his Will be declared. 4. <hi>Christ</hi> hath made no alteration herein by his Law. 5. The Apostles suppose the same <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to continue still. 6. The <hi>Jews</hi> did esteem it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to use those <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> towards any <hi>Creature.</hi> Where he shews that <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be committed as many wayes as Worship may become due to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) From the sense of the <hi>Christian Church</hi>; which hath condemned those for <hi>Idolatry</hi> who have applyed these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> to any thing besides God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How the applying the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship</hi> to a Creature makes that Worship <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Where he explains,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What real <hi>honour</hi> we do allow to the <hi>Saints</hi> on the account of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Worship we deny to them. (1.) <hi>Inward submission</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50112:113"/>
                  <hi>prayer, dependence,</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving.</hi> (2.) <hi>External</hi> and <hi>solemn Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> which are given to <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> and he proves from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that the <hi>Fathers</hi> did deny to be given to them. And so he concludes that <hi>Discourse</hi> with a full and clear explication of a <hi>Testimony</hi> of S. <hi>Augustin</hi> against <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a brief <hi>Abstract</hi> of the <hi>design</hi> of Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s discourse concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> whose parts are too well considered and put together to be blown down with a puff or two of Wit. Let me now hear how <hi>T. G.</hi> hath acquitted himself in this matter, which we shall the better judge of, by having this <hi>Scheme</hi> before us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive you expect <hi>T. G.</hi> should have followed Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s method, and have answered him part by part; but he was wiser than so; for he charges him with three things. (1.) <hi>That he makes vain, and endless, and unnecessary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</hi> (2.) <hi>That he ought to have laid down the true notion of Idolatry from the nature of the thing, which he hath not done.</hi> (3.) <hi>That he hath unfaithfully reported the words and sense of Authors.</hi> After which,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50112:113"/>
he disproves <hi>the parallel between the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Romish Idolatry.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This last, if you please, we will reserve to another Conference; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the other three, will hold us long enough. I pray begin where <hi>T. G.</hi> doth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>First, <hi>He complains much of the Bulk of the Book;</hi> and brings in a kind of a <hi>Taylors bill</hi> of the number of pages:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 167, 171, 172.</note> Imp. of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry, p.</hi> 183. It. <hi>Of the Nature of Divine Worship, p.</hi> 164. It. <hi>Of the Controversie about Images between Christians and Heathens, p.</hi> 140. It. <hi>Of Images in the Christian Church, p.</hi> 180. odd. It. <hi>Of the sense of the second Commandment, p.</hi> 113. It. <hi>Of Instances,</hi> and facings and linings, p. 96. <hi>Sum. tot. p.</hi> 877. Was not this enough to put any man out of humour?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt; when he considered he was to pay it all. And I do believe what he saith, <hi>that he was very uneasie when he read it;</hi> and like the <hi>Laconian</hi> in <hi>Boccalini, who was condemned to read over</hi> Guicciardines <hi>War of</hi> Pisa: <hi>and desired rather to be condemned to the Gallies.</hi> For there is nothing more troublesome to a man than to see that he owes more than he is ever able to pay.</p>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>T. G.</hi> shews how much of the <hi>Bill</hi> might have been cut off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>The shortest way had been to have thrown all into the Fire, as no doubt he would have done, if it had been in his Power, and that had been the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual <hi>Discharge to Dr.</hi> St.<hi>'s charge of Idolatry.</hi> But do you think, it is a good answer to an Indictment, to say it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of too many lines?</p>
            </sp>

                  <hi>By laying down only these four</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulata.<note place="margin">

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Are you sure of that? If these things be fairly granted, they will go a great way toward the resolution of the present Question. But I pray let me

                  <hi>at least as Idolatry is taken by Dr.</hi> St. <hi>for the giving external Acts of Worship, due only to God, to a Creature.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Let us then lay up this at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that <hi>real Idolatrous Worship</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the acknowledgement of one <hi>supreme God</hi>; which may be of use to us in this debate.</p>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>For the second, <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>that it is no where denyed, but is supposed by him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 175.</note> 
                  <hi>when he saith, that if God have forbidden himself to be worshipped after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the giving him such worship will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring of him, though the Giver intend it never so much for his honour, much more then, the giving acts of worship appropriated to him to another.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This is very kind. For then if it appear, that <hi>God</hi> hath forbidden the Worship of himself by an <hi>Image,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that no <hi>intention</hi> of the person can excuse such worship from <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>For the third, <hi>concerning the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the wiser Heathens,</hi> T. G. allows <hi>the Dr. to make his best of it.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then there may be <hi>Idolatrous worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> where the <hi>Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> are not made the <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> and consequently if such worship be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the second Commandment, that cannot be understood only of <hi>bowing down to the Images themselves.</hi>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>For the fourth, he saith, <hi>since the Church hath a power in decreeing Rites and Ceremonies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>it had been no prejudice to his Cause, if it had been longer, before the Use of Images was brought into Churches.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>If the Church had looked on the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> as an indifferent Rite, there had been some reason for what <hi>T. G.</hi> saith; But the force of what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> said, lay not meerly in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>no Images</hi> in <hi>Churches in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times</hi>; but in the <hi>Reasons</hi> given by the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> against the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of them. From whence he hath at large proved that the <hi>Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did look on the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> as utterly unlawful by the Law of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Object represented did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Worship. And this I take to be one of the most material <hi>Discourses</hi> in Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Book, to the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, and which he lays the greatest weight upon.

                  </note> That <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> first brought in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Images,</hi> which was still condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the best <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church. (7.) <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>For the fifth Chapter, <hi>Of the sense of the second Commandment,</hi> T. G. saith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>if God hath there expresly prohibited the giving any Worship to himself by an Image, as Dr.</hi> St. <hi>affirms, there needed no more than to expose the Law as in a Table

it must now be quite abandoned, and no kind of <hi>Discharge</hi> be so much as offered to be made for it?

reckoned for before; and how very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny material things are never entred, which he was accountable for; and how much he hath borrowed upon the <hi>Bona Fides</hi> of the Fanatick Historian, all the rest will amount to a very pitiful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.

From the <hi>Introduction.</hi> For can any words be more express than those, in the <hi>Introduction? For as much as the Church is the House of God, dedicated to his holy Worship</hi> (not to that of the Altar) <hi>and therefore ought to mind us both of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Goodness of his Divine Majesty</hi> (not of the sacredness of the Altar) <hi>certain it is that the acknowledgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not only inwardly in our hearts, but also outwardly with our Bodies, must needs be pious in it self, profitable unto us and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto others.</hi> If the intention of the <hi>Canon</hi> had been to have given any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Introduction</hi> must have related to that, and not to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty.</p>

                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:50112:119"/>(2.) From the <hi>Recommendation; we therefore think it meet and behooveful, and heartily commend it to all good and well-affected People, members of this Church, that they be ready to tender unto the Lord,</hi> (not to the Altar) <hi>the said due acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement by doing Reverence and Obeysance both at their coming in and going out of the said Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>according to the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Custom of the Primitive Church in Purest times, and of this Church also for many years of the Reign of Queen</hi> Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</p>

                  <hi>that we should worship any thing but God himself:</hi> and he adds, <hi>if there were no Table standing, he would worship God when he came into his House.</hi> And he calls it still, <hi>Doing Reverence to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,</hi> but only <hi>towards his Altar:</hi> and he saith, <hi>the People did understand this fully, and apply the worship to God, and to none but God.</hi>

               <p>You may say so, and you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do, to deceive ignorant people; but you cannot say it truly. For (1.)

               <p>What?

That the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as united with the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> is a <hi>proper object</hi> of <hi>Divine Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> i. e. that these two do make up one <hi>entire object</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship</hi>; and then it follows that the sacramental species are a partial object of Divine Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for whatever goes to make up an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject entire must have share with it; which is quite another thing from an
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50112:127"/>
                  <hi>accidental connexion,</hi> as of a Princes Robes together with his Person; for no man ever said the Princes Garments made up with his Person an <hi>Object</hi> fit to be kneeled to in token of <hi>Subjection.</hi> But here is an union supposed between <hi>Christs Body</hi> and the <hi>Accidents,</hi> and such an <hi>union</hi> by vertue whereof <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> is directed to the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> and consequentially to the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>united</hi> thereto. 2. It supposeth, that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> being thus united with the <hi>species</hi> of bread may receive all that <hi>worship</hi> which is due to <hi>God</hi> alone. Which is not very easie to prove. Because it doth not follow, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a <hi>Body</hi> is, there those things must be which do not result by necessary concomitancy from the being of a <hi>Body.</hi> For since it doth not follow by vertue of the <hi>Hypostatical</hi> union that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Divinity</hi> is, the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Christ must be there also; how doth it necessarily follow, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is, the <hi>Divinity</hi> is so present as to make that <hi>Body</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Divine Adoration?</hi> We say the <hi>Foot</hi> is united to the <hi>Soul</hi> as well as the <hi>Head,</hi> but do we therefore say that whatever is in the <hi>Soul</hi> is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>That I know very well is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly said by you; but I pray consider these two things. (1.) If the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> may be present by <hi>reproduction</hi> of the same <hi>Body</hi>; as some of your greatest and latest Divines have asserted; then there is no such necessity of <hi>concomitancy</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; because they say, <hi>God may reproduce the same body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50112:128"/>
all the accidents of it,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion.</hi> (2.) By the same way of <hi>Concomitancy</hi> they may hold the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be under the <hi>species,</hi> and to be there worshipped. For where the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is, there the <hi>soul</hi> is; where <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> is, there the <hi>Divinity</hi> is; where the <hi>Divinity</hi> is, there the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> is; and where the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> is, there the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are too.</p>

               <p>You may account this an absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, but we account it none at all: yea some of our <hi>Divines</hi> have said, <hi>If the Holy Trinity were not every where, yet it would be in the Eucharist, by vertue of this Concomitancy.</hi>

                  <hi>but like a Preacher that hath patched up a Sermon out of his note-book, he names his Text, and then takes his leave of it. For, what he was to speak to, was Idolatry in the nature of the thing, independently of any positive Law, whereas he speaks only of an Idolatry forbidden by a positive Law; but if there be no Idolatry antecedent to a positive prohibition, the Heathens could not be justly charged with Idolatry.</hi>

               <p>In my mind, he did not recede from his <hi>Text</hi> at all, but pursued it close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but you are uneasie at his <hi>Application,</hi> and therefore find fault with his <hi>handling</hi> his <hi>Text.</hi> What could a man speak to more pertinently as to <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> than to consider, what that is, which is acknowledged to be <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> both in the <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi>; What that was which the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> accounted <hi>Idolatry</hi> in them; What opinons those have of <hi>God,</hi> whom the <hi>Roman Church</hi> do charge with <hi>Idolatry</hi>; Wherein the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> consists, not only with respect to positive commands, but the general consent of mankind; Did <note n="*" place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 191. <hi>p.</hi> 210.</note> he not expresly argue from the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of <hi>solemn Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship</hi> abstractly from positive

Are we unconcerned in the Laws <hi>God</hi> made for his <hi>worship?</hi> In my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, this was the great thing <hi>T.

                  <hi>the Heathens could not understand the nature and sinfulness of Idolatry if not from some Law of God; which is in effect to clear the Heathens from Idolatry, till that Law was delivered to them; whereas S.</hi> Paul <hi>saith, they had a Law written in their hearts, whereby they might understand it; and Dr.</hi> St. <hi>ought to have shewn wherein the deordination and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Idolatry did consist antecedently to any positive prohibition; and till this be done, he can make no parallel between the Heathen Idolatry and that of the Roman Church.</hi>

               <p>I am glad to find any thing that looks like a difficulty, which may give an occasion of farther thoughts about this weighty matter, and of clearing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors mind concerning it. Herein I shall endeavour to explain these two things. 1. How far Dr. <hi>St.</hi> doth make the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>sinfulness</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to depend on the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> 2. Wherein the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth consist abstractly from a positive Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How far he makes the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of it to depend on a <hi>positive Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He supposes <hi>Natural Religion</hi> to dictate these things.<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 194, 195, 196, 197.</note> 1. That <hi>God</hi> ought to be solemnly worshipped. 2. That
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50112:131"/>
this <hi>worship</hi> ought to be <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in regard of his <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> over us, and the infinite distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his <hi>Creatures.</hi> 3. That the giving this solemn worship which is due to <hi>God</hi> to any <hi>Creature,</hi> is the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Rights</hi> of his <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> Thence he shews from <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is not given to God because he needs it, but that the belief of one God may hereby be confirmed in us by external and sensible Acts, which cannot be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there be some peculiar Acts of his Worship. And external worship is a profession of internal; acts being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive of our minds as well as words. Thence he determines, that <hi>Idolatry</hi> is a sin of the highest nature, because it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades <hi>Gods peculiar Rights;</hi> and implyes blasphemy in it, because it takes away from God the peculiarity of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Are not these arguments drawn from the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>the thing,</hi> and not meerly from a <hi>positive</hi> Law?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Notwithstanding these dictates of <hi>natural Reason</hi> concerning the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yet he supposes mankind to have been so corrupted as to have lost the sense of the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of giving <hi>divine worship</hi> to <hi>creatures.</hi> Which, he saith, they did
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50112:131"/>
chiefly on a threefold supposition. (1.) That <hi>God</hi> committed the <hi>Government</hi> of the world under him to some <hi>inferiour Deities.</hi> Or,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 113.</note> (2.) That <hi>God</hi> was the <hi>soul of the world,</hi> and therefore the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> given to the parts of it did redound to him. Or (3.) That <hi>external adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was below him, and that the service due to <hi>God</hi> was that of our minds, and the other might be given to Creatures.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>God</hi> saw it necessary to revive the <hi>peculiarity</hi> of his <hi>worship</hi> by his <hi>Law</hi> given in the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> which although given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> was of <hi>an eternal</hi> and <hi>immutable nature,</hi> being not built on any reason peculiar to them, but common to all mankind; and on this account the <hi>Christian Church</hi> did look on the same <hi>Law</hi> as obliging all Christians; as the Doctour hath proved in several places before cited.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That when the <hi>Apostles</hi> went abroad to reclaim the world from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> they made use of no other <hi>notion</hi> of it, than what was received among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and by the <hi>Reasons</hi> on which the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was founded, they convinced the world of that sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which by the corruption of mankind, and the custom of the world they had lost the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50112:132"/>
                  <hi>sense</hi> of. And this was plainly the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s words to any unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced mind, as appears by laying these things together; which are all contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the same discourse. If we say the Gentiles had lost the sense of other sins, as it is evident they had, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles made use of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them; doth it hence follow that the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of those things did barely depend upon a positive Law? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> may be said to be <hi>new,</hi> not as though it were not against the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> but because they had lost the <hi>sense</hi> of them: so the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> was a <hi>new Law</hi> though it revived the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in its moral precepts; the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Christ was a <hi>new doctrine</hi> to the world although most agreeable to the principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>sinfulness</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>natural Religion</hi> consists in these things. (1.) In taking away the due sense of the <hi>Distance</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and his Creatures: which is a violation of the <hi>Rights</hi> of his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is <hi>crimen laesae Majestatis Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> or <hi>Treason</hi> against the <hi>Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</hi> (2.) In neglecting to give <hi>God</hi> the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50112:132"/>
worship which was proper to him. And this was the consequent of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and not as though the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> did lye barely <hi>in not giving to God the worship due to him,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> seems to suggest:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 205.</note> but when men did accustome themselves to the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Idols,</hi> they grew so fond of their own inventions, that they had five <hi>Ave Maries</hi> for one <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> and so the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> came to be almost lost in the croud of <hi>Deities</hi> which they joyned with him. (3.) In worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>bad Spirits,</hi> instead of good ones; which craftily insinuated themselves among the <hi>Idolaters</hi> under the pretence of <hi>Inferiour Deities.</hi> For so the people still believed them to be <hi>good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and their learned men defied all those who said they worshipped any other, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath shewed;<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 518.</note> yet the <hi>Christians</hi> proved they were evil, because they received that <hi>worship</hi> from them, which the good ones would not do. (4.) In disparaging the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> by making <hi>Images</hi> to represent him, (which suggested mean thoughts of God to their minds, lessening the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the <hi>Greatness</hi> of his <hi>Majesty</hi>) and hoping to please <hi>God</hi> by worshipping such representations of him. Which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50112:133"/>
he thought so dishonourable to himself, that he forbids it by a severe Law, and punished the transgressours of it; and from hence the Christian Church hath accounted the same thing <hi>unlawful</hi> to them, because so <hi>dishonourable</hi> to God. (5.) In taking away that <hi>dependence</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> which he expects from his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> For when they suppose that <hi>God</hi> hath committed the <hi>care</hi> of these things to any inferiour beings, they are apt to make their addresses to them more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently because of a <hi>vicinity</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> to them; and to depend upon them for <hi>help</hi> in time of need; which takes off that entire trust in <hi>God</hi> which is most agreeable to his <hi>Wisdom, Goodness</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi> (6.) In giving <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>wicked men</hi> instead of <hi>God.</hi> This was an <hi>aggravation</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and increased the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of it; although the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth not lye in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>divine worship</hi> to <hi>bad men,</hi> but to <hi>any Creatures.</hi> And in this particular lay the abominable sinfulness of the <hi>Poetical Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which was in this respect worse than of the most barbarous Nations we ever read of. (7.) The more vile the practices, the more mean the submissions, the more
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50112:133"/>
gross the errours of <hi>Idolaters</hi> were, the greater was the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Hence the <hi>filthy and obscene Actions</hi> of the <hi>Eastern, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Idolatries</hi>; the <hi>mean submissions</hi> and the <hi>gross errours</hi> of the <hi>Egyptian Idolatries</hi> heightned the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of them. These are the main things wherein the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> did consist, abstractly from any <hi>positive Law.</hi> You see how freely I give them to you upon such an invitation, and much good may they do you.

Therefore,</hi> he saith, <hi>those were condemned for hereticks, who gave Divine Worship to the Image of Christ.</hi> If then the people happen to give <hi>Divine Worship</hi> to an <hi>Image,</hi> although they no not believe it to be so, yet this doth not excuse them from <hi>Idolatry; for,</hi> saith he, <hi>although a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in words, the Worship to be Relative, or for the sake of God, or Christ; yet it being divine worship, he doth really do it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and for themselves.</hi> (2.)

                  <hi>and that there was little or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between their worship and that of the Heathens?</hi> in some places cited by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Is it possible for any man that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves what the common people do, to imagine that they place no <hi>Sanctity, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> or <hi>Divinity</hi> in their <hi>Images?</hi> When they walk so many miles barefoot to a certain <hi>Image</hi> of our <hi>Lady</hi>; when they <hi>creep</hi> upon their <hi>bare knees</hi> towards it; when they make <hi>formal supplications</hi> to the <hi>Images,</hi> with as much Ceremony as if the persons they represent were <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>; when they look with so much <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> towards them; when they come with such mighty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of <hi>relief</hi> and <hi>help</hi> from them; when they tell stories of so many <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> which have been wrought by them; nay, when their learned men, who should have <hi>more wit</hi> or honesty, write
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50112:137"/>
                  <hi>Books</hi> on purpose to heighten these <hi>follies</hi> and <hi>madnesses</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> Can you, with any face say, <hi>there is not so much danger in the worship of Images, as in the worship of the Creatures?</hi> I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, after what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had represented in this matter, <hi>T.

For if this were all to keep men from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative worship</hi> of <hi>Creatures,</hi> I dare affirm that most of the <hi>Fathers</hi> arguments against this sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi> were very weak and feeble, and that they did not reach the <hi>Philosophical</hi> and <hi>contemplative</hi> men; but only the <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>stupid vulgar</hi>; that there was nothing of <hi>real Idolatry</hi> in their <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> but only <hi>danger</hi> to the <hi>common people,</hi> and <hi>scandal to the weak.</hi> Name me that <hi>Christian,</hi> who through all the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> ever let fall an expression to this purpose. It was <hi>Idolatry, downright Idolatry</hi> they charged them with in the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and not any meer <hi>scandalous complyance</hi> with the <hi>ignorant vulgar.</hi> If this had been all they meant, for all that I can see the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> had been to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them only of the <hi>True God</hi> whom they were to worship in the Creatures,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50112:137"/>
and if all the People were once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed of this, all the ancient <hi>Rites</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> might have continued.

               <p>Some persons not inferiour to <hi>Vossius</hi> for learning or judgement in these matters, do suppose it to be a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in him to make the <hi>Gentiles</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>inanimate nature for a true God,</hi> which say they, is in plain terms to make them <hi>Atheists:</hi> For then they must own nothing but meer matter in the world.

                  <hi>than in the worship of Images; because the Creatures are not so apparently representative of God, as an Image is of the Person represented by it, which carries the thoughts presently and effectually to him.

               <p>To this Dr. <hi>St.</hi> gave a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,<note place="margin">Defence p. 806.</note> when he said, that in an object of worship, we are not so much to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>quickness</hi> of <hi>representation,</hi> as the <hi>perfections</hi> represented. Although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an <hi>Image</hi> may carry ones mind sooner to the thing represented, than the <hi>Creatures;</hi> yet the one is so infinite a disparagement to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in comparison of the other, that there is far greater danger upon <hi>T. G.</hi>'s prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in one than in the other. I will make this plain to you by this instance. Suppose the Image of a venerable old man
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50112:139"/>
with Pontifical Habits set up to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>God Almighty,</hi> as hath been usual in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and one man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships <hi>God</hi> by this; another he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sun</hi> as a wonderful <hi>Work of God,</hi> and he worships <hi>God</hi> as manifesting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the <hi>Sun</hi>; the Question now is, whether there be more <hi>danger</hi> in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>God</hi> by an <hi>Image,</hi> or by the <hi>Sun? I</hi> say by an <hi>Image.</hi> For (1.) <hi>T. G.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses <hi>that Images are unlawful objects of Worship, which are conceived to be proper likenesses of the Divinity</hi>; now <hi>I</hi> appeal to your self, whether men are not more apt to take the <hi>Image</hi> of a man for a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> than any of <hi>Gods Creatures?</hi> Besides (2.) <hi>Images</hi> do not represent any thing that <hi>deserves</hi> our <hi>worship</hi>; but only lineaments and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, the work of Painters and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; but the <hi>Creatures</hi> represent to our minds infinite power, wisdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which are the greatest <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> For as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath said, the least work of Nature infinitely exceeds the greatest of Art in curiosity,<note place="margin">Defence p. 805.</note> beauty, strength, proportion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every thing that can discover Wisdom and Power. (3.) The <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in an <hi>Image</hi> is only by a <hi>fiction</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:50112:140"/>
a man fancying the true <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to be really present; but in the <hi>Creatures</hi> there is a <hi>real Divine Presence.</hi> And where there is greater reason for worship, there is surely the less danger. (4.) If the greater excellency of the <hi>Creature</hi> make the danger greater, then as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> argued, where there is less <hi>excellency</hi> there is less <hi>danger</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently there must be less danger in <hi>worshipping</hi> the <hi>Inanimate Creatures</hi> than <hi>Animate,</hi> and <hi>Bruits</hi> than <hi>Men,</hi> and mere <hi>Moral</hi> Men than <hi>Saints;</hi> because the <hi>danger</hi> must increase as the <hi>excellency</hi> doth: and consequently the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were more excuseable in their <hi>worship</hi> than you. And by this reason there was less danger in worshipping the <hi>Tail</hi> of the <hi>Asse</hi> our Saviour rode upon, than St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or his pretended <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.</hi> (5.) There is less <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> where the <hi>representation</hi> is more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> than where it is more gross and corporeal; but the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>God</hi> is much more divine and spiritual by his <hi>Creatures</hi> than by <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> And therefore <hi>Cardinal</hi> Lugo <hi>said, if a Wooden Image may be worshipped for the sake of the exemplar, much more such a lively Image of God as man is.</hi> And
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50112:140"/>
thus upon this principle of <hi>Relative Worship</hi> all the several sorts of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which were used among the <hi>Heathens</hi> may be revived, and set up with as fair pretences at least as Image-worship.</p>

               <p>What is this but trifling in weighty matters? I would allow <hi>T. G.</hi> as much scope for his wit, as he would desire; provided it become the gravity of the subject. What is there in these <hi>Meletetiques,</hi> but what is the duty of every good man, <hi>to see God in his works?</hi> which all persons do who are not <hi>Atheists</hi>; And is this a thing to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to scorn and derision?</p>

               <p>Alas for his ignorance! that he cannot distinguish between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>mystical Theology.</hi> I always took the <hi>seeing</hi> the great evidences of <hi>Gods Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to be <hi>Natural Theology:</hi> and is it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50112:141"/>
not possible to discover <hi>God</hi> in his works <hi>without inessencing the Soul with God?</hi> This is too mean and low for <hi>T. G.;</hi> surely you father this upon him. For I can hardly believe this and many other passages you mention, to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him; or else <hi>T.

               <p>You may satisfie your self if you please that I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do not wrong him; for here's the Book; and in the next page he compares Dr. <hi>St. with one who said Christ might be better represented by a Cow than a Crucifix,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 208.</note> 
                  <hi>and another who said he detested the Image of Christ Crucified.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>For what good end was Dr. <hi>St.</hi> joyned with these? (supposing the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries true, which I hardly believe) hath he ever said any such thing? or that tended that way? It is the <hi>worship</hi> he writes against, and not the <hi>bare represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>Christ Crucified. T. G.</hi> was not to seek for Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s mind in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for these are his words. I do not say there is as great incongruity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the humane nature of Christ,<note place="margin">Defence p. 746.</note> as there was in representing the infinite
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50112:141"/>
nature of God, but I say there is as great incongruity still in supposing an Image of whatsoever it be, can be the proper object of Divine Worship. For the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ is only capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving adoration from us, as it is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statically united to the Divine Nature; and if the humane nature of Christ be not, what then is the Image of it? What union is there between the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a Crucifix? All that can be said is, that imagination supplyes the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Christ is supposed to be present by representation. But (1.) this overthrows all measures and bounds of Worship, and makes it lawful to worship any creature with respect to God. (2.) It contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the argument of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for then <hi>God may be worshipped with the work of mens hands.</hi> (3.) 'Tis contrary to the sense and practice of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> which interpreted the second Commandment to hold against all <hi>Images</hi> set up for <hi>wo<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But <hi>T. G.</hi> wonders <hi>Dr.</hi> St. <hi>should discover God so easily in his Creatures, while he saith elsewhere, the Creatures can give no greater than Moral Certainty of the Being of God himself.</hi>

               <p>It was well thought upon, and deserves an answer; because <hi>T. G.</hi> is not the only person who hath cavilled at this. If Dr. <hi>St.</hi> by <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> doth mean only a <hi>bare probability,</hi> there were some colour for the objection, but in the very place to which <hi>T.

                  <note place="margin">Rat. Acc. <hi>p.</hi> 178, 179.</note> and that which he calls <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> he saith is, a firm, rational, and undoubted certainty. Why then may not Dr. <hi>St.</hi> discover <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Creatures,</hi> since he asserts so great an assurance of <hi>Gods</hi> being their <hi>Creatour?</hi>

               <p>It is meer cavilling, when a mans mind is understood, to be quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at his terms; especially if they be such, as others have used before him, and seem most agreeable to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Evidence.</hi> For we may conceive these several sorts of <hi>Certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Principles:</hi> which is that, I suppose, they call <hi>Metaphysical Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:50112:142"/>
For that was the proper Office of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> to establish certain <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles</hi> which might be of <hi>Vse</hi> to all other <hi>Sciences:</hi> such as those, <hi>that both parts of a contradiction cannot be true of the same thing:</hi> and that, <hi>of every thing,</hi>

If you take away equal things from equal, the remainder is equal.</hi> For whatever depends upon Induction, or needs any medium to prove it, more than the bare perception of terms, was never by any Philosopher accounted an <hi>indemonstrable and self-evident principle.</hi> Much less were <hi>Identical propositions</hi> taken for <hi>first principles,</hi> by any man that ever understood what <hi>principles</hi> were; as it were very easie to prove, if there
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50112:143"/>
were occasion for it. I have but two things to add concerning this kind of <hi>Certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Certainty</hi> of our own <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> is equal to this <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> It being a thing of natural and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate evidence. For the very <hi>doubting</hi> as well as <hi>thinking</hi> proves the certainty of the being of that which doubts. And where there is such evident perception as of first principles, and our own beings, the assent is as necessary as for the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to incline where the greatest weight lyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>self-evident principles</hi> have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little influence upon our knowledge of other things; and therefore a late Philosopher observes that even <hi>that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle,</hi>

                  <hi>that it is impossible the same thing should be, and not be at the same time, is of little or no Vse for finding out of Truth.</hi> And supposing the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the certainty of our own Beings to be granted the <hi>Cartesians</hi> (which no man who thinks can deny them) yet I do not see how the truth of other things conveyed by our senses can be drawn from thence; the one being an <hi>absolute certainty,</hi> the other only depending on a supposition which carryes not equal
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50112:143"/>
evidence along with it: which is the next kind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>certainty</hi> by <hi>sense</hi>; or upon suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that we are not so framed as not to be deceived in the most plain and clear perceptions of sense. This is that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they mean by <hi>Physical Certainty.</hi> It implyes no contradiction we should be so deceived, and consequently it is short of the first kind of <hi>Certainty.</hi> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the supposition is so just and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that such a mans understanding may be justly questioned, who questions the plain evidence of sense as to light, and day, and bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all mankind in spight of their most subtle arguments do trust their <hi>senses:</hi> and <hi>Epictetus</hi> well said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arrian. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>that if he and two or three more were servants to a Sceptick, they would make him hang or starve himself if he did not change his opinion.</hi> And <hi>Galen</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of sense needs no demonstration; for all those things which are evident to sense are to be believed for themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Certainty by Reason,</hi> or of dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing something not known from that which is known. Which is so evident in <hi>Mathematical demonstrations</hi> that no man who understands the terms, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the proof can forbear his assent.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50112:144"/>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> did attempt to bring the way of reasoning in other things to <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal certainty</hi>; which was the great design of his <hi>Logick.</hi> To this end he begins with the explication of <hi>simple terms,</hi> and so he proceeds to <hi>propositions,</hi> and then to the joyning of two of these so together that from thence a <hi>third thing</hi> may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by vertue of some <hi>middle term</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they agree. But because the <hi>conclusion</hi> may not necessarily follow, where the manner of reasoning was true, therefore in order to <hi>demonstration,</hi> he supposes <hi>two sorts</hi> of <hi>principles.</hi> 1. <hi>Axioms,</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles</hi> received by all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them. 2. <hi>Positions;</hi> which are twofold: 1. <hi>Suppositions,</hi> or <hi>Postulata.</hi> 2. <hi>Definitions.</hi> But after all, he grants that only such things are capable of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> which have a certain and immutable cause. And he puts a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a <hi>necessary conclusion,</hi> and a <hi>demonstration.</hi> The one depending on the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Syllogism,</hi> the other upon the <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>Cause.</hi> But in <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Syllogisms Aristotle</hi> doth not require some degree of necessity but the highest, when the connexion between the Subject and Predicate is so great, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be defined without the other; so
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50112:144"/>
that <hi>Logical Demonstration</hi> must be of an inseparable property, and by the most immediate and necessary cause. But very few things in the world are capable of such <hi>demonstrations,</hi> by reason of our ignorance of the essential properties and immediate causes of things; and those Instances which are brought either by <hi>Aristotle</hi> or his <hi>Commentators</hi> are about such things where <hi>demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was least needful, and tend very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the improvement of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>Certainty</hi> which supposes some <hi>Moral principles,</hi> and proceeds upon them. Such as these, <hi>That every Intelligent being acts for some end: That it is not the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of mankind to deceive one another: That there are some things fit to be chosen, and others to be avoided: That circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances vary the nature of Actions: That where comparisons are made, the greatest good and the least evil are to be chosen.</hi> Such as these, I call <hi>Moral Principles:</hi> which have <hi>self-evidence</hi> in them to any man that understands the terms. And whatever doth necessarily follow from these principles may be justly called a <hi>Moral Demonstration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:50112:145"/>5. A <hi>Certainty</hi> which supposes an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divine Assistance</hi> to preserve the mind from errour, and this is <hi>Infallible Certainty.</hi> For the mind of man being of it self lyable to mistake in its appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and judgement of things, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can preserve it from a possibility of errour, but immediate assistance from <hi>God,</hi> who cannot be deceived and will not deceive.</p>
               <p>These things being premised, we are now to enquire what kind of <hi>Certainty</hi> that is, which we have concerning the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the principles of <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> You are to consider what kind of Adversary Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had to deal with, <hi>viz.</hi> one who pleaded for an <hi>infallible Certainty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rat. Acc. <hi>p.</hi> 178, 206.</note> as that infallibility doth imply <hi>Divine Assistance,</hi> as necessary in order to an obligation to Assent. Against this Dr. <hi>St.</hi> objects, that the main foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Religion, which are the Being of God and immortality of the soul, were not capable of this kind of Proof. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this very notion of <hi>Infallibility</hi> doth suppose that which he would prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a God who must give this assistance. But at the same time he yields, that we have as great evidence
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50112:145"/>
and certainty, as humane nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, of such a Being as <hi>God</hi> is, from the consideration of his Works: which being neither from Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, nor supernatural infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he called <hi>Moral Certainty.</hi> Which he might do from these grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the force of the Argument from the Creatures depends upon some <hi>Moral Principles. Viz.</hi> From the suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness and fitness of things to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of an Intelligent and Infinite Agent, who might from thence be inferred to be the Maker of them. It being unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that meer matter should ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce things in so much beauty, order and usefulness as we see in every Creature; in an Ant or a Fly as much as in the vast bodies of the Heavens.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because they do suppose some <hi>Moral Dispositions</hi> in the persons who do most readily and firmly assent to these Truths. For although men make use of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est titles for their arguments, and call them <hi>Infallible Proofs, Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,</hi> or what they please; yet we still see men of bad minds will find something to cavil at, whereby to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their assent; which they do not in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50112:146"/>
meer <hi>Metaphysical notions,</hi> or in <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Demonstrations.</hi> But vertuous and unprejudiced minds do more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially judge, and therefore more readily give their assent: having no byas to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them another way. Although therefore the principles be of another nature, and the arguments be drawn from <hi>Idea's,</hi> or <hi>series</hi> of <hi>Causes,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>medium</hi> it be, yet since the perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mens will may hinder the force of the argument, as to themselves, the <hi>Certainty</hi> might be called <hi>Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> So he grants,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are some principles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it which have <hi>Metaphysical Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in them; as, that <hi>Whatever God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals is impossible to be false,</hi> or as it is commonly expressed, though improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is <hi>infallibly True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a <hi>rational Certainty,</hi> that a <hi>Doctrine</hi> confirmed by such Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as were wrought by Christ and his Apostle must come from God: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most certain <hi>Criterion</hi> of Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:50112:146"/>3. That there was a <hi>Physical Certainty</hi> of the truth of <hi>Christs Miracles</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead, in the <hi>Apostles</hi> who were <hi>eye-witnesses</hi> of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there was an <hi>Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> delivering this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the world, and writing it for the benefit of the Church in all Ages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That we have a <hi>moral Certainty</hi> of the <hi>matters of Fact,</hi> which do concern the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Miracles,</hi> and the <hi>Books of Scripture:</hi> which is of the same kind with the certainty those had of Christs Doctrine and Miracles, who lived in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> at that time; which must depend upon the credibility of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> who convey these things, which is a <hi>Moral Consideration,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Certainty</hi> which is taken from it may be properly called <hi>Moral Certainty.</hi> Of which there being many degrees, the highest is here understood, which any matter of fact is capable of.</p>
               <p>And now I pray tell me, what reason hath there been for all this noise about <hi>Moral Certainty?</hi>

               <p>Whatever is true, is impossible to be false; and the same degree of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence any one hath of the truth of a thing, he hath of the impossibility of the falshood of it: therefore he that hath an undoubted certainty of the truth of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> hath the same certainty that it is impossible it should be false.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50112:150"/>
But the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> declares <hi>Religious Worship</hi> is to be given to <hi>Images,</hi> and our Church declares that <hi>none is to be given to the Altar,</hi> and doth not this make an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent difference? If the Countrey fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low standing without the rails fancied the Congies made to himself; what would he have done, if he had stood within an <hi>Image</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> and seen all the Courtship that had been used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her by some of her devoted ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and <hi>slaves</hi>; when he beheld the bare knees bleeding, the tears trickling, the breast knocking, the eyes scarce lifted up to shew the greater reverence and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility towards the Image, what could he have thought, but that he was shut up within the bowels of the <hi>Goddess</hi> they worshipped? Whereas if the Countrey fellow had gone up into the Court, and seen the ancient servants make their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences</hi> after dinner in the <hi>Presence cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> he would soon have been better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; if some of the old Courtiers had told him, it was the ancient <hi>Custome</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> to make their <hi>Reverences</hi> in all <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Presence,</hi> and from thence when they went into his <hi>Majesties Chapel</hi> they used the same custome out of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to <hi>God</hi> Almighty whose <hi>Presence-chamber</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:50112:150"/>
they accounted the <hi>Chapel</hi> to be. What is all this to giving <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to the <hi>Altar?</hi> wherein the force of all <hi>T. G.</hi> saith must lye.</p>

               <p>I utterly deny that. For your <hi>Church</hi> declares <hi>bowing</hi> before <hi>Images</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an intention to <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Images is next to Heresie,</hi> (if we are to take the sense of your Councils from their own words and the explication of Divines;) You explode their Doctrine who say, <hi>that we are only to worship God before them.</hi> And is there no difference between the <hi>Acts</hi> of these two men as to Images themselves? The one declares that he looks on no <hi>Religious worship</hi> as due to an Image, but it serves him only to put him in mind of him who is the proper object of Worship, and he never intends by any <hi>Act</hi> of his to worship the Image it self: another saith, the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>Images to be worshipped,</hi> and for my part I think my self bound to do what the <hi>Church</hi> requires, and therefore it is my intention to give Worship not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the object represented, but to the very <hi>Image</hi> it self, although it be on the account of its representation. And the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50112:151"/>
latter Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath shewed to be the only allowed <hi>sense</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other rejected either as <hi>heretical</hi> or <hi>next to it.</hi> Which <hi>T. G.</hi> never so much as once takes notice of. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this doth not reach our case; for we believe the second Commandment to be still in force, which is express and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive against all <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>bowing down to them,</hi> but that which was lawful among the <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithstanding that precept, <hi>viz.</hi> to Worship <hi>God</hi> towards the <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> is still lawful among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, viz.</hi> to Worship <hi>God</hi> alone, but <hi>towards the Altar.</hi> And thus I hope <hi>T. G.</hi> will at last be brought a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to understand the sense of our Church in this practice, and how far it is from being a parallel with your <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi>

               <p>Let us see, what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> was proving in that place. It was, that by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> as it is explained by the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> true and real Worship is to be given to <hi>Images</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 575.</note> and for this he produces the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Testimonies of <hi>Suarez, Medina, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria, Catharinus, Naclantus, Bellarmine, Soto, Velosillus, Pujol, Tannerus, Ysambertus, Bassaeus, Sylvius, Arriaga,</hi> and at last Card. <hi>Lugo.</hi> If the thing be not proved, which he designed, why is Card. <hi>Lugo</hi> alone produced? If it be proved, why is Card. <hi>Lugo</hi> produced at all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R.P.</speaker>

               <p>But suppose the other be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to express his concurrence with the rest, what unfairness is there in that, to shorten his words when he layes no weight upon the <hi>manner,</hi> but upon the <hi>thing?</hi> Had Dr. <hi>St.</hi> charged <hi>Lugo</hi> with holding greater <hi>submission</hi> than the rest, and then left out the <hi>qualifying expressions,</hi> he had done him injury. But he knew
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50112:152"/>
                  <hi>Lugo</hi> meant no more than the rest, and produced him for no other purpose. If there be but any <hi>inward affection</hi> carried to the Image, which may be called a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of submission to the Image,</hi> it is all one to Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s purpose; which was only to prove, as he saith, in the same page, from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> and the <hi>Judgement</hi> of their learned and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines, <hi>that by the Decree of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Council such true and real Worship is to be given to Images as is terminated upon the Images themselves.</hi> Did these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies prove this, or did they not?

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p n="1">1. He saith, <hi>When we worship an Image, the inward affection is not carried to the Image, after the same manner it is to the Prototype; for we worship the Prototype absolutely,</hi> i. e. <hi>for its own proper excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but the Image only with a relative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> i. e. <hi>for the excellency not of the Image it self, but of the Prototype, which kind of Worship he affirms to be far inferiour to the other, which is absolute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We have not the same inward sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission towards the Image, which we have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Prototype; for we submit our selves to the Prototype, acknowledging it to be more excellent than our selves, and supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to us, which kind of submission we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prudently conceive to belong to an Image;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50112:153"/>
nor indeed any at all, by which we submit our selves to it, preferring it before us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The sole external act of kissing or bowing is not so carryed to the Image but that some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection also goes along with it, which he saith, may be called also some kind of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of submission; by which he means an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of submitting our selves to the Image; for as much as the Act of the Will from which it proceeds is an affection of performing those acts about their Images, which we are wont to exercise towards our Superiours.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Now I hope, we have the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi> true meaning. From whence I desire you to observe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the difference he puts between the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Image</hi> and the <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type</hi> lyes in the <hi>inward estimation</hi> of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the one above the other; which is as much as to say, that he doth really think there is more excellency in <hi>Christ himself</hi> than in a <hi>Crucifix.</hi> Which deserves a special remark; especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by a <hi>Cardinal.</hi> When one might venture to say, that there is scarce an <hi>Idolater</hi> so sottish in the world, but will acknowledge his <hi>Deity</hi> to be much better than the <hi>Image</hi> of him; and that he worships one for his own excellency, and the other only out of respect to him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:50112:153"/>2. He acknowledges, that all those <hi>Acts</hi> whereby we express reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Superiours</hi> may be used towards <hi>Images,</hi> as <hi>bowing, kneeling, prostration, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is <hi>some kind of inward affection</hi> which may be called a <hi>certain kind of affection of submission going along with these external Acts.</hi> And doth not all this amount to <hi>true and real worship?</hi> which was the thing Dr. <hi>St.</hi> designed to prove. For here, without exception, all those <hi>Acts</hi> whereby our <hi>reverence</hi> towards <hi>Superiours</hi> is expressed, may be used to <hi>Images; i. e.</hi> all tokens of <hi>submission</hi> to them, and an <hi>inward affection of some kind,</hi> which may be called <hi>affection of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi> By which we find it yielded to us that all external <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Adoration</hi> may be given to <hi>Images,</hi> provided, that the <hi>inward affection</hi> be carryed after a different <hi>manner</hi> to the <hi>Prototype</hi> and to the <hi>Image;</hi> which no <hi>Idolater</hi> in the world, if <hi>Maimonides</hi> may be believed, would ever deny: if they believed any other <hi>Gods</hi> besides their <hi>Idols,</hi> as he saith, <hi>there were none but did.</hi> So that Card. <hi>Lugo</hi> upon fair ground gives up all <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity</hi> of any <hi>external Acts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship;</hi> and for all that I can see, may
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50112:154"/>
sacrifice to an <hi>Image,</hi> or offer up the Host to it, on the same reasons that they make their <hi>prostrations</hi> before it. And he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the consequence of his own Doctrine so well, that he doth not seem to boggle at it on the account of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as long as <hi>T. G.</hi> yields that Cardinal <hi>Lugo</hi> doth allow all <hi>external Acts</hi> of <hi>submission to Images,</hi> and such an <hi>inward affection</hi> as to make that <hi>submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sincere and real,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath all which his heart could desire from this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Lugo.</hi>

                  <hi>that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>agrees with Cardinal</hi> Lugo <hi>in the thing, although he quarrels with him about the words.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Because he saith from</hi> Aquinas, <hi>that although no irrational or inanimate being be capable of that real excellency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any honour from us for its own sake;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 600, 601.</note>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This is true; but he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately distinguishes from St. <hi>Augustin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>peculiarity</hi> of <hi>use</hi> belonging to the <hi>sacred utensils,</hi> and the <hi>worship</hi> given to <hi>Images.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>That is no matter how he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes, as long as the consequence holds from one to the other. <hi>For if a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous respect be due to sacred places and things on the account of their Relation to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 229, 230, 231.</note> 
                  <hi>and an inward intention of the mind to express it towards them by an outward token of submission, as bowing to the Altar, it comes to the same thing which Cardinal</hi> Lugo <hi>pleads for to an Image, so that if one be Idolatry, the other must be so too.</hi> So that <hi>T. G.</hi> concludes very trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50112:155"/>
                  <hi>that by these edge-tools,</hi> viz. <hi>School-distinctions Dr.</hi> St. <hi>hath cut the throat of his own Cause.</hi> And then he brings in the <hi>Patronus bonae Fidei</hi> again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks another writing of the same worthy Author had been much more proper, called <hi>Jugulum Causae.</hi> But is it possible for <hi>T. G.</hi> not to apprehend the difference of these things? I will once more endeavour to make it plain to you. The <hi>reverence</hi> to <hi>sacred places</hi> and <hi>things</hi> differs from the <hi>relative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> in these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Acts</hi> belonging to them. For this I need only to repeat Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s words.
<q>Is there no difference between a Religious respect (if I may so call it) to sacred places and things,<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 603.</note> and all the most solemn Acts of Adoration which were ever given to Images by the most sottish Idolaters? Such as kneelings before them, prostrations, praying with their eyes fixed upon them, as though they were speaking to them, burning incense and lights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, which are as great testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of worship as ever were used by the greatest and most sottish <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
                  </q> And here Cardinal <hi>Lugo</hi> allows all <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts</hi> of <hi>submission</hi> to <hi>Images</hi>; whereas
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50112:155"/>
in the other case, <hi>discrimination</hi> is all that is contended for, out of <hi>Reverence</hi> to them. As for <hi>bowing towards the Altar,</hi> it hath been so often answered before, that I shall not repeat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Worship.</hi> For if the <hi>Reason</hi> assigned for the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> be <hi>peculiar</hi> to them, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold for all sacred things and places. Now the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> is <hi>representation</hi> of the <hi>Prototype</hi> as <hi>present</hi> to the fancy of him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships; but this cannot hold for the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Vtensils</hi> and <hi>places</hi> which have their <hi>honour</hi> for the sake of the <hi>use</hi> they are dedicated to. Thus if <hi>Images</hi> in <hi>Churches</hi> were appointed only for <hi>use</hi> without any <hi>worship</hi> to be given to them, it would come much nearer to a parallel, than they can do now, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated and set up on purpose for <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> as they are continually in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the <hi>distinction</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> makes between them. For when it most severely prohibits the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> it not only allows but commands the <hi>reverencing Gods Sanctuary</hi>; and the <hi>consecrating Sacred Vessels</hi> for the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> So that where the Law
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50112:156"/>
distinguisheth we have reason to do it too: and so the <hi>Christian Church</hi> did, when it looked on the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> as <hi>unlawful,</hi> yet they did shew <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> to <hi>sacred things</hi> and <hi>places:</hi> and <hi>honour is all they are capable of</hi> as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>but no worship doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them.</hi> So that these <hi>Edge-Tools</hi> do no execution at all but upon <hi>T. G.</hi>'s <hi>Images;</hi> which could never have been framed without them, and yet are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by them.</p>

               <p>I am glad to hear but one of those Testimonies challenged; for if that be given up, there are enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to prove his design: which you mightily mistake, if you think it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>parallel</hi> your worship of <hi>Saints</hi> with the <hi>Arians Idolatry.</hi> For this is never so much as mentioned by Dr. <hi>St.</hi>; but he names several considerable advantages which are gained by it in this subject of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:50112:157"/>1. That there may be <hi>Idolatry</hi> where the true <hi>God</hi> is owned, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, as he was no doubt among the <hi>Arians</hi>; from whence it follows, that the Nature of <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth not consist in giving <hi>Soveraign Worship</hi> to a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> without respect to the <hi>Creator.</hi> Which will be of <hi>use</hi> to us in the debate about the <hi>Pagan Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Relative Latria</hi> being given to a <hi>Creature</hi> is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they looked on Christ as the express <hi>Image of God;</hi> yet because they gave divine worship to him, supposing him to be a <hi>Creature,</hi> they were charged with <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That making <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of those <hi>excellencies</hi> for which any <hi>Creature</hi> is worshipped doth not excuse from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were guilty who supposed all the excellencies of <hi>Christ</hi> to be derived from <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That no distinction of <hi>Doulia</hi> and <hi>Latria</hi> doth excuse from <hi>Idolatry;</hi> For the <hi>Fathers</hi> make the giving <hi>Doulia</hi> to Christ to be <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That the <hi>notion</hi> of an <hi>Idol</hi> is so far from being a <hi>meer imaginary figment</hi> or <hi>Chimera,</hi> that it was attributed by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:50112:157"/>
to the most excellent <hi>Being,</hi> even to <hi>Christ</hi> himself, when <hi>Divine Worship</hi> was given to him as a <hi>Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are matters of great moment, if they hold good; doth he pass all these by, only to fall upon one single Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? If he doth, it is a shrewd sign, though he cried out of <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> yet he was pinched somewhere else. Well; but what is this horrible crime about <hi>Gregory Nyssen?</hi> Hath he brought him under <hi>an Index Expurgatorius?</hi> Hath he falsified his words and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Text? Or hath he wilfully alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his sense and meaning? Hath he done it in all the quotations out of him, or only in one? Whatever it is, let us have it.</p>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>You may jest as you please at this Answer; but the second is a very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid one: for <hi>T. G.</hi> shews <hi>the parallel to be inconsistent, both with the practice of the</hi> Arians, <hi>and Doctrine of the Fathers.</hi>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>You have not patience to hear <hi>T. G.</hi>'s answer out. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He saith, <hi>The Fathers do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a worship due to the Saints,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 248, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and particularly</hi> Gregory Nyssen <hi>in an Oration produced by him: and therefore if they had condemned the</hi> Arians <hi>of Idolatry for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only a like worship to Christ though in a higher degree, they had condemned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the like crime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The</hi> Arians <hi>made no such Apology for themselves, as the Doctor makes for them,</hi> viz. <hi>that they gave Soveraign and absolute worship to God, and only inferiour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative worship to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:50112:159"/>3. <hi>Why might not the generality at least believe Christ to be of a superiour Order, so as to have true Divinity in him, as the Heathens did of their lesser Gods, and that being assumed as a Consort in the Empire, absolute Divine Honour was due to him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They were chargeable with Idolatry, because they did avowedly give those Acts of Worship to Christ believing him to be a Creature, which by the common consent and publick practice of Christians, from whence exteriour signs in the duties of Religion receive their determination, were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be due only to God incarnate.

               <p>I confess <hi>T. G.</hi> now offers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy a serious debate. Which may be reduced to these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What those <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> were, which the <hi>Arians</hi> were charged with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:50112:160"/>
for giving to <hi>Christ</hi> supposing him a <hi>Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How far the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the same charge, for the <hi>worship</hi> she gives to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Images.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> which the <hi>Arians</hi> were charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>Creature.</hi> The strength of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s answer lies in two things.
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>That they were given absolutely to Christ, as a lesser God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>That they were such Acts which by the consent of the Church did signifie proper Divine worship.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us consider whether the <hi>worship</hi> given to Christ could be <hi>absolute</hi> upon their supposition that <hi>Christ</hi> was a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. T. G.</hi> speaks somewhat faintly in this matter, at first saying only, <hi>Why might it not be absolute? at least as to the generality?</hi> But afterwards, he takes heart, and sayes roundly <hi>that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers evermore charge the</hi> Arians <hi>for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving absolute Divine Worship to Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 250.</note> 
                  <hi>although they believed him to be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature from the Supreme God: which he hopes is far enough from the Doctors relative or inferior Worship.</hi> But
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50112:160"/>
I am very far from being satisfied with this Answer. For I pray tell me wherein lies the difference between <hi>Soveraign Worship,</hi> and <hi>Inferiour:</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> or in <hi>External Acts?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Yes surely; for otherwise it can be no <hi>due esteem:</hi> the distance being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite between God and his Creatures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Can a man then have an <hi>equal esteem</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>Creature?</hi> which he acknowledges to be made by him?</p>

               <p>You are not mistaken; for Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had shewed at large, (1.) That external <hi>adoration</hi> was one of those things which the <hi>Fathers</hi> charged the <hi>Arians</hi> with <hi>Idolatry</hi> for giving to <hi>Christ</hi> supposing him to be a <hi>Creature:</hi> from <hi>Peters</hi> forbidding <hi>Cornelius,</hi>

That <hi>invocation</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> of <hi>Intercession,</hi> was condemned as <hi>Idolatry</hi> in <hi>the</hi> Arians. <hi>Athanasius</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses it <hi>inconsistent with Christianity to joyn Christ,</hi>

                  <hi>if he were a creature, in our prayers, together with God.</hi> (3.) That they made no such distinction of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping</hi> and <hi>serving</hi> with <hi>Latria,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> insinuates.

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>T.

               <p>I think you have hit upon <hi>T.G.</hi>'s meaning: and in truth it is the only thing to be said in the case. For if <hi>Idolatry</hi> be a thing in the <hi>Churches Power</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, it is the only way in the world for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to free her self (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that <hi>power</hi> to be lodged in her); but if it should happen that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>consent</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50112:163"/>
the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> have determined <hi>Idolatry</hi> antecedently to the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>present Church:</hi> what a case are you then in? The guilt of <hi>Idolatry</hi> must lie heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon you, and if it be so <hi>great a sin</hi> as your own <hi>Schoolmen</hi> determine, you have a great deal to answer for; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the tricks and evasions of <hi>T. G.</hi> But why doth not <hi>T. G.</hi> make the external <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Theft, Adultery, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> as much under the <hi>Churches power</hi> as those of <hi>Idolatry?</hi> But I forbear now, supposing that we shall meet with this useful notion again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we end this debate.</p>

               <p>You are mistaken, if you think <hi>T.

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Had <hi>T. G.</hi> the confidence to quote St. <hi>Augustin</hi> again for this, when Dr. <hi>St.</hi> purposely answered this very <hi>Testimony</hi> in his Book which <hi>T.

returns nothing, but however he brings the same Testimony again; as whole and as sound, and as much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as ever. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at peradventure, for I remember no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Orat. <hi>de Nat.

St. <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks only of <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing the Sepulchres of the Martyrs:</hi> but all the weight lies upon <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> and what, I pray, saith this single Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the business?</p>

               <speaker>R.P.</speaker>
               <p>More than you will be willing to hear, or able to answer. For in his <hi>Oration</hi> upon St. <hi>Theodore</hi> that <hi>great and holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, (which even</hi> Rivetus <hi>himself that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious Fanatick in Criticism doth not question to be his genuine work) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the peoples devotion to the Martyrs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 238.</note> 
                  <hi>he describes the magnificent structure of the Temple, the pieces of Sculpture in it, and especially the picture of the Martyr; then coming to the Shrine he shews the esteem they had for his Relicks; and if they were admitted to touch his body, they embrace it as if they beheld it yet alive; and weeping over it as if he were whole before them, they solicit his supplication and intercession, beseeching him as a Champion of God, and invocating him as one that could obtain
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50112:164"/>
blessings, when he would, for them. And then he dilates himself upon the Acts of the Martyr and the great benefits they received by him: and at the end of his Oration ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses himself to him in these words, We stand in need of many benefits, do thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede and deprecate with our common King and Lord for thy Country. Do thou as a Souldier fight in our defence. And in case there be need of greater intercession call an Assembly of thy Brother Martyrs; let the prayers of many just persons expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the sins of multitudes of Offenders. Admonish</hi> Peter, <hi>excite</hi> Paul, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>also the beloved Disciple to be solicitors for the Churches they have founded; that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry may not lift up its head, that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies may not overgrow the Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But by the Power of thine and thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows intercession, O admirable man, and eminent among Martyrs, the Christian Church may be a plentiful Field of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If Dr.</hi> St. <hi>had been present at this Oration,</hi> saith <hi>T.

G.</hi> I could produce the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine Rhetoricians</hi> to this purpose. All the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> spake like an <hi>Orator</hi> in these expressions, for which we must
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50112:165"/>
consider the <hi>character</hi> of the <hi>Person,</hi> and the <hi>Occasion</hi> of speaking. As to <hi>Gregory Nyssen, Gregory Nazianzen</hi> severely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes him in a whole <hi>Epistle for affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the Glory of an Orator than of a Christian;</hi>

                     <hi>Greg. Naz. Ep.</hi> 43.</note> and this <hi>after he was a Priest, and devoted to the service of Christ; in so much that many Christians were very much offended at him.</hi> And what wonder is it to find such a person, on such an <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi> as making a <hi>Panegyrical Oration</hi> on a <hi>Martyr,</hi> laying on all his colours, opening his perfuming pots, and using more the <hi>figures</hi> of an <hi>Orator,</hi> than the <hi>exactness</hi> of a <hi>Divine?</hi> Nay, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so general a <hi>Custom</hi> among their <hi>Eloquent</hi> men to exceed in their <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Orations,</hi> that I find <hi>Theodoret</hi> quoted for saying, <hi>No rule of Doctrine is to be taken from them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod.

               <p>Doth <hi>T. G.</hi> call this a second <hi>Reason?</hi> Where lyes the consequence?

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50112:173"/>
making this look like a <hi>Reason.</hi> In the mean time, let the Reader consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether <hi>praying</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by <hi>Greg.

               <p>No doubt <hi>T. G.</hi> brings it for an instance of the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> for it were to no great purpose to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>singular opinion</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> of one man condemned by the rest of the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Greg. Nyssen</hi> goes upon this principle, <hi>To give Divine Worship to a Creature is Idolatry: but the Arians in

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Age, as well as <hi>before, Prayer</hi> was looked on as a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> part of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>To what purpose? since no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy denyes, <hi>that prayer as it is a means to obtain blessings from God as the Author of them is peculiar to God.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This Answer doth not take off the force of the argument. For <hi>prayer</hi> may be considered two wayes. 1. As a <hi>Means</hi> to obtain <hi>blessings.</hi> 2. As a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> Now if they reserved <hi>prayer</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> on the latter account, then it follows, that whatever <hi>Invocation</hi> doth take off from the <hi>peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of this <hi>part</hi> of <hi>external worship,</hi> is against the design of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> So <hi>Origen</hi> argues that <hi>Invocation and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do imply each other.</hi>

that they did not <hi>worship any other but Christ,</hi> the old Latin Translation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, <hi>neque alteri cuiquam precem orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis impendere.</hi> And <hi>Theodoret</hi> makes <hi>praying to Angels,</hi> and the <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>them</hi> the same thing.

               <p>Wherein lyes this <hi>external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?</hi> Is it not that we meet together and joyn in acts of <hi>Devotion</hi> to testifie our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of <hi>Gods Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>dependence</hi> upon him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then whosoever do use the same external <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> to a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> do apply that to a <hi>Creature</hi> which
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50112:175"/>
the <hi>Fathers</hi> did suppose to belong only to <hi>God</hi>; as if men <hi>kneel</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> in the same place, at the same time, with the same Ceremonies of <hi>Devotion</hi> they use to <hi>God</hi> himself, they take off the <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity</hi> of this <hi>worship</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and make it common to his <hi>Creatures.</hi>

               <p>This only reaches to the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts,</hi> but the <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of the <hi>worshippers</hi> with us make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I do not now meddle with your <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>design</hi>; but I am pursuing the force of the argument used by the <hi>Fathers.</hi> To make this yet more plain to you. The <hi>Fathers</hi> use the argument of <hi>external adoration</hi> against the <hi>Arians;</hi> for say they,<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 165.</note> Peter <hi>forbad</hi> Cornelius <hi>to worship him, and the Angel S.</hi> John; from whence they infer that <hi>God only ought to be worshipped,</hi> and therefore <hi>giving exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal adoration to Christ, supposing him to be a Creature, is Idolatry.</hi> Is this argument good, or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Let me consider a little: <hi>It was good then, but it is not now;</hi> for <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>it is in the Churches power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the signification of exteriour signs.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>An admirable answer! which makes the arguments of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50112:176"/>
truth to have no force at all. For the <hi>Arians</hi> might say, the <hi>external acts</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> did not <hi>signifie</hi> the same with them, which they did with <hi>Catholicks,</hi> for they only signified an <hi>inferiour</hi> and <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive worship,</hi> when applyed to the <hi>Son</hi>; and <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>absolute worship,</hi> when given to the <hi>Father.</hi> So that if there be any force in what the <hi>Fathers</hi> did argue against the <hi>Arians,</hi> it will make the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> and <hi>relative worship</hi> of a <hi>Creature</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry</hi>; notwithstanding <hi>Greg.

               <p>It is upon the same head of the <hi>Doctors fidelity in quoting Authors,</hi> and it concerns the passage in <hi>Arnobius,</hi> in which <hi>T. G.</hi> charged him with <hi>cogging in the word Divinity in the singular number instead of adorable Deities in the Plural;</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>He doth it very well; <hi>for he denyes not those words to be there which Dr.</hi> St. <hi>translated,</hi> but he saith, <hi>he ought not to have translated the words of</hi> Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius <hi>to the Heathens, but the words of the Heathens to</hi> Arnobius, <hi>since his design was to prove the Heathens did not worship the Images themselves for Gods.</hi>

               <p>A pitiful shift! <hi>T.

                  <hi>viz.</hi> that though the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Latria</hi> was owned before it by many <hi>Divines</hi> to be given to <hi>Images,</hi> and that were against the decree of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice;</hi> yet the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> allows all external acts of adoration of <hi>Images,</hi> gives no intimation against this kind of Worship; and since it, many of the most eminent <hi>Divines</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified the giving <hi>Latria</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> and that from the words of this Council.</p>

                  <hi>those very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do not mean by Latria proper Divine Worship, which is due to God and terminated upon him; but that the Act being in their opinion one in substance to the Prototype and the Images, it is terminated absolutely upon the Person of Christ for himself, and falls upon the Image after an inferiour manner, as a thing only relating to him, and purely for his sake: for which reason, some call it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Latria; others, secundary; others, improper; others, Analogical; others, per accidens; and the dispute in effect is rather</hi> de modo loquendi, <hi>than of the thing it self.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>To clear this matter, we must consider, (1.) That the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> doth deny <hi>Latria</hi> to be given to an <hi>Image.</hi> (2.) That the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Roman
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50112:178"/>
Church</hi> do say that the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> cannot be defended in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> without giving <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi> to it. (3.) That the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> when just occasion was given, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares nothing against this; for although it referrs to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> yet when it gives the <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> it doth it in such terms, that many of your <hi>Divines</hi> say, must infer the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Latria</hi> to be given to them.</p>

               <p>What if it doth, saith <hi>T. G.</hi> since, <hi>it is only a dispute about words, and all agree that the worship proper to God, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified primarily by the word Latria, is not to be given to Images?</hi>

               <p>Then it was giving <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to an Image of Christ, without respect to Christ;</hi> which is either <hi>non-sense,</hi> or a <hi>contradiction.</hi> Is it possible to give <hi>divine worship</hi> to an <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>person,</hi> without <hi>respect</hi> to the person?

               <p>True; for the <hi>burning Incense before Images</hi> was thought to be <hi>sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> to them, being joyned with <hi>adoration.</hi> And the <hi>Christians</hi> chose rather to dye, than to joyn in that act of worship to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>Emperours:</hi> whence Dr. <hi>St.</hi> observed,<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 323.</note> that <hi>burning</hi> of <hi>Incense</hi> towards <hi>Images</hi> was the same tryal of <hi>Christians,</hi> that eating of Swines flesh was of the Jews.

               <p>I see what you aim at; you would have me condemn the <hi>primitive Christians</hi> or our selves: according to the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> at that time, it was unlawful, but according to the <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> now, it is lawful to do the

               <p>That is, your <hi>Church</hi> is innocent, if your Church may be judge.

               <p>No; for the <hi>Emperours</hi> then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted to be worshipped as <hi>Gods, i. e.</hi> with <hi>divine worship.</hi>

               <p>Was that <hi>Divine Worship su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> or not? <hi>i. e.</hi> did they take the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> for <hi>supreme Deities?</hi>

               <p>Rather, you will not. I ask you, whether there be any such <hi>act</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> so <hi>proper</hi> to God, that you may not in <hi>respect</hi> to God, do that to his

               <p>I not ask what you do; but what upon your <hi>principles</hi> you may do. And suppose a man doth that Act which your <hi>Church</hi> allows not, is he guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>bare disobedience</hi> in doing it to an <hi>Image?</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then there are such external <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> so <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>God</hi> himself, that the doing them to an <hi>Image</hi> for <hi>his sake</hi> is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> As to <hi>sacrifice</hi> to an <hi>Image</hi> for the <hi>sake</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Is it not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Is the <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>relative sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing</hi> to an <hi>Image Idolatry?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>You ask an untoward question. For I see what you drive at.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Answer me directly. Is it, or is it not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I think it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then it follows, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>improper, absolute</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:50112:181"/>
and <hi>relative Latria</hi> signifies nothing. For if the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> are <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> no <hi>relative</hi> or <hi>improper use</hi> of them can excuse from <hi>Idolatry;</hi> if they are not proper, then it is no <hi>Latria.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I must think again of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For as you represent it, this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excuse us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I wonder so many subtle men should ever think it would. But I will not thus give it over. When the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> did forbid <hi>Latria</hi> being given to an Image, did they mean to an <hi>Image,</hi> as a piece of Wood, or Stone; or to an <hi>Image, as an Image?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>As an Image.</hi> For they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid giving <hi>Latria</hi> to that which they <hi>worshipped,</hi> but they <hi>worshipped</hi> it as <hi>an Image,</hi> for the <hi>sake of the Prototype.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Your reason is unanswerable. Therefore I say, they did forbid all <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Latria</hi> of an <hi>Image,</hi> call it by what name soever you please. For the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of an Image <hi>as such</hi> must be <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive worship.</hi> Therefore all those who contend for <hi>relative Latria</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I would fain know of these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whether their <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Latria,</hi> be <hi>Latria</hi> or <hi>Inferiour wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:50112:182"/>
one or other it must be; and it is a contradiction to say <hi>Latria</hi> is <hi>inferiour worship</hi>; for that is to say, It is <hi>Latria,</hi> and it is not. If it be then <hi>true La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> I ask whether the <hi>Image as an Image</hi> be <hi>God</hi> or a <hi>Creature;</hi> if it be a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as no doubt it is, then <hi>true Latria</hi> is given to a <hi>Creature</hi>; which according to <hi>T. G.</hi> must be <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Again; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is the same <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Latria</hi> which is terminated on the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,</hi> and on the <hi>Cross relatively</hi>; or it is a <hi>different Act.</hi> If the <hi>same act;</hi> then there is a double <hi>worship,</hi> and but one <hi>Act</hi>; for there is an <hi>absolute worship</hi> of the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and a <hi>relative wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of the <hi>Image;</hi> and let it be <hi>relative,</hi> or what it will, it is a <hi>real Act</hi> of <hi>worship;</hi> and so there must be two Acts, and yet it is but one Act. For is the <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Cross</hi> worshipped, or not? If it be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, there must be an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>worship terminated</hi> on it; and how can there be an <hi>act</hi> of worship terminated upon it, if the same act passeth from the <hi>Image</hi> to the <hi>Prototype?</hi> These are unintelligible subtleties, and only invented to confound mens understandings, as to the true and distinct <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship;</hi> and to blind their minds in the practice of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:50112:182"/>
Farther, if this be a difference only <hi>de modo loquendi,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, then the very <hi>same act</hi> may be <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, absolute</hi> and <hi>relative, per se</hi> and <hi>per accidens.</hi> For so <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>that it is one Act in substance; but it is absolute as terminated on the person of Christ, relative as on the Cross</hi>; proper in one sense, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper in the other; <hi>per se</hi> in the former sense, <hi>per accidens</hi> in the later. Which <hi>Catharinus</hi> thought to be no less than <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</hi> Lastly, there is nothing in the world, but may be worshipped with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi> by the help of these distinctions. For a <hi>Divine presence</hi> in the <hi>creatures</hi> is really a far better ground of worship, than a bare <hi>fiction</hi> of the mind, that the Image and the thing represented are all one. But of this we have discoursed already.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>To tell you plainly my mind, I never liked this giving <hi>Latria to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> my self; but it being a common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in our <hi>Church,</hi> we ought to say as much for it as we can; but I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an <hi>inferiour worship to be given to them,</hi> and so is <hi>T. G.</hi> if I do not much mistake his meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Let us then consider this <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour worship,</hi> as distinct from <hi>Latria;</hi> and concerning this I shall prove, that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50112:183"/>
it neither answers the <hi>reasons</hi> given by <hi>Councils</hi>; nor the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Not the <hi>reasons</hi> given by the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi> For which I desire but these two <hi>postulata.</hi> 1. That <hi>Images</hi> are to have <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> given to them; which is expressely determined by those <hi>Councils.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Reason</hi> of this <hi>Worship is nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Image, but something repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by it.</hi> Which is affirmed by those <hi>Councils.</hi> From hence I argue thus.</p>
               <p>To worship Christ only before an Image is not to give <hi>proper worship to the Image,</hi> which the <hi>Councils</hi> require to be given. Therefore either the <hi>Image</hi> is to be <hi>worshipped for it self,</hi> which were <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> by your own confession; or Christ is to be worshipped in and by the <hi>Image.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ is to be worshipped in and by the Image.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then you give <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship due to him,</hi> or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>The worship due to him.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But the <hi>Worship due to Christ</hi> is <hi>proper Latria</hi>; therefore you must give <hi>proper Latria to Christ as worshipped in and by the Image.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:50112:183"/>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>True; but we give it to the <hi>Image of Christ</hi> otherwise than to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; for we worship him <hi>absolutely,</hi> and the <hi>Image respectively</hi> and <hi>for his sake.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>That is it which I would have; that there is no <hi>worshipping</hi> an <hi>Image</hi> on the account of <hi>representation,</hi> but you must fall into the doctrine of <hi>relative Latria.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But may not I shew respect to the <hi>Cross</hi> for <hi>Christs sake,</hi> without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same <hi>worship</hi> to the <hi>Cross,</hi> that I do to Christ?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>That is not the question; but whether you may <hi>worship Christ</hi> in and by the <hi>Cross representing</hi> his <hi>Person,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving that <hi>worship</hi> which belongs to the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> For either you worship the <hi>Cross</hi> for <hi>it self,</hi> which you confess to be <hi>Idolatry</hi>; or you <hi>worship Christ as represented by it:</hi> if you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Christ, you must give him the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> which belongs to him, and that can be no other than <hi>Latria.</hi> Which not only appears by the <hi>doctrine</hi> but by the <hi>practice</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Cross.</hi> Which I prove by the second <hi>particular,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Inferiour worship</hi> doth not come
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:50112:184"/>
up to the <hi>practice</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your <hi>Church</hi> in praying to the <hi>Cross</hi> speaks to it, as if it were Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>O Crux ave, spes unica,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Aquinas</hi> observes and many other of your <hi>Divines,</hi> who never own any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopopoeia;</hi> but do say, <hi>that the Cross is truly worshipped with that worship which belongs to the person of Christ, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of representation.</hi> And can you imagine so many of your most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Divines</hi> would have put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to so much difficulty in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Relative Latria,</hi> if they could have defended the <hi>practice</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> without it? But they saw plainly the <hi>Church</hi> did own such a <hi>worship</hi> to the <hi>Cross;</hi> and when occasion was offered, did declare it, as in the place cited out of the <hi>Pontifical</hi> by Dr. <hi>St.,</hi> which it would never have done,<note place="margin">Def. <hi>p.</hi> 640.</note> if it had not been agreeable to its sense.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But this is but <hi>one single passage,</hi> and will you condemn a whole <hi>Church</hi> for that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Not, if the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> were otherwise fully expressed against it; but here we have shewed that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to be very agreeable to the reason of <hi>worship</hi> given by your <hi>Councils;</hi> and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50112:184"/>
to the <hi>solemn practice</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Cross;</hi> and therefore that passage ought to be looked on as a more explicite declaration of the sense of the Church. For, let me ask you, if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had been against <hi>Latria</hi> being given to the <hi>Cross</hi>; whether in a book of such publick and constant <hi>use</hi> as the <hi>Pontifical</hi> is, it should be left stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the <hi>Book-menders</hi> are so busie in your <hi>Church,</hi> that scarce an <hi>Index</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> can escape them; nor such sentences as seem to thwart their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent doctrine. Of which take this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. You remember what stir <hi>T.

No, I assure you, <hi>Deleatur dictio solummodo,</hi> saith he; <hi>satis pro imperio.</hi> Away with this <hi>Only.</hi> Why so? was it not in the Author? No mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that. It is against the <hi>practice</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:50112:185"/>
of the <hi>Church</hi>; out with it. More such instances might be produced: but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your self, whether after such care hath been taken to review the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical</hi> by <hi>Clement</hi> 8. and the publishing of it with so much <hi>Authority,</hi> such a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage would have been suffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, if it had been any wayes repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the sense of the <hi>Church?</hi>

                  <hi>But suppose the King had made an Order, that due honour and respect should be given to the Chair of State, ought not that to be observed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the disputes which might arise about the nature of the Act?</hi>

               <p>To answer this, we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Command</hi> from <hi>God</hi> that we must <hi>worship</hi> an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as we do his <hi>Person;</hi> but here it is just contrary.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:50112:186"/>
must either be <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> which one party saith is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> being the same which is given to <hi>God</hi>; or an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> which the other party saith must be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> being an <hi>expression of our submission to an inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thing.</hi> And <hi>for my life</hi> I cannot see what answer <hi>T.

                  <hi>whereas it appears from the words Dr.</hi> St. <hi>cites out of him, that he charged the Heathens with Idolatry in worshipping their Images for Gods, and the Creatures for Gods; although withal they worshipped evil Spirits,</hi> and <hi>T.

               <p>Is this such a difficulty to be set in the Front? I suppose it is only to try whether I will stumble at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold. If the <hi>Supreme God</hi> whom the Heathens worshipped was an <hi>Arch-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> as <hi>T.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50112:189"/>
                  <hi>Devil;</hi> which must needs follow, if the <hi>Supreme God</hi> among them was no other than an <hi>Arch-Devil;</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> then asserted, and now endeavours more at large to prove.</p>

               <p>Therefore waving this, I come to the main point; <hi>whether the Heathen</hi> Jupiter <hi>were the true God, or an Arch-Devil?</hi>

               <p>You are just like the Author of a late Scurrilous Pamphlet called <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Dr.</hi> St.<hi>'s Supreme God,</hi> &amp;c. who would fain reduce the whole Question of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to this single point, without considering either the occasion of this Question, or the main arguments used by Dr. <hi>St.,</hi> or the very scope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his Discourse: But he is so piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a trifler, that he deserves no notice at all. That we may proceed more clearly in this Debate, we ought first to attend to the principal Question; which was, whether <hi>Idolatry</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the acknowledgement of one Supreme Being? And the reason of this Question was, because those who did plead the most plausibly in excusing your <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> went upon this principle, that supposing men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in their minds the notion of one
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50112:190"/>
Supreme Being, it is impossible they should give to a creature that honour which was due to God alone. To over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this Dr. <hi>St.</hi> undertook to shew, that this principle would equally excuse the Heathen Idolatry, since both the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Heathens did own one <hi>Supreme God.</hi> And if this be granted him, it matters not to the main design of his Discourse whether it were <hi>Jupiter</hi> or not. And it is a wonder to me, since the man in <hi>T. G.</hi>'s <hi>Dialogues</hi> who argues against Dr. <hi>St.</hi> professes himself a <hi>Disciple</hi> of Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> he should never take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this principle, nor once go about to defend it. But since <hi>T. G.</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>that the Heathens had a notion of one Supreme Being ingraffed in their minds by nature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 371.</note> the point then in debate is, on what account they were charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and whether that will not reach to the <hi>practices</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church, i. e.</hi> whether their <hi>Idolatry</hi> lay in <hi>worshipping</hi> the <hi>Creature</hi> and <hi>not the Creator;</hi> or in giving <hi>Divine Worship</hi> though of <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees</hi> to the <hi>Creature</hi> and the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?</hi> And here lies the main strength of this controvesie; and supposing Dr. <hi>St.</hi> were mistaken as to the sense of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> about <hi>Jupiter</hi>; yet if the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50112:190"/>
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> be proved to consist in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same Divine Worship to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Creatures,</hi> his parallel will be sufficient to make good the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet, since <hi>T. G.</hi> seems to lay so much weight upon the <hi>Fathers sense</hi> concerning <hi>Jupiter,</hi> I am content to examine them together with you; but in the first place let us consider, what the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith to this point; for as I remember Dr. <hi>St.</hi> began with that, then he proceeded to your own <hi>Writers,</hi> and at last brought in the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of Fathers, and I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we should go off from this method.</p>

               <p>Since you will have it so, I will begin with the Scripture; and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> pretends to prove <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God</hi> from those words Acts 17. <hi>Whom ye ignorantly worship, him I declare unto you.</hi>

               <p>Consider, I pray, the question between Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and <hi>T. G., viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the <hi>true God,</hi> or an <hi>Arch-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> argues in these words.
<q>Did St. <hi>Paul</hi> mean the <hi>Devil</hi> when he said, <hi>whom you ignorantly worship, him I declare unto you?</hi> Did he in good earnest go abroad to preach the Devil to the world? Yet he preached him

                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 301.</note> he notably proves, <hi>it could not be understood of</hi> Jupiter <hi>who was a known God; and St.</hi> Paul <hi>could not be said to come to preach their</hi> Jupiter <hi>to the</hi> Athenians, <hi>when he expresly tells them, he came to declare to them a God whom they did not know.</hi>

               <p>To this I answer, that the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> had so confounded the notion of the <hi>supreme God,</hi> with that of the <hi>Poetical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and the Peoples fancies were so stained and polluted with those vulgar representations of <hi>Jove</hi> which they learnt from the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters,</hi> that the <hi>Apostle</hi> rather chose to preach the <hi>true God</hi> to them from the inscription to the <hi>unknown God,</hi> than from any Altars that were inscribed <hi>Jovi Opt. Max.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>People</hi> would have imagined, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had made choice of any usual inscription to a <hi>Deity</hi> worshipped in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the rest, that he must in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence allow the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of their <hi>Worship.</hi> For they joyned <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the rest of their <hi>Gods</hi> together, the <hi>Body</hi> of their <hi>Worship</hi> consisting of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of one as <hi>Supreme,</hi> viz. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:50112:191"/>
and of the rest as worshipped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him; and so their worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>complex</hi> thing, it was more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Apostles design, which was to destroy their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> not to make use of that notion of <hi>God</hi> which was corrupted by their <hi>Idolatries,</hi> but to take advantage from the <hi>Inscription</hi> to <hi>the unknown God,</hi> so to declare his <hi>Nature,</hi> as to confute their Idolatrous Worship, as he doth in the following verses. <hi>Jupiter</hi> therefore as he was the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and as he stood in <hi>conjunction</hi> with their other <hi>Deities,</hi> was a <hi>known God</hi> amongst them, and solemnly worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the <hi>Athenians;</hi> but as by <hi>Jove</hi> was understood the <hi>Eternal Mind</hi> as the <hi>only proper object</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> and therefore ought not to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with mens hands, nor to be joyned with his <hi>Creatures,</hi> so he was an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God.</hi> For they had no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a <hi>Supreme God,</hi> than as of one who admitted others into a <hi>participation</hi> of the same <hi>Worship</hi> with himself. And there were these two things which made those <hi>Gentiles</hi> disown the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who agreed with them in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of <hi>one Supreme God</hi> who made the world, (1.) That he would be
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50112:192"/>
worshipped by no <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of himself. (2.) That he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no <hi>inferiour beings</hi> to have any share in <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> but all such were accounted <hi>Idolaters</hi> by the <hi>Jewish Laws,</hi> who according to the Eastern Customs worshipped any other as <hi>Mediators,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Deities.</hi> From hence the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens accounted the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> an <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>unsociable Deity;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no representations made of him; nor any others to be joyned in worship with him: therefore <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> calls him <gap reason="foreign">

from his <hi>perfections</hi> against that way of <hi>Worship</hi> which was in use among them.

God:</hi> so that if S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be credited rather than <hi>T. G.</hi> their <hi>Jupiter</hi> was so far from being the <hi>Arch-devil,</hi> that he was the <hi>true God, blessed for evermore.</hi>

               <p>I suppose he thought none of the rest worth answering: but he finds

great fault with the testimony out of <hi>Aquinas.</hi>

               <p>This is a rare way of answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> produced twelve several Authors of good reputation, <hi>T. G.</hi> takes no notice of eleven of them, and because he makes some cavils at the twelfth, he would have this pass for an answer to them all.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But the Dr. loseth his credit so much in that, that we need not to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the rest.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Why so? It is possible a man through haste or inadvertency, or as <hi>T. G.</hi> expresseth it, <hi>through a casual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation of the visual rays,</hi> may for once mistake; but doth it follow, that he must do it for twelve times together?

               <p>I know not whether to express greater shame or indignation at this disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous dealing. There needs no other answer, but to set down <hi>Aquinas</hi> his words, and to leave the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue them.<note place="margin">

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:50112:200"/>
The single question here is, whether <hi>plures Gentilium,</hi> doth signifie the greater number of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the <hi>small number</hi> of <hi>Platonists,</hi> who are not once mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?

Of those who held one First prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, but thought Divine Worship might be given to inferiour Beings. (2.) Of those who supposed God to be the soul of the world. (3.)

dispute about the nature of Idolatry? Was it not to prove <hi>Idolatry</hi> consistent with the acknowledgement of one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God? For doth not Dr. <hi>St.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose several ways for the proof of this concerning the <hi>Heathens,</hi>

               <p>That should be better proved; For how doth it follow from <hi>Justins</hi> words? That which <hi>Justin</hi> saith is, <hi>that what he attributes to Devils, the Poets at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to God himself and his Sons:</hi> and what then?

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>But</hi> Justin <hi>saith, the Devils were the causes of Idolatry, and the Poets say the true God was the cause, therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to</hi> Justin Martyr <hi>their true God was a Devil.</hi>

               <p>Which is just like this kind of reasoning. The <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Mythologists</hi> of the Roman Church attribute the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

For what consent could there be between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Devil?</hi> If the <hi>Fathers</hi> thought they owned <hi>one supreme Devil,</hi> and yet produced their testimonies to justifie their belief of <hi>one true God,</hi> it would have been just, as if the Kings Subjects should have said to <hi>O.

produce many testimonies of theirs to that purpose: and that, as it appears, to shew their consent with <hi>Christians</hi> as to the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> as <hi>Athenagoras</hi> saith expresly; what can follow more naturally from hence, than that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> did look upon that <hi>Jupiter</hi> whom they owned to be the <hi>one supreme God,</hi> to be the same <hi>true God,</hi> whom the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans worshipped?

From hence they were accused for worshipping <hi>another God</hi> from him whom the <hi>Romans</hi> worshipped, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the several suspicions which they had concerning the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Christians;</hi>

Heathens did not assert a multitude of <hi>independent gods:</hi> nor were charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> on that account.

               <p>I will tell you, The <hi>God of the Romans</hi> was he who was worshipped af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an <hi>Idolatrous manner</hi> in the <hi>Capitol</hi> and elsewhere: the <hi>Christians</hi> chose rather to to dye than to worship <hi>God</hi> after this manner: the <hi>Romans</hi> would permit no other kind of <hi>Worship</hi> than their own: and when the <hi>Christians</hi> refused to joyn in their worship, they could not believe, let them say what they would, that they worshipped <hi>that God whom all men know by the light Nature.</hi> The <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> is <hi>the God worshipped after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manner;</hi> as the <hi>God of the Jews,</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and of the <hi>Christians</hi> is the <hi>God</hi> worshipped according to those <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws,</hi> although he be the <hi>same God</hi>

in himself the <hi>Maker and Governour of the World.</hi> This place then doth imply no more, than that the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> as it stood at that time and the Christian were inconsistent; but it doth not follow from hence that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not intend to <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Supreme God</hi> under the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Jupiter O.

               <p>Yes, <hi>T. G.</hi> takes notice of that, and from thence proves that he wilfully corrupted <hi>Tertullians</hi> text, and makes a very Tragical business of it. Methinks I see the great <hi>Dionysius</hi> with his <hi>Birchen

               <p>You need not to tell us that; but we had need to keep out of your lash as long as we can, for we expect no great kindness from you, if ever we fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. But why should <hi>T. G.</hi> think that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> designed to corrupt <hi>Tertullians</hi> sense in that place, when himself had before owned that <hi>the miracle was wrought by the prayers of the Christians?</hi> He would never have done this, if he intended the other. I do confess the words, as they lye, are capable of that construction <hi>T. G.</hi> puts upon them; but in common ingenuity they ought to be
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:50112:212"/>
understood according to his own former sense of them; unless the force of the argument lay in the other sense; which I do not perceive it doth. For Dr. <hi>St.</hi> designed to prove in that place from <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence p. 92.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Heathens did acknowledge one Supreme God, from the testimony of their Consciences, and lifting up their hands and eyes to Heaven upon any great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:</hi> and then brings in those words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; which are there produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for no other end, but to shew that the <hi>same powerful God was owned by the Gentiles and Christians</hi> in that famous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. He did not intend there to prove, as <hi>T. G.</hi> suggests, <hi>that</hi> Jupiter <hi>whom they worshipped in the Capitol was this one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being,</hi> from the testimony of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and the Miracle wrought by <hi>God himself upon the Heathens supplications to him under the name of</hi> Jove; And where he did purposely set himself to prove this, he there confesses that the miracle was wrought <hi>at the prayers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and that the whole Army made the exclamation, <hi>Deo Deorum &amp; qui solus potens, whereby they did in Jovis nomine Deo nostro testimonium reddere,</hi> saith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian;</hi> and Dr. <hi>St.</hi> adds <hi>that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did intend this honour to their own</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:50112:213"/>
Jove. From whence it appears that all the force of the argument from this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony lies in this, that the Heathens did confess there was <hi>one supreme and powerful God whom they called</hi> Jove. And this I say in Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s name is the whole strength and force of his argument, and that he never thought of what <hi>T. G.</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses upon him, <hi>viz. that God wrought that miracle upon the supplications of the Heathens to prove that</hi> Jove <hi>was the true God:</hi> which was not necessary to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. But I do insist upon it, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible proof of that which he intended, the acknowledgement of <hi>one supreme God, whom they called</hi> Jove. I do yield then, that the miracle was wrought by the prayers of the Christians; that the Christians did not pray to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Jove</hi>; that the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> did attribute the honour of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to their <hi>Jove</hi>; that in the titles they gave to him on this occasion they did give testimony to the mighty power of that <hi>God</hi> whom the Christians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped; I will not deny, that <hi>M. Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> did write a Letter to the Senate, wherein he acknowledged this miracle to be wrought by the Christians, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be that was not the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:50112:213"/>
which is extant in <hi>Baronius</hi>) But after all these concessions, I say, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s argument holds good, that the <hi>Heathens did acknowledge one Supreme God under the name of</hi> Jove. For what could the Army mean else, by that acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Deo Deorum &amp; qui solus potens?</hi> From whence it unavoidably follows, that the Heathen Army did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one <hi>Supreme and Omnipotent God,</hi> whom they called <hi>Jove:</hi> And in <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> his Column at <hi>Rome,</hi> this <hi>God</hi> is described under the title of <hi>Jupiter Pluvius:</hi> therefore according to the sense of the Heathen Army, this <hi>Jupiter</hi> was <hi>Deus Deorum, &amp; solus Potens. T. G.</hi> could not but see, that herein lay the strength of Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s argument; but he dissembles it, and makes him to aim at what he never thought of, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of an ambiguous expression, he runs away with that, and uses him with more severity than ever <hi>Dionysius turned Pedant, or reforming Stepmother used,</hi> which are his own expressions upon a far less occasion.</p>

               <p>Two wayes <hi>Jupiter</hi> might be a <hi>Devil,</hi> and yet not prejudice Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s assertion. (1.) As he assumed the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> given to the <hi>Poetical Jupiter</hi>; who was really a <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Creet</hi>; but the <hi>Poets</hi> by attributing to him the villanies of many others (as to the ravishing of women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) had made him one of the greatest <hi>monsters</hi> of <hi>Wickedness</hi> that ever was; and therefore it was no wonder the <hi>Devil</hi> should be worshipped under his name; not <hi>intentionally</hi> but <hi>terminative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> in as much, as all this worship ended in the service of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very active to subdue the minds
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:50112:218"/>
of men to the Folly and Wickedness of Idolatry. (2.) As he was busie about <hi>consecrated Images,</hi> even to the <hi>supreme Jupiter.</hi> Thus although the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> might set up <hi>Images</hi> with <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and <hi>Globes,</hi> and <hi>Thunderbolts</hi> in their hands, on purpose to declare that they intended to worship the <hi>supreme God</hi> by them; yet this way of worship being so disagreeable to the Divine Nature and Perfections, God might justly suffer the impure Spirits to be active in those very <hi>Images,</hi> which were <hi>consecrated</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: and they might by this means run away with that honour which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give to the <hi>Divine Majesty.</hi> But the Question still remains, whether notwithstanding all this, the Heathens did not design to worship the <hi>supreme God</hi> under the name of <hi>Jove?</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature doth shew that the <hi>Fathers</hi> believed the contrary; and as to <hi>Minucius Felix,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had produced a material passage out of him to prove, <hi>that they who make Jove the chief God, are only deceived in the name, but agree in the power.</hi>

               <p>T.

               <p>A very heavy charge! But what if there be no ground for all this? Is not <hi>T. G.</hi> a man of admirable dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and unparallel'd ingenuity? I will take <hi>T. G.</hi>'s own translation of the words; and if from thence all that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> saith, doth follow, there can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no cause for all these clamours. <hi>Those also,</hi> saith he, <hi>who will have</hi> Jupiter <hi>to be the Prince or Chief, are deceived in the name, but agree as to the Vnity of Power.</hi> The matter lies within a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass: Either they who agreed as to the <hi>Vnity of Power</hi> and called that <hi>Power</hi> by the name of <hi>Jove</hi> did mean the <hi>same God</hi> with <hi>Minucius,</hi> or not. If they meant the <hi>same God,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> gives the true sense of <hi>Minucius,</hi> for then they who make <hi>Jove the chief God</hi> are <hi>only deceived in the name and agree in the Power:</hi> (and it is ridiculous Pedantry to quarrel at his translating, <hi>Qui Jovem Principem volunt, They who make Jove the chief God:</hi> and for putting in <hi>only,</hi> it is no more than the sense implyes, for if they agree in the thing, they must be <hi>only</hi> deceived in the name.) This is therefore the single point to be debated, whether according to <hi>Minucius</hi> they understood the <hi>same God</hi> or not? And to make this out I desire
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:50112:219"/>
no other method than what <hi>T. G.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, <hi>viz.</hi> to consider the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucius</hi> in that place. <hi>Providence being supposed,</hi> he saith, <hi>the question is whether the world be Governed by one, or more, and after other arguments for Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in general, he produces the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of mankind in lifting up their hands to Heaven, and calling upon God, and saying, God is great, God is true, and if God give. Is this,</hi> saith he, <hi>the voice of Nature in the common people, or the confession of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?</hi> Where nothing can be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than the consent between the <hi>voice</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>the confession of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> as to the <hi>same God.</hi> And then it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows. <hi>Et qui Jovem Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem volunt, falluntur in nomine, sed de unâ Potestate consentiunt.</hi> These agree too as to the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Power, who would have Jove to be Chief.</hi> Is there not all the reason that may be, to understand this agreement to be with those mentioned before; viz. <hi>the common people</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> who all consent in the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Power;</hi> but these call that <hi>Power</hi> by the name of <hi>Jove;</hi> and although <hi>Minucius</hi> thinks they are deceived in attributing that <hi>name to God,</hi> yet he yields that they agreed in the thing. This is the plain
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:50112:220"/>
and easie sense of <hi>Minucius</hi>; Let us now consider <hi>T. G.</hi>'s sense of these words, and see how well that agrees with his design. His sense is this; <hi>They who would have</hi> Jupiter <hi>to be the Prince or Chief, were agreed as to the Vnity of Power, but were so much deceived, not only in the name, but in the thing it self, that they attributed this Power, not to God but to the Devil.</hi> For, saith T. G. <hi>Minucius his own thoughts were, that this</hi> Jupiter <hi>was a Devil.</hi> Let this be supposed, and his meaning is this, <hi>The common People call upon God, and say, God is true, God is great</hi>; and <hi>therein agree with the confession of Christians; and they who will have</hi> Jove, i. e. <hi>the Devil to be the Chief of Gods, do agree as to the Vnity of Power.</hi> They who make <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>Chief,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> to be <hi>Chief,</hi> do both agree that <hi>one</hi> is <hi>Chief</hi> I grant: but will any man of common sense say only <hi>that these are deceived in the name,</hi> who thinks at the same time, they mean the <hi>Devil?</hi> Are they not deceived in much more than <hi>the name,</hi> in the <hi>very thing</hi> it self? Do they not set up an <hi>Vsurper</hi> instead of <hi>God,</hi> and his most inveterate enemy, and attribute <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>undivided power</hi> to him? And is this dwindling expression fit for a Christian, to say only, <hi>falluntur
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:50112:220"/>
in nomine, they are deceived in the name?</hi> No: but he ought to have told them, they were deceived much more in the thing than in the name. It was but a trifle in comparison what name they used, if their sense and meaning were good. Call him <hi>Jove</hi> or what they pleased, if they meant the <hi>same thing,</hi> it was only a difference about a name: but if they did really attribute the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections to the Devil,</hi> this was a crime of the highest nature, it was <hi>noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious blasphemy;</hi> and no true Christian could pass it over so gently and slightly, as <hi>Minucius</hi> doth, if he were of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s opinion. But to convince us that he was far from it; he afterwards produces the consent of <hi>Philosophers</hi> with the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, so</hi> he saith, (in the same page of the <hi>Leyden Edition) that they did consent with them:</hi> and surely it was <hi>no consent with Christians</hi> to give the <hi>divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to the <hi>Devil.</hi> Speaking of <hi>Thales,</hi> he saith, <hi>Vides Philosophi principalis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum penitus opinionem consonare.</hi> (I forbear to translate lest <hi>T. G.</hi> should want matter to fill up some empty pages as he did by proving that <hi>volunt</hi> doth not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>making,</hi> &amp;c.) However, <hi>Minucius</hi> shews, that this <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Philosophers</hi>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:50112:221"/>
did fully agree with the <hi>Christians.</hi> Wherein I beseech you? in attributing that <hi>power</hi> to the <hi>Devil</hi> which they give to <hi>God?</hi> this is an agreement which I dare say, <hi>no Christian</hi> would ever own. And therefore it must be, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the <hi>same Divine Being</hi> which the Christians did. And after he hath reckoned up the several opinions of the most noted <hi>Philosophers,</hi> he hath this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable expression; <hi>Exposui opiniones omnium fere Philosophorum, quibus illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or gloria est Deum unum multis licet desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasse nominibus: I have set down the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of almost all the famous Philosophers, who all set forth one God though under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny names:</hi> And lest any should fall into <hi>T. G.</hi>'s extravagant imagination, that this was not a <hi>consent in the same Being,</hi> but as to a meer <hi>Vnity of Power,</hi> though lodged in the <hi>Devil</hi> himself, he adds these words, <hi>Vt quivis arbitretur, aut nunc Christianos philosophos esse, aut philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophos fuisse jam tunc Christianos.</hi> Let <hi>T. G.</hi> construe this to his sense, if he can for his heart. Would any man in the World, who believed the <hi>Heathens supreme God to be the Devil,</hi> have said, either that the <hi>Christians</hi> now were <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> or <hi>the Philosophers then were
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:50112:221"/>
Christians: i. e.</hi> that those who asserted that <hi>God,</hi> and those who said, the <hi>Devil</hi> were <hi>supreme Governour of the world,</hi> were of the <hi>same opinion.</hi> Which is so foolish, so ridiculous an assertion, that I wonder to find <hi>T. G.</hi> resolve to maintain it. And I now desire you, or any man to judge whether <hi>the half dozen Fathers</hi> T. G. hath produced before <hi>Origen</hi> can amount to a <hi>Covie</hi> of <hi>One.</hi> I have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised great patience in examining these testimonies, and not after <hi>T.

               <p>I am far from being satisfied with this account of the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi> For when a man pretends to give an account of a thing, there are three things he ought to regard; First, that it be <hi>full;</hi> Secondly, that it be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct;</hi> Thirdly, that it be <hi>general.</hi> But I shall shew you, that this account fails in all those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and withall that it doth not clear the <hi>Image worship of the Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That it is not <hi>full,</hi> because it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses all their <hi>Idolatry</hi> as to <hi>Images</hi> to lye in taking the <hi>Images of Deified men for Gods on the account of the presence of evil Spirits in them.</hi> But I find another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son alledged out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> against the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> which <hi>T.

                  <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Image Worship</hi> was <hi>very unsuitable to the Divine Nature,</hi> as well as <hi>repugnant to the Will of God;</hi> and although the latter reason may seem to hold only for those who received the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doth extend to all mankind. For he shews from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that <hi>Zeno</hi> the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:50112:224"/>
                  <hi>Stoick, Antisthenes, Xenophon, Numa</hi> and others condemned the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> on this account, <hi>because they were a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Divine Nature.</hi> And for this, he produces the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Justin Martyr, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenagoras, Origen, Lactantius</hi> and many others. Is this account true, or false? if false, why is it not proved to be so? if true, why is it not allowed? Is this fair or honest dealing, in pretending to answer, and not taking notice of the main objections; or to give account of the <hi>Fathers</hi> opinions of this matter, and to say not one word to all this? But it is one thing to write an <hi>Answer</hi> to a <hi>Book,</hi> and another to write a <hi>Book</hi> which must pass for an <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) This account is not <hi>clear and distinct.</hi> For it doth not express whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were <hi>Idolatry</hi> or not, to <hi>worship Images,</hi> where there was no <hi>incorporation supposed of evil Spirits,</hi> nor doth it shew how it could be <hi>Idolatry</hi> on that supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I do not deny, that there was such an opinion among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that <hi>Spirits might possess Images,</hi> and be <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated</hi> with them; but I say this was a <hi>particular opinion,</hi> and not the <hi>general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi> For <hi>Hermes,</hi> from whom S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:50112:225"/>
gives the most exact account of this <hi>hypothesis</hi> (from the <hi>Asclepian Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>) looks upon it <hi>as a Divine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar art of drawing invisible Spirits into Images in such a manner as to animate them;</hi>

                     <hi>c.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>is the most wonderful of all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that it should be in mens power to make Gods.</hi> Not by producing the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being;</hi> but by so <hi>uniting</hi> it to the <hi>Image,</hi> as to make that a fit <hi>object</hi> for <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship.</hi> But you of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend to do as much as this comes to with <hi>five words;</hi> and somewhat more, for you pretend to <hi>annihilate a substance</hi> which they did not: but as to the main wonder, yours is of the <hi>same nature, viz.</hi> so to <hi>unite the Divinity to the species of Bread and Wine, as to make them together a fit object for divine worship.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>T. G.</hi> doth not at all clear the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as to <hi>Images,</hi> by such an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> which doth justifie the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> upon his own grounds. For this principle being supposed, that <hi>God</hi> was <hi>really incorporated in the Image,</hi> it was as lawful for them to <hi>Worship</hi> that <hi>Image,</hi> as for you to <hi>Worship</hi> the <hi>Host.</hi> If you say, <hi>those were evil Spirits, and not the true God,</hi> that doth not clear the matter. For
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:50112:225"/>
we are not now disputing whether they were <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad Spirits</hi> which were in those <hi>Images;</hi> but on what account they were charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi> If it were <hi>for worshipping their Images as Gods on the account of</hi> one <hi>of their</hi> Gods <hi>being</hi> incorporated <hi>in the Image,</hi> this I say, is no account at all on <hi>T. G.</hi>'s principles: for then such an <hi>Image</hi> was as fit an object of <hi>worship,</hi> on their supposition, as the <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Host</hi> is on yours. So that this is rather a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> from the <hi>charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> than giving any account of it: all the <hi>Idolatry</hi> in this case lying in the worship of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> and not in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi>

               <p>This is the utmost which can be said in your Defence; and to shew you how far this is from clearing your <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> I shall consider, (1.) The force of the <hi>Fathers</hi> arguments. (2.) The difference of the <hi>Heathens</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:50112:226"/>
from <hi>yours</hi> as to the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi> And if their arguments be such as equally hold against your practises; and your answers do not really differ from theirs; then the parallel will hold good between your Idolatry and theirs in this particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the force of the <hi>Fathers</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the thing to be considered is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they held only <hi>in conjunction with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their Images to be Gods.</hi> What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion was there between this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> and <hi>the disparagement which Images did imply to the Divine Nature?</hi> For this was wholly on the account of <hi>representation;</hi> (and this is the great argument the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> insist upon.) <hi>The infinite distance between God and the Work of mens hands; the disproportion that dull and senseless mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, however Carved and Adorned doth bear to a Divine Majesty: that no Image of God ought to be worshipped; but what is what he is;</hi> i. e. <hi>his Eternal Son; the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaching men that it was greater purity of Worship, greater reverence to the Deity, less danger of errour to mankind to worship God without an Image;</hi> are all arguments used and pressed by the <hi>Fathers</hi> against the Worship of Images; which have their full strength and force supposing nothing
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:50112:227"/>
were intended beyond bare representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. What think you of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> condemning the <hi>Carpocratians</hi> for worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> Did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Christ incorporated</hi> in that <hi>Image</hi> too? Or did <hi>Epiphanius</hi> believe him to be so in the <hi>Image</hi> on the <hi>Veil,</hi> or the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Elvira</hi> in the <hi>Pictures</hi> upon <hi>Walls?</hi> By all which we see what numbers of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments the <hi>Fathers</hi> used against the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> which have no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all to the believing their <hi>Images</hi> to be <hi>Gods.</hi> Besides, several other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they used which would lose their force upon this supposition; as those taken from the <hi>meanness</hi> of <hi>subjecting our selves to vile and senseless Images;</hi> and all the enforcements drawn from the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of them; which would have no great strength if this had been the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral belief of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that the <hi>God whom they worshipped was incorporated in the Image:</hi> and therefore why might not he be worshipped thereby, as well as <hi>God incarnate in humane nature,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the vileness and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of our Flesh?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the difference between them and you about the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> I do grant, that your <hi>Church</hi> doth in terms
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:50112:227"/>
declare against it. And so in probability would a <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Wiser Heathens</hi> have done; as appears by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Celsus, Julian, Maximus Tyrius</hi> and many others. But when men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute such <hi>divine effects,</hi> as <hi>miraculous cures</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> what can they believe but there is some <hi>Divinity</hi> either in or about them? And when this is assigned as the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>Worship</hi> of such an <hi>Image,</hi> as at <hi>Loretto,</hi> or <hi>Mointague,</hi> or elsewhere; and of the mighty resort thither on that account; what is this but to believe such <hi>Divinity</hi> to be in or about them? which doth inhance the peoples Devotion to them. And this was the general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the Heathens; not, that there was an <hi>Hypostatical union</hi> between the <hi>Deity</hi> and the <hi>Image</hi> by <hi>incorporation:</hi> but that there was a <hi>vertual</hi> and <hi>powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> in and about the <hi>Image</hi> by reason of its <hi>Dedication.</hi> And upon this account of a more peculiar <hi>presence</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> after <hi>consecration,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Divine Worship was given to them,</hi> it was that the <hi>Heathen Images</hi> were called <hi>Gods.</hi>

               <p>Wherein did the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>Idolatry</hi> lye? In worshipping <hi>bad</hi> men instead of <hi>good?</hi> or in giving <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to <hi>any men?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>I will answer you as freely as you can desire, provided you answer me another question which I take to be as material, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the <hi>generality</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> did not worship <hi>Deified men?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>What need you ask that, when I have told you already? T. G. <hi>takes a great deal of pains to prove it from many Testimonies of the Fathers:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 340, to 343.</note> as I was about to have shewed when you interrupted me; <hi>because the places of their birth were known and their Sepulchres extant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I see you have no mind to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: but <hi>T.

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But have you forgotten already, what you so lately told me, that <hi>T. G.</hi> proved <hi>that the generality of the Heathens did worship Deified-men?</hi>

were their Gods;</hi> viz. Jupiter, Saturn, Juno, Aesculapius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I pray consider, were these their <hi>Gods</hi> or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Doubtless they were; <hi>for</hi> T.G. <hi>hath plainly demonstrated it from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>And were those who were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Deified-men, truly and properly Gods and not by way of participation?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I confess you stagger me, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>T. G.</hi> did not lay these two assertions together, <hi>that the Heathen Gods were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally men, and yet were truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods;</hi> but he proves this later asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I am sure of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>So you were but just now of the former; however these contradict each other, let us hear his proofs of this later, which is not so true as the former.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>And so doth he too. Only he doth not believe <hi>Deified-men</hi> to be <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Deities.</hi> They were <hi>Gods</hi> as they gave them not barely the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Gods;</hi> but as they supposed them <hi>to be admitted into some share in administring the affairs of the world; and had therefore Divine Worship given unto them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, The Heathens accused the Christians of Atheism, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them to be Gods who were publickly worshipped.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>The Heathens did not believe there was any such <hi>God</hi> who disallowed the <hi>worship of any other Gods besides him;</hi> and therefore when they found the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> utterly reject their <hi>worship,</hi> they charged them with <hi>Atheism.</hi> But is not this an admirable way of reasoning, from the <hi>Heathens</hi> objections against the <hi>Christians?</hi> Might he not prove as well that the <hi>Christians God had Asses ears, that they eat Children, that they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous Conjunctions,</hi> &amp;c. for all these were objected by the Heathens, as well as <hi>Atheism?</hi> And <hi>Athenagoras</hi> whom <hi>T.

                  <hi>Thirdly, They persecuted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to death, and they willingly suffered it, for maintaining there was but one only true

God, who deserved Divine Honour to be given to him.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Very true. Because they thought it unlawful to give <hi>Divine Worship</hi> to any <hi>Creature</hi> whatsoever. But did not the <hi>Heathens</hi> require <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship</hi> to be given to <hi>Deified-men?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>That is, they gave them <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship,</hi> and what then? they did so to <hi>Deified-men,</hi> saith <hi>T. G.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, The Fathers bring infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite arguments to prove that those whom the Heathens called Gods, were not really and truly Gods; which had been a superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labour, if the Heathens had not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as well as called them Gods.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>And did not the same <hi>Fathers</hi> bring <hi>infinite arguments</hi> to prove that these <hi>Gods were but men?</hi> Their design was to shew that nothing but what was truly and essentially <hi>God,</hi> could deserve <hi>Divine Worship;</hi> which their <hi>vulgar Gods</hi> were so far from being, that they were <hi>meer men,</hi> and some of the worst too.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, Many of those who wrote against the Heathens had been such them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:50112:231"/>
and therefore would not charge them with more than they were guilty of in this matter.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Those were the very men <hi>T. G.</hi> cited <hi>to prove their Gods had been Men, and had Fathers and Mothers, and Vncles and Aunts as other Mortals have.</hi>

                  <hi>Seventhly, The Devils perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded most of the Heathens that they were Gods, as</hi> St. Augustin <hi>saith, by their falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious signs and predictions.</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaks of their <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over mankind by reason of Idolatry;</hi>

                     <hi>De Civil. Dei, l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> which might have been, although the <hi>Heathens</hi> had only worshipped <hi>Deified men;</hi> but I grant, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> did give <hi>divine worship to Daemons</hi> too; whom some believed to be <hi>intercessors between the Gods and Men; carrying up our prayers to them, and bringing down their help to us:</hi> as he there expresseth it; and others thought them to be <hi>Gods,</hi> i. e. <hi>a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our kind of Spirits;</hi> however all agreed in giving <hi>divine honour</hi> to them. But those who believed them to be <hi>Gods, i. e. of a higher rank than the subservient Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> did not suppose them to be <hi>self-existent and independent Deities,</hi> but to have received their being by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>God;</hi> and supposing them
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:50112:231"/>
good, St. <hi>Augustin</hi> thinks their notion of them not much different from what <hi>Christians</hi> have of <hi>Angels:</hi> and that it was a controversie about a name, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be called Gods or not;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Civit. Dei, l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 23. <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> but he is far from thinking it so, <hi>whether Divine worship were to be given to them?</hi> For this he utterly denies, it being inconsistent with the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as he proves in the beginning of his tenth Book. From whence it appears, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie was not about the <hi>name of Gods;</hi> but about giving <hi>Divine Worship to any Creature.</hi> For St. <hi>Augustin</hi> would allow them to call them <hi>Gods,</hi> if they reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Divine worship</hi> as <hi>peculiar</hi> to God; but if they did give this to them, it was no excuse to call them <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Gods;</hi> as the <hi>Platonists</hi> did. And when he saith, <hi>the Devils had perswaded the greatest part of mankind by their lying wonders that they were Gods:</hi> his meaning is no more than that they were <hi>good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> which he saith, <hi>Apuleius and others observing them more narrowly found they were not, but a sort of malicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful beings; notwithstanding which,</hi> he saith, <hi>these agreed with the rest in giving divine worship to them.</hi> So that whatever men do give <hi>Divine Worship</hi> to, that
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:50112:232"/>
they do make a <hi>God</hi> of, whatsoever no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have of its <hi>Original,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Being from another.</p>

                  <hi>Eighthly, The wisest of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens not only concurred with the vulgar in the external practice of worshipping many Gods, but looked on it as a point of State-policy, not to let the people know that they were no Gods whom they worshipped.</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>And what then I beseech you? They were rather willing to maintain <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than to hazard the disturbance of <hi>Government;</hi> therefore the <hi>Gods</hi> whom they worshipped were <hi>truely and properly Gods.</hi> All that follows from hence is, that there were many follies and superstitions among the people, which they thought better to let them alone in, than to run the hazard of all by a change; that the <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and <hi>Statuaries</hi> had tainted the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> with false and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy notions of their <hi>Gods;</hi> and would in spite of Laws represent their <hi>Gods</hi> in the publick Sports doing things unsitting for men to do or see; that although they thought it were much better to have these things redressed, yet they had so much greater regard to the <hi>safety</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> than to the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:50112:232"/>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> that they chose rather to let things stand as they found them; and to joyn with the people in the same <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>publick worship,</hi> retaining their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to themselves.

                  <hi>If they give Divine Worship to any one of these as an absolute Deity,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> well observes; <hi>and not if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the worship they give to them to the true God.</hi>

               <p>What means <hi>the giving divine worship as to an absolute Deity?</hi> Is it to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that which they worship <hi>to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly God,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> saith? That is to suppose it, <hi>not to be a Creature.</hi> And upon this ground those who supposed the <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> or <hi>Elements</hi> to be <hi>Creatures</hi> could not be guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the <hi>Worship</hi> of them: and so the greatest part of the <hi>Heathen World</hi> will be excused from it. Or is it <hi>to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship to the Creatures without any respect to God the Maker of the World and of all things in it?</hi> But then either they did at that time believe him to be the <hi>Maker of those Beings,</hi> or they did not: if they did, either they worshipped them as <hi>created,</hi> or as <hi>uncreated beings;</hi> if as <hi>created beings,</hi> how could they <hi>wholly pass by the Creator?</hi> if as <hi>uncreated,</hi> how could they at the same time believe them to be <hi>created</hi> by him?</p>

                  <hi>how those who acknowledged one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:50112:233"/>
Being, could think any others to be truely and properly Gods besides him?</hi> And he resolves it thus, <hi>that the generality of the Heathens had no clear and distinct no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one Supreme Being; but only the Wiser Philosophers.</hi>

               <p>By this answer, none but the <hi>dull and stupid vulgar</hi> could be guilty of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> such who believed (if any did) <hi>there were no other Gods besides their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi> or if there were, they never consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more, than that they were all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gods</hi> alike, and they knew no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between <hi>one Chief and the rest:</hi> but if they happened to suppose <hi>one Supreme</hi> and the others <hi>made by him,</hi> as I have shewed from <hi>Tertullian</hi> they generally did, then they are free from <hi>Idolatry</hi> in all acts of <hi>worship</hi> performed with that opinion. For if <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth suppose a belief of <hi>more Gods than one truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called,</hi> then all those who did own and acknowledge <hi>one first cause</hi> from whence all other beings were derived, could not be guilty of it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all those who had the true knowledge of <hi>God</hi> could not commit <hi>Idolatry:</hi> because they could not at the same time believe but <hi>one true God, and many true Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:50112:234"/>And if the <hi>true notion</hi> of <hi>Idolary</hi> doth consist <hi>in believing and worshipping many Gods truely and properly so called;</hi> then let us see how many of the <hi>Heathens</hi> will stand clear from the guilt of it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) All those who worshipped <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men</hi> and believed them to be such, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they gave them the <hi>worship pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to true Gods.</hi> For as long as they did not think them to be such, it could not be <hi>real Idolatry:</hi> and so <hi>Cicero, Varro</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Wise Statesmen</hi> will be excused.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) All those who believed <hi>Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Gods</hi> having their first being from one <hi>Supreme;</hi> as the ancient <hi>Poets, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) All those who worshipped the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> with respect <hi>to one God,</hi> as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) All those who opposed <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> upon this ground, <hi>that although there were but one Supreme God, yet others might receive divine worship together with him;</hi> and upon this principle the most bitter enemies of <hi>Christianity</hi> disputed, <hi>viz. Celsus, Porphyrius, Hierocles, Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Maximus, Symmachus</hi> and others. And to own it not to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> to give <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship</hi> to created beings supposing
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:50112:234"/>
them not to be owned to be <hi>truely and properly Gods,</hi> is in plain terms to give up the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> against <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatry.</hi> And this I insist upon as the main argument in this matter: and desire you or <hi>T. G.</hi> or any one else to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath made it evident from the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Celsus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence p. 81, to 102.</note> 
                  <hi>Julian</hi> and the <hi>modern Platonists,</hi> that the <hi>Dispute</hi> about <hi>Idolatry,</hi> between them and the <hi>Christians</hi> was not, whether there were <hi>only one God truely and properly so called, and others only by participation from him;</hi> for this they yielded: but the question was, whether upon that supposition that they were <hi>inferiour and subservient Gods,</hi> they might not have <hi>divine worship</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them in a degree suitable to their excellencies? And upon this point the hinge of the Controversie turned. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Christians</hi> were right in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning such <hi>Worship</hi> for <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or not? If not, the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> is given up to <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Julian;</hi> if they were in the right, then <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth not lie <hi>in believing and worshipping many Gods properly and truely so called;</hi> but in <hi>giving divine worship to any Creature whatsoever.</hi> And why did not <hi>T. G.</hi> answer to this, which was the most material point of all
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:50112:235"/>
others? but run out into long discourses of the <hi>Ignorance of the vulgar Heathen</hi> (which no man doubts any more than the <hi>Ignorance of vulgar Papists;</hi> although I hope not to the same degree) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true God.</hi> And yet we could tell him of another sort of <hi>Statesmen,</hi> who love to keep the <hi>People</hi> in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> lest they should by the help of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> see too far into these matters. And some of your own <hi>Church</hi> have told us <hi>that they could find no difference between the common peoples opinion of Saints, and what the Heathens had of their Gods.</hi> And thus the parallel holds good still. But the common people though more gross in their apprehensions and do commit greater follies in their practices, may yet be <hi>safer</hi> in their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> than those who ought to inform them better. But when we enquire <hi>what is lawful,</hi> we must not run to the <hi>practices</hi> or <hi>opinions</hi> of the <hi>vulgar,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> doth here; but to the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>case</hi> as it was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by those who <hi>best understood it.</hi> And they did not put it upon that issue <hi>whether it were lawful to worship many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Deities;</hi> but <hi>whether it were lawful to give Divine worship to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beings, on the account of that power and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:50112:235"/>
authority which God had put into their hands?</hi> And if this were not <hi>Idolatry, Celsus</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> thought <hi>Heathenism</hi> justified, and the doctrine of <hi>Christianity</hi> overthrown; and so did <hi>Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin</hi> too.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) The modern <hi>Idolaters</hi> will be excused too, if the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth consist in <hi>a multitude of independent Deities,</hi> or <hi>of Gods truely and properly so called.</hi> For Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath proved abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that the <hi>Eastern, Western, Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> and <hi>Northern Nations,</hi> which are, or have been charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> by the <hi>Roman Church, do own one Supreme God, and others as inferiour Deities.</hi> And this he chiefly proves from the <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of those of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> who have been sent as <hi>Missioners</hi> to convert them from their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And what saith <hi>T.

                  <hi>yet the generality of the People did not; and so might easily worship many Gods properly and truly so called:</hi> whereas by this <hi>Discourse</hi> it appears that the difference between the <hi>supreme</hi> and <hi>inferiour Deities</hi> was a thing known and received among the most rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations. And it is no great civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity towards the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> to imagine them to be more <hi>sottish Idolaters</hi> than the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>West-Indians.</hi> I will confess freely to you, that I think there was not a more absurd and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> extant in the most barbarous parts of the world, that are come to our knowledge, than the <hi>Poetical Theology</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> if it be understood <hi>literally;</hi> and therefore the common people who had the <hi>Poets</hi> in mighty esteem, lay under

great disadvantages; but yet, the <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fables</hi> being rejected by their <hi>Laws</hi> as well as by their <hi>Wise Men,</hi> and the <hi>Poets</hi> themselves confessing <hi>one Supreme God,</hi> but above all, <hi>the natural sense of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> did keep up the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>one God</hi> among the <hi>People, who was Lord over all,</hi> insomuch that upon any solemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions they made their appeal to him, as the <hi>Fathers</hi> observe. <hi>Lactantius</hi> saith, <hi>not only the Wise,</hi>

               <p>But methinks, You seem to have forgotten T. G.<hi>'s Appendix</hi> about the-<hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Idolatry,</hi> as well as he had <hi>to write

               <p>I am not very apt to believe <hi>T. G.</hi> could <hi>forget</hi> so material a part of the Doctours Book: but there was some other reason, for passing it over; which it is not hard to conjecture.

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, because the Doctour reduces their worship to one of these two principles, either that God hath committed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World to inferiour Deities; or that God is the soul of the World: now</hi> T. G. <hi>having proved that those who do hold the latter principle are guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and those who hold the former, of the exteriour profession of it in concurring with the Vulgar in the external practice of their Idolatry, it would have been but</hi> actum agere <hi>to repeat the same things over again.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>This is scarce a tolerable shift. For the great force of that discourse, lay in two things; (1.) The almost <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal consent</hi> of <hi>Idolaters</hi> that there was <hi>one supreme God,</hi> against <hi>T. G.</hi>'s <hi>hypothesis</hi> of <hi>many Gods truly and properly so called.</hi> (2.) That all these were charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> by the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the sense of that, <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:50112:238"/>
could not lye <hi>in worshipping many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent and absolute Deities.</hi> But the prettiest shift, is, <hi>that he had condemned the Platonists for the exteriour practice of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in concurring with the Vulgar,</hi> and therefore he need not speak to <hi>whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> who agreed in that <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and yet are charged with <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> If I were given to quoting ends of <hi>Verses</hi> I would cry, <hi>risum teneatis amici.</hi>

               <p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>No such matter: he hath found out a far better away than that; he proves <hi>that Dr.</hi> St. <hi>hath forfeited all right of being believed in things of that kind.</hi>

               <p>Commend me to <hi>T. G.</hi> for shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is really the notablest trick I ever met with.

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:50112:239"/>
suborning Testimonies. Methinks this savours a little too much of <hi>Dionysius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But he charges him more with another <hi>Testimony of Trigautius,</hi> where he <hi>leaves out the Emphatical words which shew the difference between the Worship which the</hi> Chineses <hi>give to</hi> Confutius <hi>and to the Tutelar Spirits. For first, he omits the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of the Magistrates taking the Oath before the Tutelar spirits; then he leaves out what</hi> Trigautius <hi>affirms, that the worship was not the same.</hi> (3.) He omits <hi>nam</hi> and <hi>Divinam, which shew the reason of the difference to be the Divine Power which they believed to be in the Tutelar Spirits.</hi>

Dr. <hi>St.</hi> doth not omit <hi>the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Magistrates taking their oath to or before these Tutelar Spirits</hi>; for he saith expresly, that the <hi>Mandarines</hi> are <hi>to swear in the Temple of the Tutelar Spirit when they enter into their office</hi>;<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 132.</note> and he particularly insists upon it, as one of the instances of the allowances the <hi>Jesuites</hi> gave to their <hi>Converts</hi> to go and perform all <hi>external Acts of adoration</hi> in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:50112:240"/>
of the <hi>Tutelar Spirits,</hi> provided they directed all those <hi>Acts</hi> to a <hi>Crucifix</hi> which they held in their hands or conveyed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly among the flowers of the Altar. (2.) He distinguishes the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Confutius</hi> from that of the <hi>Tutelar Spirits.</hi> For, he saith, in that very place, <hi>that they make no prayers to him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>neither seek, nor hope for any thing from him; but that they acknowledge the Tutelar Spirits to have power to reward and punish.</hi> Is not this enough to shew the difference of their <hi>Worship</hi> to any men of common sense? (3.) Is not a <hi>Power to reward and punish</hi> in the <hi>Tutelar Spirits</hi> set down by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> out of <hi>Trigautius?</hi> and to what end should he then leave out <hi>nam</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> but that he thought them needless when the sense was expressed? But the <hi>birchen Scepter</hi> would be of little use, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Dionysius</hi> shewed his <hi>Authority</hi> upon such occasions.

               <p>T. G. gives a third reason, viz. <hi>because it appears from his own Citations, that these modern Idolaters either worshipped a false God for the true one; or false Gods together with the true one, if they worshipped him at all.</hi>

               <p>He thought those might be easily understood by the <hi>Case; viz.</hi> about performing the <hi>same external Acts of Worship, with Idolaters, but with a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent intention; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Mandarins</hi> were permitted by the <hi>Jesuites</hi> to go into the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Tutelar Spirits,</hi> and to use all the <hi>external Acts</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> which others used, provided they directed them to the <hi>Crucifix</hi> and not to the <hi>Idol</hi>; which the <hi>Cardinals</hi> declare to be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful notwithstanding this <hi>Intention.</hi> From whence Dr. <hi>St.</hi> observed, (1.) That they called the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Tutelar Spirits Idolatry,</hi> although they looked on them only as <hi>inferiour Deities,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth not consist in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping many <hi>absolute and independent Gods,</hi> or <hi>truly and properly so called.</hi> (2.) That <hi>inferiour Worship</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>created excellency</hi> is <hi>unlawful,</hi> when it appears to be <hi>Religious.</hi> This he proved from their condemning the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Confutius,</hi> which the <hi>Jesuits</hi> allowed. And <hi>T. G.</hi> is so much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in thinking that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to corrupt the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Trigau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:50112:241"/>
by confounding the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futius</hi> and the <hi>Tutelar Spirits,</hi> that his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is the stronger for the distinction between them. For, although <hi>no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be made to</hi> Confutius, <hi>no divine power be supposed to be in him</hi> as in the <hi>Tutelar Spirits,</hi> yet because he had a <hi>Temple</hi> in every <hi>City</hi> with his <hi>Image</hi> in it; and all other <hi>external Rites of adoration used,</hi> as <hi>genuflections, wax-candles, incense</hi> and <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; (such as your <hi>Church</hi> useth to <hi>Images</hi> without <hi>prayers</hi>) yet these are condemned as <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> And although the <hi>Cardinals</hi> might not then reflect on the consequence of this resolution as to their own practices; yet I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of that <hi>Providence,</hi> which once directed <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to speak a great <hi>Truth</hi> beside his <hi>intention,</hi> that so overruled the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Cardinals</hi> to condemn their own <hi>Idolatry</hi> under the name of <hi>Confutius.</hi> For if the using those external acts of <hi>adoration</hi> towards the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Confutius</hi> be <hi>Idolatry</hi>; why shall it not be so, where <hi>prayers</hi> are added, as they are in your <hi>Church</hi> to the <hi>Images</hi> set up in your <hi>Churches?</hi> Let <hi>T. G.</hi> tell me wherein the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Idolatry</hi> lay, which consisted in <hi>external Acts of adoration,</hi> without any opinion of <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:50112:242"/>
being a <hi>God truly and properly so called.</hi> (3.) That <hi>external Acts</hi> are capable of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> however the <hi>intention</hi> of the mind be directed. For, although the <hi>Cardinals</hi> believed the <hi>Crucifix</hi> to be a <hi>proper object of Divine Worship,</hi> yet they condemned those <hi>Acts</hi> as <hi>Idolatrous</hi> which were directed to it in the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Tutelar Spirits.</hi> And upon the whole matter, I think, no impartial Reader will believe that <hi>T. G.</hi> hath said any thing to purpose upon this matter, and that he had better left those few leaves still vacant, than have filled them with such an insignificant <hi>Postscript</hi>; and he hath no reason to thank his <hi>Friend for putting him</hi> upon laying open so much the <hi>Weakness</hi> of his <hi>Cause.</hi> For, from hence it farther appears that the <hi>Modern Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> will likewise be excused, if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth consist, as <hi>T.

               <p>Why do you ask me such an impertinent question?</p>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing can be more pertinent, for this is <hi>meer relative Latria.</hi>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>It was <hi>Idolatry</hi> in them, but yet not so in us when we worship the <hi>Crucifix</hi> with <hi>respect to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>You may as well say, Lying with another mans Wife was <hi>Adultery</hi> in them, but not in <hi>You.</hi> I pray shew the difference.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>You would fain bring me back again to the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi>; but you shall not. For I say their <hi>Idolatry lay in worshipping God as united to the parts
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:50112:244"/>
of the world; and giving Divine Worship to them on that Account.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Will you stand to this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Why not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then I will prove <hi>worshipping the Host</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> on the same grounds. For in both cases, there is a supposition really false, but which being true would justifie the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>; and if notwithstanding that supposition that <hi>God is the Soul of the world,</hi> the <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as so <hi>united</hi> is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> then the worship of the <hi>Host</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the supposition of Christs Body being <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>species</hi> is <hi>Idolatry</hi> too; they being both acts of adoration given to those objects which in themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no worship, but yet are adored upon such a supposition which being true would justifie the performance of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>You are much mistaken in your parallel. <hi>For,</hi> as <hi>T. G.</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <hi>in the worship of the Host,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cathol. no Idol. <hi>p.</hi> 327, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Act of adoration is not formally terminated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bread, supposing it to remain, but upon God: but we conceive the bread not to be there at all;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 432, 433.</note> 
                  <hi>but in place thereof the only true and Eternal God. And whatever is taken for an object of worship, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing must affirm (either truly or falsly)
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:50112:245"/>
to be; but Catholicks, whether mistaken or not in the belief of Transubstantiation, do not in their minds affirm the bread to be, but not to be; because they believe it to be converted into the body of Christ. But they who worshipped the parts of the world with a respect to God as the Soul of it, did however believe those to have a real Being, and not to be turned into the substance of God.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>All that this proves is, that you do not take <hi>the Bread it self for God;</hi> no more did they, who worshipped the parts of the world, as members of that <hi>Body</hi> to which <hi>God</hi> was <hi>united</hi> as the <hi>Soul,</hi> take those <hi>parts</hi> for <hi>God.</hi> But in both cases there is a supposition equal to justifie the <hi>Worship</hi> if true; and if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this supposition, the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> were guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> why are not you upon a far more unreasonable supposition than that? If <hi>Christs Body</hi> be present in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> you say, you may worship it as there present; so say they, if <hi>God be the Soul of the world,</hi> we may lawfully worship the several parts of it? But you say, <hi>whatever is an object of worship must be supposed to be; whereas you suppose the bread not to be, but to be converted into the Body of Christ;</hi> which alters not the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:50112:245"/>
case; for the question is not about the <hi>bare being</hi> or <hi>not being</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> but of the <hi>being</hi> or <hi>not being</hi> of a <hi>fit object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> I will make the matter plain to you by this Instance; One of the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the Heathen world was the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Sun;</hi> they who did worship it, did suppose it <hi>to be a fit object for worship,</hi> but they who looked on the <hi>Sun</hi> as a <hi>meer creature</hi> could not think so: therefore to make any creature a fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for worship, there must go a farther supposition; <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> being <hi>in it</hi> or <hi>united to it.</hi> Now the main point lyes here, whether on supposition that the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> doth <hi>not remain,</hi> it would <hi>not be Idolatry,</hi> but on supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>it doth remain</hi> it would <hi>be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry?</hi> I pray then answer me, would it be <hi>Idolatry</hi> or not to worship the <hi>Sun,</hi> suppose a man believed the very <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the Sun to be <hi>turned</hi> into the <hi>Divinity?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>No surely. For that is our own case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>How comes it then to be <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> supposing the <hi>Divinity united</hi> to the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>Sun?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>In one case we may be supposed to worship a thing which is; but in the other
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:50112:246"/>
we cannot be supposed to worship that which at the same time we believe not to be.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>If it be <hi>Idolatry</hi> to worship that <hi>as God which is not God,</hi> then the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Host</hi> may be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though you suppose the bread <hi>not to be.</hi> For to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>that not to be which really is,</hi> doth no more alter the case; than to suppose <hi>that to be God which is not,</hi> for that is to suppose that <hi>not to be a Creature which is.</hi> For the <hi>worshippers</hi> of any parts of the World might profess as solemnly as you do about the Bread, that if they did believe <hi>the Sun to be a meer creature, they should abhorr the thoughts of worshipping it;</hi> but believing it either to be <hi>God</hi> it self, or at least that <hi>the Godhead is united to it;</hi> why are not they as excusable as those who declare <hi>they abhor the thoughts of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Bread? but they believe it not to be Bread, but the Body of the Son of God.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>T. G.</hi> observes, <hi>that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal term of Idolatrous worship is an undue object;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cath. no Idol. <hi>p.</hi> 328.</note> viz. <hi>a Creature instead of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but Catholicks in case of a mistake, would have no other formal object in their minds, but the Creator himself.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>As though the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> did consist in the <hi>worship</hi> of a <hi>Creature,</hi>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:50112:246"/>
knowing it to be a <hi>meer Creature.</hi> Might not the <hi>Heathens</hi> have said they had no other formal object of adoration in their minds, but <hi>God;</hi> but supposing him <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> they might worship them on his account; as well as those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> give <hi>adoration</hi> to that which appears to be <hi>meer bread?</hi> If they who worship the <hi>Sun</hi> on the account of the <hi>Divinity</hi> which is in it or united to it, be yet guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> because though on supposition the <hi>Divinity</hi> were so <hi>united</hi> the worship would be <hi>lawful,</hi> yet the <hi>supposition</hi> being <hi>false</hi> they are guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> why then should not those be equally guilty of it, who worship a <hi>Divinity</hi> as present under the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>bread,</hi> if the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> doth still remain? for then the worship however intended falls upon a <hi>meer creature,</hi> as it did in the former case.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Those who worshipped the Sun, did suppose the substance of the Sun still to remain; but Catholicks do not suppose the substance of bread to continue, but in place thereof do worship the only true and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>It is true they did suppose the <hi>substance of the Sun to remain;</hi> but they
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:50112:247"/>
did not intend to terminate their <hi>worship</hi> on that <hi>substance,</hi> but on the <hi>Divinity united</hi> to it; and to suppose <hi>that not to be bread which is really bread,</hi> doth no more excuse from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than supposing that <hi>not to be a meer creature, which really is no more.</hi> But to drive this matter home to you, I will ask a farther Question, Were those <hi>Idolaters</hi> who worshipped the <hi>parts</hi> of the world as a part of the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself; so that he is <hi>One and All?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Suppose they were.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Did not they believe there was <hi>no other substance but of God present in what they worshipped?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>And what follows?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Do you not perceive? That <hi>to suppose that not to be which really is,</hi> and that <hi>to be which is not,</hi> doth not excuse from <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I must talk a little farther with <hi>T. G.</hi> about this matter. But I have another reason yet to charge the <hi>Heathens</hi> with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> viz. <hi>that they forsook the Worship of the Creatour, and staid in the Worship of the Creature.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Do you mean that they gave him no external Worship, or that they gave him no worship at all? or do you think any that believed a God, gave him
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:50112:247"/>
no inward worship, <hi>i. e.</hi> no Reverence or esteem suitable to his Excellency?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you ask these questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Because many of the Heathens thought <hi>external Worship</hi> beneath the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Supreme God, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath fully shewed from the Testimonies of <hi>Porphyrius, Numa,</hi> the <hi>Platonists,</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>It is <hi>Idolatry</hi> to give <hi>all external Worship to his Creatures and to reserve none to himself:</hi> because some external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is due to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>If <hi>external Worship</hi> be due to God, it is not because he needs it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is fit for us his Creatures to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie our subjection to him as our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Ought not that Worship then to be so <hi>peculiar</hi> to him, as to manifest the different <hi>esteem</hi> we have of the <hi>Creatour</hi> and his <hi>Creatures?</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not then an injury to <hi>Gods honour</hi> to give that <hi>Worship</hi> which ought to be <hi>peculiar</hi> to himself, to any of his <hi>Creatures?</hi> and that which the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls <hi>Idolatry?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>But how will you know what <hi>external Acts of worship</hi> those are which are <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>God?</hi> for therein lyes the great difficulty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Either we suppose <hi>God</hi> to have revealed his will to mankind, or not.

<pb n="469" facs="tcp:50112:248"/>
us; what we find to that purpose in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>; what the sense of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> hath been concerning them in the best and purest times of it. If you can think of any better wayes than these, I pray acquaint me with them.</p>

                  <hi>and upon that account believed them to be truly and properly Gods, in whose power it was to bestow those benefits upon them, which they desired, and they were justly charged with Idolatry by the Fathers for so doing.</hi> And he observes from <hi>T.

               <p>Here are two things to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (1.) How far the <hi>Heathens</hi> did make other <hi>Gods sharers with the Supreme</hi> in the Government of the World. (2.) How far your opinion and practice differ from theirs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How far the Heathens did make other Gods <hi>sharers with the Supreme</hi> in the Government of the World. For which we are to consider a double <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> which was received among the <hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Of those who worshipped the same God under <hi>several names and titles</hi> with respect to particular powers; which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> proved from <hi>Plotinus, Plutarch, Apuleius,</hi> and your own <hi>Simon Majolus,</hi> who on this account commends the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etick Theology</hi> beyond that of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Socrates.</hi>

takes particular notice of, <hi>viz. that the same God was</hi> Jupiter <hi>above,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There was another <hi>hypothesis</hi> more general than this, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>one Supreme God and many inferiour who were imployed by him.</hi> Of which you may remember the words of <hi>Tertullian, that the greatest part asserted the Supreme Power to be in one, and the subordinate Offices to be in many.</hi> And <hi>Orosius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

but under this God they worshipped many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour and subservient Gods.</hi> In the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> under <hi>Cyprian Saturninus a Tucca</hi> (who was both a <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi>) saith, <hi>that the Heathen Idolaters did acknowledge and confess the Supreme God,</hi>

                  <hi>as to one Supreme God.</hi> Although therefore the <hi>Heathens</hi> did own and worship <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods,</hi> yet they looked on them as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> and <hi>subordinate</hi> to the <hi>Supreme,</hi> and only imployed by him in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of things under him. And as for the <hi>partners</hi> you mention, they were not such <hi>quoad plenitudinem potestatis;</hi> but only made use of in their particular Offices; you know the distinction; and it serves better here than in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I cannot but wonder, when <hi>T. G.</hi> had upbraided Dr. <hi>St.</hi> for two pages together with his <hi>Father</hi> Livy, <hi>Father</hi> Varro,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 3.6, 317.</note> 
                  <hi>Father</hi> Cicero, <hi>Father</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, <hi>Father</hi> Virgil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he should at last sink so low as to quote <hi>Father</hi> T.

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:50112:250"/>
down a hundred <hi>Father T. G.</hi>'s; and yet even this Testimony doth not prove that the <hi>Gods</hi> that were supposed to be in Heaven by their own right were <hi>supreme and independent Deities,</hi> but the <hi>Dij Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes</hi> were of a higher rank than the <hi>semidei</hi> or <hi>indigites,</hi> the one having been always in Heaven according to the <hi>Platonists</hi> supposition, the other being assumed from among men; which comes at last to the distinction of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How far your opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice do differ from theirs. And here I pray remember that I go not about to compare the <hi>Heathen Gods</hi> with <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> as to their <hi>excellencies,</hi> for the Apostle tells us, however the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, they did really <hi>sacrifice to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and not to God:</hi> but I am only to compare the Heathens <hi>notion</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and yours together. And if you do allow <hi>Gods by participation, viz.</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits assumed into such a share of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as to have the care of some things and places committed to some more than to others; and if addresses and supplications are allowed to be made to them on that account, I desire to know how the <hi>Heathens</hi> are justly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:50112:251"/>
with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and you not? Was it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to pray to <hi>Diana</hi> as an inferiour <hi>Deity</hi> which presided over hunting, and is it none to pray to S. <hi>Hubert</hi> on the like account? Was it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to pray to <hi>Vesta</hi> to preserve from the Fire, and is it none to pray to S. <hi>Agatha?</hi> If two persons in the same storm prayed as to their <hi>Tutelar Deities,</hi> the one to <hi>Neptune,</hi> the other to S. <hi>Paul;</hi> is the one guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the other not? If two women in travail prayed for help, the one to <hi>Lucina,</hi> the other to the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> is the first only guilty of <hi>Idolatry?</hi> They might be accused of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> in making a bad choice, but I do not see how the <hi>Heathens</hi> could be charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and not the other. When <hi>Saints</hi> are <hi>Canonized</hi> to be <hi>Particular Patrons</hi> of <hi>Places,</hi> as S. <hi>Rosa</hi> lately for <hi>Peru;</hi> why may not the inhabitants make particular addresses to her as their <hi>Patroness,</hi> and <hi>Tutelar Deity,</hi> as <hi>Lipsius</hi> did to the <hi>B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin?</hi> Is not this to make such a <hi>Saint</hi> a <hi>sharer in the Government</hi> of the World, as much as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did their <hi>Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Gods</hi> under <hi>one Supreme?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon <hi>T. G.</hi>'s own ground, you are as justly charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> as the <hi>Heathens</hi> were. For the <hi>Heathens</hi> did
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:50112:251"/>
not look on their <hi>Tutelar Gods</hi> as the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Givers,</hi> but as the <hi>subordinate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</hi>

with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> who owned a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God</hi> and worshipped <hi>inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> as <hi>subordinate</hi> to them, and their <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>; but the charge will return upon your selves.</p>

               <p>Will you never be satisfied? Did not <hi>T.

                  <hi>and they concurred with the vulgar in all the external practices of their Idolatry.</hi> (2.) <hi>Because though in their Schools they denied them to be Gods, yet they gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour to them as the people did.</hi>

               <p>You must excuse me Sir, I have such an imperfection in my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it will not be satisfied, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the appearance at least of Reason; which I confess I cannot yet see in this answer. For, I pray, how comes it to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> in them who give only an <hi>inferiour</hi> and <hi>relative worship,</hi> if that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be not <hi>Idolatry?</hi>

                  <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>they were not guilty of internal Idolatry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 438.</note> 
                  <hi>but of external, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the vulgar who did worship them as truely and properly Gods; and that in such a manner that they were judged to do the same thing, and therefore it was at
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:50112:252"/>
least an exteriour profession of Idolatry in them.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But you have not yet proved that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did worship many <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Gods</hi>; and I have very lately shewed the contrary from the express testimonies of the Fathers: and therefore this answer doth not reach to the case. Yet suppose, that against the general sense of understanding men, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people should take the <hi>inferiour Gods</hi> for <hi>independent and absolute</hi> Deities, is not this the case of your own Church? as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> observed, the common people take their <hi>Images</hi> for <hi>Gods,</hi> or take the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> for the <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> and pray to them accordingly, which is both <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external Idolatry</hi> in them, however <hi>T. G.</hi> and their learned men comply with them in all their <hi>external Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> are they guilty of the <hi>exteriour profession of Idolatry</hi> or not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I thought where you would be, <hi>but is it the same case of some few men complying with a common and publick custom of Idolatrous worship;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 441.</note> 
                  <hi>and of those who follow the publick profession and do the same Acts with some private men who turn them to Idolatrous worship?</hi>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But if the <hi>publick profession</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was to <hi>worship</hi> one <hi>Supreme God,</hi> as I have already proved, then the case is the very same as to the <hi>profession</hi> and <hi>practice of Idolatry;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 444.</note> which is the main thing insisted on. And the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many other circumstantial diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences will not vary the case, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the parallel. If this be all you have to add about the <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> I pray let us come to the <hi>appropriate Acts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> For since God may appropriate Acts of Worship to himself; since upon that they become due only to him; since <hi>Idolatry</hi> is giving to the Creature <hi>the worship due to God;</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> from hence proves, that they who do those <hi>Acts</hi> by way of worship to any creature must be guilty of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>

                  <hi>that God hath so tied these Acts to his own Worship, that in all cases, and upon all occasions imaginable they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incommunicable to any other, and this so fastned to them, that it cannot be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them.

               <p>I wonder to hear you talk at this rate.

What a sensless way of reasoning were this, for a man to say, that eating and drinking could not be appropriated to that act of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> in celebration of the Lords Supper, because men eat and drink upon other occasions? It is true, they do so and must do so if they would live; but what then? May not Christ
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:50112:254"/>
therefore institute a Supper of his own with such rites and solemnities belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, as may sufficiently discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it from a common eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And were it not a horrible profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to appoint such a Supper as that of our <hi>Lord</hi> is, in commemoration of of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Ignatius Loyola?</hi> I see, I must put some questions to you to make you apprehend this a little better, than I fear you do. Is not the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Eucharist an appropriate Act of Divine Worship</hi> now under the <hi>Gospel?</hi>

               <p>So I thought by your way of talking. Is it lawful to meet together at <hi>Mass,</hi> to set apart Bread and Wine, and afterwards to partake of them with a design to commemorate S. <hi>Francis</hi> and St. <hi>Rosa,</hi> by such a solemnity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I think not; because that would be a profane imitation of our <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> which was instituted by <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the commemoration of his own sufferings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But is it not lawful to eat Bread and to drink Wine together?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>But eating Bread and drinking Wine are the same <hi>Acts in substance</hi> which are used at the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> being the same when done upon a <hi>civil</hi> and a <hi>religious account,</hi> doth not take off from the <hi>appropriation</hi> of them to <hi>God</hi> when the circumstances declare it to be an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship.</hi> Therefore when a dispute arises concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of an <hi>Act,</hi> whether it be for <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> or <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is to judge of that from the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of it; if once it be found to be for <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> then comes in the consideration of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>appropriation</hi> of all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> to <hi>God</hi> alone. And by this time I hope you understand how impertinent it is to say, that if there be <hi>appropriate Acts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> they must be so in all cases and upon all accounts imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Which is as much as to say, that eating Bread and drinking Wine in a solemn manner, in a place appointed for Divine Worship, cannot be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> unless we never eat Bread, or drink Wine, but upon that occasion.</p>

               <p>To clear this matter a little more to you, you may consider two things concerning <hi>appropriate Acts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship.</hi> 1. The <hi>general prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of giving <hi>Religious Worship</hi> to any thing besides <hi>God.</hi> Which our Saviour hath delivered in those words,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> Which the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> took for their fundamental <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> and understood it in this sense, That all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> were to be performed to <hi>God</hi> alone. And therefore of what kind soever the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:50112:256"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> were, whether we were tied to perform them to <hi>God</hi> or not, if they were looked on as <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> given to any <hi>Creature,</hi> they utterly and peremptorily refused to do them, and rather chose to suffer Martyrdom; as was plain in the case of burning <hi>Incense</hi> to the <hi>Emperours Image.</hi> No <hi>Christians</hi> did then think that we were tied to offer incense to God, and yet they esteemed it <hi>Idolatry</hi> to offer incense to any <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> therefore it is not necessary to the nature of Idolatry, that the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> be such <hi>as we are tied to give unto God;</hi> it being sufficient that it is an act of <hi>Religious Worship</hi>; and the giving of any such to a creature is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and without this, it is impossible to defend the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> which all <hi>Christians</hi> are bound to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>particular Acts</hi> of <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> though they are always unlawful to be given to any thing besides <hi>God,</hi> yet we are not tyed after the <hi>same manner</hi> to perform them to him. For (1.) Some <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> are natural and always equally agreeing to the <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> such as <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Invocation; Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> on his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Providence; Thanksgiving</hi> for <hi>Mercies</hi> received; and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:50112:256"/>
all internal <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> which result from the relation we stand in to <hi>God,</hi> and the apprehensions we ought to have of his <hi>Perfections;</hi> as <hi>Fear</hi> from his <hi>Power, Submission</hi> from his <hi>Providence, Faith</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> in him from his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Wisdom, Love</hi> from his <hi>Goodness,</hi> &amp;c. All these are <hi>necessary Acts</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> (2.) Some <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> are <hi>appropriated</hi> to him <hi>when they are due,</hi> but they are <hi>not alwayes due:</hi> such as <hi>making vows,</hi> and <hi>swearing by his name.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are not tied to perform these at any certain times, yet whenever they are done, they must be done to <hi>God</hi> alone. (3.) Some <hi>acts</hi> are not <hi>necessary</hi> to be done to <hi>God</hi> at all; and yet it is <hi>unlawful</hi> to do them to any other. And of this kind are the <hi>offering Sacrifices and burning Incense;</hi> which were strictly required under the <hi>Law,</hi> but that dispensation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring after the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> the obligation to those <hi>Acts</hi> was wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and yet it was <hi>Idolatry</hi> to use them to any thing <hi>besides God;</hi> because they were <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> and therefore if to be performed at all, they were so due to him that they could not without <hi>Idolatry</hi> be applied to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him. And thus, I hope, I have a
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:50112:257"/>
little helped your understanding about these <hi>appropriate Acts of Divine Worship.</hi>

               <p>All this I yield. But that which I insist upon, is that <hi>fundamental precept</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> as declared by Christ, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shalt thou serve.</hi>

                  <hi>But do you think that Christ hath made a re-establishment of those Acts in the new Law which were before peculiar to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 454.</note> 
                  <hi>as Sacrifice, Incense,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for then Christians will be as much bound by this precept to give them to God, as not to give them to any other. But if they are not re-established, how doth it follow, that because they were appropriated to God by the Law, therefore now that Law is taken away, they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to any other besides God?</hi>

               <p>I do not say that Christ did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a re-establishment of those <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> which were peculiar to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi>; but I do say, that <hi>Christ</hi> by this Precept as explained by himself, doth
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:50112:257"/>
make it utterly unlawful to perform any act of <hi>Religious Worship to any but God alone.</hi> And if this be all you have to prove the <hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>Equivocations, False Suppositions,</hi> and <hi>Self-contradictions</hi> in Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Discourse of <hi>appropriate Acts of Divine Worship,</hi> it had been more for <hi>T.

                  <hi>the giving them to any besides himself will not be to give to the creature the worship due to God, unless it be done with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:50112:258"/>
to give them to a creature as esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of Divine Honour. For that is the definition of real Idolatry.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then the <hi>Mandarins</hi> in <hi>China</hi> who performed all external acts of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Tutelar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> secretly directing their intention to a <hi>Crucifix</hi> were not guilty of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> For they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form those <hi>acts,</hi> with an intention to give the worship to the <hi>Tutelar Spirits as esteemed worthy of Divine Honour.</hi> Then the <hi>Thurificati</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> who through fear offered <hi>incense,</hi> could not be charged with <hi>Idolatry;</hi> nor <hi>Marcellinus</hi> though he sacrificed in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Vesta,</hi> when he only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> But did not <hi>T.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 467.</note> Why so I pray? Is it not, because <hi>Gods incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable excellency</hi> requires an <hi>external worship</hi> peculiar to it self? And if so, is it not to give the worship due to <hi>God</hi> to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:50112:258"/>
something else, to apply those acts which are peculiar to himself, to any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him? This debate in truth comes to this point at last, whether there ought to be any such thing as a peculiar <hi>external worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> or not? For, if external worship be due to him, and such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be due to him alone for his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable excellencie, then the giving external worship to a creature, must be giving to it what is due only to God. And to resolve the nature of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>inward intention,</hi> is all one as if one should say, that Adultery were to lie with another mans Wife with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cuckold her Husband; but if a man did it out of love to her Person, it were no adultery. Why is there not an external act of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as well as of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, theft, murder and the like? Where doth the Scripture give the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the nature of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is to be taken from the <hi>inward intention,</hi> when the <hi>Law</hi> is express against the outward action: and all men are charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> who were guilty of the external acts, without running into the thoughts and designs of their hearts? Nay, your own Authors cannot deny that there is an <hi>external Idolatry</hi> as well as <hi>internal;</hi>
                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:50112:259"/>
and where the outward acts are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous we ought to presume there was an implicit and indirect intention; and no more is necessary to make an act Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous than a voluntary inclination to do it. This is therefore a meer subterfuge, and can never satisfie a mans Conscience, nor excuse the Roman Church from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>

               <p>I grant it, but that only shews what <hi>practical judgement</hi> doth precede a voluntary act of Idolatry: as it is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from an involuntary compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In this later case, persons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty as to the external act; as a man that takes away his Neighbours goods out of fear of his own life is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of theft, although the fear he was in may lessen the wilfulness of it: so in Idolatry when committed through the power of a sudden passion is a sin of the same kind with other Idolatry, but not so wilful and deliberate a sin. But in case of <hi>wilful Idolatry,</hi> there must be a practical judgement determining the will to the act of Idolatry. If you ask me what that judgement is, whether true, or erroneous; I say it is an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement, for it determines the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divine worship to that which doth not deserve it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 459.</note> Not as though Idolatry implied <hi>the believing that to be truly and

properly God which is not;</hi> (which <hi>T. G.</hi> would infer from thence) but it implies only the practical judgement determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the will to give Divine Worship to that which really deserves it not. As for instance; suppose an Image of our Lady to stand before two persons; the one declares against the <hi>Worship</hi> of it, though he may be forced to do it, he is guilty of real but involuntary Idolatry (taking involuntary as to the free incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Will) the other readily and spontaneously falls down upon his knees before it, and says his prayers to the <hi>Image</hi> as gravely and devoutly as if the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> were present; both these do concur in the same external act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but from a very different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the one judges it fit to comply for his own safety; the other judges the thing fit to be done: but it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that he judges the Image to be the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> her self, but that he ought to give such <hi>worship</hi> to her Image; so that judging divine worship to belong to that which doth not really deserve it, is all the erroneous judgement necessary to a wilful act of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and if this be any kindness to <hi>T.

                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:50112:261"/>
doth suppose; and I say, it requires no more than an error in the practical judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, determining the will to give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship to that which doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it.

                  <hi>T.

               <p>Those are not <hi>Lugo</hi>'s words, but <hi>licet non possit offerri nisi soli Deo;</hi> yet I shall not insist upon that.

proper to <hi>Latria,</hi> or the worship pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to God?

                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 217.</note> For his words are, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that sacrifice is so peculiar to God that it ought not to be offered to any else; but not as an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Latria</hi> saith <hi>Cardinal Lugo,</hi> for there is <hi>no act of adoration that is so;</hi> but upon another account as it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Gods absolute Dominion over us as to life and death, and that we ought to lay down our own lives when he calls for them</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which is to make <hi>sacrifice</hi> a <hi>significant ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony peculiar to God</hi> expressing his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,</hi> but not an <hi>immediate act of worship</hi> peculiar to him: <hi>for of that kind,</hi> he saith, <hi>there is none.</hi> And therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, your Church hath <hi>no
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:50112:262"/>
one external act of Divine Worship so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God, that it may not be offered but to him alone.</hi> And from hence it appears that <hi>Lugo</hi> did not take <hi>adoration</hi> meerly for <hi>that act of Religious Worship which is performed by the motion of the Body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 468.</note> as <hi>T.

                  <hi>and therefore there ought to be some peculiar external acts appropriated to the worship of God, as most agreeable to his incommunicable excellency?</hi> I could not but rejoyce to see <hi>T. G.</hi> own so reasonable a principle, and I desire no other, as to the meer light of Nature to prove your Idolatry. For, if this be a principle of <hi>Natural Religion;</hi> then Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry even by the light of Nature lies in applying appropriate acts of Divine Worship to any but to God himself; for since his excellency is incommunicable, and the submission we owe to God pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, and that submission ought to be expressed by external acts, all which <hi>T. G.</hi> grants; then all those who do use
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:50112:263"/>
such acts to any besides God, are guilty of giving the worship due to God unto a Creature. For God hath not only a right to our <hi>inward submission,</hi> but to the <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of it, which cannot be done but by <hi>external acts:</hi> and which is observable as to this matter; the honour of God as to his incommunicable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies with respect to mankind as a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, doth not lie in the bare <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> but in the external performance of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> to him. For, if it be necessary that <hi>Gods Authority</hi> be owned in the world, it is necessary it be done by <hi>visible acts of Worship;</hi> which ought to be so appropriated to him, that any one who discerns them may see the difference put between <hi>God</hi> and all his <hi>Creatures.</hi> For herein lies the manifestation of that inward sense we have of <hi>Gods incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable excellencies,</hi> when we set apart times, and places, and offices of <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> by which we declare our submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to God, as our Creator and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the World. And the confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this distance between <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Creatures</hi> is the great sin of Idolatry: from whence <hi>Aquinas</hi> and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be a <hi>sin of the highest nature,</hi>

and unlawful actions. If a man kills another by chance, or out of malice; if a man takes away another mans goods with his consent or without; it is the same act as to its substance; and what discrimination can be made but by the circumstances? and therefore I cannot but wonder to hear you object against this, or think it any repugnancy to <hi>Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating acts of Divine Worship to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>

                  <hi>First, Acts take their nature from the formal reason or account upon which they tend to their objects, and from thence they become either civil or religious, though they may receive another denomination from the circumstances which do accompany them.</hi>

               <p>I pray consider; the thing we enquire after, is the difference between <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Worship;</hi> which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> saith is to be taken from the <hi>circumstances, no,</hi> say you, <hi>it must be taken from the formal reason, or account on which they tend to their objects:</hi> but the <hi>formal reason</hi> of <hi>acts</hi> being secret and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, the question is whether that be
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:50112:266"/>
sufficient to put a <hi>discrimination</hi> between <hi>Acts</hi> of an external and visible nature, as those of <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious worship</hi> are. I will make this plain to you by a noted instance: While the <hi>Christian Emperors</hi> required no more than meer <hi>civil worship,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> made no scruple of giving it to them in the same postures which were used in <hi>divine worship;</hi> but when they suspected that <hi>divine worship</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they utterly refused it: here we have the <hi>same acts</hi> as to the <hi>substance</hi> of them in both cases; and yet the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> could easily discern which did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>civil</hi> and which to <hi>religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>; was it from such a <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of the <hi>persons</hi> which none could know but the doers? or else from the <hi>circumstances</hi> which did make it appear that more than <hi>civil worship</hi> was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? And yet this <hi>worship</hi> which the <hi>Heathens</hi> gave to their <hi>Emperours</hi> was only an <hi>inferiour sort of divine worship,</hi> and so understood by the general consent of the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves; from whence we gather (1.) That the <hi>discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of acts of <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> do not depend upon <hi>the intention</hi> of the <hi>Doer,</hi> but the <hi>outward circumstances</hi> of them. For, if it had depended on the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:50112:267"/>
inward intention of the person, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> might have saved their lives and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours by doing the <hi>external acts</hi> with a <hi>different intention;</hi> and that which was <hi>divine worship</hi> in him that designed it for such, were but <hi>civil worship</hi> in him that intended no more. (2.) That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of an <hi>inferiour sort of divine worship</hi> doth not make it <hi>lawful.</hi> For it could be no otherwise understood by the <hi>Christians,</hi> and yet they refused it as <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worship.</hi>

               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>If the circumstances of time, and place, and such like do so restrain and limit the signification of external acts, that it is easie to discern one worship from another, how can you make it out that the people did not give religious worship to</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>when in a most solemn act of devotion, it is said, that the people worshipped the Lord and the King? where we see the same act at the same time, a time of solemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion given to God and the King, and the People never charged for giving religious worship to the King.</hi>

                  <hi>T.G.</hi> need not have gone so far back for such an argument. For the <hi>Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains</hi> in a sacred place and at a solemn time of <hi>devotion,</hi> do bow three times to the King, when they enter into the Pulpit; and
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:50112:267"/>
yet who is there imagines they give him <hi>divine worship?</hi> It is not therefore the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of time and place alone,</hi> which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> makes to discriminate <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious worship;</hi> but the <hi>concurrence</hi> of all circumstances together. If I bowed to a Friend at <hi>Church,</hi> is any man so senseless to take this for <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Where there is an antecedent ground for <hi>civil worship</hi> and <hi>respect,</hi> which is well known and understood among men, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like <hi>Idolatry,</hi> although we do use the same external acts towards men which we use towards God himself. As among the <hi>Israelites</hi> no man doubted that their <hi>bowing to the King</hi> was upon a <hi>quite different account,</hi> from their <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God;</hi> although they <hi>bowed to the King</hi> in a <hi>place</hi> dedicated to <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> And where the <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> is so well understood to be of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature from that of <hi>religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> that very <hi>reason</hi> makes a <hi>discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> besides the <hi>circumstances</hi> of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place.</hi> Which I shall make appear from the case of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian;</hi> whose <hi>bowing</hi> in the <hi>house of Rimmon</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free from <hi>Idolatry</hi> because of the known custom of paying <hi>civil respect</hi> every where else to his <hi>Prince</hi> in that

               <p>And what then I beseech you? <hi>Monsieur Daillé</hi> discourses against those who would use all the external Acts of adoration of the Host which others did, but with a different intention, and hoped this would excuse them from <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Now in this case he saith, that <hi>signs of Religious Worship, as uncovering the Head, kneeling or prostrating the body at the sound of a little bell, and such other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the plain and ordinary signs of the adoration of the Host; and are so appointed by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and so understood by those who generally practise it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> saith he, <hi>those who do use these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signs are to be understood to give ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Host.</hi> From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:50112:272"/>
that men cannot comply with others in the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Host</hi> without <hi>hypocrisie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry:</hi> which it was <hi>Mons. Daillé</hi>'s design to prove. But what is all this to the proving that <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour worship</hi> is not <hi>Idolatry?</hi> we desire that these signs of Worship may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted according to the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>publick practice of those who use them</hi>; by which we say, it is as truly <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> as the <hi>Nations</hi> used, which all <hi>Christians</hi> do charge with <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But if your meaning be, that your actions are to be interpreted in your own sense, it will come to this at last, that You are not guilty of Idolatry, because you <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> you are not guilty of it; And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever condemned themselves for it by <hi>publick declarations?</hi> unless it were when they repented of it as a great sin, which I do not find you are yet willing to do.

               <p>No. But <hi>T. G.</hi> means, <hi>that there is now no Law of God binding men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these external Acts of worship, and therefore it is in the Power of the Church to appoint these as well as other Rites and Ceremonies,</hi>

               <p>If this be his meaning, it is very ill expressed.

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Did that Law cease at the coming of Christ, that those Acts were to be used only to <hi>God</hi> as tokens of that inward submission which is proper to him?</p>

               <p>No; that doth never cease.</p>

               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose <hi>T. G.</hi>'s meaning is, that the <hi>appropriation</hi> before extended to them as <hi>tokens of inferiour respect

and veneration,</hi> which Law ceasing, it is now lawful to use them in that sense.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then these <hi>Acts</hi> under the Law, were forbidden in that sense, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>profession</hi> or <hi>declaration</hi> were made by those that used them. As suppose that the Jews had invocated <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in their <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Synagogues</hi> and worshipped <hi>Images</hi> just as you do, and made the same professions of their meanings and intentions as your <hi>Church</hi> doth; this had been <hi>Idolatry</hi> in them, but not in you.

            <sp>
               <speaker>R. P.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose it must be.</p>

               <speaker>P. D.</speaker>
               <p>Then <hi>inferiour Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> was once Idolatry, but it ceased to be so at the coming of Christ. Is not this a rare invention? And by this means Christ destroyed <hi>Idolatry,</hi> not by <hi>rooting it out,</hi> but by making that <hi>not to be Idolatry</hi> which was so before: and so he might take away all other sins by making those <hi>breaches</hi> of the other nine Commandments not to be sins to <hi>Christians</hi> which were so to the <hi>Jews.</hi> But we have not only the express words of Christ, making all <hi>Religious worship</hi> of a <hi>Creature</hi> unlawful, against this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi>

who charged the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> without regarding this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who were not under the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> and the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> which judged this <hi>inferiour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> still.

               <p>Our Saviour's design was to deter men from assuming or affecting such titles of excellency, superiority, or Authority over others in teaching, as seemed to encroach too much on the divine perfections: but this holds much more against the pretence of <hi>infallibility</hi> in any person, than for the lawfulness of <hi>inferiour Religious worship.</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> never forbids the common use of those titles among men, when they have no respect to <hi>Divine Matters</hi>; no more than he doth the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Civil worship</hi> in
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:50112:275"/>
men towards <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>Parents;</hi> and thus far the parallel is good, as to <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi>: but as Christ doth forbid the <hi>affectation</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> though of an <hi>inferiour sort</hi> under the titles of <hi>Rabbi, Father,</hi> and <hi>Master</hi>; so he doth likewise all <hi>inferiour sort of Religious worship</hi> when he saith, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> And therefore the <hi>equivocation</hi> which lyes in mens power to determine, is not that of the <hi>degrees of Religious worship,</hi> but of the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious worship.</hi> But if it be lawful to apply the signification of external <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> to <hi>higher</hi> or <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degrees,</hi> why may ye not do the same as to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as well as <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Was it not wisely done? and then to talk a great deal about the remainder of the Doctours Discourse, whether sacrifice of it self doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie absolute worship more than adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without taking notice that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> joyned them together, though the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> separates them. And <hi>T. G.</hi> gives no manner of reason why the antecedent consent of mankind as to one of these should not prevail in your <hi>Church</hi> as well as in the other:
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:50112:276"/>
which is the main ground according to <hi>T. G.</hi> why <hi>sacrifice ought still to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the peculiar Worship of God.</hi>

                  <hi>What advantage doth the Doctor get, by insisting so much on that question, why Sacrifice may not be offered to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as well as other external Acts of Worship,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dial. p.</hi> 501.</note> 
                  <hi>for he can only infer from thence that in such case the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>might possibly have no external act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship appropriated to God, if she have none but Sacrifice; but whilest she hath no such custom</hi> de facto <hi>as offering Sacrifice to Saints and Images, 'tis manifest he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accuse them in that point of having no external Act of Worship proper to God, or of giving it to any besides him.</hi>

               <p>It was to very good purpose that he insisted on that question, on these accounts. 1. Because either it is in the power of the Church to appoint appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Acts of Divine Worship, or it is not. If it be in the Churches Power, then <hi>sacrifice</hi> may be as lawfully offered to the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> if the <hi>Church</hi> think fit, as prayers and invocations, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>general consent of mankind in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:50112:276"/>
Sacrifice to God.</hi> If not, then there is some <hi>antecedent reason</hi> why some external Acts of Worship are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the <hi>absolute worship of God</hi>; if so, then all such Acts are <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated</hi> where the <hi>same reason</hi> holds; whether it be <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> or the <hi>consent of mankind</hi> in general, or of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church:</hi> and consequently, though the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may reserve <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God as <hi>peculiar</hi> to him, yet they may give other acts of <hi>Divine worship</hi> to his <hi>Creatures,</hi> which have the same reason to be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated</hi> which <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it self hath. 2. Because though in words they seem to <hi>appropriate Sacrifice to God</hi> as a <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar act of external worship,</hi> yet they do in effect overthrow it by these two as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions. (1.) That its peculiarity is not as being an <hi>Act of Adoration,</hi> but upon another account as a <hi>significant Ceremony</hi> of our <hi>total subjection</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And this was that which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> charged your Divines with, that they reserve <hi>no one Act of external adoration</hi> as proper to God; and that they say,<note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 204.</note> that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> doth not <hi>naturally</hi> signifie any worship of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 226.</note> but only by the
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:50112:277"/>
imposition of men. So that your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines confess there is no <hi>natural Act of Divine worship, no external Act</hi> of <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> which is reserved as peculiar to <hi>God;</hi> but only an outward Ceremony which doth not <hi>of it self</hi> signifie the <hi>worship of God,</hi> nor our subjection to him. But solemn Prayers and Praises do <hi>of themselves</hi> signifie our <hi>dependence</hi> on <hi>God,</hi> and therefore have an <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reason</hi> to the <hi>consent</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> why they should be <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> (2.) That even <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> is allowed by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be offered for the honour of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> saith, is joyning Creatures together with God in the honour of <hi>Sacrifice:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 220, 222.</note> and if <hi>Sacrifice</hi> be so appropriate to the honour of God that it cannot signifie any thing else, then it is nonsense to sacrifice to God for the honour of another; if it may signifie any thing else, and be so used in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> then you do not reserve so much as sacrifice for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate sign of the absolute Worship of God.</p>

such trivial kind of arguing as this to pass for solid reasoning: and it must be a hard world when a man of the Doctours abilities must be forced to feign that he doth not know how the same Sacrifice may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for sins and a thanksgiving for benefits, especially the Sacrifice of the Altar being the same with that of the Cross, in which all the differences of the legal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were fulfilled.</hi>

                  <hi>Is it not for the honour of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to praise God for him? and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing being the offer of a present in token of gratitude, doth that diminish or add to the Act of thanksgiving?

               <p>It is one thing to make the <hi>Graces</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> an <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and another to offer up a <hi>Sacrifice for the honour of the Saints,</hi> as it is expressed in the <hi>Offertory.</hi> In the former case there is no question but
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:50112:278"/>
the <hi>Honour</hi> is <hi>designed</hi> wholly to <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Giver</hi> of those <hi>Graces,</hi> although a <hi>consequential Honour</hi> doth redound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the <hi>Saints</hi> themselves; but in the latter case the <hi>intended and designed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the very Act it self</hi> is declared to be to the <hi>Saints</hi> as well as to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. If a Courtier gives the King so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn thanks for great kindness shewed to one of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> the honour of the <hi>Action</hi> belongs wholly to the <hi>King,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>occasionally</hi> and <hi>consequentially</hi> it redound to the reputation of the Person for whom it is done: but if a Courtier on New years day should make a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> upon his <hi>Knees,</hi> and <hi>say,</hi> I offer this New years gift to your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in honour of your Majesty and of the Groom of your Stole,</hi> or <hi>Chamberlain of your Houshold,</hi> &amp;c. how do you think this would be taken at Court? And yet this is just the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Offertory</hi> in your <hi>Missal. We make this Oblation to thee O Holy Trinity, and for the honour of the Blessed Virgin and all Saints;</hi> can any one say that this is not the <hi>designed and intended honour</hi> which belongs to the <hi>Act</hi> it self, and not meerly that which is <hi>occasional</hi> and <hi>consequential?</hi> If those
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:50112:279"/>
who offered <hi>Cakes</hi> to the <hi>B.

Besides, you are guilty of a greater ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity, for those might be only <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical oblations,</hi> but in your <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> you pretend to make a <hi>present</hi> you say to <hi>God;</hi> but what is it? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than <hi>his own Son;</hi> if your doctrine be true. And for what end? <hi>to be a propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick and the dead.</hi> And is this indeed <hi>the present</hi> you make to Almighty God in honour of his Saints? I cannot with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience think of the absurdities which follow from hence. For how came you to make a <hi>Present to God</hi> of his <hi>own Son?</hi> When we make a <hi>Present</hi> to any one, it is understood to be of something in our power to bestow, and which we are willing to part with, for his sake to whom we offer it. Do you indeed in this sense make a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> to the <hi>Father?</hi> Have you the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>bestowing him</hi> in your hands? And are you willing
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:50112:279"/>
                  <hi>to part with your whole right and interest in him?</hi> You are excellent Christians the mean while. Nay, no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was truly and properly offered by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherein he did not abandon his right in that which was Sacrificed. And therefore you see upon what terms, you make such a <hi>present</hi> to God by a <hi>proper Sacrifice</hi> of his <hi>Son</hi> to him. But suppose the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> were to be made a <hi>true and proper Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>sins</hi> on the <hi>Altar,</hi> How comes it into your hands to offer him up to the Father, since the great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>propitiation</hi> was not to be offered by any ordinary <hi>Priests,</hi> but by the <hi>High-Priest</hi> himself, <hi>who was to carry the Blood into the Holy of Holies, and there to make intercession for the People?</hi> Are you the <hi>High-Priests</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to offer unto <hi>God</hi> the great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Atonement?</hi> Is not the <hi>great High-Priest of our profession entred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vail, and is there making interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the <hi>Cross?</hi> What need then of your Offering him up again for <hi>propitiation,</hi> who Offered himself once on the Cross for <hi>a full, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and sufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world?</hi>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:50112:280"/>
We have all the reason in the World to commemorate with great thankfulness and devotion that invaluable Sacrifice of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and if you will call the <hi>Whole Eucharistical Office</hi> a <hi>commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sacrifice</hi> as the Ancients did, I shall never quarrel with you about it. But how the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the Mass comes to be <hi>propitiatory</hi> as the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the <hi>Cross</hi> was, I understand not; nor how it should be the same with the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and yet of so much less value than it, the one being said by you to be <hi>infinite</hi> and the other <hi>finite;</hi> nor how the <hi>destruction</hi> of his <hi>Sacramental</hi> and of his <hi>Natural Being</hi> should be the same thing; nor how this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> should be <hi>propitiatory</hi> only for one <hi>sort</hi> of <hi>sins</hi> and not for another; nor how the Son of God can be made a <hi>true and proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sin</hi> under the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> nor, what <hi>consumptive change</hi> that is in him, which according to your selves is necessary to make him such a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Is he <hi>slain</hi> again in the <hi>Mass?</hi> If he be, I can tell who is the <hi>Judas</hi> that betrays him, and who are the <hi>Jews</hi> that Crucifie him. If not, how comes a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> without
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:50112:280"/>
                  <hi>shedding of Blood?</hi> If the <hi>consumptive change</hi> be only in the <hi>Elements,</hi> then the <hi>Elements</hi> are <hi>Sacrificed,</hi> and not <hi>Christ.</hi> If it be only a <hi>Sacramental change,</hi> what is that to a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>propitiation?</hi> And suppose all the other absurdities to be removed, and that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass</hi> is a <hi>true, real, proper</hi> and <hi>propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice of the Son of God Body and Soul upon the Altar,</hi> yet how at last comes this to be <hi>giving God thanks for the Graces of his Saints?</hi> I thought such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> had been much rather for the <hi>expiation</hi> of their <hi>sins.</hi>

               <p>I pray remember, it is an <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and visible Sacrifice</hi> which you contend for, and now tell me where it is in your Church. Doth it lye in the <hi>mimical ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> at the <hi>Altar</hi> in <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Christ on the <hi>Cross?</hi> If that be it, the necessary <hi>consumption</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> will be no comfortable doctrine to the Priest. Doth it lye in the <hi>consecration</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> which are <hi>visible?</hi> But you say, <hi>the essence of the Sacrifice consists in the change</hi>; and we can see no <hi>visible change</hi> made in them, and therefore there is no <hi>external and visible Sacrifice.</hi> Besides, if the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> did lye in the <hi>change of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements after Consecration into the Body of Christ,</hi> then the <hi>Elements</hi> are the thing <hi>sacrificed</hi> and not the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> for the <hi>destructive change</hi> is as to the <hi>elements,</hi> and not as to the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Or doth it lye in the <hi>swallowing down, and consumption of the species after Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Priest?</hi> But here likewise the <hi>change</hi> is in the <hi>accidents</hi> and not in the <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> which remains <hi>whole and
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:50112:283"/>
entire</hi> though the <hi>species</hi> be <hi>consumed</hi>; and I think there is some difference between <hi>changing ones seat</hi> and being <hi>sacrificed.</hi> For all that the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>changed</hi> in, is only its being no longer under the <hi>species,</hi> but <hi>T. G.</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose will allow it to be <hi>whole and entire</hi> still. Doth it then lye <hi>in pronouncing the words of consecration upon which the Body of Christ is under the species of Bread, and the Blood under that of Wine, and so separated from the Body?</hi> But this can least of all be, since <hi>T. G.</hi> assures us that <hi>whole Christ</hi> is under the <hi>Bread</hi> as well as under the <hi>Wine</hi>; and so there cannot be so much as a moment of <hi>real separation</hi> between them; and we know how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for other purposes the doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy</hi> is. Tell me then where is your <hi>external and visible Sacrifice</hi> which you boast so much of; since according to your own principles there is nothing that belongs to the <hi>essence</hi> of a <hi>sacrifice</hi> is <hi>external and visible,</hi> and consequently your own Church labours under the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect T.

               <p>I see now you are wheeling about to your first Post, and therefore it is time to give you a space of breathing. Your great business is to set us at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among our selves, but you have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto failed in your attempts, and I hope will do.

                  <hi>It is therefore enough, that the Eucharist is the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross, as the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross is represented, renewed, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and restored by it, and as every repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation is said to be the same thing with that which it representeth.</hi>

               <p>I will tell you the mysterie of this business, and so put an end to this long Conference. It was the ancient custom of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> as well as others for the Communicants to make an <hi>oblation</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> of which they were afterwards to partake. This I prove from the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi> of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> published by <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>

                  <hi>Bona</hi> have proved beyond all dispute, that the ancient <hi>Latin Church</hi> did use <hi>common</hi> and <hi>leavened Bread</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> that was offered by the people till a thousand years after Christ. But then the doctrine of Transubstantiation coming into the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> it was no longer thought fit that the <hi>Bread</hi> which was to be turned into the <hi>Son of God</hi> should be made after a <hi>common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> or with the <hi>unsanctified hands</hi> of the <hi>Laity,</hi> but by those who did attend upon the Altar: remembring what the good
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:50112:288"/>
woman told <hi>Gregory</hi> I. <hi>that she wondred that the Bread which she made with her own hands should be called the Body of Jesus Christ;</hi>

From hence the dispute began between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> about <hi>unleavened bread</hi>; and from henceforward the <hi>custom</hi> of <hi>oblations</hi> for the <hi>service</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and is only kept up on some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular solemnities, as <hi>Canonization</hi> of <hi>Saints, Inauguration</hi> of <hi>Princes, Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Bishops, Marriages</hi> and <hi>Funerals;</hi> however the same form of words conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues still in the <hi>Offices,</hi> as if the <hi>oblations</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> were still made by the <hi>People;</hi>

Consecration, Commemoration, Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, Participation</hi> did all belong to the <hi>sacrifice.</hi> But since you restrain the <hi>true and proper sacrifice</hi> to the <hi>oblation</hi> of the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Priest,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had reason to say, that the <hi>sacrifice</hi> among you belongs to the <hi>Priests,</hi> and is not an <hi>external Act of Worship</hi> common to all.
