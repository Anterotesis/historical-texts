         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſeeke the like, within ſo narrow and ſtreite a compaſſe.
For heerein is orderly declared, who were The firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerours
of the world ſince the time of the flood: by
what waies from age to age the ſpicerie, drugs, and riches
of the Eaſt were conueied into The Weſt: what were the
cauſes of the alterations of thoſe courſes, as namely the
changes of Empires and gouernments: The ceaſing of
all trafficke for many yeeres by The Gothes inuaſion of
the Romane Empire: The riſing vp of The Mahumetane
ſect; with their ouerrunning of Afrike and Spaine: The
renewing againe, after many yeeres diſturbance, of the
trafficke and entercourſe of The Eaſt Indies; firſt by the
Califas of the aforeſaid ſect: and eftſoones by The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
Ienowais and Florentines. Then followeth the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Ceuta in Barbarie by <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt king of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
of that name in the yeere of our Lord 1415. whoſe

<hi>Philippa,</hi> daughter of <hi>Iohn</hi> of Gante, and ſiſter to <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth, king of England) was the firſt beginner of all
the Portugall diſcoueries, and continued the ſame for the
ſpace of fortie and three yeeres euen to his dying day.
<pb facs="tcp:5982:3"/>
By whoſe encouragement the kings of Portugall found
out with much patience and conſtancie the laſt way of
the bringing the Spicerie into Europe by The Cape of
Buona Sperança; and for theſe hundred yeeres paſt haue
become the chiefe Lords of the riches of the Orient By
emulation of which their good endeuours, The Antiles
and The weſt Indies began to be diſcouered by The kings

Now touching the tranſlation, it may pleaſe you ſir, to
be aduertiſed that it was firſt done into our language by
ſome honeſt and well affected marchant of our nation,
whoſe name by no meanes I could attaine vnto, and
that as it ſeemeth many yeeres ago. For it hath lien by
me aboue theſe twelue yeeres. In all which ſpace though
I haue made much inquirie, and ſent to Lisbon, where
it ſeemeth it was printed, yet to this day I could neuer
obtaine the originall copie; whereby I might reforme
the manifold errours of the tranſlator. For whereas a
good tranſlator ought to be well acquainted with the
proprietie of the tongue out of which, and of that into
which he tranſlateth, and thirdly with the ſubiect or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it ſelfe: I found this tranſlator very defectiue in all
three; eſpecially in the laſt. For the ſupplying of whoſe
defects I had none other remedie, but to haue recourſe
vnto the originall hiſtories, (which as it appeereth are
very many, and many of them exceeding rare and hard
to come by) out of which the authour himſelfe drew the
greateſt part of this diſcourſe. And in very deede it coſt
me more trauaile to ſearch out the grounds thereof, and
to annexe the marginall quotations vnto the worke, then
the tranſlation of many ſuch bookes would haue put me
vnto. Of which quotations there is yet a farther vſe; to
wit, that ſuch as haue leaſure ſufficient, and are deſirous to
reade theſe things more at large, (for breuitie oftentimes
breedeth obſcuritie) may fully ſatisfie their deſires by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
recourſe by the helpe therof to the pure fountaines,
out of which thoſe waters which are drawne are for the
moſt part moſt ſweete and holſome. Now if any man
ſhall maruel, that in theſe <hi>Diſcoueries</hi> of <hi>The World</hi> for the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pace almoſt of fower thouſand yeeres here ſet downe,
our nation is ſcarce fower times mentioned: Hee is to
vnderſtand, that when this authour ended this diſcourſe,
<pb facs="tcp:5982:4"/>
(which was about the yeere of Grace 1555.) there was
little extant of our mens trauailes. And for ought I can
ſee, there had no great matter yet come to light, if my
ſelfe had not vndertaken that heauie burden, being neuer
therein entertained to any purpoſe, vntill I had recourſe
vnto your ſelfe, by whoſe ſpeciall fauour and bountifull
patronage I haue been often much encouraged, and as it
were reuiued. Which trauailes of our men, becauſe as
yet they be not come to ripenes, and haue been made for
the moſt part to places firſt diſcouered by others; when
they ſhall come to more perfection, and become more
profitable to the aduenturers, will then be more fit to be
reduced into briefe epitomes, by my ſelfe or ſome other
endued with an honeſt zeale of the honour of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
In the meane ſeaſon nothing doubting of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
acceptation of this my labour, I humbly beſeech
the authour of all goodnes to repleniſh and enrich you
with his beſt bleſſings, long to protect and preſerue your
Honour to the profitable ſeruice of her Maieſtie,
and to the common benefit and good
of the Realme. From London

that the captaine of Maluco with onely his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſoldiers ſhould haue the victorie againſt ſo many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all together. For ſometimes it happeneth that ſome
of the captaines of Maluco with many extraordinarie
ſoldiers beſides their ordinarie, yea and with the aide of
al the Kings and Lords of Maluco in their fauour and aide
went againſt one King onely of them, and came backe
againe with loſſe. So there may be reckoned three notable
things done in India, I ſay of qualitie: (but of more quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and importance there haue been others:) which were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the taking of Muar by <hi>Emmanuel Falcon,</hi> and the winning
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Bitam by <hi>Peter Maſcarenas,</hi> and this, whereof we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
treate. For all theſe three deedes ſeemed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be atchieued, conſidering the ſmall quantitie
of ſoldiers which the captaines had in giuing the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
againſt ſo many; with the order and maner by them
ordained how and which waies to obtaine their purpoſe
as well by their enimies as by themſelues. And they could
not be atchieued otherwiſe but by vſing a meane and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not thought of at the firſt by the Portugals, nor yet
euer ſuſpected by their enimies. And, beſides this, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and fower of his brethren were all ſlaine in the kings
ſeruice: And he now being the laſt of his linage, caried
with him into Maluco woorth ten thouſand cruſadoes,
which he ſpent not in idlenes, nor yet in play, but onely in
bringing of many kings and innumerable townes vnto
our holy faith, and in the preſeruing of Maluco, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his power and ſtrength that all the cloues might
<pb facs="tcp:5982:6"/>
come vnto the hands of the kings highnes: which with
Maluco yeelded vnto him euery yeere fiue hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
cruſadoes; being all to his great preiudice, let, and
hinderance. For if he had gathered cloues for himſelfe,
as the captaines of Maluco haue done and doe, then he
had come home very rich. But when he came home into
Portugall in great hope (ſuch is the ſimplicitie of the
beſt natures) to be rewarded for his good ſeruice,<note place="margin">Good ſeruice full ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</note> and to
be more fauoured and honored, then if he had brought
home with him an hundred thouſand cruſadoes, he was
greatly deceiued. For he found neither fauour, nor yet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
but onely among the poore and miſerable, to wit, in
an hoſpitall: where he was kept ſeuenteene yeeres vntill
the hower of his death; and there he had allowed vnto
him his winding ſheete to burie him in: and the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of the Couent prepared for his buriall as for a
poore courtier caſt off by all men, leauing himſelfe indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in two thouſand cruſadoes, whereof part came out of
India, and part thereof many of his friends had lent him
to maintaine him in the hoſpitall: for in all theſe ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeeres he had not of his highnes for to helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with ſo much as one riall of plate, nor yet I of the
bookes which I deliuered receiued any thing to diſcharge
his will with. Yet for all this, euen as vpon the proſperitie
of his victories he neuer made any boaſt, ſo likewiſe in his
aduerſities his great ſtomacke did nothing abate his hart.
As there are good proofes that with ſo many and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
diſgraces as he ſuffered, he neuer vnto the hower
of his death left off to raiſe and to augment the yeerely
rent vnto a Counto:<note place="margin">A Counto is 50000. cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes.</note> which ſome made ſtrange and would
not giue eare vnto: So that euen as he was extreme pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the performance of his ſeruice, ſo he was the like
in the things ſounding vnto the perfecting of the ſame,
which was the cauſe that he was brought vnto the ſtate
that he died in. For he could not ſee the qualitie of the
<pb facs="tcp:5982:7"/>
time, but onely thoſe of his great ſeruice, by reaſon of the
great charges that it ſtood him in. And his ſaying was,
That he was borne, not for to ſay that his conſtellation
was in the wars victorious, but in the ouercomming of
kings by the arte of warfare, readines in reſoluing, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in conſeruing, and great loialtie and patience with
many ſeruices vnto his king and maſter. In which of all
theſe he had moſt contentation it cannot eaſily be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
Wherefore your noble Grace may ſee, that this
treatie and the others were made with ſighes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which his inferiour will might haue raiſed vp in him
againſt his ſuperiour reaſon. Neither was he willing to
take for his remedie that which that great Turke <hi>Zelim</hi>
ſonne to the great <hi>Mahumet</hi> did, (for he tooke Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople
and died in Rome) who vſed to make himſelfe
drunke, becauſe he would not remember the great eſtate
which he loſt: nor yet woulde he giue eare vnto thoſe
things which many of his friends would tell him, wiſhing
he would ſettle his mind out of the kingdome: (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he ſhould neuer be able to liue:) whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that in this point he would rather be compared
vnto the great <hi>Timocles</hi> the Athenian,<note place="margin">Or rather The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles.</note> then to be like the
excellent Romane <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> Which is a goodly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a true and faithfull Portugall. (Though it were not
ſo as I doe ſay, yet I doe heare, that the hoſpitals be full of
the moſt faithfull ſubiects to their prince and countrey.)
Wherefore by all reaſon this treatie ought to be of your
Grace fauoured, ſetting apart all ouerſights, if there be
any, in this worke, of the author: I being not able to
attaine vnto the vnderſtanding of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

in a ſhip from this countrey, comming by the north and by

of <hi>China,</hi> for that they from 20. 30. and 40. degrees vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
haue ſtrong ſhips and clynchers, that can well brooke

kéepe the water, and another kinde the land. For my part I
thinke that theſe be they, which breake the ſerpents egges,

Crocodiles: which in times paſt by report were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted,

which flie into the mouth of the Crocodile, and picke out
the filthines which is betwéene his téeth, and in his iawes,

flieth away without harme; yet there come by and by other

            <p>In the ſame riuer there are alſo many beaſtes like vnto

               <note place="margin">Plinius lib. 2. cap. 67.</note> which is now called <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> departed from

them, holding them as priſoners, and commanding her yoong
ones to call their maſters vntill they be taken. If the théeues
be many, or the wilde beaſtes of ſo much ſtrength, that they
dare not meddle with them, then they goe vnto the houſe of

light vpon ſome trée, from whence they could not remooue.
And as the <hi>Negros</hi> went vp the trée they ſhould finde waxe

The time of <hi>Alexander Magnus,</hi> as appiereth by the ages

And becauſe water was ſcant that way, they vſed to carrie it

            <p>After that the <hi>Romanes</hi> had gotten the moſt part of the

But then came the <hi>Gothes, Moores,</hi> and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

the <hi>Vandales</hi> came out of <hi>Spaine</hi> and conquered <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the yeere 450. the king called <hi>Atila</hi> deſtroied many

            <p>And after this came the <hi>Lombards</hi> into <hi>Italie,</hi> namely in

So that each Prince vſed a cuſtome to augment the

            <p>About this time alſo the Iſland of <hi>Madera</hi> was diſcouered

               <p>In the yéere 1529. or 1530. one <hi>Melchior de Sofa Tauarez</hi>

They were not well receiued by <hi>Diego de Almagro,</hi>

fire and aſhes, which aſhes make excellent good lie. They
open the earth from the roote and ſcrape it, and the iuice
which commeth out is like a ſirrupe. If you do féeth it, it will
become honie; if you purifie it it will be ſugar. Alſo you may
make wine and vineger thereof. It beareth the <hi>Coco.</hi> The
rinde roſted and cruſhed vpon ſores and hurts healeth and
cureth. The iuice of the tops and roots mingled with incenſe
are good againſt poyſon, and the biting of a viper. For theſe
manifold benefits it is the moſt profitable trée knowne to
growe in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>Alſo there be there certaine ſmall birds named <hi>Vicmalim.</hi>
Their bill is ſmall and long. They liue of the dewe, and the
iuice of flowers and roſes. Their feathers be verie ſmall and
of diuers colours. They be greatly eſtéemed to worke golde
with. They die or ſléepe euerie yéere in the moneth of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
fitting vpon a little bough in a warme and cloſe place:
they reuiue or wake againe in the moneth of Aprill after that
the flowers be ſprung,<note place="margin">The reuiued birds.</note> and therefore they call them the reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
birds.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe there be ſnakes in theſe parts, which ſound as
though they had bels when they créepe. There be other which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5982:49"/>
engender at the mouth, euen as they report of the viper.
There be hogges which haue a nauell on the ridge of their
backs, which aſſoone as they be killed and cut out, will by
and by corrupt and ſtinke.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe there be certaine fiſhes which make a noyſe
like vnto hogs,<note place="margin">Snorting fiſhes.</note> and will ſnort, for which cauſe they be named
ſnorters.</p>
               <p>In the yéere 1538. and 1539. after that <hi>Diego de Almagro</hi>
was beheaded,<note place="margin">Gomara hiſt. gen. lib. 5. cap. 35.</note> the Marques <hi>Francis Piſarro</hi> was not idle.
For he ſent ſtraight one <hi>Peter de Baldiuia</hi> with a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of men to diſcouer and conquere the countrey of <hi>Chili.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chili.</note>
He was wel receiued of thoſe of the countrey, but afterwards
they roſe againſt him and would haue killed him by treaſon.
Yet for all the warre that he had with them, he diſcouered
much land, and the coaſt of the ſea toward the ſoutheaſt, till
he came into 40. degrées and more in latitude. While he was
in theſe diſcoueries he heard newes of a king called <hi>Leucen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golma,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This might be the temple in the lake of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticaca.</note> which commonly brought to the field two hundred
thouſand fighting men againſt another king his neighbour,
and that this <hi>Leucengolma</hi> had an Iſland, and a temple
therein with two thouſand prieſtes:<note place="margin">Cieça cap. 103.</note> and that beyond them
were the <hi>Amazones,</hi> whoſe Quéene was called <hi>Guanomilla,</hi>
that is to ſay, <hi>The goldeu heauen.</hi> But as yet there are none
of theſe things diſcouered. About this time <hi>Gomez de Alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado</hi>
went to conquer the prouince of <hi>Guanuco:</hi> and <hi>Francis
de Chauez</hi> went to ſubdue the <hi>Conchincos,</hi> which troubled
the towne of <hi>Truxillo,</hi> and the countreyes adioyning. <hi>Peter
de Vergara</hi> went to the <hi>Bracamores,</hi> a people dwelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the north from <hi>Quito. Iohn Perez de Vergara</hi> went
againſt the <hi>Ciaciapoians: Alfonſus de Mercadiglio</hi> went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Mulubamba. Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Gonzaluo Piſarros</hi> went to
ſubdue <hi>Collao,</hi> a countrey very rich in gold. <hi>Peter de Candia</hi>
went to the lower part of <hi>Collao. Peranzures</hi> alſo went to
conquer the ſaid countrey. And thus the <hi>Spanyards</hi> diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelues, and conquered aboue ſeuen hundred leagues
of countrey in a very ſhort ſpace, though not without great
trauailes and loſſe of men.</p>
               <p>The countreyes of <hi>Braſill</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> ſtand eaſt and weſt
almoſt 800. leagues diſtant. The néereſt is from the Cape of
<hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> vnto the hauen of <hi>Truxillo:</hi> for they ſtand
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5982:50"/>
both almoſt in one parallele and latitude. And the fartheſt is
950. leagues, reckoning from the riuer of <hi>Peru</hi> to the ſtreits
of <hi>Magellan,</hi> which places lie directly north &amp; ſouth, through
which countrey paſſe certaine mountaines named the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The mountaines of Andes.</note> which diuide <hi>Braſill</hi> from the empire of the <hi>Ingas.</hi> After
this maner the mountaines of <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Imaus</hi> diuide <hi>Aſia</hi>
into two parts: which mountaines begin in 36. and 37. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
of northerly latitude at the end of the <hi>Mediterran</hi> ſea
ouer againſt the Iſles of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> running ſtill

mountaines of <hi>Atlas</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> diuide the tawnie <hi>Moores</hi>
from the blacke <hi>Moores</hi> which haue friſled haire, beginning
at mount <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es</hi> about the deſert of <hi>Barca,</hi> and running along

               </p>
               <p>The mountains of the <hi>Andes</hi> be high, ragged, and in ſome
places barren without trées or graſſe, whereon it raineth and
ſnoweth moſt commonly. Vpon them are windes and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
blaſtes; there is likewiſe ſuch ſcarcitie of wood, that they
make fire of turffes,<note place="margin">Earth of diuers colours good to dy withall.</note> as they do in Flanders. In ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of theſe mountaines and countries the earth is of diuers
colours, as blacke, white, red, gréene, blew, yellow, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
wherewith they die colours without any other mixture.
From the bottomes of theſe mountaines ſpring many ſmall
and great riuers, principally from the eaſt ſide, as appéereth
by the riuers of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> of <hi>Plata,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others which runne through the countrey of <hi>Braſil,</hi> being
larger then thoſe of <hi>Peru,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Caſtilia del oro.</hi> There
grow on theſe mountaines many turneps, rapes, and other
ſuch like rootes and herbes. One there is like vnto <hi>Aipo</hi> or
Rue which beareth a yellow flower, and healeth all kinde of
rotten ſores, and if you apply it vnto whole and cleane fleſh it
will eate it vnto the bone: ſo that it is good for the vnſound
and naught for the whole.</p>
               <p>They ſay there be in theſe mountains tigers, lions, beares,
woolues, wilde cats, foxes, Dantes, Ounces, hogs and déere:
birdes as well rauenous as others, and the moſt part of them
are blacke, as vnder the North both beaſts &amp; birdes be white.
Alſo there be great &amp; terrible ſnakes which deſtroied a whole
armie of the <hi>Ingas</hi> paſſing that way, yet they ſay that an olde
woman did inchant them in ſuch ſort that they became ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5982:50"/>
gentle, that a man might ſit vpon one of them. The countrey
of <hi>Peru</hi> adioining vnto the mountaines of <hi>Andes</hi> weſtward
toward the ſea, and containing 15. or 20. leagues in bredth is
all of very hot ſand, yet freſh, bringing foorth many good trées
and fruites becauſe it is well watered: where there growe
abundance of flags, ruſhes, herbes, and trées ſo ſlender and
looſe, that laying your hands vpon them the leaues will fall
off. And among theſe herbes and freſh flowers the men and
women liue and abide without any houſes or bedding, euen
as the cattell doe in the fields: and ſome of them haue tailes.
They be groſſe, and weare long haire. They haue no beards,
yet haue they diuers languages.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which liue on the tops of theſe mountains of <hi>Andes</hi>
betwéene the cold and the heate for the moſt part be blinde of
one eie, and ſome altogether blinde, and ſcarce you ſhall finde
two men of them together, but one of them is halfe blinde.
Alſo there groweth in theſe fields, notwithſtanding the great
heate of the ſand good Maiz, and Potatos, and an herbe which
they name <hi>Coca,</hi> which they carrie continually in their
mouthes (as in the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> they vſe another herbe named
<hi>Betele)</hi> which alſo (they ſay) ſatiſfieth both hunger and thirſt.<note place="margin">An herbe named Coca which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth hunger and thirſt.</note>
Alſo there are other kindes of graines and rootes whereon
they féede. Moreouer there is plentie of wheate, barly, millet,
vines, and fruitful trées, which are brought out of <hi>Spaine</hi> and
planted there. For all theſe things prooue well in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
becauſe it is ſo commodiouſly watered.</p>
               <p>Alſo they ſow much cotton wooll, which of nature is white,
red, blacke, gréene, yellow, orange tawnie, and of diuers other
colours.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe they affirme, that from <hi>Tumbez</hi> ſouthward it
doth neither raine, thunder, nor lighten, for the ſpace of fiue
hundred leagues of land: but at ſome times there falleth ſome
little ſhower. Alſo it is reported, that from <hi>Tumbez</hi> to <hi>Chili</hi>
there breede no peacocks, hennes, cocks, nor eagles, falcons,
haukes, kites, nor any other kinde of rauening fowles, and
yet there are of them in all other regions and countreies: but
there are many duckes; géeſe, herous, pigeons, partriges,
quailes, and many other kindes of birdes. There are alſo a
certaine kinde of fowle like vnto a ducke which hath no
wings to flie withall, but it hath fine thinne feathers which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5982:51"/>
all the body. Likewiſe there are bitters that make war
with the ſeale or ſea wolfe: for finding them out of the water
they will labour to picke out their eies, that they may not ſée
to get to the water againe, and then they doe kill them. They
ſay it is a pleaſant ſight to behold the fight betwéene the ſaid
bitters and ſeales. With the beards of theſe ſeales men make
cleane their téeth, becauſe they be wholeſome for the toothach.
There are certaine beaſtes which thoſe of the countrey call
<hi>Xacos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xacos a kinde of great ſheepe that men ride vpon.</note> and the <hi>Spanyards</hi> ſhéepe becauſe they beare wooll like
vnto a ſhéepe, but are made much like vnto a déere, hauing a
a ſaddle backe like vnto a camell. They will carrie the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
of 100. weight. The <hi>Spanyards</hi> ride vpon them, and
when they be wearie they will turne their heads backward,
and void out of their mouthes a woonderful ſtinking water.</p>
               <p>From the riuer of <hi>Plata</hi> and <hi>Lima</hi> ſouthward there bréede
no crocodiles nor lizards, no ſnakes, nor any kinde of vene
mous vermine, but great ſtore of good fiſhes bréede in thoſe
riuers. On the coaſt of <hi>Saint Michael</hi> in The South ſea there
are many rocks of ſalt couered with egges. On the point of
<hi>Saint Helena</hi> are certaine Well ſprings which caſt foorth a
liquor, that ſerueth in ſtead of pitch and tarre. They ſay that
in <hi>Chili</hi> there is a fountaine, the water whereof will conuert
wood into ſtone. In the hauen of <hi>Truxillo</hi> there is a lake of
freſh water, and the bottome thereof is of good hard ſalt. In
the <hi>Andes</hi> beyond <hi>Xauxa</hi> there is a riuer of freſh water, in the
bottome whereof there lieth white ſalt. Alſo they affirme by
the report of thoſe of the countrey, that there haue dwelt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
in <hi>Peru,</hi> of whoſe ſtatures they found in <hi>Porto viejo,</hi> and
in the hauen of <hi>Truxillo,</hi> bones and iawes with téeth, which
were thrée and fower fingers long.</p>
               <p>In the yeere 1540. the captaine <hi>Ferdinando Alorchon</hi>
went by the commandement of the Viceroy Don <hi>Antonio de

               <p>In this yeere 1540. <hi>Gonſaluo Piſarro</hi> went out of the citie
of <hi>Quito</hi> to diſcouer the countrey of <hi>Canell</hi> or Cinamome, a
thing of great fame in that countrey. He had with him two

                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:5982:51"/>
where there happened a great earthquake with raine and
lightning, which ſunke 70. houſes. They paſſed ouer cold and
ſnowie hils, where they found many <hi>Indians</hi> frozen to death,
maruelling much of the great ſnowe that they found vnder
the Equinoctiall line. From hence they went to a prouince
called <hi>Cumaco,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cumaco.</note> where they tarried two monethes becauſe it
rained continually. And beyond they ſawe the Cinamome-trées,
<note place="margin">Cinamom trees</note> which be very great, the leaues thereof reſembling bay

               </p>
               <p>From hence they went to the prouince and citie of <hi>Coca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coca.</note>
where they reſted fifty daies. From that place forwards they
trauailed along by a riuers ſide being 60. leagues long, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding of any bridge, nor yet any foorde to paſſe ouer to
the other ſide. They found one place of this riuer, where it
had a fall of 200. fathoms déepe,<note place="margin">El pongo. a mighty fall of a riuer.</note> where the water made
ſuch a noiſe, that it would make a man almoſt deafe to ſtand
by it. And not far beneath this fall, they ſay they found a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
of ſtone very ſmooth, of two hundred foote broad, and the
riuer runneth by: and there they made a bridge to paſſe ouer
on the other ſide,<note place="margin">Guema.</note> where they went to a countrey called <hi>Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
which was ſo poore, that they could get nothing to eate
but onely fruits and herbes. From that place forward they
found a people of ſome reaſon, wearing certaine clothing
made of cotton wooll, where they made a brigandine, &amp; there
they found alſo certaine Canoas, wherein they put their ſicke
men, and their treaſure and beſt apparell, giuing the charge
of them to one <hi>Francis de Orellana:</hi> and <hi>Gonſaluo Pizarro</hi>
went by land with the reſt of the companie along by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
ſide, and at night went into the boates, and they trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in this order two hundred leagues as it appeereth. When
<hi>Pizarro</hi> came to the place where he thought to finde the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine
and Canoas, and could haue no ſight of them nor yet
heare of them, he thought himſelfe out of all hope, becauſe he
was in a ſtrange countrey without victuales, clothing, or any
thing elſe: wherefore they were faine to eate their horſes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5982:52"/>
yea and dogs alſo, becauſe the countrey was poore and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,

taking a good hart to themſelues they went on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in their iourney, trauailing continually 18. monethes
and it is reported, that they went almoſt 5. hundred leagues,
wherein they did neither ſée ſunne nor any thing elſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might be comforted, wherefore of two hundred men
which went foorth at the firſt, there returned not backe paſt
ten vnto <hi>Quito,</hi> and theſe ſo weake, ragged, and diſfigured
that they knew them not. <hi>Orellana</hi> went fiue hundred or ſixe
hundred leagues downe the riuer, ſéeing diuers countreyes
and people on both ſides thereof, among whom he affirmed
ſome to be <hi>Amazones.</hi> He came into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

They required peace with the people and ſome victuals,
