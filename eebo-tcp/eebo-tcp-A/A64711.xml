         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>BISHOP OF ARMAGHS DIRECTION.</head>
            <head type="sub">To satisfie your demands both concerning the Liturgy, and Episcopall government.</head>
            <p n="1">1. FIrst for the Book of Common Prayers, it may be alledged that God himselfe appointed in the Law a set forme of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. ver. 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>David</hi> appointed set Psalmes to be sung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on special occasions, as the title of them sheweth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> appointed a set forme of Prayers to be used by the Priests at a solemne Fast, <hi>Joel</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Christ not only commanded us to pray after such a manner, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9. but to use a set form of words, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. and the 2. <hi>When you pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The spirit of God is no more restrained by using
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36061:3"/>
a set form of Prayers, then by singing set Hymes or Psalms in meeter, which yet the adversaries of our Common prayers practise in their assemblies.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Of all Prayers, premeditated are the best, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 2. and of premeditated prayers, those which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by publick authority, are to be preferred before those which are to be uttered by any private spirit.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All the Churches in the Christian world, in the first and best times, had their set form of Lyturgy, whereof most are extant in the Writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at this day.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Let our Service-book be compared to the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> or any other Lyturgy prescribed in any of these former Churches, and it will appear to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader, that it is more exact and compleat than any of them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Our Service-book was penned and allowed of, not only by Learned Doctors, but glorious Martyrs, who sealed the Truth of the reformed Religion with their blood.</p>
            <p>Yet it cannot be denyed that there are <hi>quaedam in pulchro corpore,</hi> and it were to be wished, so it were to be done without much noise.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Calender in part might be reformed, and the Lessons taken out of the Apocrypha might be struck out, and other Lessons taken out of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture appointed to be read in places of them; for besides that there is no necessity in reading any of the Apocrypha, there are some of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters repugnant to the Doctrine of the holy Scripture, as namely in some Chapters of <hi>Tobit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That in the Psalms, Epistles, Gospels, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36061:3"/>
all sentences alledged out of the holy Scripture, the last translation of King <hi>James</hi> his Bible may be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; for in the former there be many passagaes not agreeing to the Original, as might be proved by many sentences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That in the Rubrick, wherein of late the word <hi>Priest</hi> hath been put instead of <hi>Minister,</hi> it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, and the word <hi>Minister</hi> restored, which is less offensive, and more agreeable to the language of all the reformed Churches, and likewise some clauses which seem surreptitiously to have crept into it, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged, as namely after the Communion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Every Parishioner shall communicate, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and shall after receive the Sacrament, and other Rights ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order in the book appointed, which words can carry no good sense in a Protestant Cure, nor those added after private Baptism: That it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Gods Word, that Children being baptised have all things necessary for salvation, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly saved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That in the Hymes instead of the Song of the three Children, some other were placed out of the Canonical Scripture, and that a fitter Psalm were chosen at the Churching of women for these verses:</p>
            <p>He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: and the Sunne shall not burn thee by day, nor the Moon by night: seem not to be pertinent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That in the Prayers and Collects some expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions bettered, as where it is said, Almighty God which only worketh great things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let thy mercy lose them for the, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from all fornication and all other deadly sins,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36061:4"/>
as if all sinnes were not deadly.</p>
            <p>And that among all the changes and chances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the visitation of the sick, I absolve thee from all thy sins, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. That in the singing of Psalms, either of hymns, rymes, or other superfluous words, as I have said, and for why: and homely phrases, as thou shalt feed them with brown bread: and take hand out of thy lap, and give thy foes a rap, and mend this geere, and the like, may be corrected, or at least, a better translation of the Psalms in meeter appointed in place of the old.</p>
            <p>For Episcopal governmen, tit may be alledged that in the old Law, the Priests were above the Levites.</p>
            <p>That in the Law the Apostles were above the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Disciples.</p>
            <p>That in the subscription of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, which are part of the Canonical Scriptures:</p>
            <p>It is said that <hi>Timotheus</hi> ordained the first Bishop of the Church of the Christians.</p>
            <p>That Episcopal ordination and jurisdiction hath express warrant in holy Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>As namely <hi>Titus</hi> the 1. and the 5. <hi>For this cause left I thee in</hi> Creet, <hi>that thou shouldest set in order things that are wanting, and ordain Presbyters,</hi> that is, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in every City, as the first of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the 5. 22. <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man;</hi> and verse 19. <hi>Against a Presbyter or Minister receive not an accusation but under two or three witnesses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Angels to whom the Epistles were endorsed, two or three of the Apocalyps, are by the unanimous consent of all the best Interpreters, both ancient and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36061:4"/>
later, expounded to be the Bishops of these Cities. <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and other Ecclesiastical Writers affirm, none contradicting them, that the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves chose <hi>James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and that in all the Apostolick See there succeeded Bishops, which continued in all the Christian world, and no other goverement heard of in the Churches for 1500 years and more, than by Bishops, and the <hi>Canons</hi> both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and provincial consisted of Bishops.</p>
            <p>That so many Acts of Parliament and Laws of the Kingdome, and Statutes of the Colledges of both Universities, have relation to Bishops.</p>
            <p>That the removing of them, especially there having been no other Government ever setled in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, will breed an infinite confusion, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the Church; yet it will be wished that in some things our Government might be reduced to the constitution and practise of the Primitive Church, especially in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Bishops did ordinarily and constantly preach, either in the Metropolitan Churches, or in the Parochial Churches in the Visitations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they might not ordain any Ministers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of three or four at the least grave learned Presbyters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That they might not suspend any Minister <hi>ab officio &amp; beneficio,</hi> at their pleasures by their sole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not but for such crimes only, as the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lawes of this Kingdome appointed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That none might be excommunicated but by the Bishop himself, with the consent of the Pastor in those Parishes the delinquent dwelleth, and that for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36061:5"/>
heynous and scandalous crimes joyned with obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and wilfull contempt of the Churches authority; and that for non-appearance upon ordinations, some lesser punishment might be inflicted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Bishops might not demand benevolence from the Clergy, nor exact allowance for their diet in their visitations, nor suffer their servants to exact un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Fees at Ordinations and Constitutions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That Bishops and Officials might be subjected to the censure of provincial Synods and Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</p>
