         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yea, and beſides theſe, an infinit ſort of others there are, who be diuerſly caried (a thing not vnmete to be thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony

ſome liuing at eaſe, and in prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: ſome wyth payne vſing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie: ſome delighting in one thing, ſome in an other: euery one following, as his diſpoſition is, the vaine marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of this brickle worlde. Hence it is, that the moſte famouſe Philoſopher <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> compared the lyfe of man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a marte, or fayre, as in the which ſome are buſie, ſome ydle, ſome byers, ſome ſellers, ſome lookers &amp; gazers on.

For, vnto theſe, there is (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed place in heauen, wherein they ſhall lyue in blyſſe for euer: vnto the others, remayneth (ſaith Chriſt) the ſaluation of theire Soules, and they

are thoſe (O moſte happie men!) that ſhall haue our ſauiour to be their aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and Patrone, he it is, that before his father will acknowledge, receiue, and rewarde them. Yet all are not (O right ſacred Queene) to be accounted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, which talke of religion, and in whoſe mouthes onely and lyppes the name of the Lorde is, all are not true confeſſours which can and doe abyde long impriſonment, all are not godlye Martyrs which ſuffer death, yea though they dye vnder colour, and in pretence of defending the true fayth. For, many there are, whome the aduerſarye har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth, as the <hi>Arrianes,</hi> the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes,</hi> wyth others, many there be that dye in blindneſſe, that are ſeduced, and that defend in a maner meere heathines. Of theſe it is, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth: <hi>Quae eſt ista dementia, vt cum male viuitis, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronum facta faciatis, &amp; cum iure punimim, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam Martyrum requiratis?

For, there be ſome, I woulde there were not many, who vnder the name of deuocion doe vpholde ſuperſtition, and by the colour of godlineſſe and pietie, do pamper vp blindeneſſe and Idolatrie. The proofe whereof (to the inwarde ſorowe of any chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hart) we may in theſe our dayes beholde, and ſee. For, to defende the pryde of one man, to maintayne the pompe of one prelate, (Lorde) what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and how many be moued, and ſet on? how many be egged againſt Chriſt and his goſpell? howe many be ſtyrred vp againſt their Prince, their friendes, and their countrey? how many are bent againſt the lawes of God, of man, and of nature? neyther yet is this, ſo much to be maruayled at.

darkneſſe, good dealings will differ from deceyt, holyneſſe doth hate vngodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, true pietie ſhall euer deteſt blinde Idolatrie, to be briefe, heauen is enemie vnto hell.

Hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes from my childhood deteſted this way, which to doe well, we muſt tearme the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and cleanſing of Chriſtianitye, from vnprofitable cloddes, from wéedes and bryars, wherewith the houſe of God was in a maner ouergrowne, hauing oft heare in talke (as to many can witneſſe) reſiſted the ſame, hauing paſſed ouer the Seas, moued with a vayne zeale, to chunne it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing at the length by tranſlations, &amp; toyes wrytten againſt it, I returned priuilie (as
<pb facs="tcp:1904:20"/>
occaſion ſerued me) into Englande againe of that minde to depart hence as ſoone, and as ſecretly as I coulde. In the meane tyme I was aprehended, and ſo committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Being then there, and looking for ſome extreme kinde of dealing, which yet I ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle feared, as were the puniſhment neuer ſo harde, were it neuer ſo great, I was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea, verye willing felt I my ſelfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it. But in ſteade of extremity, (it is beſt to confeſſe the troth) I founde much clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, I founde in thoſe, whome before I lytle regarded, great wiſedome, good learning, much grauitie. Which thing, as I did at the firſt in a maner vnwillinglie (ſo rooted was the diſeaſe) conſider, ſo in time, how I know not, I began ſomewhat better to lyke it. So that oftentimes weying the iudgement of the learned men that talked with mée, to be ſhort, waying all, and indifferentlye wyth my ſelfe, I was diuerſelye minded, a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile it was, that one mynde, in one bodie ſhoulde be ſo wauering, my thought was mooued, my hart was in a maner amazed, it made me to thinke vpon the eſtate of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> who forſaking the <hi>Manichees</hi> ſtood<note place="margin">Li. confeſ. 6.</note> at a ſtay, ſomewhat doubting which way to

And what folowed? anone I was minded to examine better, and with good héede to conſider (which thing hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervnto I might not away with) the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ſuch as before, I miſlyked, deteſted, abhorred.

<pb facs="tcp:1904:29"/>
the eſtate of Chriſt his Church ſhoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye. This is the Popes owne reaſon, let him ſée vnto it. Aſke of them what <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Siſinnius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the twelfth of that name were. They were Popes of Rome, the one was an heretike, the ſeconde was a wicked man, and the thirde was a monſter and a very Epicure. <hi>Liberius</hi> likewiſe was an horible heretike, an <hi>Arrian,</hi> &amp; yet B. of <hi>Rome.</hi> I report of them as I finde it in the bookes written by the Popes owne friends.

            <p>But ſhall we nowe ſée what authoritie they haue, for reaſon (wée perceyue) they haue none, and who the chiefeſt champions be that defende this primacie? you may not thinke but that there are many of them, yet what they are, that is to be conſidered. They be no Apoſtles, nor yet diſciples of Chriſt, they bée the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelues, their Cardinals, their Biſhops, their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, their dearlings, their hirelings, they be thoſe whoſe necks were vnder the yoke, either therevnto allured through gifts, faire promiſes and flatterie, or forced throughe

feare, or through ouermuch ſimplicitie blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſeduced, who ſo drewe forth and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the pompous chariot of iniquitie. And that I ſée me not to vtter vntruth, that the thing may appeare, they were <hi>Stephanus, Iulius, Pelagius, Symmachus,</hi> with ſuch like, all being biſhops of the Sée of <hi>Rome.</hi> The caſe in controuerſie is their owne, they maye not bee their owne iudges, in that their owne lawe is againſt them.

And could the Pope except he were his owne iudge, maintaine his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie? No. And therefore being better adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they make this law, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> may iudge all, but he may be adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of none.

be contented to heare. I will be briefe, I wil not be partiall. To begin I néede not with the primitiue eſtate of Chriſt his Churche, wherein we can finde no ſuch primacie, no ſuperiority amongſt the Apoſtles, who then all hauing receyued the holye ghoſt alike did preache the Goſpell, and ſo faithfully did ſet forth the truth, without pride, without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the higheſt roome, or once mention of any ſupreme heade to be had or exerciſed among them. Let the Popes owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities preuayle, let his euidences be ſeene, are not the wordes thereof theſe? Although <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were preferred by<note place="margin">Clomens.</note> our Sauiour in a maner aboue the reſt, yet claymed not they any glorie, or title of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie: and ſhal then the Pope claime that, which <hi>Peter</hi> neyther would nor could not? In the time firſt of <hi>Cyprian</hi> we reade, that certaine lewde Prieſts being worthily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Biſhops of <hi>Aphrica,</hi> ranne to <hi>Rome,</hi> that by the Biſhop there, they might haue the matter farther diſcuſſed. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> findeth great fault with the hearing of them, and writeth thereof vnto <hi>Lucius</hi> then biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying that vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry biſhop a portion of Chriſtes flock is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb facs="tcp:1904:32"/>
who ſhall render accordingly an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the ſame, and that therefore theſe men ought to be tried, as in dede they were in <hi>Aphrica,</hi> and that by and vnder their owne biſhops: he writeth likewiſe at large concerning the ſame, and much reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it vnto <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Now what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or what grounde of ſupremacie, a fewe diſobedient and conuict Prieſtes coulde pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe vnto the Sée of <hi>Rome,</hi> iudging vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, I ſée not. But if they be either ſ ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or ſ arrogant, as to frame vppon theſe runnagates, their right, and vſurped title, let them then, and wyth good indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie conſider, how <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> their Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> being excommunicated, and yet touching no matter of faith, did appeale (for ſo they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues name him) vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Here we finde another Pope, and vnto whome their Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath appealed. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> it was he, &amp; not <hi>Silueſter,</hi> it was the Emperour, and not the biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that made lawes in defence of the Chriſtians, it was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror that condemned the writings of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> it was he that called from baniſhment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1904:32"/>
               <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> and it was onely he that then made an edict againſt heretikes. But if they will haue it that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did ordeine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the chiefe, then let them goe forward in their hiſtorie, wherein they ſhall finde, how at that time this voyce was hearde, <hi>hodie venenum eccleſiae est immiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, <hi>nowe doth poyſon enter into the Church.</hi>
               </hi> And that this voyce was true, you ſhall well proue, if you examine throughlye the whole doings of <hi>Silueſters</hi> ſucceſſours. For (O Lord) what crueltie was amongſt them! what ambition! what ſymonie! what diſobedience! what hereſie was amongſt them! Come wée then vnto the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinianus</hi> his time. For concerning <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> and <hi>Anacletus,</hi> if the decrées in their names ſet forth, be theirs, (as in déede they ſeme not to be) they were biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore is their authoritie contrarie vnto the ſcripture, in aduauncing themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, nothing worthie of anye reaſonable man, or of anye indifferent Chriſtian to bée eſtéemen. And before we ſpeake of <hi>Iuſtinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> you muſt vnderſtande that there were in his time, and vnder him, among others, fiue eſpeciall Cities, that is <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:1904:35"/>
by the iudgement of the Prince, of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and of the Laitie, &amp; that for good cauſes. But <hi>Phocas</hi> (they ſaye, marke well when<note place="margin">Anno do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. 604.</note> their kingdom began) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all Churches ſhould be obedient vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romain church.

For <hi>Bonifaciꝰ</hi> the fourth was glad to aſke leaue of <hi>Phocas</hi> that he might tranſpoſe the temple <hi>Pantheon,</hi> to be the Church of our Ladie, and of all Sainctes. <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the fift, coulde not without the licence of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, not ſo much as be ſuffered to take the tiles from <hi>Romulus</hi> temple, to couer S. <hi>Peter</hi> his Church. Neither was this in the time when the Church was perſecuted, it was ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and twentie yeres after Chriſt, it was when all Chriſtendome (as they ſay) obeyed the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> But what obedience was giuen him, by his obedience vnto the Emperour, it maye appeare. For if it were not lawful for him without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours leaue, to medle with the tiles or temporall goods of one Church, then it was leſſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1904:35"/>
for him to haue to doe, as he now clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole temporalities of all the Churches in Chriſtendom. If he might not doe ſo litle a thing without the conſent of the Emperour, much leſſe might hée doe greater thinges, much leſſe lawfull it was for him to depoſe Chriſtian Princes, and to tread vnder his féete Kings and Emperors. Let here indifferencie take place, if wée be wiſe, we wil wey theſe things without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie. Neyther may I here omit <hi>Paſchalis</hi> which was choſen to the Biſhopricke of <hi>Rome</hi> in the yeare of our Lorde. 817. Who for that he was not elected by the authoritie of the Emperour, was faine to ſende vnto <hi>Lewys</hi> named for his clemencie <hi>Pius,</hi> then being Emperour, to declare in whome the fault was, and that it was long of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Clergie that he was ſo elected, adding further that he was choſen againſt his will. With this ſatiſfaction <hi>Lewys</hi> was pleaſed, and therevppon he wrote vnto the people and Clergie that they ſhoulde kéepe the inſtitutions and decrées of their aunceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and that they ſhoulde not offende the imperiall Maieſtie againe. This is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that what ſhould we néede any more?
<pb facs="tcp:1904:36"/>
and yet ſéeing I am entred into the hiſtorye, I will alledge what <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fourth did, in acknowledging his duetie vnto the Emperor. He being choſe biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the conſent of the people and the Clergy, would in no wiſe take vpon him that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, vntill the ſayd <hi>Lewys</hi> had confirmed his election. Hath then the Emperour no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with the choſing of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> who is ſo fonde as to defend ſuch abſurditie? is not this playne? is not this true? is not this in their owne hiſtorie? was not <hi>Benedictus</hi> the thirde, confirmed Biſhop by <hi>Lewys</hi> the ſecond? was not <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the firſt, confirmed by the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror? &amp; that it ſhould be ſo, was it not the order alwayes, the lawe, and the cuſtome? Concerning their Counſels, in ſpeaking of one, we ſhall eaſily bewray the weakeneſſe of the others, and that if ſpecially we touche any of their chiefe. Their Councell holden at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> they do in althings ſo reuerence, receiue, and ſo beleue, as they doe the foure holye Goſpels of our Sauiour Chriſt. If then we can prooue errors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, of neceſſity muſt they acknowledge their Counſell to be erronious, and themſelues
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1904:36"/>
to bée blaſphemous. Let them nowe take héede, for if this go forwarde, their craking of Counſels, their authoritie of fathers, ſhal henceforth not helpe them a farthing. But how ſhall we proue it? Euen by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf, I think his friends will be glad of ſuch a iudge. If he procede againſt them, let them blame none but him, whoſe blames they ſeeke to defende. To be briefe, thus ſhall we proue it:</p>
            <p>All ſuch as haue offered vnto anye man a prophane name, a name of raſheneſſe, of pride, and of blaſphemie, were erronious and wicked.</p>
            <p>But the Counſell holden at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> hath offered vnto the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> a prophane name, a name of raſhneſſe, of pride, and of blaſphemie.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Counſell holden at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> was erronious and wicked.</p>
            <p>Here the Propoſition at <hi>large</hi> is vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true, the <hi>leſſe</hi> is prooued out of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Epiſtles vnto <hi>Eulogius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; vnto <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> can in no wiſe be denied. Note now
<pb facs="tcp:1904:37"/>
then in what eſtate, in what ſtrength is their Euangelicall Counſell, vnderſtande how ſoone they are diſproued, and how eaſie it is to detect their pryde, their vſurpation, their blaſphemies, &amp; ambicion. I ſée a great deale more, which I might haue ſaide, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching reaſon and authoritie, but to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man, to any not drowned in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pit of darkeneſſe, thys much may ſuffice.

time, before he ſuffred, which of them ſhould<note place="margin">Marc. 10. Math. 20.</note> be the greater. But our Sauiour did muche reprehende them therefore as we reade at large thereof in the Scriptures, where hée ſayth that amongſt the Princes of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſuch worldly power, ſuch dominion is vſed: <hi>Non ita erit inter vos, <hi>it ſhall not be ſo amongſt you.</hi>
               </hi> And yet notwithſtanding all this, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> will néedes haue <hi>Peter</hi> (God knoweth little for <hi>Peters</hi> ſake) to haue the preheminencie, the maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the ſuperioritie ouer all the reſt. Chriſt alloweth it not, the Pope will, belike it ſhall be as he will. That I ſpeake no worſe of him, a wilfull part he playeth thus in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing holye Scripture, in peruerting the ſenſe, by his inſenſible reaſons, to ſerue his turne and deſire.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1904:38"/>
arguments, conſider their abſurdities, and wey them with indifferencie. Their firſt fonde argument is this: Chriſt ſayd, thou<note place="margin">Math. 16. Behold how this place is abuſed.</note> art <hi>Peter,</hi> and vpon this rocke I will builde my Church. Therefore the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſupreme heade. O Lorde what a wiſe reaſon is this / where was Logique, and that I ſpeake not of the reſt, where was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe when this was framed? vppon what will he builde his Church? ſhake off blindeneſſe, confeſſe the truth, <hi>ſuper hanc pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi>

               </hi> Vpon him which rightly confeſſeth that Chriſt is the ſonne of the liuing God, ſhall the Church be builded. And did none euer confeſſe that but <hi>Peter?</hi> yes, all the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das I ſcariotes</hi> excepted. Therefore vppon them all, vpon any, whoſoeuer that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt to be the ſonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing God, is the Church builded. For what is the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſt his Church? is it any thing elſe, than the increaſe of faithfull people, confeſſing and acknowledging the faith of Chriſt? what dreame they than, vpon <hi>Tues Petrus, &amp; ſuper hanc petram?</hi> perceiue they not how that place of ſcripture is moſt playne?
<pb facs="tcp:1904:39"/>
or is it vnto them that the holy ghoſt, by the Prophete <hi>Eſay</hi> doth thus ſpeake? <hi>you ſhal</hi>

               <hi>and beleue the Goſpell.</hi> For this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument they themſelues ſée, doth neyther proue in <hi>Peter</hi> any ſuperioritie, nor yet that their Pope ought to haue anye primacie. Procede we then to their other arguments. Chriſt ſayde vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> féede my lambes,<note place="margin">Ioan. 21. Note how this place is peruerted.</note> féede my ſhéepe, féede my ſhéepe: therefore <hi>Peter</hi> is the heade of the Apoſtles. I wéene this be to headie an argument, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any reaſonable man, to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Of Logique I will no more ſpeake, for as all men may ſée, they eyther vtterly lacke it, or elſe they want good matter therein to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, or both. Shall it follow, bicauſe Chriſt bade <hi>Peter</hi> féede his ſheepe, that therefore he is the heade of the Apoſtles? what is it to féede Chriſt his ſhéepe? is it anye thing elſe than to preach the Goſpel, and ſo to inſtruct men in the faith? ſayde he not then aſmuch vnto the reſt? <hi>hos numero. 12. emiſit Ieſus,</hi> Chriſt<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> ſent forth euerie of the twelue to preache, <hi>ad oues perditas,</hi> to call home the ſtrayed ſhéepe, to féede them. He gaue no one iote of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1904:39"/>
vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> which he gaue not vnto all the reſt, he ſent them all to preache the Goſpell, to féede his ſhepe. But why would the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> haue <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the ſcriptures to be the principal or chiefe among the Apoſtles? <hi>latet anguis in herba,</hi> there is a pad in the ſtrawe: it is not be ye aſſured, to further <hi>Peter,</hi> it is nothing for <hi>Peters</hi> ſake: it is to the intent that he himſelfe (O prowde man!) might chalenge a ſuperioritie ouer all. This is the cauſe that theſe blinde arguments came forth, that the ſcriptures be ſo wreſted, abuſed, and belyed. Againe, they thus reaſon. Chriſt ſayth vnto<note place="margin">Math. 17. Wey howe this place is wreſted.</note> 
               <hi>Peter,</hi> thou ſhalt finde in the fiſh his mouth a péece of coyne of foure drammes, paye that for me and thée: therefore <hi>Peter</hi> hath a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie ouer all the Apoſtles. A perfite argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I warraunt you, if it be throughlye weyed: there was neuer ſuch abſurd toyes, neuer ſuch boyiſh brawling, I dare ſaye, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed. Doth, I pray you, Chriſt, bicauſe hée then payed tribute, chalenge vnto himſelfe, therefore anye power, did not as manye as were at <hi>Capernaum</hi> pay the tribute of two drammes? did anye one of them thereby claime an authoritie? how ſhall <hi>Peter</hi> then
<pb facs="tcp:1904:40"/>
hereby haue any ſuperioritie? is it bicauſe Chriſt payd for him two grotes? good God, a great manye, yea all, (they muſt needes graunt) payd at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> for their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants the like tribute, and yet did they not therfore attribute vnto their men any chiefe dignitie. The truth is mightie, and the<note place="margin">Dem. ex o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. de fal. legat.</note> contrarie is weake: the truth hereof is, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had neuer a pennie, and therfore Chriſt with that one coyne, leaſt he ſhoulde be an offence vnto them, payd for him. This is the right ſenſe, there is no more in it to ſéeke. What can be plainer than this? what can be more peruerſe, than to ſhadow with lies, with lewdneſſe ſo manifeſt a truth? But O the great ſtrength of veritie, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Cicer: pro M.

Chriſt ſayd vnto <hi>Peter, Simon, Simon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde<note place="margin">Luc. 22. Se howe this place is miſvſed.</note> Satan hath deſired to ſifte you, as it were Wheate: but I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not: therefore <hi>Peter</hi> hath a maioritie ouer al the Apoſtles, and is their ſuperiour. Suppoſe here (Chriſten reader) what theſe men would doe, if others framed

againſt them ſuch fooliſh and ſelf will argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neuer ſaye that they are learned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they haue ſome better learning. But I maruayle not ſo much at their blindneſſe, I haue bene in it, I know therof the effects. If I wondered at any thing, it ſhoulde be at this, that there are amongſt ſo many men, not ſo much as one eye. Neyther ſpeake I of corporall eyes, but of thoſe rather which Aungels haue, the eyes of vnderſtanding, the eyes wherewith God is ſéene, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his holy worde is vnderſtanded. Now touching this place of Scripture, whereas Chriſt ſayd vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> that Satan deſired to ſift them, as it were Wheate, the ryght meaning (marke well indifferent Reader) thereof is, that our Sauiour Chriſt percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the time of his paſſion to approche, and vnderſtanding the frailtie, temptation and feare that his Apoſtles ſhould then be in, he ſayd: <hi>all you ſhall bee offended through</hi>

               </hi> Sée here howe plainly the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt S. <hi>Marke</hi> ſetteth forth that place of S. <hi>Luke.</hi> The ſhepehearde is Chriſt, the ſhéepe are the Apoſtles, at his taking they

ſcattered: <hi>relicto illo, omnes fugerunt,</hi> they left<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> him in the handes of his aduerſaries, and fled awaye. This is it that Satan deſired to ſift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What followeth? but I haue praied<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> for thée (vnto <hi>Peter</hi> he ſayth) that thy faith fayle not. And what gather wee of theſe wordes: forſooth, that Chriſt ſéeing, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, yea, vttering the eſtate to come of <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, how in that day he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him thriſe, and that before the Cocke crewe, he thought it neceſſarie alſo, as néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it was, that <hi>Simon</hi> by name ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue ſome words of comfort, that he ſhould vnderſtand, though through feare he denied him, that yet his faith ſhoulde not ſo fayle, but that in hart ſtill he would acknowledge him to be the ſonne of the liuing God, and though that through frayltie he did fall, yet ſhould he through due repentance be rayſed vp againe, and ſo ſhould not his faith fayle. There followeth alſo in the ſame place: <hi>and when thou art co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted, make more</hi>

nowe with thée to repent and to be ſorie. Such is the ſenſe of that text, it ſoundeth (you ſée) in no wiſe to any ſuperioritie. And touching the authoritie of binding and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as it was giuen vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo was it vnto all the reſt, and that without anye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. For our Sauiour ſpeaking vnto them al (as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> witneſſeth) ſaith thus:<note place="margin">Ioan.</note> 
               <hi>whoſe ſinnes ſoeuer yee remit, they are remitted vnto them, and whoſe ſinnes ſo euer yee retain, they are retayned.</hi> Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> recordeth the ſame, his wordes bee plaine, the ſenſe is euident, the meaning is manifeſt, what would you more?

Wherefore theſe thinges with an vpright iudgement, with an honeſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence conſidered, how, by what meanes, ſhall the Popes primacie be defended? the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof is pride, the fruite is poyſon, it can not be prayſed.

<pb facs="tcp:1904:42"/>
it, and holye ſcripture doth altogither denie it. If good reaſon therefore maye take place, if right authorities can preuayle, if ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture ſhall ouercome, who is he now, where is any that will maintaine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, vphold, or aſſiſt either the Pope, or his feyned, painted, hollow Popedome? I will therfore conclude, yea, the kings of the earth (as ſayeth the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>) doe one after another conclude and ſay: <hi>How happeneth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 14.</note>

            <p>Here ſéeing then that the chiefeſt bulwark of vnbeliefe is battered downe, ſéeing the gate of <hi>Babilon</hi> is broken, ſéeing that the very ſeate of <hi>Lucifer</hi> is defaced, ſéeing hys prowde pallace is ouerthrowen, wée maye briefly ſpeake of the braunches, which, ſayd we nothing, the roote being deſtroyd, would

For if the Pope bée put downe, how can dreaming Purgatorie ſtande? how can his Bulles liue? how can his Pedlars, and his Pardons preuayle? of theſe things, and of ſuch others, I meane as briefly, ſo in plaine wiſe, and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeake. Yet firſt I ſée it needefull, that we aunſwere vnto certaine obiections now bellowing in the throtes of the aduerſaries, that ſo their vaine dartes and fooliſh reaſons throughly weied, they acknowledging their diſeaſe, maye with a more moderation of mynde with vs conſider, what things they be, whence they came, and wherevnto they tende, whereof we haue to treate.

he was borne, he had not bene worthie to haue the name of an Apoſtle of Chriſt: if <hi>Peter,</hi> if <hi>Barnabas,</hi> if the reſt had not forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the rites and lawes then vſed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were borne, and which their forefathers helde and kept, they had neuer bene accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Diſciples and followers of Ieſus. Touching the common people, you knowe how the Phariſies fooliſhlye obiected by the ſame wordes, the ſelfe ſame thing againſt our ſauiour. And as you ſaye: theſe Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants be mad, they haue no learning, ſo ſayd they: <hi>turba haec non nouit legem, execrabiles ſunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 7.</note> 
               <hi>theſe fooliſh people know not the lawe, they are accurſt.</hi> But let the Phariſies, let their followers ſpeake what them liſt, wée muſt ſaye: <hi>nunquam ſic loquutus est homo ſicut hic homo,</hi> there is no preaching like vnto the Goſpell, there was neuer man that ſet forth ſuch doctrine, there is none that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto this. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> before his conuerſion vnderſtanding that the poore Chriſtians did preuaile and now ſomewhat better liking their doctrine, ſayth: <hi>Quid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timur? <hi>what ſuffer wee?</hi> ſurgunt indocti, &amp; rapiunt coelum, &amp; nos cum nostris ſcientijs dimer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimur in profundum, <hi>the vnlearned doe riſe</hi>

               </hi> And concerning the chiefe rulers (right great praiſe be therefore vnto God.) They were not of a long time ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to heare the truth, nor ſo willinglye to embrace it as nowe. If ſome be yet clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if their eyes be not opened, what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile? When the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the people would not repent, what ſayd he? <hi>for ſit an pauperes ſunt,</hi> peraduenture<note place="margin">Ieremi. 5.</note> they are fooliſh and ſimple, they vnderſtand not the Lordes way: <hi>ibo igitur ad optimates,</hi> I will goe therefore vnto their heades, and rulers, vnto the chiefe, <hi>&amp; ecce magis hi ſimul confregerunt iugum, ruperunt vincula,</hi> but loe, theſe in like maner haue rather broken the yoke, and burſt the bandes in ſunder, theſe are worſe than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other.

<pb facs="tcp:1904:44"/>
what ſpeake you of the chiefe and Rulers? as for the learned, I will confeſſe the truth, there are in the miniſterie men verie ſimple and of ſmall vnderſtanding, I knowe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a number, I wil not denie it, the thing may in time be remedied: but to ſpeake indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlye, if we examine the miniſterie with the former prelacy, they are as learned now, yea, better learned than euer they were. For in times paſt, what ſay you vnto Prieſtes, what ſay you vnto Biſhops that coulde not ſpeake anye true Latine? Let none thinke that I ſlaunder them, they were ſuch, and therfore to excuſe themſelues, thus they ſay: <hi>If the Biſhops or Preiſtes doe ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,</hi>

And what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of this miſchief? let vs be indifferent, let vs tell troth. Satan for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth of a long time hauing the world vnder his clawes, was quiet, without care, he was negligent. Then loe, though moſt horrible vices raigned, yet had they eyther the title of
<pb facs="tcp:1904:45"/>
vertues, or elſe had the people no eies to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them, ſo that Satan was <hi>animi ſecuri homo,</hi> one that feared nothing, he néeded not to be buſie, a better trade than he had, coulde he neuer haue. For Superſtition had put on the name of Religion, hawtineſſe was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med holyneſſe, tyrannie was called a zeale vnto iuſtice, whoredome was named chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and (as <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſayth) <hi>vitia virtutes ſe eſſe mentiuntur,</hi> vile vices reported the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be vertues, ſuche was the wretchedneſſe (O miſerie / ) of the time. But in theſe days Satan being pinched, mens eyes opened, darkeneſſe remoued, vices defected, and the deuill in a maner naked, howe on euery ſide beſturreth he himſelfe? he bloweth abrode his poyſon, he ſcattereth euerye where hys newes, he calleth vnto him his mates, it ſtandeth him vpon, he maketh all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that may be. And what of all this? is it a thing ſtraunge? or is not a thing always ſéene, that when the Goſpell is preached, then Satan is moſt moued. <hi>For the deuill</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chryſost.</note> 
               <hi>hearing that the ſonne of god deſcended into this world,</hi> hearing the fayth of Chriſt preached, <hi>he made great haſte againſt him to ſhut vp mens harts in ſinne and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1904:45"/>
               <hi>thinking that he coulde deſtroye as much, as Chriſt was able to ſaue.</hi> For example therof, what ſhould I ſpeake of the perſecution in the primatiue Church? it ſhal ſuffice, if I ſet before you but a péece of the wickedneſſe, and of the lamentable eſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaine Empire beginning anon after <hi>Marcus.

Next him ſucceded <hi>Pertinax</hi> a verye good man, yet was he ſlaine and murthered of his owne ſouldiors. What ſhoulde I ſpeake onely of murther: what wickedneſſe raigned not? Theſe cut throte ſouldiours, after the death of <hi>Pertinax</hi> ſolde the Empire vnto a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Carle, one <hi>Iulianus.</hi> But what came thereof? the whole eſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire was troubled, thrée at one time claymed the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, <hi>Iulianus, Niger, and Seuerus.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of the death of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> his mother, what ſhould I ſaye? go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole hiſtorie, and you ſhall finde almoſt nothing but méere impietie. And yet
<pb facs="tcp:1904:46"/>
at this time the Goſpell was preached, wée may not ſay that the doctrine was not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good, bicauſe the time ouer flowed with iniquitie. Conſider this, Chriſten Reader, wey it with thine owne conſcience, and then<note place="margin">An ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> iudge vprightly. They obiect alſo, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of the Miniſters is naught, that they be vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, lewde, and I knowe not what. Their lewdeneſſe I will not defende, if they be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> God amende them.

If in the Church now there be ſome lewde men, I maruaile not.

Touching the Pope and his Prelacie, who can accuſe them? for though they be neuer ſo lewd of themſelues, though they offende in moſt deteſtable filthineſſe, though the Pope doe not one good déede, yet<note place="margin">Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus papa.</note> the vertues of his Predeceſſors maye ſuffice him.

               <note place="margin">Arist.</note> 
               <hi>est: <hi>That which is not, is no where.</hi>
               </hi> The name of Purgatorie in holye ſcripture was neuer read, in ſenſe alſo, there is therein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing founde, in anye wiſe to confirme the ſame: except you will haue the wreſting of places to be proofes, and the abuſing of Gods
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1904:47"/>
word to be made a warde, a couering, and a bolſtering of iniquitie. Did the Apoſtles of Chriſt euer heare of any ſuch place? heard they once of the name of Purgatorie? no, for it was long after (will the defenders thereof ſaye) before it was borne and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened. <hi>Our forefathers</hi> (ſaye they) <hi>more</hi>

Well, it was time to hatch it, for it was one of the profitableſt monſters that euer was whelped within the Popes houſe. But (beléeue me) let them garniſhe it neuer ſo much with gold, feyned dreames and with other deluſions, yet ſhall it down, the ſtraw ſtuffing muſt be ſéene, the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lymmes muſt be looked vppon, and the breathleſſe babe muſt throughly now be rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp, and be tried. And what gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to our forefathers (I will vſe their owne wordes) of the name of Purgatorie? Marrie (ſay they) the thirde Chapiter of the Prophet <hi>Malachie,</hi> and the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Theſe be their twoo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall places, vpon the which, you ſhall nowe

In thys place and in the whole chapiter, theſe things be only conteyned, the comming of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, the deliuerance of the faithfull, through Gods great mercie and grace, from their ſinnes, the iudgement of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked, of their blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and of Gods moſt benigne care toward the godlye. See then whether your priuate Purgatorie, maye haue hence anye place, any pretence of being, any defence or bolſtring, or not. I néeded not to tell you, oh I woulde it were not néedefull to tell, that we are onely ſaued by Chriſt his death, that we are clenſed by his bloud ſhed, and that we are redemed by his paſſion, it is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1904:48"/>
Ieſus Chriſt, which gaue himſelf for<note place="margin">Titus. 2.</note> vs, to redéeme vs from all vnrighteouſnes, and to purge vs a peculiar people vnto him ſelfe, we feruentlye being giuen vnto good workes. Weigh then, what it is to purge the children of <hi>Leui,</hi> and ſée whether it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe, then that they ſhould be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and renewed by the ſpirite of God, yea, and that ſinne ſhoulde not be imputed vnto them for the loue of Chriſt. Conſider this, it is a more holeſome doctrine, than to hunt we know not where, after a hatefull, phantaſticall and fooliſh pretenced Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. Thus by the wordes of the Prophet, ſéeing they may not preuaile, ſeeing that the ſame is altogither againſt them, let vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſée what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle ſayth. He alledgeth that the foundation is already layde, which is Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; then he procedeth in theſe wordes: <hi>If anye man builde vppon this</hi>

               <hi>foundation, golde, ſiluer, precious ſtones, wood, hay, or ſtubble, euery mans worke ſhall appeare. For the daye of the Lorde will declare it, and it ſhall bee ſhewed in fire, and the fire ſhall trie euerye mannes worke what it is. If any mans worke that he hath builte vpon, doe abide, he ſhall</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1904:49"/>
               <hi>receyue a rewarde. If anye mans worke burn, he ſhal ſuffer loſſe, but yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall be ſafe neuertheleſſe yet, as it were through fire.</hi> Theſe be S. <hi>Paules</hi> wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as men not giuen to conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fonde ſtrife, as men deſirous of the right vnderſtanding of holye ſcripture, as men all free from partialitie and part ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, let vs weigh vprightlye the meaning of the text. Here the Apoſtle would haue vs to be feruent in good workes, and earneſt to doe well, hée wiſheth vs to bee occupied in that labour, which, when the iudge of all ſhall come, may in his ſight be acceptable, may to vs ward be commendable. And that we ſhould well beware, what workes we builde vppon our foundation, he plainlye ſheweth, that at the laſt day all our doings ſhalbe opened, and that then the ſame ſhall be ſo tried, as the Goldſmith in fining hys mettals, trieth out the droſſe and baſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from the pure, perfite, and fine. <hi>The day</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>of our Lorde ſhall declare it,</hi>

               <hi>bicauſe it ſhall appeare in fire.</hi> The daye of our Lorde is the daye of iudgement, the thing is ſo plaine, as no man, though he be very peruerſe, may denie it. But when ſhall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1904:49"/>
it appere in fire? euen then, at the generall iudgement, ſo is the text. Where is therfore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, their place of Purgatorie? Well, will you ſée in fewe wordes, what by the whole text is ment? Here this onelye is ſpoken of thoſe, which ſhall be ſaued, of ſuch as builde vppon Ieſus Chriſt, vppon which foundation, as all can not builde golde, precious ſtones and ſiluer, as all can not be perfite, neyther by martyrdome bée crowned, nor yet by good learning ſhine like the ſtarres ofheauen: ſo thereon building, be it but Wood or Haye, be it but verie ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work it ſelfe be in the end bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though he himſelfe receiue no ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the others, yet ſhal he be ſaued, and how? <hi>as it were through fire.</hi> Not through<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> fire, but through the great feare, wherin he then ſhall ſtande, of the iuſt iuſtice &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. O how comfortable is this doctrine? how farre paſſeth it al their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fires and feyned flames of Purgatorie? You ſée now that the Scripture admitteth no ſuch place, you ſee the right meaning aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the Prophet, as alſo of the Apoſtle, You ſée that their two chiefe and onely pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doe ſerue ſo to their purpoſe, that they
<pb facs="tcp:1904:50"/>
ſtand plainely and altogither againſt them. Howe ſhall then poore Purgatorie ſtande? how ſhall the Pope mayntayne his chiefe Farme? Howe ſhall therein his might, his gaine be befended? to what purpoſe ſhoulde we cloke the matter anye lenger? his eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences be all naught, his writings be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeyte, his leaſe is antedated, his witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be prooued partiall, and periured, his Lawyers haue loſt their credite, his intereſt is not good, it is the Lord of hoſtes that ſueth him, the iudgement (<hi>ſe iudice</hi>) muſt paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But we ſee (ſay the Purgatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) the name of Purgatorie often ſet forth by auncient writers. And what I praye you of that? what gathered they, what meaned they by that name? forſooth, ſo farre were they from confeſſing anye ſuch Purgatorie fire, which now men ſo fooliſhly ſéeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, that <hi>ſome ſayde the tribulation of</hi>

But that the aduerſaries maye throughlye be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, that the indifferent and welwilling maye rightly be inſtructed, ſhall we ſée in what wiſe S. <hi>Paule</hi> receiued this inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at our Lords hands? <hi>That which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered you, the ſame I receiued</hi> (ſayeth<note place="margin">I. <hi>Cer.</hi> II.</note> he) <hi>of the Lord. For the Lorde Ieſus the ſame night in which hee was betrayed, tooke Bread, gaue thanks, and brake it, ſaying: take, and eate, this is my bodye, which ſhalbe giuen for you, this do ye in the remembrance of me. After the ſame maner he tooke the Cuppe when ſupper was done, and ſayd: this Cup is the new teſtament in my bloud, this doe as oft as you ſhall drinke it, in the remembrance of me. For as often as you ſhall eate this Breade, and drinke this Cup, you ſhall ſhewe the Lordes death vntill he come.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1904:52"/>
               <hi>Therfore whoſoeuer ſhal eate the Bread, and drinke the Cuppe of our Lord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, he ſhall be guiltie of the bodie and bloud of our Lord. Wherefore let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of that Breade, and drinke of that Cuppe.</hi> Thus farre ſpeaketh S. <hi>Paule,</hi> and that verie plainly. Nowe come we then to the ſearch of the text. And firſt, let thoſe who will acknowledge there no breade, way but indifferently the words as they ſtand. Chriſt tooke Breade, he gaue thanks, and brake it. What brake he? Breade. Who will denie it? He ſayde that it was his bodie. That is true: but howe? not fleſhly but ſpiritually. <hi>It is</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>the ſpirit that quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the fleſhe profiteth nothing, the wordes that I ſpake vnto you, are ſpirite and life.</hi> Lo, how euidently he aunſwereth the cogitations of ſuch, as thought that they ſhould haue eaten him carnally. Hence it is that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thus ſaith: <hi>The firſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. in expoſition. Pſalm. 8.</note> 
               <hi>ſprang amongeſt the Diſciples of Chriſt, as it were through the hardneſſe of hys words. For when he ſayd, except one will eate my fleſhe, and drinke my bloud, he can not haue lyfe euerlaſting.</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1904:52"/>
               <hi>They here not vnderſtanding, ſayde one vnto another, this is a hard ſaying, who can eate him? and whiles they thus ſaid, they ſeparated themſelues from him, and he remayned with twoo diſciples, whom, when the other were gone, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. It is the ſpirite</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>which giueth life, the fleſh profiteth nothing. The wordes that I ſpake vnto you, are ſpirite and life. You haue vnderſtoode ſpiritually, ſo they are ſpirite and lyfe: You haue vnderſtoode carnallye, ſo yet are they ſpirite and lyfe. But vnto thee they are not ſpirite and life, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt them not ſpiritually. Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande yee ſpiritually the wordes that I ſpake vnto you. You ſhall not eate thys bodie which you ſee, neyther ſhall you drinke the bloud, which thoſe that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie me ſhall ſhed. I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you a kinde of ſacrament, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritually vnderſtanded, doth quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you, but the fleſh profiteth nothing. But as they vnderſtode, ſo they aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For they vnderſtoode fleſhe, as that which is ſolde and broken in the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. But Chriſt perceyuing this, ſayde:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1904:53"/>
               <hi>This offendeth you, bicauſe I ſayde: I giue you my fleſhe to eate, and my bloud to drinke. If therefore you ſhall ſee the ſonne of man aſcende thither where hee before was, what is this? Here lo hath he plainly declared that, which before had moued them, here he opened, whence they were offended, here in deede and plainly if they had vnderſtoode it. But they thought that he would giue his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vnto them. He ſayd, that he would aſcend into heauen, and that all whole. When you ſhall ſee the ſonne of man to aſcende where he was before, truly then ſhall you ſpecially ſee that he giueth not his bodie in ſuch maner as you thinke: or then you ſhall vnderſtande, that hys grace is not conſumed with mouthes. Vntill the ending of the world, the Lord is aboue, but yet here is notwithſtanding with vs the grace of the Lorde, for the bodie wherein he roſe, can be but in one place, yet his grace, his Godhead, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie is ſpreade euerye where.</hi> O howe plaine, howe full, howe manifeſt be theſe wordes! the naturall bodye of Chriſt that was borne of the virgin Marie, is, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1904:53"/>
muſt be in one place, and that in heauen, vntill the ending of the world: therefore his naturall bodie can not be here alſo in earth, it can not be in the material Church, on the altar, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſts hands. Concerning their conſecration &amp; tranſubſtantiation, I aſke of them what they do conſecrate, whether it be bread, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords body? if it be bread, then is<note place="margin">The body of Christ is not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, nor yet the bread. Aſke them then, what is conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</note> it not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye of Chriſt, if it be his body, can they make it holyer at one time, than at an other? is his bodie at anye time vnholye? Herevnto they may neuer well aunſwere, their <hi>in instanti</hi> may ſtand nothing to their purpoſe. I am loth here to heape the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable hereſies wherein they are, which would defend this carnall eating. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie, their diſagréementes, their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors be maruailous. For example, and that I ſéeme not to belye them, I will betray one of their abſurdities. It is in queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them (ſo carnall they be, ſuch <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernaites</hi> they are) whether the bodie of Chriſt may be receiued with his deitie and ſoule or not? <hi>H:</hi> ſayth that neither the ſoule nor deitie is there receiued: others, as <hi>B:</hi> do ſaye, that in receiuing the body, they receiue alſo the deitie and ſoule. O Lorde what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable,
<pb facs="tcp:1904:54"/>
what horrible controuerſies what hainous abſurdities be theſe? It were hartilye to be wiſhed of euerie honeſt hart, that theſe would giue ouer, thus carnallye to grinde vpon Chriſt his ſoule, vppon his bodie and deitie. And if they cannot be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, without altercation in the true faith, then it is rather to bée ſuffered, that they wrangle (as a number of them do and haue done) about <hi>ſum, es, fui: hic, haec, hoc: qui quae quod &amp;c.</hi> For by the one, they ſet forth much and outragious impietie: by the other they bewray but their iangling nature and great follie. For is it not méere childiſhneſſe, for them to deale, as one of them doth in this matter? <hi>With it</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>agreeth <hi>hoc,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Sand:</note> 
               <hi>this: with it, <hi>quod,</hi> the which: it commeth after the verbe <hi>est,</hi> is: and goeth before the verbe <hi>datur,</hi> is giuen.</hi> Good God what a doe is this, how is a Doctor here troubled in finding out, in one little ſentence, the nowne ſubſtantiue? Oh, it is eaſie to make great volumes, they maye ſoone make ſuch bookes, they may ſtuffe them without ſtudy, with Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, Caſes, Articles, Pronounes, Verbes, Participles, with conſtruing, with parſing, with iffes, with andes, with aſking
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1904:54"/>
and aunſwering, with trifling and linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, with light queſtions, common talke, and controlling. Well, Chriſt (ſaye they) ſaid, this is my body: why ſhall not we then beleue him? forſooth, that you would beleue him, we verilye doe wiſhe: and that you woulde take heede of that herefie, <hi>which</hi>
               <note place="margin">August.</note> 
               <hi>happened, as it were through the harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his wordes,</hi> amongſt his owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, we earneſtlye admoniſhe, perſwade and exhort you. It is vndoubtedly true, that the holye Communion doth conſiſt of twoo things, of the viſible kinde of Elementes, of breade and wine, and of the inuiſible grace. Of which twoo things, the ſpirituall body of Chriſt conſiſting, is receyued of the worthie receyuer, to his comfort and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neyther yet may you here thinke, that his ſpirituall bodie conſiſteth of breade, but that by the receyuing of breade, we be made to vnderſtande of the receit of his ſpirituall fleſhe, and by the receiuing of wine, we are certified to receaue (and all for our inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) his ſpirituall bloude: or if you will haue it brieflier, to receyue his bodye and bloud ſpiritually. And that this is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſhall beare me
<pb facs="tcp:1904:55"/>
witneſſe: <hi>Two wayes is the fleſh of Chriſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Epist. ad Epheſios.</note> 
               <hi>and his bloud vnderſtanded: either that ſpirituall and diuine, whereof he ſayth: my fleſh is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede, and except you will eate my fleſh, and drinke my bloud, you ſhall not haue lyfe euerlaſtyng: or elſe that fleſhe which was crucified, and that bloud which was ſhed with the ſpeare of the ſouldier.</hi> What words can be playner than theſe? who is ſo ſimple, but may now ſée, of what fleſhe and of what bloude Chriſt ment, when he ſayde, <hi>My fleſhe is meate in deede?</hi> here further to aunſwere ſuch, who thinke it to be his carnall bodye, bicauſe he ſayde, this is my bodie, I thinke there is no reaſonable bodye, that will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it néedefull. Yet to auoyde all that the aduerſaries maye alledge, whereas he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it once his body, he many times nameth it bread, ſo doe the Apoſtles, ſo doe the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. His body it is, in reſpect of his ſpiritual fleſh and bloud, which then the faithfull doe receiue: but bread and wine it is, in reſpect of the Elementes, which we eate, taſte off, and digeſt. Alſo whereas the Doctors doe ſomtimes not ſpeake of the bread and wine,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1904:55"/>
but of the verie bodie of Chriſt, <hi>quod in ipſae</hi>

So haue you here ſufficiently ſhewed vnto you, the right meaning of the Lordes ſupper, you haue in fewe wordes the effect of the ſame, and the teſtimonie therein, aſwell of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as of the Doctors.

But nowe wee will brieflye treate, of the tranſlation of holy Scripture into the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare tongue, of ſinging of Pſalmes, and of ſuch like things, as they ſhal occurre, which now are by Satan reprooued, by his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters repugned, and by his chiefe defenders reſiſted. And herein that I maye be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I will vſe ſuch authorities as (let Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan doe his worſt) muſt néedes be allowed.</p>
            <p>Much a do many now make, bicauſe they<note place="margin">Of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the vulgar tongue.</note> ſée the holy Scriptures to be in the Engliſh tongue, and that to the comfort and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many a thouſande. But what (trow yée) is the cauſe that they finde themſelues therein ſo much grieued? Oh, therein lieth the verie whole matter, therein hangeth all the marring and making of their market. For if the people once perceiue what ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition is, will they (thinke you) be ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious? if they perceyue what Hipocriſie is, will they be Hipocrites? if they ſée how hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Idolatrie is, wil they then ſuccor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators? if they beholde what blindeneſſe is, will they delight in darkeneſſe? if they doe vnderſtand the ignoraunt abuſes of times paſt, will they perſeuer ſtill in ignorancie? if they were deceyued, blinded, and moſte

for twoo pence? ſome receiued twentie dayes pardon, ſome thirtie, ſome fortie. O filthye merchandiſe! Well. What was further taught by ignoraunt and vnlearned men, touching penance, I neede not to ſay.

We ſay that we are iuſtified by fayth alone, by no merites of ours, by no workes. We ſay that a iuſt man maketh the workes good, and not that the good workes doe make a man iuſt. And as by faith alone without workes we be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſo by grace alone without our deſertes we be ſaued.

               <hi>we ſuppoſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that a man is iuſtified by fayth without the deedes of the law.</hi> Lo, what can be plainer than this? Let them which haue eyes ſee, the wordes be euident, let ſuch as haue heartes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande. <hi>If you</hi> (vnto the Pope, not I, but <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth) <hi>be iuſtified by deedes, then</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:1904:76"/>
what is in thy power? it is in thy power, not to doe ſome deede that is euill, and yet is it not in thée to doe that which is good. How ſo (will one ſay) doe not I that which is good, if I doe not the thing which is euill? No. And therefore marke it. For were it ſo, then did the Heathens, and Ethnickes good déedes, which thing, who is he that will graunt? ſhall we ſaye, that the heathens were iuſt men? or that they were vertuous? God forbid. And why? bicauſe they wanted this faith which maketh the worke good,<note place="margin">Auguſtin.</note> which iuſtifieth a man. <hi>For the whole lyfe of the vnfaythfull</hi> (ſayeth <hi>Auguſtine) is ſinne.</hi> And therefore though we may ſaye that one hauing faith, hath, doth, or if hée haue time, would doe good workes, yet can not we ſay, that all which ſeeme in our eyes to doe well, haue faith.

The argument is made, if we ſaye: that the Pope and his adherentes doe ſo thinke, and for that cauſe miſlike his miniſtering: therefore they bée accurſt. Such is the concluſion. In this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, if they denie any thing, it muſt bée their owne Propoſition, which was made at a generall Councell, by the aduiſe of ſo manye fathers. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Pope and the<note place="margin">Anno do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. 1073.</note> ſeauenth of that name, who vſurped vnto himſelfe (as ſome doe write) the authoritie, kept a great ſturre, and laboured earneſtly to forbid the mariage of Prieſtes.

vſed in theſe later dayes, euen in leſſe than ſixtene yeares paſt? why were at that time the maried Prieſtes ſeparated from their wiues? bicauſe (ſayth the Pope) their mariage was no mariage, bicauſe they were adulterers.
