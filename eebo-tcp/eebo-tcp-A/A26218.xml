         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>'TIS not to justify my self, that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to write the Memoirs of my
Life. For 'tis a long time since that God
has given me the grace to look upon
the Injurious Reports that have bin spread abroad
concerning me in the World, as a punishment of
my vanity. And for that reason I submit my self
to the conduct of his Providence: Happy in this,
that I am sensible of my own Innocence as to every
thing that Calumny has laid to my Charge; but
on the other side, unfortunate to have lost the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of my Innocence by the Scandals to which I have
bin too guilty of giving the occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55945:6"/>
I thought it might be permitted me to write my
own History, were it but to justify by my Example
such Persons of my Sex as have of late been made
the Objects of common Reproach. 'Tis well known
to what degree Reproaches are improv'd in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
seeing that now-a-days we meet with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
People so adventurous to maintain, That there
is hardly an honest Woman in the Town. 'Tis
true, the malignity of Men is not the only reason
of the little justice which they do us, seeing there are
Women, who may be thought to have taken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in confirming the ill opinion which men
have of us: And indeed, there are none who
have done more injustice to their Sex, then they
who have written the Memoirs of their Amours,
and dispers'd into the World Letters for which their
Passion and Debauchery found Materials. From
their Examples men have condemn'd all those
whom they suspected of having any Amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues;
and when a Woman has once got the
Reputation of a Coquette, she is presently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
to be one of those that make it their glory to
be so.</p>
               <p>I therefore thought it might be one means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
this growing Opinion, by a faithful recital of
the Adventures of my Life, to shew, that a Woman
may be defam'd, yet not be guilty; and that there is
many times more of Misfortune then Irregularity
in the Conduct of several Women, upon whom the
Public is pleas'd to throw their Scandals. There
is also another benefit to be reap'd from these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs:
For from thence you will learn to avoid all
such Misfortunes as are lookt upon as Crimes; and
to shun those things which may give occasion to
fully the Reputation of Women, by observing where
I my self became an ill Manager of my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55945:6"/>
I am well descended as well by the Father's as by
the Mother's side; but it was the first of my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
that I was born too soon; for my Mother
was hardly arriv'd to Sixteen years of Age when she
lay in of me. And because that in Ten years after
my Mother had no more Children, I was lookt
upon as Heiress of my Father's Estate. All this while
my Mother was too young to let a Daughter grow
up with her at home, that would have kept the Hand
of her Dyal from standing long at Sixteen. So she sent
me to a Grandmother, who had that fond love for
me, which Women advanc'd in years have manytimes
for Children by whom they expect the continuation
of their Name and Family. She made it her business
to infuse into me, upon the score of my Birth and
Beauty, all the Vanity and Pride she had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her self; and the first thing that I learnt, was,
that I was Fair, and destin'd to the most noble and
elevated Pretensions. With these Fancies I was flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
all along; and I had already attain'd Eleven
years of Age, when my Mother was brought to bed
of a Boy. But no sooner was this Son and Heir
come into the World, but my Grandmother began
to lavish out all her Affection for me, upon him;
my Beauty was no longer flatter'd: No more talk
of my being a Princess or a Dutchess at least: No—I
must stifle all those gaudy Expectations: My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had bereav'd me of all those great Advantages.
On the other side, they began to instill into me In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to a Religious Life; and at length, they
told me flat and plain, it was the manner of living,
and all the Preferment my Parents had design'd me.</p>
               <p>I was already big enough, and had so much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
about me, as to be deeply sensible how disastrous
such a Resolution would be to me: And the very
thoughts of it infus'd into me as great an aversion


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55945:7"/>
for my nearest Relations, as before I had respect
and complacency for 'em. My Father was the only
Person for whom I still preserv'd some little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for he still seem'd to have something of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for me. So that whenever they talk'd of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
me into a Nunnery, I always had recourse to
him, and to him made known my Reluctancy and
Despair. Which I so well exprest in words accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani'd
with tears, that my Father himself could
not refrain from weeping. But he, good man, wore
not the Breeches: And therefore he advis'd me, for
his sake, to suffer for a while the Inconveniencies of
a Convent, with a promise that I should not long
be under that Confinement, but that he would
dispose of me so soon as I was ripe for Marriage.</p>
               <p>Upon this I obey'd, and I was put into a Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
where the Abbess was my Father's Cousin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and in her I met again with as much fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as formerly my Grandmother had for me.
Which together with the hopes that my Father had
giv'n me, was no small consolation to me.</p>
               <p>Now in regard I had all the liberty I could desire
in the Nunnery, I had so accustom'd my self to do
what I pleas'd, that no body durst contradict me:
And being thus flatter'd and caress'd, it was no
wonder if I gave a second harbour to all that vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which my Grandmother had infus'd into me.
The Praises also which the Nuns continually gave
me, daily swell'd this Vanity: And by that means
I came to understand, that Convents, where young
People are allow'd the liberty I had, are no better
Schools for Children, then the Houses of Fondling
Parents that idolize their own Issue. The more I
was persuaded that all Nuns were Saints, the more
I sooth'd my self that I deserv'd their Praises; and
the more vainly I flatter'd my self, that there was

nothing in me to be amended, seeing those very
Persons who were entrusted with the care of my
Conduct, applauded every thing I did, and every
thing which I desir'd to do.</p>
               <p>In this manner I was bred up, with little instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Duties of my Religion. Not that they
omitted to teach me the grounds of it; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
I had an excellent Memory, I made it my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to study those grounds, rather to shew
my wit, then for the sake of information: Nor did
I make any difference between the Articles of my
Faith, and the Songs and Verses which I got by
heart. To me they seem'd all alike, and I lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it only as an exercise of my Memory, which was
put upon me to try whether I had a good one or no.
How many times have I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amented afterwards my
being so little taught the difference between Solid
and Trivial! and my being left to my self to make
my choice of which of the two my Fancy best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd.
Both Nuns and other Persons, who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with the Education of Children, are very
imprudent to make no distinction between things of
so different a nature; but rather to permit the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Trifles, before the Memory and the Heart are
well season'd with the first impressions of Truth and
Vertue.</p>
               <p>The reading of Romances brought me to reflect
upon things, of which till then I had but a confus'd
and imperfect apprehension. By reading them, I
learnt there was a Passion that gave to Women
an absolute dominion over Men. And I was not a
little overjoy'd to think, that I could as well as
others pretend to that empire; and that perhaps I
had an opportunity already to exercise that Power.</p>
               <p>In short, I call'd to mind, that when I liv'd with
my Grandmother, there was a Person of Quality


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55945:8"/>
who lov'd me, and who usually call'd me his little
Queen. I recall'd to my memory all the marks that
he gave me of his Affection: And I made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
but that that Affection was an effect of that
same Passion which I found so well express'd in
Romances. I was sorry I had bin ignorant of it
so long; and that I had made no better use of my
empire over that Lover. Who is regard he was a
Person of Quality, and one that appear'd to have
more merit then any of the rest with whom I was
acquainted, seem'd to me most worthy of paying
me his Assiduities. I resolv'd therefore to engage
him to give me a Visit, that I might please my self
with enjoying the honour of submitting a Man to
my own Laws.</p>
               <p>I was too young to have any other motive to this
Attempt then vanity: Nor indeed was I acquainted
with any other; neither did I believe that Love
was any other thing then that same Power and
Command wherewith I flatter'd my self.</p>
               <p>The course which I took to engage the Marquiss
of <hi>Blossac</hi> (for that was then his Title) to come to
me, was to write to him. To which end, not
knowing what I did, I copi'd out of several Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
what seem'd to me the most endearing, to
express that I very much desir'd to see him. That
is to say, I wrote a most passionate and tender Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
without being sensible of the thing which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
and without divining in the least that there
was any harm in writing after that manner. This
without doubt is an effect the most innocent that
the reading of Romances can produce in the mind
of a young Person. But after all, it is a dangerous
effect; seeing that by accustoming our selves to read
the Language of Love, we expose our selves, how
harmless soever our Intentions may be, to love the


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55945:8"/>
name of it, and to feel the effects and power
of it.</p>
               <p>Romances therefore having taught me, that there
was a secret and mysterious method to be observ'd
in the delivery of Letters; I bethought my self of
putting mine into a small Bundle of Rarities
wrought by the Nuns, of which I pretended to make
a Present to <hi>Blossac</hi> upon the Festival Day of the
Nunnery's particular Saint. In this manner then I
sent him my Letter, with orders to the Bearer to
deliver the Bundle into his own hands. Thus had
my Passion bin never so violent, it could not have
taught me to take better measures then my own
Vanity inspir'd into me. For the two Passions of
Love and Vanity force Women to act for the most
part much after the same manner, as I found by
experience in the progress of my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blossac</hi> receiv'd my Letter; and had always lookt
upon me as a Child: But he found that Letter so
witty, that his first thoughts advis'd him to shew it
to my Parents, to the end they might see what an
extraordinary Daughter they had. However, he
met with so much Passion, so much tenderness in
it, that he believ'd it impossible that I should write
in such a manner, without being in some measure
sensible of what I had written to him. And the
younger I was, the more he flatter'd himself with
being the first Object of a growing Passion: And
whatever in my Letter seem'd to him to be above
my years, he ascrib'd to nothing but Love. So that
from thence forward he began to love me in earnest,
and return'd me a most passionate Answer, wherein
he promis'd to come and see me the next day.</p>
               <p>However, I met with something in his Letter
that offended me; for he call'd me his <hi>Pretty Child.</hi>
Now I had never read that the Hero's in Romances


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55945:9"/>
gave such Language to their Mistresses; so that I
expected him with impatience, that I might have
the pleasure to abuse him for it. He came; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had not seen me in above a year before, he
found me so well grown, though then but in the
Twelfth of my Age, that the sight of my Person com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
what my Letter had begun. He became my
most Passionate Lover; nevertheless, being desirous,
before he discover'd his Love, to be assur'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I had reason enough about me to sustain the
weight of such a Declaration, he appli'd himself to
me with the same terms of familiarity as formerly,
calling me his Little Miss, and his Pretty Sweet-heart,
and teling me with an Aire of Fondness, that
I was the most delicate Girl in the World. All these
low Titles I took ill; and therefore in the Tone of
a Romantic Heroess, I talk'd to him as <hi>Astrea</hi> talks
to <hi>Celadon,</hi> when she banishes him her presence. At
first he laught at my Childish Indignation; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me persist in the same Language, he was so much
the more at a loss, because he lov'd me with so much
the more tenderness. Thereupon he came to a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Explanation of himself, and told me after such
a manner, as somewhat daunted me, that he was
asham'd at his years, to confess himself so weak as
to have a Passion for me; however, that he could
not forbear to let me know, as much a Child as I
was, that his Life and his Repose depended upon
me, and that he should dye without an Assurance
that my heart was his. And he pronounc'd these
words in such a manner, that they pierc'd my very
Soul: And had I had but a little more Experience, I
should have understood to have made a distinction
between him and others; and that it was no longer
that I acted by the same Motive that oblig'd me
to send for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55945:9"/>
I then forgot all that Romances had taught me
concerning the Disdain and Pride of their Heroesses:
I fell a weeping; and begging his pardon for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
offended him; I assur'd him of the surrender
of my heart, and that I would never say any thing
to him agen that should excite his Anger. He was
overjoy'd to find such an alteration in me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
his Arguments to persuade me how passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
he lov'd me, when our Conversation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by the coming in of the Abbess; for then
he fell a cockering me again with tendernesses suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to my Age, and calling me Pretty Child, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
me to be a good Girl. Nor was it out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
that I forbore to shew my self displeas'd with
his Discourse, but because I found an inclination in
my self to pardon every thing in him but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.
I was so much afraid he did not love me,
that having found an opportunity before we parted,
to ask him whether he were still offended, I oblig'd
him to swear that he would love me as long as he
liv'd.</p>
               <p>Thus it was, that without knowing what it
meant, I surrender'd my self up to that fatal Passion
that since has so much troubl'd my repose. 'Twas
not for any other design that I desir'd to see <hi>Blossac,</hi>
but only to trample upon his Submission, when I
became so much his Slave, that I took delight in
nothing else but thinking of him. To such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice
had the aiery Vanity of Romances insensibly
led me.</p>
               <p>I lov'd, yet knew not what Love was: And I
lov'd so much the more, because I was ignorant
what it was to love: Nor would my Ignorance
permit me to contend with what I knew not. I
saw nothing that frighted me in the kind Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I had for <hi>Blossac;</hi> nor had I any desire to be


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55945:10"/>
afraid of Consequences which I foresaw not. I stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di'd
nothing so much as how to please him, and
find out ways to see him often. Romances then,
that formerly were my chief delight, began to grow
irksome to me; I did not like it that their Heroesses
should take so much pleasure in treating their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
so uncivilly: And I blam'd their Pride so much
the more, the less I understood that it was a vertue
to be proud. Thus whither is it that we may not
be transported, when we unwarily deliver up our
selves to a Danger which we understand not, yet for
which we have a kindness! When I was alone, I
would be writing Letters to <hi>Blossac;</hi> and though I
knew not there was any harm in what I did, yet
I was most terribly afraid of being taken in the Act.
But it was impossible for me to be so cautious as to
preven<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it. Some of my Epistles were found, and
carri'd to the Abbess, who blest her self to see <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
so prevalent in a Girl of my years. She sent for
me, and ask'd me where I had learnt to write after
that manner? I knew not what answer to make
her, seeing her, as I thought, in such an angry Mood.
And my silence making her believe that I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
instructed, and more guilty then indeed I was,
she told me, I deserv'd to be buri'd alive for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
such Letters as those. Upon that I fell a blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering,
and pleaded for my self, that I did not
think there had bin any harm in writing after such
a manner. But she gave me such a Juniper Lecture
by way of answer, as open'd the eyes of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and soon convinc'd me of my Errors;
and I was so asham'd of what I had done, that I
began from that very moment to have as great an
aversion for <hi>Blossac,</hi> as I had kindness before. But
among all the Abbess's Pious Taunts, and Matron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sentences, there was none that made so deep an


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55945:10"/>
impression upon me, as her upbraiding me for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given a Man an occasion to believe I was in love
with him. She told me, there was nothing so
mean and despicable; and that Virgins who had
no more wit then so to expose themselves, were
the slight and contempt of those very Men by
whom they sought to be belov'd.</p>
               <p>This toucht me to the very Soul: So that I was
not so much afraid of the Scandals and other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
to which, as she assur'd me, I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
my self, as I was asham'd to have done a
thing, which as they told me, would make me the
scorn of the Person whom I lov'd.</p>
               <p>I resolv'd therefore not only not to write to <hi>Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac</hi>
any more, but never to see him agen. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
the same to the Abbess, and I consented to let
my Paper and my Pens be taken from me, to let
'em see that I had a desire, by my disdain, to make
amends for my overforwardness, which now I
blam'd in my self as much as they could do.</p>
               <p>The Abbess had reason to believe, by my inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
and submission to her Corrections, that there
was nothing but Innocence in what I had done.
However, she was one of those who will never miss
an opportunity to exalt their own Merit, and get
a Reputation for Zeal and Regularity, whatever
becomes of their Neighbours. This Lady, who was
never lookt upon to be one of the exactest Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in the World, inform'd my Parents of what
had happen'd, in hopes that they would judge, by
the Account she gave 'em of her Vigilance, that she
was not a Woman that would suffer any other then
Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> in her House.</p>
               <p>This was the first Stain that ever blemish'd my
Reputation, and which inclin'd so many People to
judg amiss of my Conduct; and doubtless the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55945:11"/>
of the Abbess was the cause of all my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
For had she known how to manage this
first Fault, I might perhaps have afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to whatever they demanded of me, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it.</p>
               <p>My Mother judg'd by those Letters, that I had an
inclination to Gallantry; which together with some
other Reasons that she had to make me a Nun,
made her give the Abbess a strict charge to mould
me for that course of life.</p>
               <p>The Abbess perceiving how much I endeavour'd
to obliterate the Fault with which I was upbraided,
believ'd the change of my Behaviour to be an effect
of my Repentance: She knew not that Pride was,
the cause of it, and that this Pride proceeded from
no other Reason, but because I would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd
by <hi>Blossac.</hi> It never came into her thoughts
that a Girl of no more then Thirteen years of Age
should be capable of such a refin'd piece of Cunning.
She believ'd I had quite forgot <hi>Blossac;</hi> and that
now being recover'd from that little Love-frenzy
of mine, I would readily yield to those Reasons she
should make use of to persuade me, that the only
Heaven upon Earth was a Nunnery.</p>
               <p>She told me that all my Relations knew what
had pass'd between <hi>Blossac</hi> and my self: And that
after such a Transgression they could not think of
marrying me; because no body would marry a
Maid who had bin guilty at my years of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treague:
That the Story had made a great noise,
and done me so much injury, that there was no
other way for me but to betake my self to a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Life. Then she made me a long Harangue
upon the Pleasures of Retirement; she flatter'd me
with hopes that I might suddenly come to be her
Coadjutrix, and that she would leave me her Abby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55945:11"/>
I was not so much a Child as not to see whither
all this tended; nor so much a Fool as not to know
that there was nothing but Innocence in the main
thing with which they upbraided me. And I as
readily found by the Abbess's Sermons, that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
had a great desire to make a Nun of me.
Now in regard there was nothing so remote from
my Resolutions, as the Sentiments which she strove
to infuse into me, I gave her this confident Answer,
That that same Gallantry which she inveigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so much, was not a thing so criminal as she
would needs persuade me. But though what you
tell me, said I, were true, yet if it be my Parents
absolute pleasure that I must vail my self, I make
no question but to obtain this Liberty from them at
the least, to make my choice of another House.</p>
               <p>The Abbess astonish'd at my Answer, and my
Resolution, endeavour'd to sooth me up, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
me she would talk no more of it.</p>
               <p>After all these Disputes I perceiv'd in my self a
violent desire to see <hi>Blossac,</hi> and to inform him of
every thing that the Abbess had told me. For not
doubting but that he would be glad to marry me,
and for that he was otherwise a Person suitable to
my humour, I thought I could not do better then
to renew my Friendship with him. I quite forgot
that petty Pride which I assum'd upon the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of our private Familiarity; nor was I afraid of
his despising me when I renew'd those Addresses
that seem'd requisite to recall him. And thus it
came to pass, that they restor'd me to my Passion by
the cares which they took to divert me from it.</p>
               <p>It was now near ten Months that he had heard
no tydings of me, from the time that I had told
him I would see him no more. He had endeavour'd
to penetrate into the motive that induc'd me to


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55945:12"/>
this change. But at length the Nuns having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him, that I had shewn his Letters, and that
I only made it my business to make him my Sport,
he was asham'd that he had ever had any kindness
for me. He took me for a Child, and for one who
had a Character of Inconstancy and Deceit, which
it became him to avoid; and with th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se thoughts
he resolv'd to forget me.</p>
               <p>He thought me unworthy of his Sedulities; at
what time I found a way to let him know, that I
desir'd to speak with him, and that I desir'd him
to come disguis'd to the Window of the Speaking-place,
where I promis'd to be at such an Hour. But
he receiv'd the Message with a disdainful smile, and
bid the Messenger tell me, he would come and see
me when I had learnt more wit.</p>
               <p>What a Rage was I in, when they brought me
this Answer! I began to believe what the Abbess
had told me, that forwardness in Persons of my
Sex always drew contempt upon themselves.</p>
               <p>I was sensible of all the mortification that could
cast down a Person naturally vain, when her Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is humbl'd to the lowest degree. I could not tell
what course to take to disingage my self from the
Trouble which I had brought upon my self. Prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by my Revenge, sometimes I sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e musing which
way to take away the Life of a perfidious Contemner
of my Favours; but then agen, condemning so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Resolution, nothing would serve me, but to
throw my self at his Feet, that I might regain him
by my Tears. In short, a thousand extravagant
Ideas rowl'd in my mind, which the reading of
Romances had furnish'd me withal, and which my
Youth confirm'd.</p>
               <p>After I had spent two or three Months in this
doleful condition, I fell into a languishing Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55945:12"/>
the cause of which the Nuns were ignorant of.
I admir'd the guidance of my Discretion at those
years. For I made no body the Confident of my
Grievances. And my vanity made me a Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler;
for I was too much humbl'd in my own Eyes,
to make my self lower in the Eyes of others.</p>
               <p>At length, overwhelm'd with grief, and not
knowing what to resolve, I made as if I had had a
liking to a Religious Life.</p>
               <p>This alteration in my Behaviour astonish'd the
Abbess and the Nuns, who mistook the irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Heart too much devoted to what it lov'd,
for the effects of Grace. Never did Virgin testify
a more ardent Zeal to take the Vaile upon her,
then my self. For I was impatient to try, whether
the noise of such a Sacrifice would not awake <hi>Blossac</hi>
to a recollecting himself: And on the other side, I
had before my Eyes the Honour which such a goodly
Action would procure me in the World.</p>
               <p>So soon as my Relations were inform'd of my
Design, they hasten'd me to take the Habit upon
me: And indeed considering the steps that I had
made, I could not well go back. However, I
found an Expedient to suspend the execution of a
Design which began already to terrify me. I told
my Parents, that I did not find they led such regular
Lives as I could wish, in the Nunnery where I was;
and therefore being desirous to renounce the World
in good earnest, 'twas my intention to make choice
among all the Nunneries, of one the most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere
that I could hear of.</p>
               <p>Now no sooner had I declar'd my resolution to
go to another House, but the Abbess and the Nuns
endeavour'd to dissuade me from taking the Habit
upon me in any House whatever. They told me
that I was not of a Constitution proper for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55945:13"/>
and some there were who made me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of their secret disgusts against Retirement.</p>
               <p>I ascrib'd all this good Counsel to the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Lives: Nor indeed was I at all troubl'd
to have found out new Reasons for my leaving their
Convent. I was therefore still importunate to be
carri'd to another Nunnery; my Mother also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd
with my desires; and so I left the Abbess and
her Abby, not knowing whether I had reason to be
sorry or to rejoyce.</p>
               <p>The Nuns no sooner saw me out of their House,
but they told me, like a company of Charitable
Baggages as they were, that I was a Coquetting
Slut, whom they were overjoy'd to be rid of; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did they fail to make my pretended Amorous
Intreague the subject of their Tittle-tattle to those
who were ignorant of it before.</p>
               <p>When I came to the Convent I had made choice
of, as well for that I was not yet Fifteen years of
Age, as because the Nuns had bin inform'd of all
the Reports which had been spread abroad concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, they thought it proper to defer the putting
me among the Noviciats, but only gave me the
Habit and Title of a <hi>Postulant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Convent seem'd to me quite different from
the other: For the Nuns liv'd all in a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity;
every one appear'd contented with her
Condition; there was a holy Emulation among
'em; and in short, they perform'd all their Duties
with an extraordinary Exactness. More then this,
the general opinion of their Sanctity had drawn to
their House Ladies and Virgins of the highest Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and they were so accustom'd never to frequent
other Houses, that they would not so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with a Lay-sister. They desir'd always to have
Prelates to officiate at all their Solemn Festivals, and


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55945:13"/>
never to hear any but the most famous Preachers.
Now whether this Affectation were altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from Pride, and all suspicion of Vanity, is a
question not so easily determin'd.</p>
               <p>One would have thought however, that being
so vain as I was, I should have agreed with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
where I met with so much Vanity; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that I had very little Piety, I scorn'd that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Vanity that sacrifices only to Rank and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew. I was only an Idolatress of that vanity
which Beauty and Merit inspire; with some kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
too for that other Vanity, to see my self ador'd
by the Person for whom I had an affection.</p>
               <p>And this Vanity made me still retain a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the Affront which, as I thought,
<hi>Blossac</hi> had put upon me: Nor did I so loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
as I said before, my Intention to be a Nun,
but only to try, whether the Noise of my Design
would rouse him to prevent it. But I heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of him; and in the mean time the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for me to take the Habit upon me, drew
near.</p>
               <p>Some few days before, my Father came to see me,
and putting the Question to me, whether I really
persisted in my Resolution to take the Veil, only my
Tea<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> made answer for me. By that he understood
more then I durst let him know. He told me,
he was glad I had not so much Zeal, as others
would persuade him I had, for a Condition
which he could not permit me to embrace,
as having resolv'd to marry me to a Gentleman
whom he had made choice of for me. He farther
added, That the Match was suitable to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Affairs, and that he was come to talk
with me about it. He did not name the Husband
whom he had design'd me; only he told me in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55945:14"/>
that he was a Person with whom I should
live happily, well descended, and of a good Estate;
but that the Business was to be speedily concluded,
and to be kept private from the knowledge of my
Mother; for that though the Match were never so
advantagious, she would oppose my Marriage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such an aversion as she had for my advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and absolutely resolving to make me a Nun.
He told me moreover, that to make sure work, he
had design'd to take me from the Convent by force;
and gave me an account what measures he had stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd
for that purpose.</p>
               <p>I had not so easily consented to my Father's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
but that I imagin'd at the same time, that
the Husband he had provided for me might be
<hi>Blossac</hi> himself. I had also some remnants of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
Notions rowling in my Head, which made
me believe that <hi>Blossac</hi> had an intention to make a
Knight-Errant Wedding of it, by some pleasing
surprise, which would be so much the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to my Humour. I ask'd my Father therefore
whether he were not the Man? And the manner
of my Father's refusal to explain himself, fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
me that it could be no other then <hi>Blossac,</hi>
Besides, I was so wrapt up with a belief of this
Fancy, that I durst not press my Father any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for fear of finding my self deceiv'd. So that
I only told him I should be ready to obey him in
every thing. Thus while my Mother was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for me a Religious Vail, my Father was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for me Nuptial Sheets. A thing perhaps
which never happen'd before, that two such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Ceremonies should be preparing at the same
time for the same Person.</p>
               <p>Some days after this Discourse with my Father,
he return'd to the Convent, bringing my Mother


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55945:14"/>
with him: And then it was that he desir'd her to
let him take me out from the Company, that he
might have the consolation of taking his last fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
of me, since he was after that to resign me
wholly to God and the Blessed Virgin. My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consented; and then my Father taking me by
the hand, while my Mother was talking with the
Nuns, led me into the Court. At the same time
three sturdy Fellows came to us, and taking me up
in their Arms, carry'd me without the Gate, and
then threw me into a Coach with six Horses. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the Coachman drove away, and I was out
of sight in the twinkling of an Eye.</p>
               <p>My Father being now to act his part, return'd
in a seeming haste to the speaking-Room, and with
an aire of Grief and Fury told my Mother a plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Story, such as his Invention had supply'd him
with, and then pretending a world of eagerness to
pursue the Ravishers, he flew to his own Coach,
leaving my Mother half maz'd, and the Convent
in such an uproar, as might well be the effect of so
strange and unexpected an Accident.</p>
               <p>My Mother, who suspected not my Father in
the least, accus'd <hi>Blossac</hi> to be the Contriver and
Author of This, and swore she would spare for no
cost, till she had obtain'd full satisfaction for this
Violence.</p>
               <p>On the other side, my Father, who knew better
then any body what was become of me, made the
Coachman drive this way and t'other way, till he
had almost tir'd his Horses, and then sending him
back to my Mother, bid him tell her that he was
going to take post in pursuit of me, according to
such directions as he had receiv'd from the Country
People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:55945:15"/>
In the mean time the Coach, wherein I was,
whirl'd it away full speed; never stopping till it
was toward night, that we came to a Place which
I was altogether unacquainted with, and where my
Father met us about an hour after our Arrival.</p>
               <p>As for my own part, during the whole Journey,
I could not find out for my life who the Lady, nor
the three Men were, that bore me company. They
answer'd to all my Questions, <hi>That my Father would
satisfy me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he arriv'd, he told me the Lady was a
Friend of his, whom he had desir'd to keep me
company; and that the three Men were honest Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and faithful Servants of his; how that he
would not leave me till he had deliver'd me safe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of my Husband, who liv'd at such a
Place, which he nam'd, and where his Estate lay.
All this while these Stories did nothing correspond
with my Imaginations that this Husband might be
<hi>Blossac:</hi> So that now beginning to find I was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
I conjur'd my Father to have pity upon me,
and not to sacrifice me to a Person for whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I might not have the least inclination. But
he only bid me have patience, and all would be
well. Thus we continu'd our Journey, and much
ado I had to resist the Mortal Inquietudes that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil'd
my Thoughts; though I did not altogether
despair of finding such a Person in my Husband,
whose Complacencies might make me forget
<hi>Blossac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time I observ'd, during our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that one of the Men that accompany'd me
would be always viewing me with a nice and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Eye; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> besides that, was very officious to
please me. Nevertheless, it never came into my
mind so much as to guess that he was the Person


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55945:15"/>
design'd to be my Husband. However he was the
Man. And when we were come within half a day's
journey from the Village whither we were travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he left us, without discovering who he was.
So soon as he was gone, my Father askt me, what
I thought of him? and whether he were not a
handsome Gentleman? And these Questions he
put to me after such a manner, that I knew before-hand
what he was going to say to me. However
I made him no reply to his Interrogatories, for fear
my answer should not please him. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he found by me, that I had no great stomach
to the person of the Man; however, after he had
acknowledg'd him to be the Husband he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for me, he told me, he had only left us, to
return agen and meet us in an Equipage more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his Quality. How are poor Maids to be
pity'd, when their Parents seek only their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the preferment of their Children! I will
now then tell ye the Reasons why my Father sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd
me to this Gentleman.</p>
               <p>He was the Son of a Counsellor of the Parliament
of his Province, who not having any inclination to
the Law, had purchas'd a very great Lordship, with
an intention to get it erected into a Marquisate.
Which being somewhat difficult to obtain, he had
recourse to my Father, who had formerly bin his
Father's intimate Friend, and who by his Credit
at Court procur'd him what he desir'd. His Estate
indeed was very considerable, and therefore he was
doubtless an Advantageous Match for a Virgin who
had no Portion.</p>
               <p>There was yet another Reason of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
that press'd my Father to marry me. For
this Gentleman, after he came to his Estate, had
lent my Father a Considerable Sum of Money; and


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55945:16"/>
he had so order'd his Business, that my Marriage
was to extinguish the Debt. 'Tis true, he did not tell
me all this at first; he only told me that he was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruin'd if I did not comply with his Desires. But
when he heard me conjure him not to precipitate
my Marriage, he thought it behov'd him to tell me
the whole Truth, with this farther Circumstance,
that my Mother knew nothing of the Debt, and
that she would be like a Mad-woman, if ever it
came to her Ears.</p>
               <p>I did not complain to my Father for seeking by
my Marriage to repair the Decays of his Estate; but
I could not forbear telling him, that I was sorry he
did not sooner let me know the Reasons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
him to marry me, for that I was persuaded
that if he would have bestow'd me upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss
of <hi>Blossac,</hi> he would have been as generous to
have engag'd the payment of the Debt upon the
same Condition. At which my Father fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and embracing me, My dear Child, said he,
thou dost not understand the World; we live not in
an Age, where Persons of Estates pay so dear for
their Wives.</p>
               <p>I reply'd, that he was not acquainted with <hi>Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac</hi>'s
Humour, and that if he pleas'd, before he
marry'd me, to make him the proposal of marrying
me upon the same Conditions that he gave me to
another, I made no question but that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
'em.</p>
               <p>I gave this Character of <hi>Blossac,</hi> because I lov'd
him; and not being able to conceal from my self
the Affection I had for him, I endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
my self, that the Good Qualities which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
in him, render'd him a Person worthy of my
love: And judging of his Sentiments by my own,
I imagin'd he would never refuse to obtain me at


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55945:16"/>
any rate whatever. Thus I forgat the Contempt
of which I had till then accus'd him: And I had
still the vanity to flatter my self that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have patiently endur'd my being marry'd to
another, had he bin inform'd of my Destiny. Upon
this, I desir'd my Father to let me write to him,
and to put off the Wedding till I receiv'd his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
But my Father told me I was a Chicken, to
imagin that a Man from whom I had not heard in
so long time, would impair his Estate to purchase
a Bedfellow. Yet such were still the vain Hopes,
wherewith I was wont to flatter my self in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
course of my Life: For I always had a
good opinion of those that lov'd me.</p>
               <p>In the mean time my Husband met us with a
Magnificent Train; and then, I must acknowledge,
he appear'd to me quite another thing then what
he seem'd to be upon the Road. So that after I
had for some time wistly view'd and consider'd him,
I felt no farther reluctancy to give him my hand;
and therefore making a vertue of necessity, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to make the best of my Fortue.</p>
               <p>We stay'd no longer in the Town where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
then to get all things ready for the Nuptial
Ceremonies: During which time I was visited by
all the Neighbours; and in regard my Father was
with me, no body ever dreamt that I had bin hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
away in a Coach and Six Horses to a stollen
Wedding.</p>
               <p>So soon as the fatal Knot was ty'd, we went to
my Husband's Lordship, where my Father left me,
having all the reason in the world to believe that
he had dispos'd of me to a plentiful and happy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He had before his departure written to my
Mother, that he had met with my Ravisher, and
had forc'd him to marry me: That I had bin more


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55945:17"/>
fortunate then prudent; for that I had suffer'd my
self to be forc'd from the Convent by a Person of a
great Estate, and of no mean Birth.</p>
               <p>My Father was desirous that I should approve
his writing to my Mother after that manner; and
that my being forc'd from the Nunnery should be
thought a Contrivance of my own. And this was
another Blot upon my Reputation, and of which I
too plainly foresaw the Consequences. For no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that saw my Father's Letter, question'd the truth
of my being stollen by force; and they as little
doubted that it was my Contrivance, because they
were ignorant that I was altogether a stranger to
my Husband at that time. Besides, my former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for <hi>Blossac,</hi> so well known, render'd all
that my Father had written too probable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd:
Nor was it any wonder that I should have so
much wit, at Sixteen years of Age, to manage a
Nuptial Amour, which was the only Remedy I
had to prevent my being lockt up in a Cloyster.</p>
               <p>Thus it fell out, that though I never deserv'd it,
I had all the Honour, or rather all the Shame of
this Intreague: My Wit was admir'd; but People
neither thought, nor spoke so well of my Prudence
and Conduct. The Story of my being taken by
force out of a Nunnery, was the Discourse of all
<hi>Paris</hi> for a long time, and every body told it after a
different manner. The Idea that all Persons had of
my Wit and Contrivance for the carrying on of an
Amoros Intriegue, shelter'd my Father from having
any hand in it. But the Relation it self of the Matter
of Fact was so remote from Truth, that I should
have deni'd it my self, had I heard it repeated;
for there was no disguise which they did not make
me put on to facilitate my Escape out of the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
insomuch that I was strangely surpriz'd to


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55945:17"/>
find that a certain Author, in a Book, wherein he
has the goodness to name me, should presume to
aver, that I was disguis'd in Man's Apparal, and
that I made my Escape in a Gardner's Cloaths.
Thus if there be but the least foundation for Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
she believes her self fully authoriz'd to publish
whatever Malice dares invent. And I am assur'd
that so many Scandalous Stories as are every day
made upon Persons of my Sex are only the effect of
this Malignity. But 'tis too early yet to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.
I have many other Adventures to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
wherein you will find that Slander has as
little spar'd me, though no more guilty, then in
this.</p>
               <p>One of the first, to whom the Story of my
being forc'd from the Convent, and my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
was told with all the most malicious
Circumstances that Publick Report could imbellish
it withal, was <hi>Blossac.</hi> Which when he had heard,
he seem'd to repent his refusing to meet me at the
Time and Place appointed. For he had no other
Reasons to forbear seeing me, then the noise which
our Letters had made; and not believing, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so young as I was, I could have Discretion and
Conduct enough to make use of all the Means and
Opportunities that might present themselves to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
our Private Meetings, he resolv'd to stay till I
had more Judgment. And besides, he was not well
satisfi'd with me, because he still conceited it was I
who had inform'd the Abbess of our private Amour.
At least it was this that he told me in excuse of
himself. For my part, I am persuaded, by what
happen'd after that, that from the time of those
Reports he ceas'd to love me, and that his
Flame did not re-kindle, till the noise of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forc'd from the Convent gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55945:18"/>
that I was not so much a Child as he took
me to be.</p>
               <p>However it were, when he understood that I
was marri'd to a Person much below him in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and inferior to him in Estate, he resolv'd to
find me out, not able to forget in what a passionate
manner formerly I was wont to breathe into his
Amorous Breast my Vows and Resolutions to be
always his. Nor was it an unusual thing for him
to visit the Province where my Residence was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Grandfather had bin Governor of it; and
for that the Gentry of the Country had a great
value for his Respect and Name.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55945:18"/>
               <head>Book the Second.</head>
               <p>WHILE <hi>Blossac</hi> was meditating the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of my Affection, I was wholly taken up
with the care of pleasing my Husband. Me thought
I lov'd no body but him, tho in truth I could make
daily discoveries, as well in his Disposition, as in his
Person, of those defects which in some measure stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd
my Inclination. He was a Man naturally given to
debauchery, and one who preferr'd Wine and Good
Chear before all other Pleasure. He would be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
fuddl'd; and in that Condition he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
offensive and disobliging in his Language. He
would be still upbraiding me, That instead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him a Portion, I had bin the cause of making
him part with some of his Choicest Acres: And
this Reproach he would usually throw upon me in
Public. All People blam'd him, and took my part
at those times; but there was no alteration; it was
not an Injury that was offer'd me now and then.
Nevertheless, I dissembl'd it so well, that I gave
him not the least occasion to accuse me of failing in
my Complacency and Respect for him. I led a Life
in the Country very retir'd; having only the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of one Gentleman that liv'd in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
a Person of Wit and Learning. This was
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de Balzac:</hi> He brought me to love Reading and
Study; and by his Advice I apply'd my self to read
more solid and substantial Authors then any I had
hitherto known; I found my self also well enclin'd
to learn the Languages, and to write with more


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55945:19"/>
exactness then the generality of Women. This
was both a diversion to me, and procur'd me much
honour in the Province; so that I became an Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
among the Wits, and Judge of their Works.
Now receiving so many Verses every day as I did,
it may well be thought that they were sent me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in my Praise; and among Sparkling Wits,
I'll assure ye, there were some that made love to
me in Verse. But I receiv'd nothing from their
hands, with which I did not make my Husband
acquainted; nor did I perceive that he had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Jealousy. But I did not long enjoy
this Repose. Some body inform'd him, that before
I was Twelve years of Age I had written Amorous
Letters to <hi>Blossac,</hi> which had made a great deal of
noise. Which made him believe, that having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
such an early inclination to Love, I must
needs retain it still; and being moreover conscious
of his ill usage of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a conceit came into his head
that I could not love him, and that therefore I must
have an Amorous Intriegue elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Nor was it long before he knew of whom it was
that it behov'd him to be jealous. <hi>Blossac</hi> was come
into the Province with some of his Friends; and
presently they came all together to pay me a Visit.
I was alone in the Castle: But it is impossible to
express in what a strange disorder all the motions
of my Body were, when I beheld the Man who
once had bin so dear to me. On the other side, he
seem'd to me no less embarrass'd then my self. After
the first Complements, his Friends commended the
Situation and Beauty of the Castle, and desir'd to
see the Apartiments. Which while they were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Blossac</hi> made a dextrous Escape from his Friends,
and having found a way to speak to me in Private,
he gave me to understand in the most tender Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55945:19"/>
in the World, that he had always lov'd
me, and that I could not in justice deprive him of
a Heart which I had formerly giv'n him. But I had
still so much power left as to conjure him never to
think more of me, at least, never to make me any
more Visits. Nor did I forget to forbid him to
write to me, fearing as I acknowledg'd to him,
that my Husband would have no good opinion of
any familiar Intercourse between us.</p>
               <p>While we were thus in parley together, my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
arriv'd, and it was no body's fault but his
own, if he did not perceive that <hi>Blossac</hi> and I had
both been weeping. I am apt to believe that he
was sensible of the disorder wherein he found us,
but he dissembl'd it, and all the rest of the day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean'd
himself with great civility.</p>
               <p>The Marquis of <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> was one of those who
accompani'd <hi>Blossac;</hi> and resembl'd very much the
Young Sparks of the Times: He was inconsiderate,
and lov'd to talk to Women without discretion. I
know not whether or no he had ever heard, that I
had once a kindness for <hi>Blossac,</hi> or whether it were
out of a humour to please himself by crossing my
Husband; but all the time we sate chatting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he would still be telling him, that I was the
most Beautiful Woman that ever he beheld in his
life; and frankly confess'd that he would make love
to me, but that I liv'd in a Province so remote.
However, because what <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> prattl'd was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in jest, my Husband took no offence at it. So
that when I saw that my Husband seem'd so well
to understand Ralliery, to remove that jealousy
which he had of <hi>Blossac,</hi> I resolv'd, though very
imprudently, to bestow the main of my Civilities
upon <hi>Sauveboeuf,</hi> and seem desirous to please him.
Wherein I did very unadvisedly; for <hi>Blossac</hi> grew


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55945:20"/>
jealous of it; my Husband's Suspicions were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
confirm'd; <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> lov'd me in earnest; and
all three took me for the Arrantest Cocquet in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>After our Company had left us, my Husband no
longer put any constraint upon himself, but began
to reproach me with what I had formerly done for
<hi>Blossac,</hi> and with what I had now done for <hi>Sauve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf;</hi>
he swore he would not be the Cully of my
Amours, and that I should never stir out of the
Castle.</p>
               <p>Some days after, he made a shew of having inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
one of <hi>Blossac</hi>'s Letters which confirm'd his
Suspicions. He had bin so cunningly malicious as
to compose the Letter himself: But I knew not
what to think of it: For indeed, notwithstanding
the Injunction I had laid upon <hi>Blossac</hi> not to write
to me, I was afraid lest he might have ventur'd a
Letter; and I found my self in a strange Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</p>
               <p>And here I will aver it with the same sincerity
with which I purpose to write these Memoirs, that
it was not so much what the Jealousy of my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
caus'd me to fear, that busied most my
thoughts in the sad Reflections which I made upon
my Destiny, as the consequence of an Amour, of
which I had formerly bin sensible, and which had
then got the mastery of my Heart. I was more
pleas'd to think that I was belov'd by <hi>Blossac,</hi> then
I was afraid of my Husband's Resentment. I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<hi>Blossac</hi> also for his imprudence in writing to
me: And lastly, Whatever seem'd to assure me of
his Fidelity, made a deeper impression upon me,
then all the Dangers to which he expos'd me. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
I will say thus much more with the same
sincerity, that I had no design in all this, contrary


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55945:20"/>
to my Duty. I was also prepar'd to suffer whatever
my Husband should inflict upon me. Nor did I hope
for any other happiness, then to observe a blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Humour, and to foster at the bottom
of my Heart the secret pleasure of loving another,
with so much the more fidelity, because I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to yield nothing to my Passion. What an
Example of Vertue should I have bin, had I had a
Husband endu'd with greater Prudence! But he
spar'd me so little, and took so much care to cry
me down, that Vexation and Despite made me
lose something of the delicacy of my Sentiments.
'Twas my Opinion that I might seek a means to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my Repose, provided I did nothing that could
bring reproach upon my Actions.</p>
               <p>My Husband's behaviour toward me, gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to all the Reports that were spread abroad at
that time: 'Twas believ'd he did not use me so,
without just cause: Nay, it was reported, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Visit which <hi>Blossac</hi> paid me, my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had surpriz'd me in the very Act.</p>
               <p>My Husband gave credit to that Scandal, and
conceited with himself, that it became him to treat
me as if I had bin guilty. So that the fear of being
oppress'd, made me study the most speedy way to
free my self out of his hands. To that purpose, one
of my Women, and my self, disguis'd our selves
in the Habit of Country Girls, and intermixing our
selves with the Workmen that wrought in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
we went out in the dusk of the Evening along
with them, and walk'd it to a Place where a Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quey,
whose Fidelity I had gain'd by Reward,
staid for us with Horses.</p>
               <p>After we had rode all Night, we came the next
Morning to a Convent, the Abbess of which had
promis'd me sanctuary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55945:21"/>
So soon as I was safe there, I wrote to my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
complaining of his Severity, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
me to betake my self to flight: And to my
Father, to inform him of the Reasons why I left
my Husband. I besought both the one and the
other to examine without passion whether I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
such usage. My Affection also tempted me
to write to <hi>Blossac:</hi> But I had strength enough to
resist that Temptation; fearing lest my Letter might
be intercepted, and produc'd as a Testimony to
prove me guilty, at a time when it so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
me to appear innocent.</p>
               <p>My Husband made me no return: But my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sent me word, that I had done ill to leave
him; that he would write to him, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him to take me home again; and that he
would not fail to be speedily with me, and be a
means to return me reconcil'd into his hands.</p>
               <p>How easy is it for People who behold the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of others only at a distance, to take that
course which then my Father took! I was so ill sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd
with his Letter, that I wrote him an Answer,
That I would rather dye then return to my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who being the first to accuse his Wife of a
Disorder, which he well knew she was innocent of,
had thereby acquir'd a right to misuse her when he
pleas'd.</p>
               <p>My Father to appease me, and at the same time
to convince me that I was in the wrong, sent me
a Letter which my Husband had written to him,
wherein he only complain'd of my little Affection
for him, without mentioning a word of those Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
and Suspicions which he had manifested to
me: Protesting on the other side, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ador'd me, and swearing that he would
spare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for nothing to make me forget the Causes


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55945:21"/>
which he might have given me to complain of
him.</p>
               <p>My Father was mov'd with the Tenderness that
appear'd in that Letter; and at first I was mollifi'd
with it my self; so little of evil did my Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and so easy would it have bin for my Husband
to have liv'd happily with me, would he have bin
so pleas'd himself. But at length, upon a review
of his Letter, I perceiv'd the Spirit of it, and I saw
well that his Softness was only an Artifice to surprize
me. And this confirm'd me more then ever in my
Resolution never to return home agen.</p>
               <p>All this while my Reputation was cruelly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd:
And then I began to understand, that of
all the Resolutions that a Woman, whether guilty
or innocent, can take, the worst is to leave her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
House. Yet after all, how prejudicial soever
this Resolution was to my Reputation, it seem'd
necessary for my Repose, and I was of opinion that
my Quiet ought to be more dear to me then my
Honour. Doubtless this was an Illusion: For the
one cannot be lost without the other: And an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Woman must never hope for repose, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects
the care of her Honour. Such are the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
to which we are reduc'd by Matrimony.
What Woman therefore would engage in it, did
she but consider, that there is no other remedy for
an unfortunate Woman, but to endure, without
daring to complain of her Sufferings, or seek the
means to avoid 'em?</p>
               <p>But in regard, that when I marri'd, I did not
apprehend it was my duty to render my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
I only made it my endeavour to set my self
at liberty. And I may also say, That the less ground
I saw for the Reports that were spread abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my Honour, the more Courage, and the


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55945:22"/>
greater Resolution I had to contemn 'em. But I
must also confess, that the more I was persuaded
that People had an ill opinion of me, the more I
accustom'd my self to slight the Probabilities that
might confirm it. I minded only to preserve my
self innocent. That was all the vertue and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which I propos'd to my self. Neither did my
Delicacy aim so far as to appear exactly what I was:
whether it were, that I despair'd of success, or that
the love of my repose made that Niceness seem to
me quite out of season. But in short, 'twas only
the obstinacy of People to cry me down, which
fix'd me in that disposition of mind. I wish that
Women, who are under the same Circumstances,
may not follow my Example; if there be any one
however that can do otherwise.</p>
               <p>But to let my Father see that my Husband's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was full of Artifice, I sent him a new Scroll
of all his severe Usage and Menaces with which he
continually worri'd me, and put me into hourly
Frights; and conjur'd him not to overwhelm me
with Despair, by obliging me to live with him
again. I must confess, that my Husband's ill usage
of me was not sufficient to authorize a Separation;
but it was too terrible for me to endure. I tremble
every time I think upon it, that he should threaten
to keep me lockt up in the Castle; and it raises my
Anger when I call to mind the injurious and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Language which he continually peal'd in my
Ears. More then this, I did not believe that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was bound to stay till utmost Extremities to be
separated from a Husband: Nor did I much mind
whether the Law or my Parents made the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
provided we might be parted.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I understood that my Father,
instead of returning an Answer to my last Letter,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55945:22"/>
was preparing to deliver me back into my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
possession.</p>
               <p>On the other side, my Mother, who was afraid
of nothing more then that I should return to <hi>Paris,</hi>
and put her to charges, wrote me troublesome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
wherein she gave me those admirable Lessons,
which I much question whether she would have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
her self, had she bin in my Condition.</p>
               <p>This made me take a Resolution which I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
at first; but which, after all, was that which
flatter'd me most, and of which the very thought
afforded me consolation in the midst of my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Afflictions. I wrote to <hi>Blossac,</hi> and gave
him an Account of my Condition, desiring his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Assistance. However, because I was still
afraid lest my Letter should be intercepted, I let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
fall from my Pen that might give him the
least hint that I had still a Passion for him. I only
seem'd to repair to him, as to a general Friend, not
knowing where else to address my self, But this
Precaution quite ruin'd me in the good opinion of
<hi>Blossac,</hi> or rather serv'd as a pretence for his Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.
For certain it is, that if he had always lov'd
me, he would never have quarrell'd with me for
making so little a shew of my Passion, because he
might well judge that I could not in prudence write
otherwise, considering the Circumstances I was
under.</p>
               <p>I have already told ye, that he was jealous of
my Civilities to <hi>Sauveboeuf.</hi> This Jealousy was
strengthen'd by the many Reports which my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had spread about to my Disgrace. For in all
Companies where he took pains to dishonour me,
<hi>Sauveboeuf</hi>'s Name was not forgotten. And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
naming of a Person who was fam'd for being
one of the greatest Intrieguers about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55945:23"/>
was enough to render the Calumny probable.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Blossac</hi> not finding in my Letter my former
tenderness of Expressions, believ'd me another
Woman; and that it was not out of inclination or
preference that I address'd my self to him, but out
of pure necessity. So that he was neither a Lover that
had the Tenderness, nor a Friend that had the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
to serve me. He return'd me an Answer the
flattest, the most spropositous, and the most offensive
in the World, reproaching me with my ill Conduct,
and my natural propensity to Coquettry. Alas! he
forgot that 'twas himself who had infus'd that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity
into me: And his Perfidiousness went so far
as to make that criminal in me, which I had only
done for his sake.</p>
               <p>I read over his Letter no less then ten times, not
being able to persuade my self that ever he could
have been capable of so much Ingratitude as to
write to me in that manner. But being fully at
length convinc'd of it, I ceas'd from that moment
to have any longer for him, I will not say, not
only the least Inclination, but the least Esteem. I
was astonish'd that I should be so long before I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it; and I repented that I had not taken a
Resolution to despise him, from the very time that
he refus'd to give me the meeting already spoken of.
This speedy change in my heart in reference to <hi>Blossac,</hi>
convinc'd me that there is not any Woman sensible
of her Honour, who is proof against some certain
Injuries. From that time forward I could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
either to see, or have any value for him. All
that I could do, in consideration of the Sentiments
which he had inspir'd into me, was only never to
name him. I know not whether all Women will
approve this speedy Resolution of mine to forget
him. But I can hardly believe there is any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55945:23"/>
so low-spirited, as to continue her Affection to
a Man that should forsake her in necessity, and under
a slight Pretence, when unfortunate only for his
sake. We may pardon Inconstancy, Fantastical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and even Injuries themselves, when they are
not the Character of a Base and Interested Heart;
but I cannot believe it other then a Crime to love
a Man who suffers a Woman whom he had lov'd,
and who craves his Assistance, to become a prey to
her Enemies. He ought to have serv'd me without
any hesitation, and that done, he might have chosen
whether he would have lov'd me or no. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in my opinion I did no more then what any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Woman would have done, in defacing him
out of my heart.</p>
               <p>So soon as I had receiv'd the foremention'd Letter,
and that it had caus'd so suddain a change in my
Affection all things, methought began to look with a
new face. I did not think my Husband's Behaviour so
hateful as it seem'd to be: I blam'd my self for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left him; and I expected the arrival of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with as much impatience, as fear of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him before. I found no reluctancy to submit
to what he had propounded to me; and I lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Misfortunes which I had so much dreaded, to
be no other then the effects of vain Terror. By
which we may see, that Love is that which gives
what Tincture it pleases to things; and that when
a Woman ceases to have a Passion for another Man
besides her Husband, she has courage enough, either
not to magnify the causes of her fear, or else not to
be afraid at all. How happy had I bin, had I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
these things sooner, and had always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
'em during the continu'd course of my Life.</p>
               <p>How great a power did my Father believe he had
over me, when he beheld me so submissive to what-
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>


                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:55945:24"/>
not how, from the Sparks that stopt him, came ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up with his Sword in his hand, and threaten'd
to kill me. Upon which <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> not believing
it safe to trust me in such rude hands, carri'd me
away by force, notwithstanding all that I could say
or plead for my self.</p>
               <p>Thus by the most unexpected Accident that ever
was, I found my self as it were torn from the hands
of my Husband, at a time when I began to love
him; and I became at the same time an Innocent
Occasion of new Stories and fresh Calamities to the
prejudice of my Reputation, when I was wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with a desire to have fix'd my self to my duty.</p>
               <p>What a noise did this Story make; and what did
not People say of me in the World! My Father and
my Husband made no question, but that it was a
Contrivance of mine which had engag'd <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi>
to this Act of Violence: And being so prepossess'd,
they made no wonder that I so readily consented
to my Reconciliation; and after this, my Father
no less readily believ'd whatever my Husband had
told him before. And indeed, Probabilities render'd
the Proceeding so Criminal, that neither the one nor
the other could well excuse me. And upon this
they were so incens'd against me and <hi>Sauveboeuf,</hi>
that without any consideration of their own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and my Reputation, they went to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
to make their Complaint to the Parlament.</p>
               <p>But they were not a little amaz'd to meet <hi>Sauve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf</hi>
there, who to justify me as I had desir'd him,
had follow'd 'em to that City. However, 'twas
in vain for him to lay before 'em, that I had no
hand in the Violence: For that was thought to be
an Excuse only to hinder the Prosecution of the Law.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Publick Report had spread
abroad a new Story, by which it was given out,


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55945:24"/>
that <hi>Sauveboeuf,</hi> having forc'd me from my Friends,
only to satisfy a transitory Passion, had left me so
soon as he had humour'd his loose Desires.</p>
               <p>What a troublesome thing it is to lie at the mercy
of certain Conjunctures! while every body takes
the liberty to vent Probabilities for truth; so that
it may be said that the good or bad Reputation of
Women depends upon the Circumstances of their
Adventures.</p>
               <p>Besides that <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> was well esteem'd in the
Parlament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and had very powerful
Friends, there was another Reason which hinder'd
my Father and my Husband from prosecuting this
Affair. Nor did <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> shun 'em, but waited
on 'em himself to give 'em an Account of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
and among other things he told 'em, that
the same day that he forc'd me from 'em, he carri'd
me back to the Nunnery which I left that Morning.
Certainly they must have bin most dreadfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd
against me, to question my Innocency after
that. For, in short, had I lov'd <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> in such
a manner as they seem'd to believe, and to that
end, had engag'd him to force me out of their
hands, most assuredly I would never have return'd
the same day to the Convent; I should have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
chosen some other Sanctuary; nor would I so
soon have taken care to justify my self.</p>
               <p>My Father and my Husband made a shew of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
credit to what <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> told 'em; and so,
quitting their Prosecutions, perhaps because they
thought they should get nothing by 'em, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to me, who stay'd all this while in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
But this Visit was quite different from the
former. They both of them distrusted me; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had I those kind thoughts of my Husband as
before, while I began to look on <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> with no
indifferent Eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55945:25"/>
Thus we quitted the Convent a second time:
But then I must acknowledge, I follow'd my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and my Husband with as much Reluctancy and
Sadness, as Chearfulness and Joy before this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Adventure.</p>
               <p>My Father staid with us a few days; and before
he left me, he prepar'd me for all the cold Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my Husband, which in a little time he
fail'd not to make me sensible of. I did all that lay
in my power to remove from my Father's mind all
those Suspicions, which my being forcibly carri'd
away had created in him. But he made me answer,
that nothing but my future behaviour could unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, and that if ever I gave him occasion to
be displeas'd with me again, I must never expect
to find any Protection among my Relations. And
thus I became expos'd to greater Misfortunes then
those which hitherto had befallen me.</p>
               <p>Some time after I found my self to be with
Child; and because it pleas'd my Husband to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that we had bin together near two days when
he came the first time with my Father to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
he imputed to <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> what he ought not
to have imputed to any but himself. Never had
Calumny a weaker foundation: For all the World
knew, that since my first acquaintance with <hi>Sauve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeuf,</hi>
he had never spoken to me but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Witnesses. But whether it were that my
Husband resolv'd to ruin me, or that it was his
pleasure to assert an untruth, he openly declar'd
that I could not be with Child by him.</p>
               <p>Then I foresaw all the Sorrows that afterwards
befel me. I wrote to my Father an Account of my
Condition, and of the Injury my Husband did me:
But, my Father di'd about the same time, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded
still to my disgrace, and became an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55945:25"/>
to my Misfortune, because his Death was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to my having broken his heart. Nor was
there any body now left to whom I could repair for
Succour, but my Mother, who perfectly hated me;
and for fear I should return home, was the first
that confirm'd my Husband's Suspicions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
into him thoughts of shutting me up in a
Nunnery.</p>
               <p>I shall not say anything how I liv'd after this with
my Husband. There is no need that the World
should be inform'd of my ill usage, to beget com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of my Misfortunes. My Condition was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make People apprehensive that never Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was more unfortunate.</p>
               <p>I also owe so much prudence to the Memory of a
Man whose Wife I was, to say nothing of him, more
then what I cannot dispence with letting the World
know: But certain it is, that I suffer'd whatever
Cruelty and Scorn could invent to torment a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>At length, in the midst of that despair to which
I was reduc'd; and dreading as well for my self,
as the Child in my Womb, all those dismal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
which I had reason to fear, once more I
thought it my best way to commit my self to the
Fortune of a second Flight. This Design of mine
I imparted to <hi>Balzac,</hi> who, as I said before, was a
near Neighbour of mine, and often came to visit
me. He advis'd me to go to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and
complain to the Parlament. This, no question,
was good Counsel, but my love for <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi>
would not let me follow it, and forc'd me to take
a bad Resolution. I went to the Marchioness of
<hi>R</hi>—For the vexation of having recourse to a
Rivaless did not so much prevail with me, as the
hopes of obtaining by her Assistance the succour and


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55945:26"/>
protection of a Person whom I lov'd: But I never
committed a fault in my life, for which I deserv'd
to be more severely rebuk'd, then this. Yet after
all, whither must a Woman carry her Complaints,
when she is altogether void of Succour, and has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a prevailing Passion in her Heart that blinds her
Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sauveboeuf</hi> was in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and the Marchioness,
as jealous of me and could possibly be of her, found
a means to render fruitless all the Letters which I
wrote to him, either by stopping 'em, or by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing
him against me. At least this was what I
imagin'd; not being able to persuade my self, that
a Man should testify so great a Passion for me, yet
never write me back one Answer, in such a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Condition as mine.</p>
               <p>Thus it was that I was well enough punish'd for
the choice I had made of the Marchioness's House.
Not that the Marchioness fail'd in any point of
Civility toward me; but on the other side, did
me a thousand good Offices: But in short, I suffer'd
my self to be beholding to a Woman who receiv'd
Letters every day from <hi>Sauveboeuf,</hi> while I could
hear no tydings what was become of him. I found
I was too unfortunate to have faithful Friends.
But as unfortunate as I was, I found my self vain
enough not to digest the seeing another so severely
preferr'd before me.</p>
               <p>I resolv'd therefore to quit the Marchioness, and
that I might conceal the motive of my Resolution,
I faign'd the Receit of Letters from my Mother,
who had sent for me to lye in at <hi>Paris.</hi> She believ'd
it; or else she dissembl'd the believing of it: And
so, though very near my time, I set forward in the
Road to <hi>Paris,</hi> not knowing where to lodge when
I came there: For I never thought that my Mother
would ever receive me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:55945:26"/>
I order'd therefore two Places to be hir'd in the
Publick Coach under another Name; and so I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
attended only by one of my Chamber-maids.
Now in regard that none of the Passengers knew
me, I heard my self frequently talk'd of during the
Journey. Nothing made more a noise in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
then this my second Flight from my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
House. 'Twas all the Discourse of the
Strangers in the Coach; and I had more then once
an occasion to be angry at the fooleries which they
prattl'd. There was one Man, whom I never saw
in my life, who averr'd that he was perfectly well
acquainted with me, and who not dreaming that
he was trifling in my presence, maintain'd, that it
was none of his fault that he had not bin one of
my Gallants. He affirm'd, that I had left my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to run after <hi>Sauveboeuf;</hi> and he added to all
the rest a thousand Abominable Circumstances. And
thus it is that we meet with People every day, who
corroborate Scandal by a false Honour which they
attribute to themselves; and who, that they may
seem to be privy to Affairs that make a great noise,
invent Particulars of which they pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the original Reason. I had a mind more then
once to have confounded those Calumnies by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
my self: But I thought it much better,
without making my self known, to take the Lady's
part, of whom so much ill was spoken.</p>
               <p>I was not ignorant that I was become the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Discourse; but I never imagin'd that Scandal
was arriv'd to that height, as I had reason to
know, to my cost, by the Things that were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of in my own hearing. Which shews us,
that how much vilifi'd soever a Woman may be,
she never thinks her self so much cri'd down as she
is. And therefore it would be very requisite some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55945:27"/>
that they who have given the World an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to censure their Conduct, should hear what
People say of 'em. Perhaps they might make a
better advantage of such a piece of Knowledge then
I did. For I believing that nothing could be charg'd
upon me, to the prejudice of that Fidelity which I
ow'd my Husband, whatever they said mov'd me
no more, then only to stir up within me a secret
desire of Revenge. Whereas I should have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that seeing outward Appearances afforded
Calumny such fair Handles to lay hold of, I should
have bin more circumspect to have avoided 'em.</p>
               <p>The heat wherewith I took the part of those
Ladies whom the Publick signalizes for Adventures,
won me the Friendship of a Young Gentlewoman
who rode in the Coach with her Husband. They
were Persons, who after they had resided for some
time in the Province where the Husband had a
very considerable Employment, were returning to
<hi>Paris,</hi> where they had left their Family. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was call'd M. <hi>Laval:</hi> And Mademoiselle <hi>Laval</hi>
was a Lady pretty enough to make me believe that
she was a little concern'd in my defence of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
However, they seem'd to live, both of 'em, in
perfect agreement, and their Union made me envy
their happiness, and bemoan the Fate of Young
Virgins of Quality who are sacrific'd to Interest.</p>
               <p>I had <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ill taken my Measures, and was so near
my Time, that I was forc'd to stop in a Little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
within a Day's journey of <hi>Paris.</hi> Mademoiselle
<hi>Laval</hi> would not leave me; but judging by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
that I was a Person of Quality, desir'd her
Husband that he would let her stay with me:
And he was so complaisant, as to give her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55945:27"/>
I was brought to bed of a Boy, who has since
made me amends for the Misfortunes of his Birth,
by his Merit, and the Reputation he has acquir'd.
But a Son, who has bin so much the more a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer
for my sake, because he never fail'd in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and Tenderness for a Mother, who too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet without being guilty, gave him occasion to
complain.</p>
               <p>I was three Weeks before I was able to sit up;
and all the while Mademoiselle never left me; for
which I oblig'd her to accept of a Diamond, as a
small recompence of her Care. Soon after her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
came to visit us, and seeing the Present I had
made his Wife, he offer'd me his House in <hi>Paris:</hi>
A kindness which I was willing to accept, till I
had sounded how my Mother stood affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
me.</p>
               <p>So soon as I came to my Lodging, I sent her, by
my Maid, a Letter, which I had written in such a
Stile as I thought most prevalent to mollify her Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duracy,
giving her an account of my being brought
to bed, and of the Reasons that forc'd me to leave
my Husband. But upon reading it, she burst out
into such a heat of Indignation against me, as no
way became a Parent, nor would she vouchsafe so
much as to ask where I lodg'd: Neither did my
Maid, seeing her in such a Chafe, think it proper
to tell her. All that the Maid could obtain from
her was, that she would receive the Child; and I
order'd it to be carri'd to her, with a second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which had no better Success then the former;
for she still refus'd to see me.</p>
               <p>This Severity of my Mother most cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd
me: And I thought to have appli'd my self
to my Relations: But fearing to find them no less
morose and inflexible then she, I resolv'd to let no


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55945:28"/>
body understand who I was but Monsieur <hi>Laval,</hi>
and Mademoiselle <hi>Laval;</hi> in hopes thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
'em to a continuance of their Cares. But it
had a contrary Effect. Monsieur <hi>Laval</hi> became jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
He imagin'd that the Friendship which his
Wife had shew'd me, had no other ground then
the conformity of our Inclinations. The Stories that
had bin told him in the Province, and what he had
heard in the Coach, made him believe me to be a
Woman that had neither Honour nor Conduct;
and thus assuring himself that I was a Person of a
lewd Conversation, he bid his Wife give me fair
warning to provide me another Lodging, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
her to have any farther familiarity with me.</p>
               <p>Mademoisel <hi>Laval,</hi> who had still a greater friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for me when she knew who I was, was at her
Wits-end, having receiv'd such absolute and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
Orders from her Husband: She told my
Maid, and she brought me the News.</p>
               <p>These unseasonable Tydings made me very unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy:
Nevertheless I told Madam <hi>Laval,</hi> that it was her
Duty to obey her Husband; and I made her a long
Sermon upon that Subject, stuft with Admonitions
and Lessons, which I had more reason to practise
then she. But this is not the first time that we
have seen People quick sighted in the Omissions of
others, that were always blind in the observance of
their own Neglects.</p>
               <p>She promis'd me, that whatever Lodgings I took,
she would find a way to come and visit me. Thus
I left Madam <hi>Laval</hi>'s House, and hir'd a Lodging
ready furnish'd; from whence I sent, time after
time to my Mother, that whenever she pleas'd to
hear me, and be a means that I might have justice
done, I would not refuse to return to my Husband.
But I was astonish'd, when instead of receiving any


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55945:28"/>
answer from my Mother, I understood that my
Husband was come to <hi>Paris,</hi> that he never stirr'd
out of her House; and that both of 'em spar'd for
no cost to obtain an Order from the King to shut
me up in a Cloyster.</p>
               <p>Fearing therefore lest they might accomplish their
Design, I resolv'd to lie conceal'd, till I could meet
some Person, under whose Protection I might have
justice done my Innocence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, my Money was almost all gone,
and I began to be afraid of Necessity and Poverty,
which are doubtless the severest of all Punishments,
when my Maid came to me with a great deal of
joy, and told me, that she had met <hi>Blossac,</hi> that she
had inform'd him where I lay, and that he had
promis'd to come and visit me the same day.</p>
               <p>Now that which fill'd my Maid with so much
joy, was her hopes that <hi>Blossac</hi> would offer me Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
for she was not ignorant of my Wants; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, a Person the least scrupulous of any in the
World, and would willingly have propounded to
me all sorts of ways to get Money, had she found
me dispos'd to follow her Counsels.</p>
               <p>I chid her severely for telling <hi>Blossac</hi> where I
lodg'd, seeing I had resolv'd never to see him more;
and at the same time, after I had paid my Landlord,
I remov'd immediately to another House, letting
no body know where I lay, unless it were Madam
<hi>Laval;</hi> resolving rather to suffer the Indignities of
Want, then to be oblig'd to so unworthy a Person.
All the while my Maid us'd all her Art, with a
world of Tittle-tattle to vanquish my unseasonable
Pride, as she call'd it, and quoted me a hundred
Women of as great Quality as my self, to convince
me by their Example, that I was not to refuse any
Relief when I stood in need of it. But at the same


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55945:29"/>
time Madam <hi>Laval,</hi> who guest at my Condition,
brought me Forty <hi>Pistoles,</hi> which she desir'd me to
accept. I perceiv'd she had sold the Jewel which
I gave her; so that I refus'd at first to receive the
Money. But judging by the manner of her present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, that she would think her self highly disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
if I refus'd her Offer, I compli'd with her
Kindness.</p>
               <p>As for my Maid, she endeavour'd to persuade me
to admit <hi>Blossac</hi> to give me a Visit, though it were
but once, and no more; and seeing she lost time in
Persuasions, she went her self to find him out, and
told him doubtless where I lodg'd: for he appear'd
to me like an Apparition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I least expected
him. 'Tis true, my Misfortunes had not alter'd
me in the least; and I was glad that he found me
the same as he had seen me formerly, that I might
make him the more sensible of the Entertainment
I resolv'd to give him.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>Laval</hi> was then in the Room, and was a
Witness of our Converse. So soon as he saw me,
he blush'd and turn'd pale almost at the same time.
Presently, at the first view of him, I rose up, and
going towards him, I ask'd him what his Business
was, and desir'd him to be gone. Nevertheless, he
would have put on an Air of Familiarity; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a coldness in my Reception, he laid aside
his Gayety, and ask'd me what I had to object
against him? I answer'd him, that I knew him
not; that in truth, I took him formerly for one of
my Friends, but that I had bin mistaken in him.
Now because he was conscious that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
me, he told me, that if he did not come to
my Assistance, he had Reasons for it, which he
hop'd would satisfy me, when I heard 'em. But
perceiving that I would not heark'n to him, he


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55945:29"/>
drew a Purse, which he desir'd me to accept; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
withal, that I might have occasion for it. I
refus'd it; he would have giv'n it my Maid; but
I forbid her so severely to receive it, that she durst
not disobey me. <hi>Blossac</hi> seeing me thus obstinate,
in a kind of fury put up his Purse into his Pocket,
and going out of the Room, in an insolent manner
told me, that the next time I wanted him, I should
come after him.</p>
               <p>I made Madam <hi>Laval</hi> acquainted with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I had to be offended with <hi>Blossac,</hi> and she
commended me for using him as I had done.</p>
               <p>She had a Kinsman that liv'd at the <hi>Hostel' d'
Epernon,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Morille:</hi> And one day
she took an occasion to talk to him concerning me,
and the Condition I was in. <hi>Morille</hi> was generous
and obliging: And for that Reason, compassiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my Sufferings, he spoke of me to the Duke of
<hi>Candale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke, to whom my Name was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
and who had heard talk of my Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
gave <hi>Morille</hi> Orders to wait upon me, and
to give Madam <hi>Laval</hi> two hundred <hi>Pistoles</hi> for my
present Occasions. Madam <hi>Laval</hi> was too much
my Friend, to conceal from my knowledge that
<hi>Morille</hi> acted by the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi>'s Orders:
And I was willing to be beholding to the Duke,
because I had reason to believe, that what he did
was only out of Generosity; of which I was so
much the more readily convinc'd, because he did
not seem to have any desire to see me.</p>
               <p>I must confess, I was not a little taken with the
Duke's Civilities; and a little thing perhaps would
have persuaded me not to have taken amiss a Visit
from him. But I understood soon after, that there
was something of Interest in his Generosity. For


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55945:30"/>
so soon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he understood that I had accepted his
two hundred <hi>Pistoles,</hi> he sent to me that he might
be admitted to kiss my Hand, which I could not
well refuse him. He spoke not a word that tended
to give me the least intimation of what he had
done; and always interrupted me, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me going about to testify my acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But though he were so diligent to prevent
my Acknowledgments of his Generosity, he affected
no less to talk of the Passion, which as he said, he
had for me: And I was bound to hear him, and to
believe some part of his Discourse.</p>
               <p>There was nothing in my heart that oppos'd the
Inclination that I had for him, but the necessity of
being oblig'd to him, under which I labour'd. Thus
by an odd effect of Scruple and Delicacy, the same
things, which having convinc'd me of his Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
had infus'd into me an esteem and value for
him, hinder'd me from resolving to give him proofs
of it. I must confess, that had I not bin beholding
to him, I am apt to think I should have had as
great an Affection for him as he protested Love for
me. But imagining with my self, that it would
be suspected my Passion was grounded upon Interest,
I took a Resolution to resist whatever might ripen
an Inclination for him. For this reason I answer'd
him in such a manner as might deprive him of all
hope; and I conjur'd him also never to see me
more, till I was in a condition to acknowledge his
Bounty.</p>

               <head>Book the Third.</head>
               <p>BUT the World is so persuaded that Women
are altogether govern'd by Interest, that the
Duke of <hi>Condale</hi> made no question of my having a
private Amour somewhere else. Which made him
talk to the Count of <hi>B</hi>—of my contempt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
as of a Novelty newly come into the World.
The Count, who was one of those that believ'd
there could be no honest Woman, told him that he
had bin a Cully to his own Generosity; and offer'd
to give him proofs of it. To which purpose he
resolv'd to enter into a strict acquaintance with me,
as well to undeceive the Duke, as to rank me
among his Heroesses. But he was mistaken in his
Aims; for he found nothing in the Reception I
made him, that was for his purpose, to embellish
his Memoirs withal. After I had refus'd to hearken
to a Person who had highly oblig'd me, it could
not be imagin'd I would be over hasty to flatter the
Assiduities of one who attempted my Vertue, to
make sport with it.</p>
               <p>At first he sent me Letters without any Name; as
if my Fortune had depended upon his Conquest;
and because he wrote better then another, he
thought I would be glad to entertain a Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with so witty a Lover. I found his Letters
very pretty; but I was not in a Condition to take
any delight in reading 'em: And when I saw
that he persisted in writing to me, I not only
refus'd to receiv 'em, but burnt those which I


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55945:31"/>
had already receiv'd, in the presence of Madam
<hi>Laval.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, the ill fate of those Letters did not
discourage the Count; and being inform'd of the
time and place where I went to Mass, he made his
appearance there several times; and because I
would not be seen to take any notice of him, he
accosted me. At what time after he had testifi'd to
me his extraordinary desire to be acquainted with
me, he talk'd to me of his Letters. I answer'd him,
that I had never read 'em; that the Business which
detain'd me at <hi>Paris,</hi> would not permit me to lose
so much time; and more, that I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
why he should pretend to so much Boldness,
as to write and talk to a Woman who had no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, nor ever desir'd to have any.
These words put him quite out of order; so that
he brush'd away from me, and went to tell the
Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> that I was not a Woman who
had common sense.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> laught at him for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and conceiv'd a greater esteem for me.
Nevertheless, he was not so eager to pay me his
Assiduities; but forbore to visit me, whether it
were that he despair'd to reape any fruit of his
Pains, or that he were naturally impatient.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Necessity press'd harder and
harder upon me every day. And though none of
my Relations were ignorant of the Wrongs my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and my Mother did me, none of 'em sent me
any relief. 'Tis true, that some of 'em were down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
with my Mother, and laid before her, how
much she was bound in Conscience to assist me;
but her Hatred suppli'd her with Reasons that
stopp'd their mouths. And then they cri'd, her
Mother knows more then we; there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55945:31"/>
in the matter, or else a Mother could never
be so cruel to her own Flesh and Blood. For it is
always a much more easy thing to condemn the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
then to afford 'em any Succour in their
Distress. Nevertheless there was a Lady who took
some compassion upon my deplorable Condition.
This Lady was the Dutchess of <hi>Chastillon;</hi> and tho
she were my Mother's Friend, she offer'd me both
her House and her Table. But by the unlucky in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of my Stars, all the Dutchess's Favours
and Bounty became fatal to her Reputation and
mine.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> was one of her Acquaintance,
and gave us frequent Visits. This Abbot the
Dutchess would be still obliging to make me Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents;
to which purpose she made use of a means
that put me to no little shame. We frequently
play'd all three together, and in regard the Abbot
never play'd but with a design to lose, I won con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably
every day. Nevertheless, Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon</hi>
not contented with having suppli'd me with
Money by this means, after she had one day won,
at the Fair, a Service of great value, she caus'd it
to be sold, and press'd me to accept the Money.
But the Abbot, who was desirous that Madam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> should be beholding to him for it,
bought the Plate again the next day, and sent it
her home to her House.</p>
               <p>This Piece of Gallantry made a great noise; and
because few People knew the motive of Charity
that induc'd the Dutchess to act in that manner,
they thought she had sold the <hi>Service</hi> merely for the
sake of the Money. And as for the Abbot, after
this, there was no farther question made of it, but
that he was in love with Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> and
that I was the Confident privy to the Intreague.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55945:32"/>
This Scandal spread abroad to that degree far
and near that the Dutchess was constrain'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
me from her House. And I parted from her
with all the Sorrow, that it was possible for me to be
sensible of, for having innocently given an occasion
to the Injurious Reports that had bin rais'd to the
prejudice of her Honour. And they made the same
interpretation of my Removal, as they had done of
her Bounty. For they gave out that I was only sent
away, because she perceiv'd that the Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi>
was in love with me. And indeed he was medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Secret Designs, which I discover'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>After I left Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> I put my self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Convent; and three days after the Abbot <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi>
brought me a Letter from her, wherein she sent
me word, that notwithstanding the Reasons which
oblig'd her to refrain my Company, she was still
my Friend: That it became me seriously to think
of forcing my Husband and my Mother to do me
Reason; and to the end I might have more liberty
to act then in a Convent, she had given order for a
House for me in such a Quarter of the City, where
she would take care that I should want for nothing.
I really-believ'd that this Letter came from Madam
<hi>de Chatillon:</hi> And being earnestly desirous to put an
end to the Disputes between me and my Husband,
I consented to what she had order'd in my behalf,
without any more ado. So that after I had return'd
her a thousand Thanks in a long Letter, I quitted
the Convent, and went to the House prepar'd for
me, in company with Mrs. <hi>Laval.</hi> For her Husband,
who was then in the Province, no longer minded
his Wife's coming to see me, so long as he perceiv'd
that I had found Protection and Support.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55945:32"/>
I found in this Lodging an Apartment very rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and modestly furnish'd, as also a Coach with the
Cyphers of Madam <hi>de Chatillon.</hi> I admir'd her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,
and often complain'd to her in my Letters,
that notwithstanding I receiv'd so many Favours
from her Bounty, I had not the liberty to visit her.
For I forgot to let ye know, that when we parted,
she told me 'twas not convenient we should visit
one another. I must confess, I never receiv'd any
Answers to my Letter; but the Abbot <hi>Fouquet,</hi> who
still undertook to deliver 'em, and who frequently
came to visit me, always brought me Compliments
and Excuses in the Dutchesses Name. However, in
a little time I began to consider, that the Abbot's
Visits were too frequent: But in regard he still
brought me news of Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> and that
he seem'd to visit me only upon the account of my
Business, I durst not desire him to forbear coming
so often.</p>
               <p>In this manner I liv'd for some time, without
dreaming in the least that there had bin any foul
play in these Civilities that were shewn; when
Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> one morning enter'd my Chamber, and
gave me to understand with tears in her Eyes, that
the Lodging where I lay, belong'd to the Abbot
<hi>Fouquet,</hi> and that it was the Publick Talk of the
Town, that he kept me. In a word, That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> was no way concern'd in any of
these Favours, for which I thought my self wholly
beholding to her Liberality.</p>
               <p>It is not to be imagin'd how much I was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
at this News. Methought I saw at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
instant every thing that I had not the wit to see
before. I made no doubt but the Things which
had bin told me, were true; and I admir'd how I
could be so palpably cheated. Presently I flew to


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55945:33"/>
Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s House; but so soon as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
she came towards me, and loading me
with Reproaches, bid me be gone out of doors
immediately. This Reception seiz'd me with
amazement; I fell into a swoon, from which they
had much ado to recover me: I ask'd in vain to
speak with Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> but she refus'd me
admittance, and sent me word again to make haste
out of her House. This Usage having too sadly
convinc'd me of the truth of what Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> had
told me, I resolv'd to return no more to that Fatal
House; but went directly to the Convent which I
left some Weeks before: But the House refus'd to
admit me: And I found by the Language which
they gave me, that I alone was ignorant of the
Trick that had bin put upon me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Laval,</hi> who knew me to be innocent of all
this, gave me the best comfort that she could; and,
I believe, that had it not been for her, I had stabb'd
my self. She carri'd me to one of her own Friends,
where she left me, till she went to fetch away
such things as were properly my own; but more
especially to seek for the Letter wherein M. <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon</hi>
had offer'd me the Lodging. There she met
the Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> in a heavy toss to know what
was become of me. She told him that I was fallen
ill at a House where I intended to have spent the
Afternoon, and that they had put me to Bed. He
really believ'd what she told him to be true, and
desir'd Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> to be his Guide to the Place
where I was; nor could any thing that she could
say to be rid of him, prevent his coming along
with her: Neither indeed was she unwilling that
he should see me, to the end I might school him for
the injury he had done me. But so soon as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him, my Tears that were but newly ceas'd,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55945:33"/>
burst forth again: I had not strength enough to speak
a word. So that Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> beholding me in that
Condition, told him the true Reason of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>But the Abbot with a smiling Countenance bid
me be of good chear, assuring me that nothing had
bin done but by Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s Order: And
to prove the falshood of all those things which had
bin told me, he alledg'd the Respect which he had
always had for me.</p>
               <p>I was so cast down by the Troubles and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
attending this Adventure, that I listen'd with
delight to the Assurances which he gave me, that
all was but a false Alarum. So true it is, that in
overwhelming Misfortunes we lay hold on every
Bough to save our selves. But in short, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
which the Dutchess of <hi>Chatillon</hi> gave me, no
way agreed with the Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi>'s Oaths: So
that without examining any farther, whether it
were true or no, I desir'd him to refrain all manner
of Visits for the future. He obey'd me; still
protesting at his departure, that he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> had order'd him
to do.</p>
               <p>So soon as he was gone, I immediately sent away
to Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> the Letter which had bin the
cause of so many bad Effects. Which Letter the
Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> had devis'd on purpose to decoy me
into his Lodging, with a design to have told me
more of his mind when opportunity should assist
him.</p>
               <p>However, Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> being persuaded
that I had acted by consent with the Abbot, as yet
continu'd to harbour a Conceit that I had contriv'd
the Letter in my own justification; nor would she
begin to do me justice, till she saw me persevere in


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55945:34"/>
my Resolution never to return to that Lodging
again. But afterwards the Abbot himself fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiv'd
her, by confessing that he had counterfeited
the Letter, to the end I might be in a Place where I
might be more at liberty to look after my Affairs:
Adding withal, that he had not made use of that
Artifice, but only to oblige me to accept of the
Lodging.</p>
               <p>But the World judg'd otherwise of the matter:
For it was the publick Discourse, that I had bin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in an Amorous Intriegue with the Abbot, but
that being weary of me, he had turn'd me out of
his House. And thus I underwent both the Shame
and Mortification to be lookt upon as a Mistress
abandon'd by her Gallant.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Fouquet,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
in vain to undeceive the Publick. All
the Favour which they, who believ'd I left the
House by my own Choice, did me, was to say, I
had not done it, but to avoid the Prosecutions of
my Mother and my Husband.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that They, no sooner both of 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that I lodg'd in a House that belong'd to
Abbot <hi>Fouquet,</hi> and which he furnish'd for me at
his own Charges, but they presented a Petition
against me, and they were just upon the point of
obtaining leave to seize me when I left those Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
I had notice of it, and I thought it my best
way to conceal my self. For I suppose that no body
would have advis'd me to have deliver'd my self up
to the Hatred of a Mother, and the Jealousy of an
Enrag'd Husband.</p>
               <p>So soon as Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of my Innocence, she employ'd all her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Friends in my behalf; and she had enow
to procure me an Injunction to stop all farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55945:34"/>
against me. By this means she set me at
liberty to appear and sollicit a legal Separation from
my Husband. She recommended me to a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
who promis'd to assist me, and who took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself the management of my Business. I had
also a yearly maintenance of a Thousand Crowns
allow'd me by Decree, which secur'd me from the
Gripes of Want; all which I should have done at
my first coming to <hi>Paris.</hi> But though I could have
spar'd for no pains, how could I ever hope to have
brought it to pass, when I had neither Protection
nor Friends?</p>
               <p>The Magistrate with whom Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>
had brought me acquainted, provided me a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the House of one of his Kinswomen; where
he came to me every day, and gave me an account
of what he did for me. So that I blest my self that
I had got for my Friend a Person whose Zeal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
so fervent. Therefore it was that I wholly
reli'd upon him for the management of my Affairs;
and gave my self up to enjoy the Repose which I
had bin so long depriv'd of.</p>
               <p>But this Magistrate had another aim; for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
gave me an occasion to discover that my
Person was no way displeasing to him; nor was I
at all alarum'd at his good Opinion. On the other
side, I was extreamly glad of it; imagining that
his Zeal being enliven'd by Love, my Business
could not go amiss.</p>
               <p>He had a proper handsome Son already in the
King's Service, and who went by the Name and
Title of Marquiss of St. <hi>Albe:</hi> He was brisk, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,
and witty; he came frequently to his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman's
House, where he had a fight of me, and
soon became his Father's Rival.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:55945:35"/>
The method of Courtship which these two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
took was very different. The Son always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful,
durst not open his Lips to speak of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
The Father embolden'd by the Services he
did me, never scrupl'd to discover his love to me.
I then began to repent of delivering up into his
Hands the whole management of my Suit; but 'twas
now too late. He was become master of it; and
I could not be without him.</p>
               <p>I therefore lent him a patient Ear, and heard
with moderation a Language which my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
had render'd odious to me; and I forbore all
manner of Ralliery to a Person, whom it became
me to be careful of displeasing. Nor could I put
him quite out of hopes, for fear of exasperating
him against my Interests; believing that by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in suspence, I should engage him to serve
me: But this Conduct of mine produc'd a contrary
effect. He persuaded himself, that since I heard
him with so much calmness, I had an inclination
for him; and with these thoughts he redoubl'd
his Assiduities, and press'd me to declare my self. I
must confess, that till then, I saw no great harm in
his Addresses, which were rather a diversion to me.
But now I began to dread the Consequences of
such an Amour. And indeed, considering these
new attacks upon my Reputation, I had reason to
be of this opinion, That whatever good Intentions
a Woman might have, it was always dangerous to
her Honour to suffer her self to be belov'd.</p>
               <p>His Sollicitations became so earnest, and his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
so pressing, that I knew not what course
to take, that I might be rid of him. My first
thoughts prompted me to let him plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the vanity of his Hopes: But then considering
he was a Person I stood in need of, I alter'd my


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55945:35"/>
mind, and took a Resolution, which in truth I
ought not to have taken. For I made him believe I
was not insensible of his love, and constrain'd my self
to suffer it with some compliance. This way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
augmented his foolish Hopes, and within a
few days after he had the boldness to let me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
as much. Had I not bin restrain'd by Honour
and my Duty, yet my aversion for him would have
preserv'd me from offending: For the Extremities
wherewith I was threaten'd, seem'd to me less se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
then the Compliance which he demanded. So
that I gave him all the Ill Language that Anger and
Contempt could inspire into my thoughts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
him to meddle no more with my Business.
And to the end I might wholly disingage my self
from him, and deprive him of all opportunities of
seeing me, I was preparing to leave his Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
House; when a new Accident befel me.</p>
               <p>The Young Marquiss of St. <hi>Albe</hi> was belov'd by
a Damsel that waited upon his Mother; I know
not what pass'd between 'em; but this Maid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that her Lover began to neglect her since
his acquaintance with me, she resolv'd to watch
him. Now it happen'd one day that she found a
most tender and passionate Letter which he had
written, with a design perhaps to have put it into
my hands. However it were, the Maid ne're que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd
but that it was intended for me; and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
me for having got her Lover away from her,
in the height of her malice she resolv'd to answer it
in my name; wherein she made me write whatever
was proper to make the World believe that I lov'd
<hi>St. Albe</hi> as much as I was belov'd by him. And to
suppress all proof of the falshood of the Letter,
which was none of my Hand, she gave it out that
I had reasons for what I did. This was but a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55945:36"/>
Contrivance: However, it pass'd among those
who only sought to put me to trouble.</p>
               <p>The Maid, who made use of this Stratagem,
was not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gnorant of my being belov'd by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her Galant, because she was her Mistress's
Confident, who being naturally of a jealous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
had the Curiosity to have her Husband
watch'd; and you may be sure she was nothing
sorry to have an opportunity to plague him. She
therefore jeer'd him every day with his affection for
me; and to let him see how unfortunate he was in
his Courtships, she shew'd him the Letter which his
Son had written to me, and my pretended Answer
to it. The Father, who was already jealous of his
Son, was fully convinc'd of the truth of his Amour
when he read those Letters. He never troubl'd
himself to examine a Story that was so sillily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd;
but overjoy'd that he had got proofs of the
secret correspondence between me and his Son, he
resolv'd to observe no measures of civility with mee,
and flew out into a most violent Rage against his
Son. In vain his Friends persuaded him to more
mild and gentle Sentiments. This unnatural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who by his Credit, and his Office, had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
enough to bring about his unjust Designs,
threw his Son into Prison, never considering the
indignity of such usage. For in short, <hi>St. Albe</hi> was
already an Officer, had Courage, and was well
esteem'd in his Regiment. Nor was he content
with punishing <hi>St. Albe;</hi> but comes to me on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to affront me. He upbraided me with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching
his Son, and let go a Torrent of
Injurious Language, and as he went out, told me
that I deserv'd no less to be sent to some House of
Confinement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:55945:36"/>
I thought at first that he himself had counterfeited
those Letters on purpose to pick a quarrel with me:
Afterwards I accus'd his Son to have bin the Author
of 'em; believing, that in imitation of some Young
Sparks, he might have fram'd 'em, to give himself
the Reputation of a <hi>Fortunate Gentleman.</hi> I was labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the violence of these various Agitations,
when the Magistrate return'd to me again. It seems
he had consider'd that I had said nothing in my
own vindication; and therefore it was probable he
would have heard what I could say for my self. But
I receiv'd him with all the disdain imaginable. But I
scorn'd to undeceive him about the Letters, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
he seem'd to me in his Behaviour. I only
bid him be gone, and trouble me no more with his
Impertinences. The next day the Maid, who had
bin the cause of all this Disorder, seeing <hi>St. Albe</hi> in
Prison, mov'd with the misfortune of her Lover,
came to me and confess'd what she had done: And
upon her promise to confirm her Confession to me
before his Father, I sent for him again. Nor was
he long absent; verily believing that I had sent for
him back to make my peace with him. He heard
the Maid's Recantation; but he would not believe
her; at least he counterfeited Incredulity. He
ask'd me, in derision, how much I had given her to
make that Confession; farther adding, that he was
no Fool to be put upon by my little Artifices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>When the Maid was gone, and he saw me alone,
he told me, there was but one way to prevent the
noise that he was going to make in the World;
that he needed not to interpret what he meant;
for that I knew well enough what it was he desir'd.
'Twas in vain to tell him, that the course he took
to gain my Love, was the only way to make me
hate him. He continu'd obstinate in his imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55945:37"/>
Pretensions; telling me, that men of the Long
Robe were not Persons that us'd to be foil'd in their
Undertakings. In short, he forc'd me by his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Language, to return him as bad; to which he
repli'd with Menaces and Reproaches, swearing as
he went out, to acquaint my Mother and my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
with my Irregular Actions.</p>
               <p>I went immediately to give the Dutchess of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon</hi>
an account of every thing that had past. She
spoke to the Magistrate, and with a great deal ado
obtain'd so much favour from him, as to promise
her that he would make no noise, nor shew my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Letter which he had in his custody. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Villain told the Dutchess so many plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Stories concerning my pretended Intriegue with
his Son, that she firmly believ'd him; so that I was
forc'd to endure the Sermons that she preach'd to
me upon Folly and Indiscretion. 'Twas in vain to
assure her that the Magistrate was a wicked Fellow,
and that I resolv'd to stay no longer in his Kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
House. She lay'd before me the need I had
of him, and scar'd me with the fear of his Revenge.
I found my self then reduc'd to a necessity of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling;
so that we patch'd up a Reconciliation,
upon condition that he should speak to me no more
of his Passion. He promis'd me so to do, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
not to keep his word, and more obstinate then
ever to make an ill use of the need I had of him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Unfortunate <hi>St. Albe</hi> took
a resolution to write to me, and begg'd of me that
I would endeavour to procure his Liberty. Mov'd
therefore with his Sufferings, and forgetting the just
Reasons I had to refrain from medling in his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I listen'd to my Compassion. I sent impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to his Mother the Letter which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to me, and wherein he made me a lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55945:37"/>
of his Ill usage. I made no question but
that her heart would have bin mollifi'd with read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; but she was more jealous then compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and preferr'd her desire to embroil me again
with her Husband, before the care of delivering
her Son from his oppression. She shew'd her Son's
Letter to her Husband; which prov'd the cause of a
new Prejudice against me. For the Father reassum'd
his first Fury, and swore he would ruin me, if I did
not shun his Revenge by satisfying his Passion. I
likewise acquainted Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> with this
Accident, who blam'd me for receiving and show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Letter; and told me I must get out of
this Labyrinth as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Now then to get rid of the Magistrate, a certain
Stratagem came into my head that brought me into
new trouble. I made a shew of surrendring to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
and I promis'd him a meeting the next
day at a Place appointed. But I went the very same
day to his Wife, and made her acquainted with her
Husband's Follies, and the meeting wherewith I
had flatter'd his Hopes. I thought it might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me, considering my Circumstances, to take
this Course, seeing that his Wife had let loose all
her fury against me; and gave out that I had as
much kindness for her Husband, as indeed I had a
real aversion for him.</p>
               <p>I thought, to the end I might undeceive her, that
it would be my best way to inform her of what
pass'd between us; which I did, withal desiring her
to give our meeting an interruption, and affording
her all the opportunities of doing it.</p>
               <p>This Woman, who imagin'd that this was not
the first meeting I had given her Husband, thought
at first I had entrusted her with a false Secret; but
at length she was convinc'd of my Sincerity. She


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55945:38"/>
thank'd me then for the Advice I had given her,
and assur'd me she would do what I desir'd. But
her mismanagement of the Affair turn'd the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
means which I made choice of to disincumber
my self from my Persecutors, to my prejudice.</p>
               <p>I was hardly arriv'd at the Place appointed for
my meeting the Magistrate, but she appear'd, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
along with her two other Relations, who were
to be Witnesses of this Adventure.</p>
               <p>This Scene would have been a diversion to me,
had I not thought, that they who were to be Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of her Husband's Shame, might be likewise
Witnesses against my self; and that it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but that an Affair that would be known to so
many People, must expose my Reputation after a
most cruel manner. The Wife also, who would
have it thought that this was not the first time her
Husband had broke his Conjugal Covenant, instead
of informing her Witnesses that I had acquainted
her with the Assignation, told 'em quite the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and bestow'd upon me a liberal share of the bad
Language which she gave him. The Husband all in
confusion sneak'd out of the Room without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a word: At what time I thought the least thing
the Wife could have done would have bin to have
given a fair Testimony of my Innocency to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom she brought along with her. But she was
as wicked in her Generation, as her Husband was
in his; for she upbraided me before their faces with
debauching her Husband. This Adventure present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took wing, and the Publick that already had a
prejudice against me, made no scruple to believe me
engag'd in a re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l Intriegue with the Magistrate.
However, I did what I could to undeceive the two
Kinsmen; and they listen'd to me, believ'd me,
and offer'd me their Protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:55945:38"/>
The Husband, who had not the least suspicion of
my informing the Wife of the Rendevouze, came
to see me the next day. But then I told him, I durst
not be seen with him any more; conjuring him in
the midst of those Extremities to which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
me, to let me understand the condition of my
Affairs, since I could not in honour employ him any
longer. He bid me not to trouble my self; for he
would serve me to the end; that the Adventure the
day before was a trifle; and that his Wife was a
kind of Beldame, to whom no body gave credit.
Then he renew'd his Importunities to answer his
Desires: But he no longer talk'd like a Master; nor
was I any more afraid of him. Of all this I gave a
faithful Account to Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> who order'd
me to leave my Lodging with the Magistrate's Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and fell out with the Magistrate himself in
such a manner, that she would never suffer him to
come near her more.</p>
               <p>But understanding after this, that his Wife had
never surpriz'd him at the Assignation, but by the
Information that I gave her, he would not let go
his hold, resolving to ruin me, or vanquish my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>St. Albe</hi> found a way to break
Prison; upon which his Father, who was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
troubl'd at it, and knew not what was become of
him, came to acquaint me with it; and talk'd to
me as if I had had a hand in his Escape; and it was
true that it was so reported abroad in the World.
For his Father gave out these Reports to scare me,
in hopes to overcome me by dint of Defamation;
persuaded that I would at length take off my Mask,
when I saw my self lost in my Reputation. And
this was the only hope wherewith he flatter'd his
Passion for me. But the more he strove to defame


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55945:39"/>
me, the less occasion I thought I had given, and
the greater was my comfort to find my self inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent:
For God had giv'n me the grace to look so
many Misfortunes in the face, without losing my
Reason. I defended my self from the Accusation of
having contributed to <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Escape, and justifi'd
my self with so much the less trouble, because I was
ignorant of the means he had made use of.</p>
               <p>And now the Father resolv'd to make his last Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
for obtaining what he had bin so long desiring
with so much importunity. To this purpose he
came to give me notice that my Husband was just
upon the point of obtaining a Sentence in his Suit
that would be nothing for my advantage; but
that he alone had a Trick to delay Judgment, and
that he would assist me in such a manner, that I
should gain my Cause, if I would heark'n to his
Suit. I answer'd with disdain, that I would with
patience wait the end of my Business; and that
how unhappy soever my Destiny were, I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chuse to be unfortunate, then purchase my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
by so foul a Crime.</p>
               <p>The Lodging where Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> had
plac'd me, when I left the Magistrate's Kinswoman,
was a House which had several Lodgers that were
not acquainted one with another. I had the first
Apartment, and I had no converse with any of the
People that lodg'd in the House. As for Mrs. <hi>Laval,</hi>
she liv'd with her Husband, who was return'd from
his Province: 'Tis true, that she frequently visited
me, and that was all the comfort I had. At the
same time also I hir'd the Maid again that I brought
with me from my Husband's House, and who left
me when I went to live with Madam <hi>de Chatillon.</hi>
I must confess, 'tis a pernicious thing to the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a Young Woman, to keep Servants so full


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55945:39"/>
of Mercury as she was. And it should be the first
care of a Person of my Sex to avoid entertaining in
their Service wild and disorderly Wantons, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be too familiar with Servants, how modest
and regular soever.</p>
               <p>This Maid had many ill Qualities, as will appear
by the sequel or the Story. Nor had she ever seen
<hi>St. Albe.</hi> which was the occasion of an Adventure
which may seem fabulous, but which fell out as I
am going to relate it.</p>
               <p>My Maid having frequently heard how eagerly
the Magistrate persecuted me with his impertinent
Courtsh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p contriv'd an Enterprize which she never
imparted to me.</p>
               <p>She had already got acquaintance with the People
of the House; and one day she told me, that there
was a very pretty Lady among the rest of the Lodgers
who every day very diligently enquir'd after my
health; and manifested an earnest desire to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with me. I bid her be sure not to bring
her to me; for that I resolv'd to have no converse
with Persons that I knew not, having reason to be
afraid of every body, in the Condition I was in.
Nevertheless my Curiosity led me one day to take a
view of her from my Window. 'Tis true, I had
not time to examine her well: However, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
something in her Countenance which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
was not unknown to me; but I could not
remember where I had seen her.</p>
               <p>All this while my Maid had lai'd a Design in her
head, which she resolv'd to put in execution, while
I spent the Afternoon with Mrs. <hi>Laval.</hi> She went
to the Magistrate's House, and after she had ask'd to
speak with him in private, she told him, that my
unkind usage of him was only to try his Constancy:
And moreover, that it was no wonder that I had


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55945:40"/>
so scornfully rejected him, since he never made me
any Present: That Women were byass'd by Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
assuring him that his Courtships would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to me, provided he would be but liberal.
In short, That if he desir'd that I should comply
with his Addresses, he had no more to do, but to
come the same day to my Lodging. The Magistrate
promis'd not only not to fail, but to bring Money
along with him. The Maid, having thus taken her
leave, went to the Young Gentlewoman before
mention'd, and propos'd to her that she would be
pleas'd to admit, under my Name, and in my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
the Visit of a certain Gentleman, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was very diverting to me; telling her withal,
that if she would do me that kindness, I should look
upon it as an infinite Obligation. The Lady made
some Scruples at first, but at length accepted the
Proposal. She suffer'd 'em to dress her in one of
my Habits; but still while she was dressing, she
would still be laughing, as if she had found a Mare's
Nest. She demanded also the Name of the Man that
was to come; but the Maid gave her a wrong
Name, which really satisfi'd the Gentlewoman,
to do whatever they desir'd of her, but still laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and telling him that she was never cut out for
an Actress.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Old Fornicator of a Magistrate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd;
at what time the Maid going to meet him,
and taking him aside, gave him to understand, that
before he was to be introduc'd into the Apartment
where I was, I desir'd him not to meddle with the
Window Shutters, but to let 'em be as they were;
adding withal, that I had order'd her to take the
Money, because it was beneath her to ask for it.
Presently he put a Purse into my Maid's hand, and
enter'd my Apartment with all the Joy, which the


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55945:40"/>
hopes of a Blessing, from which he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not far remote, could inspire into him. At the
same time there was so little light in the Chamber,
as would hardly admit the distinction of Objects.
However, he could perceive a Young Person, that
seem'd to him to be very handsome; and being so
prepossess'd as he was with the Idea of his Pleasure,
he never suspected in the least any Trick to be put
upon him. He accosted the Lady; but finding her
as mute as a Fish, and that he could not get one
word out of her Mouth, he began to distrust his
Good Fortune: But though she would not speak,
as busy as he was about her, he thought he heard
her laugh: Upon which he stept to the Windows
to let in the Light; but while he was fumbling
about the Shutters, the Lady having open'd the
Chamber-door, was going to fly for't. Which the
Lawyer perceiving, more nimble then she, laid hold
of her; but seeing her Face stood motionless, as if
he had seen a <hi>Medusa</hi>'s Head; while the Lady
wrests her self out of his Hands, and ran up into
her own Apartment.</p>
               <p>Down came the Magistrate, and having got his
People about him, up stairs he went again, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Son to be deliver'd into his hands; his
Son, who lay conceal'd in the House in Womens
Habit.</p>
               <p>All this while my Maid thought verily that the
Magistrate had bin stark staring mad; for she was
utterly ignorant that the Lady, whom she had got
to act my part, was the Unfortunate <hi>St. Albe.</hi> For
it seems that after he had escap'd from the Place
where his Father had imprison'd him, he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
himself in Womens Habit, and was come to
lodge in the same House where I lay, in hopes that
being thus secur'd from the Persecutions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55945:41"/>
he might meet with an opportunity to offer
me his Service.</p>
               <p>The Magistrate having caus'd the Chamber-door
to be broken open, <hi>St. Albe</hi> was deliver'd into his
hands in the same disguize he had on; that is to
say, in my Cloaths. What a dreadful Accident was
this for me! Though an Angel should have descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Heav'n to have born witness of my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
he would not have bin believ'd. 'Twas
known that <hi>St. Albe</hi> had a love for me; and he
was found lodg'd in the House where I lay, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd
in Female Habit, and in Cloaths that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to my self. Could any body believe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
but that all this was done by Consent. What
a folly was it in <hi>St. Albe,</hi> since he had taken a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to lye at my Lodging, that he did not
sooner make himself known? or at least that he did
not refuse to comply with what was desir'd of him?
But he never dreamt of his Father's coming, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after the Maid had giv'n him a wrong Name:
Besides, that his Love made him look upon the
man, for whom the Cheat was intended, as a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
upon whom he was willing enough to revenge
himself.</p>
               <p>During this Hurly-burly at my Lodging, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
my Maid, whom I order'd to come to
me. But being quite tir'd with staying for her, I
desir'd Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> to accompany me to my Lodging.
When I came there, the Neighbours told me the
whole Story of this Adventure; and my Maid not
coming, I thought her afraid to see my face.</p>
               <p>They who heard this Story, made no question
but that it was a Contrivance of mine. They
thought it had bin a Device of mine to make sport
with the Magistrate; and gave it out, that I had
done it after a very facetious manner; but at the


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55945:41"/>
same time, they shrewdly suspected that <hi>St. Albe</hi>
and I were agreed together; and thence inferr'd that
I was an ill Woman for betraying him in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to his Father. In short, They thought me to
be of the Humour of those Amorous Dames, who
care not what becomes of their Lovers, so they may
but satisfy their Revenge, or their Divertisement.</p>
               <p>However, the Consequences of this Affair were
not so pernicious to me as I imagin'd. The
Magistrate was advis'd not to make any noise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he could not do it, without making himself a
Laughing-stock to the whole Town: And therefore
he only gave out, that understanding his Son lay
disguis'd in the House where I lodg'd, he only went
to fetch him thence.</p>
               <p>By this means I found my self deliver'd from a
hateful and importunate Lover. He had no mind
to make love any more to a Woman that knew how
to play such Tricks as those. So that he only hated
me from the bottom of his heart; and the weight
of his fury fell upon his Son, whom he caus'd to
be more closely confind.</p>
               <p>All this while my Suit remain'd in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
still; for the Magistrate did nothing for me;
and Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s Interest so far prevail'd,
that neither my Mother nor my Husband could get
any ground upon me. She had so order'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that none of the most famous Advocates would
meddle with the Cause; but still answer'd my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
when they came to entertain 'em, that it
was a Cause no way proper for the Bar; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be ended by a Friendly Accommodation:
But because we could not agree upon the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there was nothing done on either side. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I still enjoy'd my Allowance without seeing
either Husband or Mother; though 'tis true, that


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55945:42"/>
I took all the care I could to avoid their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>What was become of my Maid all this while, I
knew not; nor was I at all sorry to be so rid of her,
till I heard how ill a use she made of her Absence
to my prejudice: For in all Places where she came,
she would be always bespattering my Reputation.
And I will tell ye one Adventure, by which you
will fully understand the Character of this same
wicked Baggage.</p>
               <p>She then perceiving that nothing made the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
so mad as to be impos'd upon by one of his
own Sex, made sure of a handsome young Female,
and persuaded her to take my Name upon her. And
thus it was, that she offer'd me to several Young
Sparks at the Court, as a Woman whom necessity
had reduc'd to seek her Subsistence by this way of
living. Among the rest, she address'd her helf to
<hi>Blossac,</hi> and told him, that I had bin a slave to my
Reputation, which was the only Reason that made
me refuse the offer of his Purse; but that I would
not be so haughty, when I thought my self secure
from being known; and provided he had so much
discretion as to make a show of being a Stranger to
me, that he might assure himself of success. Now
in regard that <hi>Blossac</hi> had never done me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to have any great respect for me, he readily
gave credit to the Wenches fair Story; and desirous
to revenge himself of the Inconstancies which he
laid to my charge, he accepted the Proposal, with
a design to insult over me. This was doubtless his
Intention, because he told the Maid that he would
bring some of his Friends along with him, when he
gave me the meeting; resolving they should be Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
with him in his good Fortune. <hi>Blossac</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
told his Friend of it, and his Friend told


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55945:42"/>
another, and so it spread insensibly all over the
Town.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> whom I sometimes met at
Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s, was astonish'd at the Reports
that were spread about concerning me, and was so
civil as to believe 'em false. He also inform'd Mrs. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
of what he heard, who besought him to let her
know his Authors; and he confess'd ingenuously
that <hi>Blossac</hi> was his Intelligencer.</p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>Blossac</hi> had given the Duke an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Discourse between him and my Maid;
and having also told the Place and Day appointed
for the Meeting, the Duke knew not what to think
of it; but being desirous to be convinc'd of the
truth, he requested <hi>Blossac</hi> that he might accompany
him to the Assignation.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> acquainted me with what the Duke of
<hi>Candale</hi> had discover'd to her; nor did we know to
whom to impute a Story so extravagant. I confess
the first motions of my Imagination accus'd my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and my Husband, whom I saw persisting still
so obstinately in their Resolutions to ruin me. But
all this while there was nothing of certainty in Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
               <p>In the midst of these Perplexities Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> and
I were debating which way to put a stop to these
violent Calumnies, when word was brought me
that the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> desir'd to speak with me.
I was glad of the opportunity, in hopes that he
might give me some light into these Mysteries. He
enter'd: But seeing that he only talk'd to me of
general Matters, I interrupted him, and ask'd him
the meaning of the many Reports that so terribly
attackt my Reputation, and of which he had alreary
bin talking to Mrs. <hi>Laval.</hi> Then he up and told
me what had pass'd between him and <hi>Blossac,</hi> with a


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55945:43"/>
farther Account of what had pass'd between <hi>Blossac</hi>
and my Maid. Adding, with a smile, that he came
to see whether I was at home or no; because he had
bin told I was to have bin at another Place; and
that <hi>Blossac</hi> stay'd for him to carry him to the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
At length he concluded, that he would still
make a show of believing as they did, that he would
meet <hi>Blossac,</hi> and go along with him, and that he
would send me word who they were that made use
of my Name.</p>
               <p>I was overjoy'd to become Mistress of the means
that would so suddenly enlighten me into these
dark Secrets that had so much disturb'd my Rest:
And I begg'd of the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> to give
me all the clearest Informations he could, that so I
might cause <hi>Blossac</hi> to be surpriz'd in company with
the Person that had assum'd my Name. I told him
of what importance it was to my Reputation, that
this Affair should be made clearly out, and conjur'd
the Duke to do me justice. He promis'd me; but
he told me withal, that it would be much more for
my Honour that my Husband should surprize <hi>Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac;</hi>
because it could not be thought but that he
knew of the Reports as well as others; that he
would go immediately and give him notice that I
had given <hi>Blossac</hi> a meeting, and that it would be
no body's fault but his own if he did not surprize
me. I approv'd the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi>'s Design; and
so leaving to him the management of all things, I
took my leave of him with as much joy, as I was
overwhelm'd before with sadness and amazement.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> so well order'd his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that my Husband and my Mother had notice
of the Assignation before he met <hi>Blossac.</hi> And the
People whom he employ'd to carry 'em the News,
would not let 'em be at rest, but peal'd it in their


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55945:43"/>
Ears, that there was no time to be lost: Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they wanted no Spurs, as believing that this
Adventure would put an end to their Process; and
therefore they resolv'd not to let me escape 'em this
bout.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> returning
to <hi>Blossac,</hi> told him, that an Accident had fallen
out, so that he could not possibly go along with
him. <hi>Blossac</hi> therefore seeing no other remedy,
went all alone to the Place appointed, while the
Duke follow'd him at a distance, and kept himself
conceal'd in the Neighbourhood, resolving to be a
Witness of what happen'd. As for my Mother and
my Husband, they were so indiscreet as to tell all
the World that now they had me safe: So that the
noise of their Design ran like Wildfire from one end
of the Town to the other; insomuch that they
were attended by a Train of several Persons, that
laught in their Sleeves to think they were going to
be the Spectators of a strange Sight; that is to say,
of a Husband, who was going, as he thought, to
convince himself of being a Cuckold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blossac</hi> was met by my Maid, and he was hardly
enter'd the Room where the mistaken Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
stay'd for him, but my Mother and my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
with all their Troop, were close at his heels.
Upon the noise they made, out came my Damsel:
She was known, and when they saw her, they made
no question I was not far off. Presently the Doors
were forc'd open; but then, to tell ye who lookt
most like a Changeling of the Two, when they
saw themselves both mistaken, would be too hard
a Task for me to undertake; 'tis only for you to
imagine. My Mother dropt out first, my Husband
sneak'd out after her, and <hi>Blossac</hi> follow'd him,
looking all like People upon the News of a great


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55945:44"/>
Loss at Sea. So soon as they were gone, the Duke
of <hi>Candale</hi> arriv'd, and gave order for seizing my
Maid and her Coadjutrix; and after he had given
farther order that they might be secur'd, he made
haste to my Lodging to acquaint me with the issue
of the Adventure.</p>
               <p>I was in hopes this disappointment my Husband
had met with, would have bin a sufficient Proof of
my Innocency, and of the little ground he had for
all his Suspicions and Surmises; and I lookt upon
this Adventure as a finishing Stroke, that would
have put an end to all my Misfortunes. But People
made another interpretation of it. They cri'd, that
all this was but a Trick of my own nimble Wit;
and that my Maid, by agreement with <hi>Blossac</hi> and
I, had drawn my Husband and my Mother into this
Snare, to make it serviceable toward the gaining of
my Cause. In short, the less reason they had to
believe I had a share in it, the more convinc'd they
were of my having a hand in it, and the better
they judg'd it carri'd on: Every body laught that
heard of it, and I only, by it, reap'd the Applause
of being a Woman of Wit and Address. But that
was not the commendation that I sought: I desir'd
only that I might have my due. But 'tis impossible
when a Woman is engag'd in Concernments that will
admit of two Interpretations, to avoid the worst, and
enjoy a happy Reputation; 'tis not enough for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of my Sex to govern her self according to the
Rules of Wisdom and good Conduct; there must
be nothing that will cary two Senses in the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of her Life: A Woman must needs be always
guilty, when Innocence has need of so many Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
Happy those Women who are not expos'd
to these Inconveniences. A smooth even way of
living is the only thing in the World which they


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55945:44"/>
ought most of all to desire; and they ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom
themselves betimes to look upon Intriegues
and Adventures as the Rocks of their Repose and
Honour. I my self confirm'd the Tour which was
given to this Story, by my compassion upon the
two Confederates in Custody. For being persuaded
that I had no more need of Proof to justify my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
I thought 'em Objects of my Pity; nor
could I endure to hear of the Punishments that
were threaten'd to be inflicted upon a Maid that
had serv'd me: So I order'd her to be set at liberty,
together with her Accomplice. I must confess, I
could not have committed a greater Act of Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and never was Compassion more unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For then, with much more reason then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it was adjudg'd that the Maid had acted by
my Orders, when it was known that I was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of her Release.</p>
               <p>I advise no body therefore to do as I did: This
Creature became so forgetful of my goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, that she was afterwards always the first
to raise and spread about the Town a hunderd ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Stories of me. A Woman who has Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
that expose her Reputation, ought to cause
'em to be punish'd without mercy.</p>
               <p>My Husband about the same time return'd into
his Province; whether it were that he could not
brook the shame of his last Adventure, or that he
thought his absence requisite to make me hearken
to an Accommodation; for he began to be a weary
of lying alone; and since I had found Money and
Friends, my Mother, who could not endure the
sight of me in <hi>Paris,</hi> had persuaded him, that it
was for his Interest to be reconcil'd, and live with
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55945:45"/>
For my own part, I could not take a better Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then to consent to such a Reconciliation, had
it bin only to turn the last Story to my advantage.
The World would doubtless have more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that I had no hand in it, had I immediately
after return'd to my Husband. Well then, he sent
a Gentleman to me, one of his Friends, whose
Name was <hi>Montalzac,</hi> with Orders to make me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fair Propositions, if I would forget what was
past. Nor did he only entrust that Gentleman with
this Negociation, he also employ'd an Ecclesiastic,
who was a Famous Director. But these two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
instead of forwarding this Accommodation,
put it farther off, by the different Methods which
they took.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montalzac</hi> had not seen me above twice, before he
gave me to understand he was in love with me, and
that the only motive that induc'd him to labour a
Reconciliation between me and my Husband, was,
because that being his Neighbour, it would be the
more easy for him to visit me. As for the Director,
he troubl'd me with long Discourses that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
to me: He would be proving in Mood and
Figure, that I could not in Conscience live a-part
from my Husband; and he repeated so many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging
Stories about my ill Conduct, that he made
me mad. I answerd him, that I had nothing to
do with his long Sermons, and sent him away with
great indignation. He was not accustom'd to be
so rudely handl'd; but on the other side, had the
Reputation of an Oracle in all Pious Negociations
which he undertook. So that he lookt upon me as
a Reprobate: And after he had left me in a kind
of Passion, he went and gave out in all Companies
where I came, that my heart was harden'd, and
that I would dye in my Iniquity. Of all the People


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55945:45"/>
that ever attack'd my Reputation, no body did it
with more malice, nor more elaborately then this
devout Ecclesiastic. He thought he did God good
service in defaming me; and I quickly found my
self become a Prey to the fury of False Zealots,
who cri'd out that I was a Gangreen'd Member that
was to be cut off from the rest of the Body. Such
sorts of Zealots are never to be employ'd in Affairs
of the same nature with mine; at least they ought
to be instructed before they go to work, that Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Patience are the most approved means to
obtain success; and operate much more effectually
then the Transports and Invectives of an over-pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
Zeal. 'Tis a strange thing that they, who,
by reason of the Confidence which their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
demands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought to be the most sparing of
the honour of their Neighbour, should be, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
they are, the first that rend and tear it with
most inhumanity. A Director, by vertue of his
Office, will never pardon those by whom his Zeal
is ill receiv'd: And Zealots, like the Person whom
we speak of, are seldom soft and charitable, but
when they are flatter'd and applauded.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Montalzac,</hi> so soon as he had discover'd his
Passion to me, I began as soon to suspect all the Advice
he gave me: And for fear that by admitting his Visits,
he might think I had some intention to flatter his
Hopes, I told him, I would acquaint my Husband with
his audacious discovery of his Amorous Sentiments
to his Friend's Wife: And that notwithstanding my
real Inclinations to an Accommodation, I would
defer it till he had a more faithful Friend for his
Neighbour. <hi>Montalzac,</hi> fuming, to see himself so
disdainfully rejected, resolv'd to observe all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to inform my Husband of every step I
took; which he did exactly; but still setting out


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55945:46"/>
the most innocent things in what Colours he pleas'd.
Thus let a Woman be never so discreet and wary,
'tis impossible she should avoid the stroaks of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
and Calumny, when she is so unfortunate as to
be belov'd by wicked People.</p>
               <p>While they were thus labouring to reconcile me
to my Husband, I had a greater desire then ever to
be parted from him. The Protection of Madam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> had procur'd me the same Favour from
Monsieur the Prince. I must confess, that had I
not bin so powerfully supported, I should have bin
more willing to have hearken'd to my Husband's
Offers; but all that came near me, persuaded me
against 'em; some out of Interest; others because
they would not give themselves the trouble to let
me see the inconveniences of a Design, wherein I
ran the hazard of ill Success. And indeed there are
few real Friends, that know how to give Women
those Counsels which are most agreeable to their
real Exigencies. There was no body but Mrs. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi>
who thought it unfriendly to flatter me. She
told me every day, that I could not take a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Course then to live with my Husband;
and insisted that it behov'd me at least to hear the
advantageous Offers which he made me. But I was
not then in a condition to relish the solid Reasons
with which she supported her wholsome Advice.
The ill Usuge which so good a Woman daily suffer'd
from her Husband, made me afraid of the like from
mine. I had not as yet learnt the Lesson she had
done, that the Reputation of a Woman is never
secure, when she lives asunder from him, whom
God has once united to her. On the other side, I
thought I should be happy if I could obtain a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and this was that which I only thought
it my duty to labour for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55945:46"/>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> had still recourse to me under the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of his Father; nor can I deny, but that the
respect with which he always accompani'd his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for me, made me very desirous to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him. I imputed all his Father's ill usage of
him to my self: I was mov'd that he should so long
disguize himself for my sake; and moreover, I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
him all reports to which he had expos'd me,
in favour of the pleasing Vengeance which he had
given me the occasion to take upon his Father's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.
I was also good-natur'd; and tho as yet I
fe<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>o motions of affection for him, however I had
too <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>t an esteem for his Person, to refuse him
whatever I could in civility contribute toward the
making of his Life less miserable. To sum up all
in a word, I did not think it was a crime in him to
love me, and I thought that an Amour which was
no way offensive to me, could be no inducement to
hinder me from doing that, which I would have
done out of generosity. Thereupon I spoke to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> in his favour, lay'd before her the
sad condition of the Young Gentleman, and begg'd
of her to make use of her credit in his behalf. She was
well pleas'd that I took his part; however at the
same time she made me sensible, that it would be
another blot upon my Reputation, should it be
known that I had any hand in serving him. Which
made me request her to procure <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Liberty,
yet so that I might not be seen in the business. In
short, Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> spoke to Monsieur the
Prince, who obtain'd an Order for his Release,
and at the same time procur'd him an Employment
in the Army better then that which he had before.</p>
               <p>It was presently the Publick Opinion that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> had never procur'd <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
had it not bin at my request. But give me


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55945:47"/>
leave to question whether I was to be blam'd for
concerning my self in his behalf. The Delicacy
which I ow'd my Reputation, did not require me to
be insensible of the misfortunes of a Person, who
for his merit and his Youth was worthy of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
There was not any body but my self to whom
he could have recourse; and I never repented of
the service I did him. Whatever occasion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it gave to be objected against me as a Crime,
it had bin a great piece of Cruelty to have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<hi>St. Albe</hi> in that deplorable Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was; especially when it was in my power to
relieve him. How careful soever a Woman ought
to be of her Honour, I am of opinion that 'tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for her to do a good Action. And when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is defam'd upon those accounts, she is only to
complain of certain unhappy Circumstances that
sometimes will not suffer Women to do good
Actions unpunish'd.</p>
               <p>So soon as <hi>St. Albe</hi> was got safe out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Clutches by the Credit of Monsieur the
Prince, Publick Rumours gave it out more then
ever, to be an effect of the love that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us. This was what his Father spread
abroad in all Companies; and <hi>Montalzac</hi> was no
less diligent to inform my Husband of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Report. Which oblig'd me to a steady Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
never to see <hi>St. Albe</hi> more: And though
I did not think I had deserv'd any thing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
for having procur'd his Liberty, yet I
thought it my duty to avoid a sort of Visits which
would have drawn a Scandal upon me with much
more justice.</p>
               <p>But <hi>St. Albe</hi> had a heart as generous as my self;
and as the injury that I might do my self in acting
for him, had not hinder'd me from being serviceable


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55945:47"/>
to him; he on his side could not believe, that the
wrong which his Gratitude might do me, was a
sufficient Obstacle to hinder him from shewing it.
He thereforefore several times by the Sollicitations
of others begg'd the favour of admitting him but
to one single Visit: But finding me obstinate in
my denial, he resolv'd to see me whatever it cost
him. 'Tis true, I had better have given him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
at first without so much opposition; but
my Nicety prov'd prejudicial to me upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p>At the same time Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> went to
her Signiory of <hi>Marlou,</hi> whither I accompani'd
her, and where the Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> came often to
visit us. Certain it is, that Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>
would never have suffer'd his Assiduities, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was unwilling to displease a man who
had too much Credit at Court, which is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that she was not so guilty of Coquetry, as a
Scandalous Memoir would make her. She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
convinc'd, since the Adventure of his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that the Abbot had a kindness for me; which
was the reason perhaps that she carri'd me along
with her to <hi>Marlou;</hi> in hopes that the Abbot would
be more then ever my Servant, or at least that she
might put upon my Account the frequent Journ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
that he made to <hi>Marlou.</hi> I conjectur'd her
Design; but I was so highly beholding to her, that
I was willing for her sake to expose my self to
whatever could be said of me; and I think I had
reason to do as I did. There are certain Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that will never permit us to be ungrateful;
and I should have thought it a ridiculous piece of
Niceness to have oppos'd Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
I thought it sufficient if I did not contribute
by my ill Conduct to the Sinister Constructions


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55945:48"/>
which the Journey might produce, if at least such
Complacencies might be allow'd of without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
In a word, I set my self above all Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
These are also Circumstances which it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
for a Woman to be engag'd in; and where
a Woman cannot do a good Action without losing
something of her Honour. But what must she do!
She must either renounce the World for good and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
or else resolve to meet with these Inconveniences
sometimes.</p>

               <p>WHILE we stai'd at <hi>Marlou,</hi> the Lord <hi>Digby</hi>
who had hir'd a House in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
thought himself oblig'd to pay a Visit to
Madam <hi>de Chatillon;</hi> but this Visit was attended by
so many others, that presently a Report was spread
about, that my Lord was in love with her; nor
was she sorry it should be imagin'd that my Lord
bent all his Assiduities to her: For then she was in
hopes it would not be nois'd about that she had any
kindness for Abbot <hi>Fouquet,</hi> when she hearken'd to
another.</p>
               <p>The Abbot, at his first coming to <hi>Marlou,</hi> said
nothing to me that seem'd to make me any way the
Object of his thoughts. But so soon as he perceiv'd
that my Lord was in love with Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi>
he was desirous to try whether she would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
some effects of her Jealousy. I understood
his Intentions by the continual Complaints he made
of her to my self: And it may be well believ'd that
I had no desire to comply with his faign'd Affection
for me. But the more I was resolv'd to give him
no Answer, the more I imagin'd it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for me to carry my self civilly towards him.
This engag'd him farther then I intended; and
things came to that pass, that I thought my self
assur'd that he lov'd me really. I resolv'd therefore
not to keep him in suspence: For I told him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that all his Pains would be in vain. But then I
found by Experience, that a Woman hazards her


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55945:49"/>
Reputation no less by giving marks of a Passion of
which she is not at all sensible, then in declaring an
absolute Aversion.</p>
               <p>The Abbot told me, he wonder'd I made no
better use of his kindness, since it was in his power
to do me an injury by discovering my private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
with one of my Lord's Domestic Servants.
Those words surpriz'd me, and I desir'd him to
interpret his meaning, which he refus'd to do, but
flung out of the Room full of despite and anger.</p>
               <p>A little while after I was going to inform Madam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> of what had pass'd; but she interrupted
me, telling me that I was a Fool, and ran the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of ruining my self past all redemption; that it
was known that <hi>St. Albe</hi> was with me every day;
and that to the end we might see one another with
more convenience, I had order'd him to disguise
himself: in short, that he waited upon my Lord in
the nature of his <hi>Valet de Chambre.</hi> I protested to
her, that if that were the Business, I knew nothing
of it; that I had never seen <hi>St. Albe</hi> since his being
releas'd out of Prison, and that I understood not
the meaning of these Discourses.</p>
               <p>However, what Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> told me, was
true: For <hi>St. Albe,</hi> still possess'd with his Love,
and not knowing what course to take upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
to see him, yet understanding that I was at
<hi>Marlou,</hi> and that my Lord <hi>Digby</hi> pay'd frequent
Visits to Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> got into his Service
under a borrow'd Name. But I had not as yet seen
him; he satisfy'd himself with only seeing me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Crowd, waiting for the Opportunity
which he sought. However he was known, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that it was imagin'd that we convers'd together
every Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:55945:49"/>
I begg'd of Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> that <hi>St. Albe</hi>
might be spoken to, and desir'd to be gone, before
the Business made any further noise, and that I
should be his mortal Enemy if he disobey'd me.</p>
               <p>Upon this Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> sent for <hi>St. Albe,</hi>
and lay'd before him the Injury which he did my
Reputation. But he appear'd to her so pierc'd with
sorrow for having displeas'd me, and so ready to
obey, that she took pity of him, and promis'd him
that before she return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> she would give
him an opportunity of seeing me, and immediately
sending for me, she left me with him. He threw
himself at my feet, without being able to speak one
word: On the other side, I had not the power to
chide him; I only lay'd before him the Injuries to
which he expos'd me by his Follies; and told him,
that it behov'd him to overcome a Passion that was
neither convenient for him or me; that I would be
always one of his Friends; but that I should hate
him, if he did not apply himself more seriously to
the Duty which he ow'd the King's Service, and
made it his endeavour to render himself worthy
the Favours which Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> had procur'd
him. This said, away he went, charm'd with my
gentle reception of him, and as he left me, told
me, that he should never be happy, till he had for
my sake lost a Life for which he was indebted only
to my Goodness.</p>
               <p>However, this could not be carri'd so privately,
but that it came to the Ears of <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Father
and <hi>Montalzac;</hi> who Both made it their business
to publish this Adventure, set forth and garnish'd
with a thousand horrid Circumstances of their
own.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> seeing all his Attempts upon
me prov'd unsuccessful, renew'd his Sedulities to
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>


                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55945:50"/>
declar'd to <hi>Montalzac,</hi> that I was sorry my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was in such a Humour, for that I was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
inclin'd to a Reconciliation with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montalzac</hi> assur'd me, that if I would give him
any hopes of success in his Amour, he would work
my Husband to other Sentiments. This made me
bethink my self of managing <hi>Montalzac</hi> to the best
advantage; for I knew he had a great power over
my Husband; and I consider'd, that if he did not
accomplish his Negociation, yet that at least I should
make it apparent to all the World that I desir'd an
Agreement, by my keeping fair with <hi>Montalzac.</hi>
Therefore I play'd the Dissembler upon this Occasion;
and so forbearing to promise <hi>Montalzac</hi> that I would
reward his Diligence, I left him some glimmering
Hopes that I might one day not be insensible of his
Passion. From that very moment he imagin'd that
his Person was not displeasing to me. But believing
me prepossess'd for <hi>St. Albe,</hi> he requir'd a Promise
from me that I would never see him more. To
which I return'd him an Ambiguous Reply, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any tartness in the least. On the contrary, as
if I had bin to justify my self in every thing that
had bin rumour'd in the World concerning <hi>St. Albe</hi>
and my self, I told him, that in truth I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by him, but that I had always us'd him very
severely; that my manner of receiving him at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou,</hi>
was a convincing Proof of what I said; that
I had forbid him to come near; and that in short,
I had quite given over seeing him; when just as I
had spok'n the words, <hi>St. Albe</hi> comes into my
Chamber.</p>
               <p>I leave ye now to judge at the Trouble and Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
I was in; because that really I had not
seen <hi>St. Albe</hi> in a long time before, and that I knew


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55945:50"/>
not what was become of him. I spoke to him
therefore like one that was heartily angry with
him, and bid him be gone immediately. Nor did
<hi>St. Albe</hi> dare to offend me, but retir'd with all
the submission imaginable, begging pardon for his
having displeas'd me. However, his unexpected
Arrival persuaded <hi>Montalzac</hi> that all I had told him
was false; and because that <hi>St. Albe</hi> withdrew so
quickly, he thought it to be a Trick concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us. Oh, said he in a king of Ironical Ralliery,
You are very sincere indeed; who dares question
your Vertue? The World certainly does ye a great
deal of wrong to suspect your Chastity: In short, he
gave me so much offensive Language, that he made
me angry. I then repented I had sent away <hi>St. Albe,</hi>
and I was just about to have sent for him back, to
let <hi>Montalzac</hi> see how little I car'd for what he
thought of me; so true it is, that Women care not
what they do, when they are provok'd However,
I did not recall <hi>St. Albe,</hi> but satisfy'd my self
with only sending away <hi>Montalzac</hi> with a befitting
Indignation.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>St. Albe</hi> went out of the House, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that the Person whom he saw in my
Chamber was the Marquis of <hi>Montalzac,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
calling to mind at the same time the ill Offices
he had done me, he resolv'd to wait his coming
forth, and revenge the Injuries I had complain'd of
<hi>St. Albe</hi> never consider'd the Consequences of what
he was going to do, but follow'd the motions of
his Anger. So soon therefore as he saw <hi>Montalzac,</hi> he
clos'd up with him, and asking him how he durst
defame a Lady who deserv'd to be spoken of with so
much respect, he presently forc'd him to draw his
Sword. For some time they sought without any
advantage; but at length <hi>Montalzac,</hi> after he had


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55945:51"/>
wounded <hi>St. Albe,</hi> fell dead at his feet. This
Duel was fought almost under my Windows, and
the noise with which the People, who, though too
late, made haste to part 'em, fill'd the Street, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
me to open 'em; where the first sight that
strook my Eye, was <hi>St. Albe,</hi> who, though scarce
able to stand, endeavour'd to gain the Door of the
<hi>Hostel' d' Entragues.</hi> I could not be so cruel as to
shut it gainst him; on the other side, I ran down,
and was the first who order'd him to be let in. So
soon as he saw me, he fell at my feet, and with a
languishing Tone, Madam, said he, I dye the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Person that has reveng'd the Injuries done you.
But I begg'd the Master of the House to carry him
without delay through a Back-door into a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
House, where his Wounds were drest the first
time; and from thence I took care to have him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
to another House a little farther off. And
by this means it so happen'd, that the Pursuit, which
was after him, could not find him out.</p>
               <p>However, the thing happen'd at such a time that
Duels were punish'd more severely then ever, and
I saw that <hi>St. Albe</hi> would stand in need of Great
Credit to procure a Gentle Prosecution on the
King's Side. To this purpose, away I flew to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s, and inform'd her of the whole
Adventure. There I luckily met the Abbot <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi>
who promis'd me that the Informations should
not be given to the Proctor General his Brother,
till he had view'd 'em; and that he would so order
it, that it should appear as if <hi>St. Albe</hi> had bin first
assaulted.</p>
               <p>The Abbot was as good as his word; so that by
his Diligence and his Care, no harm ensu'd, but
<hi>St. Albe</hi> had liberty to appear abroad, so soon as his
Health would permit him; his Pardon was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55945:51"/>
and dispatch'd; so that nothing remain'd of
this Adventure, but the Prejudice which it did my
self. For how was it otherwise to be believ'd but
that I had a kindness for <hi>St. Albe,</hi> considering what
I had done for him? Nevertheless I only serv'd him
out of generosity and compassion, and my Opinion
was, that Women, the most severe Professors of
Vertue, would have done as much as I did. All the
while that <hi>St. Albe</hi> lay private, I never went to see
him. I must confess, I put a constraint upon my
self in so doing; because that besides that my Visits
might have contributed to his Cure, the love
which he testifi'd for me was accompani'd with a
charming respect and awful submission. Perhaps
the greatest part of Women, who enjoy an unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Reputation, would not have bin so nice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such an Occasion.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, when I consider'd what the World
talk'd publickly of <hi>St. Albe,</hi> and my self, it was an
affliction to me, and I thought my self unhappy:
For in short, <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s uninterested Zeal did me as
much harm, as the Character of those who lov'd
me with less niceness. Thus there is no Lover which
it does not behove a Woman to be afraid of, seeing
there is so much danger in the Visits of an honest
man.</p>
               <p>Now in regard the Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> believ'd that
I had a love for <hi>St. Albe,</hi> he was no less persuaded
that I was greatly beholding to himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought he had a right to demand of me some
Marks of my acknowledgment. He told me, that
seeing he had for my sake sav'd the Life of my Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
he expected from me a piece of Service which
I could not deny him without Ingratitude; which
was to give him information how Madam <hi>Chatillon</hi>
demean'd her self with the Marshal <hi>d' H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quincourt,</hi>


                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55945:52"/>
who for some Months had seem'd to be very much
her Servant. I made him answer, that I had not
yet observ'd that Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> had any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for those that had a love for her, and that she
only admitted 'em into her Company out of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
I added, that it became him better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s Character, which was
rather to seek the settlement of a Good Fortune,
then to live under the uncertainty of Wanton
Amours.</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>de Fouquet</hi> told me, he knew that well
enough; however, he desir'd me to do him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
which he requested of me.</p>
               <p>But though I was oblig'd to the Abbot <hi>Fouquet,</hi>
yet I thought my self much more beholding to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon;</hi> and therefore I fail'd not to give
her an account of the Trust which the Abbot
endeavour'd to repose in me. To which, <hi>You are
not the first,</hi> said Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> to me, <hi>whom
he has tri'd to engage to inform him of all my Actions. He
is a jealous Friend, who cannot endure that any body else
should have a kindness for me; and because I cannot love
him after such a manner as he desires, he conceits that I
reserve that sort of friendship for another. With these
thoughts he torments himself; all those that visit me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
his rest, and upon the least appearance he frames
Suspicions to himself, which he will not suffer to be rooted
from his mind; he disperses 'em in the world, and finds
out people that spread 'em abroad in all Companies.</hi> Is it
not He who has endeavour'd to persuade all the
Earth that I love Monsieur <hi>de Candale,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours?</hi> I do not wonder therefore that the
Visits of Marshal <hi>d' Hoquincourt</hi> alarum him; 'tis the
Character which he bears. But you know, added she,
the Reasons that induc'd me to be civil to him: And
I must now dissemble. Do you make as if you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55945:52"/>
spok'n to me; I permit you to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my Demeanour with the Marshal; but it
will be to no purpose for you to tell him the truth; he
will never believe ye; he will accuse ye of Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
for he is a Man who will not be satisfi'd
with any Relations that make his Injustice appear:
In a word, 'tis his desire that People should speak
ill of me.</p>
               <p>What Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> told me, came to pass;
for the Abbot believ'd I would never betray her;
and when I assur'd him that no man could have a
just Suspicion of Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s Vertue; he
told me, he well knew what thoughts it behov'd
him to have of it, and flew into a passion because I
would not tell him an untruth.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> forbore not to
see him, but still admitted his Visits: And this
Compliance alone it was which caus'd her Conduct
to be suspected; but for this, she had preserv'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
the Reputation which she deserv'd.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I had still more reason to
complain then Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> being oblig'd to
be careful how I offended my Friends, and finding
my self in such a condition as gave opportunities to
authorize whatever the World would say of me.
For when a Woman lives a-part from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
she furnishes Discourse with Weapons against
her self; nor is it thought an injury done her to
suspect her Behaviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> was no sooner cur'd, but his Father
dy'd; and happy for him he dy'd so suddainly,
that he had no time to make a Will, whereby to
disinherit him.</p>
               <p>The first use that <hi>St. Albe</hi> made of his Inheritance,
was to offer it to my self. He wrote to me, that
I was Mistress of all his Estate; and desir'd I would


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55945:53"/>
permit him to make it over to me by a Deed of
Gift, for a particular Reason. His Friends were all
for having him to marry; and in regard it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to consent to any such Proposal, he thought
to rid himself of their Importunities, by letting 'em
see that he had dispos'd of his Estate.</p>
               <p>Though this Proposal seem'd to be very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
yet I was not insensible of the Gentleman's
Generosity. And at the same time I bewail'd my
Misfortune to be belov'd by a man, who, the more
capable he was to perform Heroic Actions, the more
he prejudic'd my Reputation. And how did I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
my self to the Fury of his Relations, when
they should come to understand the Design which he
had propounded to me! A Rock so much the
more dangerous, by how much I felt my self
more pleasingly flatter'd; for I knew then, it
would not be possible for me to hate a man
that gave me every day new occasions to esteem
him.</p>
               <p>Had I not had a thousand Reasons of Prudence
and Vertue, yet methought I would not have bin
without 'em then, to render my self worthy the
Sentiments which <hi>St. Albe</hi> had for me; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
no other Proof to justify my Conduct. From
that time forward I was convinc'd, that there was
no Woman, let her have but never so little Reason,
that can deny her self not to be touch'd with
Principles of Honour, when she is belov'd by a Man
who only deserves to be the Object of her Affection.
And if we meet with Women every day who are
somewhat nice in fixing their Amours, 'tis because
they can find no Person who merits a more refined
Delicacy. For generally the Character of those by
whom they are belov'd, is that which procures 'em
their happy or unhappy Destiny; and nothing


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55945:53"/>
teaches 'em their duty better, then a Lover who
understands the performance of his own.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>St. Albe</hi> did on his part, taught me
what it behov'd me to do on mine. I resolv'd not
only to refuse his Offers, but also to oblige him
to marry. I sent him word, that he would ruin
me by doing what he intended; but if he desir'd I
should have a kindness for him as long as I liv'd,
that it behov'd him to comply with the Desires of
his Relations; which I conjur'd him to accomplish,
by the care it became him to have of my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>My Answer afflicted him; he fell sick; and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Sickness he wrote me several Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he endeavour'd to persuade me to consent to the
Deed of Gift. But I resolutely refus'd him; and
wrote to him fresh Exhortations to marry, unless
he had a mind to lose my Favour for ever. And
indeed it was easy to be seen, that I could never
have avoided the Persecutions of his Family, had
they had the least intimation of his Design.</p>
               <p>As for the Donation, I suppose he consider'd the ill
consequences that would infallibly have attended it,
and therefore never spoke to me more concerningit;
but he sent me word that he could not resolve to
marry; for that seeing I had refus'd him, he valu'd
no body else beside. And the pleasure which this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
infus'd into me, hinder'd me from opposing
it, which was the reason that I could not avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made the Object of what the Malice of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
could throw upon me.</p>
               <p>For in regard that they were very earnest with him
to marry, and so much the rather, because a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Match was offer'd him, which they were
afraid of missing, they imputed his refusal of it to
mee. So that his Kindred being prepossess'd with


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55945:54"/>
that Opinion, broke all the Laws of Decorum with
me, and fell upon my Reputation with all the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
imaginable. On the one side they sent to my
Husband, and peal'd it in my Mother's Ears that
<hi>St. Albe</hi> kept me; and on the other side they hant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>St. Albe</hi> with ridiculous Stories of my pretended
Amours. And things were carri'd so high, that a
Great Lord, who had a mind to marry his Daughter
to <hi>St. Albe,</hi> propos'd the sending me away to my
Husband by force, which I had notice of; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that, falling out with <hi>St. Albe</hi> in good earnest,
I sent him word that I would hate him, and never
see him more, if he did not comply with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of his Friends.</p>
               <p>He tri'd divers ways to dispence with this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
but seeing that the longer he delay'd his
Marriage, the more bitterly they inveigh'd against
me, he promis'd to marry the Party propos'd to
him: He went to see her, and the Articles of the
Contract were soon sign'd.</p>
               <p>After he had given me this proof of his Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he begg'd leave that he might pay me a Visit;
nor did I think it proper to refuse him. He came
to me with such a face of Grief, as made me repent
of what I had exacted from him; nor could I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
how great a Sharer I was with him in his
Sorrow. But in short, said I, there is no other
way for you to assure me of your Love. Marry
then; and to compleat the proof of your Affection
for me, you must likewise love the Person whom
you are going to marry; and as you demean your
self to her, I shall judge of your love to me. But
have a care how you behave your self with the least
scorn and contempt, for the reason of it will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
conjectur'd. Well, Madam, repli'd <hi>St. Albe,</hi>
with a sigh, I will do what whatever you command


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55945:54"/>
me; but my Relations and my Wife shall know,
that 'tis to you they are beholding for it; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition that they come and ask you pardon
for the Injuries they have done you. No, said I,
that would produce a bad effect; for your Wife will
never love ye, when she should come to understand
that any other then her self had oblig'd you to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her. But as for your Relations, I give you leave
to let 'em see that you had all along a kindness for
me; nevertheless, that I never was the Woman
who gave you bad Counsel. At least permit me,
Madam, repli'd <hi>St. Albe,</hi> to bring my Mother hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that she may be acquainted with your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
and by that means be enabl'd afterwards
to undeceive those who verily believe 'twas you
that obstructed my Marriage; for I protest, said
he, concluding, that I will never marry, if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
does not know, that it was only done by
your Command. I answer'd him, that he might
bring his Mother to me; and that I would gladly
see her, since it was a Satisfaction which he would
not be deni'd.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>St. Albe,</hi> by causing this sort of Amends to
be made me, thought he had found a means to
bind me in a Tye of Friendship with his Mother,
that so he might have afterwards opportunities to
see me. Nor did he conceal this Inducement from
me; and I was sensible of it, because I found that
I could hardly dispence with a perpetual absence
from him: Besides, that I thought it would be a
means to silence the Prittle-prattle of the World,
when they should see me in friendship with his
Wife, and the rest of his Relations.</p>
               <p>His Mother fail'd not to come and see me with
the first; for since the Adventure that befel her
Husband, she had an inclination for me. And
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>


                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55945:55"/>
and besides that, I was beginning to think seriously
of reconciling my self to my Husband. He would
have said a great deal more, but I refus'd to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to him, and bid him be gone.</p>
               <p>He return'd the next day, but I deni'd him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
and at length he despair'd of ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
me alter my Resolution. But when it was
known about the Town that I went no more to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
his Wife, 'twas then given out that she had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
me the House; and this Report confirm'd what
had bin formerly spread abroad concerning me. I
must confess I found my self under very unfortunate
Circumstances; for I could not carry my self
with that circumspectness upon this Occasion, but
that some ill interpretation or other would be put
upon my Behaviour; so that I rather chose to suffer
that it should be said <hi>St. Albe</hi> had sacrific'd me to
the jealousy of his Wife, then that it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
he had sacrific'd his Wife to his Affection for
me.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>St. Albe</hi> began to be assur'd of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
never to see him more, he laid aside all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
upon himself, and began to lead his Wife a
very ill life: Upon which it was presently given
out, that I had advis'd him to take that Course to
satisfy my Revenge.</p>
               <p>So soon therefore as I found that <hi>St. Albe</hi> neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pursue the Counsel I had given him, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to abate of the good opinion I had of him. He
appear'd to me to be too much like other men; I
accus'd him for want of Niceness; and I was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
as to imagine with my self that his Behaviour
offended me: I thought he fail'd in the respect and
value which he ow'd me; and therefore I resolv'd
to cure him of his Passion; seeing there was no
other way to oblige him to live lovingly with a


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55945:55"/>
Woman, whom he would have thought sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amiable had he not had a love for me.</p>
               <p>I communicated this Design to Mistris <hi>Laval,</hi> and
we agreed together, that I should make a shew of
being in love with a Gentleman whose Name was
<hi>Savigny,</hi> with whom I had bin acquainted for some
time, and whom I frequently saw at Madam <hi>de
Chatillon</hi>'s, whose Kisman he was; and that Mistris
<hi>Laval</hi> should go to <hi>St. Albe,</hi> and tell him as a great
Secret, of this new Amour of mine. I was in hopes
by this means that <hi>St. Albe</hi> would have relinquish'd
all his kindness for me, and that he would have
liv'd lovingly with his Wife, when he thought me
prepossess'd for another. I was too well acquainted
with <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Discretion, not to be afraid lest he
should make an ill use of this Confidence, or that it
was not in his power to defame me. Which made
me determine to give him proofs of this imaginary
Intriegue by several Letters which I feign'd to have
written to <hi>Savigny,</hi> and which Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> was to
shew <hi>St. Albe</hi> as one of the greatest Secrets in the
World. I must confess, this Artifice lay a little
too open to discovery. For they that were but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so little acquainted with me, knew full well
that I had no manner of private engagement with
<hi>Savigny,</hi> and that he never came to my Lodging.
However, I fanci'd that <hi>St. Albe</hi> might suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be surpriz'd by it; and perhaps it might be
no trouble to me to try him that way; or at the
worst, I thought that if he discover'd the Artifice,
he would understand thereby that it was my abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
desire that he would live more lovingly then
he did with his Wife, since I made use of so strange
a means to oblige him to it.</p>
               <p>A part of what I foresaw came exactly to pass.
For it was not in <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s power to have an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55945:56"/>
meanly favourable of me; since never any man
made good the Character of a True Lover better
then he did, which is to have an inviolable esteem for
the Person whom he loves. But it was not only the
value he had for me, that hinder'd him from giving
credit to the Secret that was told him with so
much caution; the good Opinion he had of Mistris
<hi>Laval,</hi> would not permit him to believe her. He
was convinc'd that a Woman so much my Friend
as she was, could never be induc'd to betray me;
so that he told Madam <hi>Laval</hi> in plain terms, that
he would not believe one tittle of all her Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> orejoy'd to find him so honest a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
acknowledg'd to him, that I had made
use of that means to let him understand how much
his Harshness to his Wife offended her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> could not refrain from tears, when he
saw that I did the same thing to engage him to his
Duty, which others would have done to draw him
off from it. And he desir'd Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> to give her
self the trouble of delivering me the following
Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Surrender, Madam, to your Goodness in my behalf.
Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> can tell ye, that I never hesitated one
moment to take your part against your self. The esteem
which I have for you, made me judge at first sight, that
you had a design to impose upon me. But undeceive your
self; for nothing shall ever create in me any other Opinion
of your Vertue, then what I first conceiv'd, when I sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd
my heart and Life to your Service. I shall submit
to what you enjoin me: However, permit me to beg of
you, in recompence of this Sacrifice, a share in your heart:
I cannot forbear admiring it; and I suffer extremity of
pain, because I cannot deserve it. Assist me to support the


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55945:56"/>
Misfortune to which you condemn me, in obliging me to
shew another what I can never be truly sensible of for any
but your self: Convince me from time to time that you
have not quite forgotten me; and suffer me to flatter my
self that I should have bin more happy, if your Duty and
mine would have allow'd me that felicity.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> deliver'd me this Letter, and she wept
when she gave me an account of what she had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
of Great and Heroic in the Sentiments of
<hi>St. Albe.</hi> We both together admir'd and bewail'd
the unhappy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chance of my Destiny, which made so
many People cherish such bad Opinions of me, those
especially among whom I endeavour'd to gain that
esteem which I thought was due to me, while the
only Person that I would have had prepossess'd
against me, could not suffer an ill thought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to enter his Breast.</p>
               <p>How happy should I have bin, said I to Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moisel
<hi>Laval,</hi> if all men were of his Character!
Alas! why are they not so?—what a detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inclination have they to judge amiss of Women?
At least, added I, since I have met with one who
partakes not either of their Blindness or Malignity,
it is but just that I should have an esteem for him
only, and this is that I will do the whole remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of my Life. Happy if they who were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of my first Affections had resembl'd him. But
no, repli'd I presently, it would have vex'd me to
the Soul, if ever any other but <hi>St. Albe</hi> had merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an esteem which I would have bestow'd upon
another. Well, said Mrs. <hi>Laval,</hi> but what at
length is your Resolution? Will you grant him
his Request? will you let him hear from you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times?
Alas, repli'd I, wherefore should I not?
Can I do too much for a man that thinks nothing


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55945:57"/>
too good for me? Go, find him out, I conjure ye,
and tell him he may reck'n upon what ever I can
grant him without prejudice to my Duty; and if
ever I come to be in a condition—But stay,
repli'd I as soon, we must not flatter our selves with
idle Hopes—tell him I am wholly his—provided
that he never sees me, and that he never requires
any Letters from me; which though they may be
altogether innocent, will however render me su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.
You have much ado, repli'd Mrs. <hi>Laval,</hi>
to take any Resolution, Madam—for my part
I advise ye not to send to him at all; but to wait
till he performs what he promises to ye, and that
an opportunity present it self to let him know how
sensible you are of it. I submitted to her Advice;
though I must acknowledge, that had Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi>
but never so little enclin'd to have giv'n me other
Counsel, I should without delay have taken it; and
it may be I might not have bin sufficiently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mistress
of my self, to have prevented the declaring to him
the entire Passion I had for him.</p>
               <p>If I had reason to be satisfi'd with <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I was much more pleas'd with him, when I
understood his kind demeanour toward his Wife.
He was so careful in his behaviour, so full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and complacency, that he was become a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
for all Husbands. Whatever passion I had for
him, I had no inclination to be jealous of him:
And I thought my self so well acquainted with
<hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Character, that I attributed to my self
whatever he did for his Wife.</p>
               <p>But the World made another judgment of the
Matter: People believ'd that <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s kindness to
his Wife proceeded from his being separated from
my Company: And they cri'd, there was all the
reason in the World to remove me from him,


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55945:57"/>
seeing it was I who set 'em formerly at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> was at his Wit's end when he heard 'em
talk at this rate; but he durst not undeceive 'em;
for that if he intended to live in peace with his
Wife, and follow exactly my Advice, it behov'd
him to be careful how he discover'd me to have
any hand in the change of his Humour.</p>
               <p>But Madam <hi>de St. Albe,</hi> being fully persuaded
that her Husband's kindness to her was only due to
her own Merit, was the first that rail'd against me
in all Places. 'Tis true, she was more reserv'd in
the presence of her Husband, before whom she durst
not so much as utter my Name, for fear of recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to remembrance what was past. Of this every
body inform'd me, and advis'd me to ask <hi>St. Albe</hi>
the reason of it. But I had no mind to do it, and
I found my self enclin'd to speak as much good of
her, as she spoke ill of me. I must confess, this
Moderation deserv'd no great applause; for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought,
that a Woman under my Circumstances
could not well do otherwise; besides that I lov'd
<hi>St. Albe</hi> too well, not to pardon the Tittle-tattle
of his Wife, upon whom I could not be reveng'd,
without setting 'em again together by the Ears.</p>
               <p>About this time he was engag'd to go to the
Army; and because he thought my Allowance not
sufficient to maintain me, he found out Monsieur
<hi>Brice,</hi> who was entrusted with the payment of it;
and putting a considerable Sum into his hands, he
desir'd him to let me want for nothing; and so to
manage the Business, that I might think my self
beholding only to Mr. <hi>Brice.</hi> And he, was so exact
in the performance of what <hi>St. Albe</hi> had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to his care, that I was a long time igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
whence this Generosity proceeded. But when


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55945:58"/>
I understood it, my esteem and my love encreas'd
for a man so worthy to be belov'd. I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I needed no new Testimonies of his Merit to
make me resolve to love him as long as I liv'd: I
was fully determin'd upon that already; but at the
same time I promis'd my self to do nothing for him
but what might correspond with my Duty. The
innocent Pleasures of loving <hi>St. Albe,</hi> and being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by him, was my comfort in the midst of all
my Sufferings with which my froward Destiny af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
me; and whatever compassion the recital of
my Misfortunes drew upon me, I thought it a thing
to be really envi'd, that I should have the happiness
to meet, in the Person of <hi>St. Albe,</hi> with a Lover
worthy to possess my heart, and in the Person of
Mrs. <hi>Laval,</hi> with a Friend that so well merited my
Confidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s absence gave his Wife her full liberty to
exercise her hatred against me: Nothing pleas'd
her so much as to hear my Conduct ill spoken of.
Her Gossips, who understood her Sentiments, fed
her Malice with their compliance; so that at length
she resolv'd my ruin to all intents and purposes.
And to bring about her Design, she bethought her
self of contriving several Letters of her own head,
wherein she stufft a world of horrible Fictions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> and my self. These Letters she
put into the hands of the Director, of whom I have
already made some mention; who believing that
the Glory of God requir'd him to be reveng'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me for slighting his Admonitions, shew'd 'em
with a hypocritical gravity to Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi>'s Husband,
and after that to my own Husband, and my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.
Nor did he stop there, but found a way to
have the Queen inform'd of my loose behaviour,
with an humble Petition that she would be pleas'd


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55945:58"/>
to interpose her Authority to remedy those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
which he could not but lament; and of
which he might have easily seen the falshood,
would he but have taken the pains to examine
by whom those Letters were written. But Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Charity are Vertues to which Hypocrisy

               <p>WHEN Reputation is become a prey to the
indiscreet Zeal of counterfeit Godliness,
the Mischief is without a Remedy. The Letters
before mention'd made a most terrible noise; and
Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> inform'd me that the Queen had
bin made acquainted with 'em, and that she had
bin importun'd for an Order to have us Both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find,
Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> and my self. All this was done
by the pious Care of the Director before mention'd,
as I have already said. And I made no question but
that our Enemies had obtain'd their desires, had
not Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> bin so kind as to undeceive
the Queen. But she justifi'd me in such a manner,
that the Director could do us no harm.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> advis'd us
to betake our selves to some Convent, till our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
could be brought either by fair or foule
means to do us justice. Which Advice we follow'd;
and I can say we did it without reluctancy.</p>
               <p>After this I made it my business to bring my Suit
to an end. To which effect Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> took
the pains to speak to my Judges, and the Cause
was just ready for judgment, when my Mother
came to me, and propos'd an accommodation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and my Husband. I was apt to believe
that my Mother did this of her own head, without
any Order from my Husband: She was afraid, lest
having such powerful Friends at Court as I had,
that I should have obtain'd an absolute Separation,


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55945:60"/>
and liv'd continually at <hi>Paris;</hi> where, for her that
still aspir'd to go for a young Widow, a Daughter
of my years was the most mortifying Sight in the
World, and therefore she would fain have got me
out of the way: But she did not find me to be in
such haste to correspond with her Desires. I told
her that I had bin too much abus'd to be satisfy'd
with a private Agreement, and therefore I would
be justifi'd in Publick: Which Answer did not a
little exasperate her against me, so that we parted
no way satisfi'd one with another. But for my part,
I must confess 'twas not so much my Husband's ill
usage, and my Mother's unkindness which oblig'd
me still to thwart her in what she desir'd: I was
mad that a Mother, who had always forsak'n me
when she saw me without support, should make her
Applications to me, when she saw I had no more
need of her.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as I said before, I mov'd every day
by my Counsel for Sentence in my Cause, and was
just upon the point to obtain it, when the Death of
my Husband put an end to the Suit after an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
manner. He was return'd home with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
as they said, to have suborn'd Witnesses
against me; at what time he was seiz'd with a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Sickness, that gave him no time to do me ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
However, he declar'd before his death, that
he repented of his unkindness to me; that he had
bin jealous without a cause of my behaviour, for
which he blam'd himself; and that he desir'd that
all the World might know, that I was innocent of
all those things which Scandal had laid to my
charge, and of which he confess'd himself to be the
chief cause.</p>
               <p>The Tydings of his Death reach'd first my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
ears before they came to mine, so that she


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55945:61"/>
made more then ordinary haste to inform me of it,
and it would have bin a difficult thing to have added
any thing to her Demonstrations of Joy and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.
All the Ladies in the Convent came to
complement me upon the News. But then I, who
took notice that I was lookt upon before by the
same Persons as a Woman whose company they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffer'd, then were plea'd with among 'em,
was struck with admiration at their Civilities, and
how much they congratulated themselves, that I
had done them the honour to make choice of their
House for my Aboad.</p>
               <p>The first Counsel that my Mother gave me, was
to go forthwith into the Province, and look after
the fair Estate which my Son was then Heir to:
But the Death of another Person, which happen'd
almost at the same time, chang'd my Fortuue much
more to my advantage. For my Brother being
about Fifteen years of Age, had over-heated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Colledge, and dying of a Pleurisy, left
me the sole Heiress of a considerable Fortune.</p>
               <p>My Mother was so griev'd for the loss of my
Brother, that I thought she would never have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
him. I offer'd her all the Consolation that I
could give her, and might have bin a comfort to
her, would she but have done me that justice that
would have made me capable of being so; but I
endeavour'd in vain to persuade her, that she should
regain in me what she had lost in my Brother: She
had the same Sentiments of me as formerly; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were, that she imagin'd her former Harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to me would not permit me to love her, or
that she still continu'd her malicious Inclinations to
ruin me.</p>
               <p>The change of my Fortune was so much the
more accept<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, as being that which I the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55945:61"/>
The first thing then that I did in this same
Exaltation of my Fortune, was to bethink my self
of a way to make Madam <hi>Laval</hi> some satisfaction
for the Obligations she had laid upon me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
her to her Husband, to whom I lent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Sum of Money to buy an Employment in
the King's Houshold; but he liv'd not long in his
new Advancement. After that, I would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
an advantageous Settlement for Mrs. <hi>Laval;</hi>
but she testifi'd so great a desire to live with me,
that I consented to it; so much the rather, because
I was assur'd of her Sincerity, and that she had a
more then ordinary love for me.</p>
               <p>While I was giving these demonstrations of my
Gratitude, the World, accustom'd to empoyson all
my Actions, fail'd not to give out, that I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
an Employment for Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi>'s Husband for
no other reason, but because I was in love with
him. But I shall not need to say any thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to such an irrational Calumny.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>St. Albe,</hi> I had still a passionate love for
him; and I answer'd the marks of Tenderness
which he continually gave me, as much as Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Decorum would permit me. It may well
be thought that the change of my Fortune was no
small pleasure to him: And I must confess, that
when I found my self my own Mistress, I repented
that I had oblig'd him to marry; I should have bin
overjoy'd to have made him a Sharer with me in
my Estate. 'Tis true, he was not my Equal in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
nor rich enough to pretend to marry me; but
what he had done for me, and the respect with
which he had always accompany'd his Passion, made
me believe that there was no Person but he in the
World who was worthy of me; but there was no
ground for me to give him any such hope. On the


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55945:62"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55945:63"/>
other side, I thought, that if I gave him an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the least Presumption, it would but serve to
augment his Misfortune, and create in his Breast a
greater contempt of his Wife: Therefore I resolv'd
to conceal from him more then ever the Sentiments
of kindness which I had for him. I paid him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
what I thought was due to him, and in my
Turn offering to him my Estate to be wholly at his
Service, I desir'd him to allow me an opportunity to
testify my Gratitude to him. But at the same time
I conjur'd him to use all his Endeavours to stifle a
Passion, which would but only serve to render him
unhappy.</p>
               <p>He lov'd me with so much delicacy, that he
durst not contradict the Resolution which I seem'd
to have taken to forget him: How unwilling so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was to receive the Money which I sent
him, he only accepted it for fear of displeasing me;
and fearing lest the outward marks of his Love
should prove at length offensive to me, he took a
Resolution to dissemble it as much as he could, and
consenting to my Resolution neither to see him, nor
admit his Visits; he only sent me word that his
Love should last as long as he liv'd, but that he
would never give me an occasion to complain of
him.</p>
               <p>This Submission of his, render'd him still more
dear to me; and if it were my grief that I could not
do for him what I would, it was my equal joy
that I had in him a Lover who was proof against all
Trials.</p>
               <p>There are but few Women, perhaps, who are
capable of containing themselves within those
bounds which I prescribe my self; perhaps, because
they know not how to relish what is most exquisite
in the pleasure of being belov'd. For my part I am


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55945:63"/>
of opinion, that a Woman may dispose of her Love
with her Duty, yet have nothing to upbraid her self
for so doing.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Death of my Husband I had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
considerable Matches propounded to me by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
People. However, what I had suffer'd during
my first Nuptials, or rather my love for <hi>St. Albe,</hi>
made me reject all their Proposals.</p>
               <p>Then no body made any scruple of keeping me
company, or of professing themselves to be my
Friends. For I was rich, and my Wealth had
quite defac'd the remembrance of whatever had bin
invented to my ruin. Then I understood the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the World: They who had the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fam'd
me, were the first that sought my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and swore that they never gave credit to
the Stories publish'd by my Enemies. But I was
nothing dazl'd with this Change; I knew still how
to distinguish People that had bin kind to me in
my Misery, from those that only flatter'd my Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>The Affairs wherein the Death of my Husband
had involv'd me, oblig'd me to take a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Province, where my stay was longer then I
expected: And passing through <hi>Lyons,</hi> I understood
that the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> lay there so desperately
sick, that he was quite giv'n over. Touch'd with
this News, and forgetting then the Reasons which
I had to believe him none of my Friends, I only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd
what he had done for me, and I thought
it my duty to offer him my Service in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
he was in. So soon as he perceiv'd me, he
could not forbear asking me pardon for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sent to me in so long time; and he told me,
sighing, that it had bin his misfortune not to know
his Real Friends. I answer'd him, that I would


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55945:64"/>
freely pardon him what was past, provided he would
but strive to recover his Health. He repli'd, he was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he should dye, but that he was glad that Death
had given him so much time as to assure me, that he
always had a greater esteem for me then for any
other Woman. After that, he told me what Women
he had lov'd; and I perceiv'd I was not the only
Woman to whom he had prov'd inconstant. Oh!
if I might but live a little longer, cri'd he, I would
make known to the World, that there are Women
both of merit and vertue; and my Example should
undeceive all those who are the cause of the Injuries
that are done 'em. I could not forbear weeping,
seeing him persuaded that he was going to dye:
He also wept himself; and our Tears made People
believe that there had bin a mutual Amour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us.</p>
               <p>Thus what I did out of meer gratitude for the
Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> turn'd to the prejudice of my
Reputation after a strange manner. So true it is,
that when a Woman is unfortunate, she cannot do a
good Action, which shall not be conster'd in a bad
Sense. For presently it was spread abroad, that I
had bin driven out of the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as an Object that terrifi'd his Conscience. But
what will not People say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they have a mind
to defame a Woman! However, I was little mov'd
with these Rumours. For because I was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
of what they laid to my Charge, I thought
it my duty to neglect 'em. Nor was it a wonder
that I was not more cautius for the future then I had
bin till that time. My Innocence hinder'd me still
from keeping a guard upon my self, and was the
first cause of the Attacks that were made upon my
Reputation. I should have bin more studious of
outward Appearances, had my Desires bin more


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55945:64"/>
irregular. But Hypocrisy and Grimace seem'd to
me the most unworthy of all Vices: I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
how much People have need of 'em in their
Conversation in this World.</p>
               <p>I met in the Province a Lady whose Misfortunes
had render'd her no less illustrious then my self:
And because I undertook to write these Memoirs for
no other reason then to prove that People are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mistak'n in the judgments which they make
concerning Women, I thought it proper in this
Place to relate the Story of this Lady, by which it
will be seen how deceitful outward Shews are; and
I shall set it down in the following words, as she
repeated it her self.</p>
               <p>When the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> said she, first made
his Applications to me, I was ambitious enough to
wish him for my Husband; and I flatter'd my self
with those hopes, because he gave me some reason
so to do. The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> his Brother in-Law,
at the same time also testifi'd a very great
Passion for me; and doubtless I had had a greater
love for the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> but he was marri'd,
and I was too proud to hearken to a Lover who
could not be my Husband. Therefore I gave an
ear to the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and endeavour'd to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
him from the Duke of <hi>Nemours.</hi> Now it
was the less known that either the one or the other
courted me, because all People were persuaded that
they were otherwise engag'd; nor was it believ'd
they had any other Quarrels then such as frequently
divided the whole Court, and of which the two
Ladies, with whom they seem'd to be in love, were
the occasion. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> also promis'd
to marry me, so soon as he had brought about a
Design which he had in his head, and which he
imparted to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:55945:65"/>
The Promise of a Match so advantageous, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
my Pride, and made me carry my self more
stately toward the Duke of <hi>Nemour;</hi> but I made it
my business to humour the Duke of <hi>Beaufort.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had too great a conceit of his
Merit, and too much Wit not to unravel the reason
of my preferring his Brother before him. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
it made him mad, to have the meanest share
in my Affection; and he endeavour'd to infuse into
me a contempt of his Rival. But notwithstanding
all the unpleasing Portraitures he gave of him, I
still continu'd my compliance with the Duke of
<hi>Beaufort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> was so enrag'd at this, that
seeing he could not put me out of conceit with his
Rival, he resolv'd to make his Rival have an ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of me. Therefore he inform'd him by a Person
suspected to neither, that I betray'd him, and that
the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> spent whole Nights with me.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> took no notice of any thing
to my self, but resolv'd to have me carefully watch'd.
On the other side, the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who made
no question but his Brother-in-Law would set Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels
enow upon me, dream'd of nothing else but
how he might procure a Witness that would swear
he saw him enter my Chamber in the Night; and
at length he gain'd one of my Servants, who left
open a low Window that lookt into the Street;
and through that Window it was that the Duke of
<hi>Nemours</hi> enter'd, at such a time when he was sure
to be observ'd by the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Spies.</p>
               <p>This Adventure was not long kept secret, but
was publish'd the next Morning; and all the while
I knew nothing of it. And indeed what care, what
caution can be sufficient against Adventures of this
nature! What Woman can promise her self to be


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55945:65"/>
exempt from disgrace, when there needs no more
then an Enemy or a Lover to satisfy his Revenge
upon her.</p>
               <p>But when I understood what had past, I went to
the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> to ask him the reason of spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a Scandal. He answer'd me, that I knew
better then any body; that it was no Calumny, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Rival had bin seen to go in and come out
of my Lodging but the Night before. Upon that
I made such a Hubub in my House that I discover'd
the Truth. I sent for the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> to come
to me; he came; and the Lacquey who had bin
brib'd, confess'd the whole truth before him, so
that at length he began to believe, or else he made
a shew of believing I was innocent. I told him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that I was not satisfi'd with those Proofs, but
that I would give him others yet more convincing,
by obliging the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> to disown the
thing himself. But the Duke desir'd me to forget
the Adventure, assuring me that he desir'd no other
satisfaction, and that he was fully convinc'd of my
Innocence.</p>
               <p>However, I saw no other way to restore my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to its first integrity, but my marrying the
Duke of <hi>Beaufort:</hi> But I soon perceiv'd he had flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
me with false hopes; he abated his Sedulities,
and insensibly forbore to visit me. And to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustify
this change of his mind, he wrote me word, that
during the Agitations of his Fortune, he could not
think of marrying. So that I plainly saw, I was no
longer to reck'n upon him. I must confess, it was
no great trouble to me to forget him, because I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lov'd him. However, I was vex'd he had es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
me; and therefore not caring to live any
longer at <hi>Paris,</hi> I retir'd into my Province. Where,
while I remain'd in my own Signiory, which as you


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55945:66"/>
well know, borders upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
another Adventure befel me.</p>
               <p>One Evening word was brought me, that two
Gentlemen, having lost their way in following
some Chase or other, desir'd to know whether I
would be so courteous as to afford 'em a Lodging
till the next day, in regard it was late, and they
being quite tir'd, it was impossible for 'em to ride
any farther. The Person that spoke for 'em would
not tell me their Names; only he assur'd me, they
were Persons of Quality, and that I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
me of the kindness I did 'em.</p>
               <p>I had with me a Lady, one of my intimate
Friends, and an old Gentleman, who was nearly
related to me. I was also at a stand, whether it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
me to entertain Gentlemen who refus'd to let
me know who they were: But when they appear'd,
I found such an Aire of Nobleness in their Faces,
and they requested me to lodge 'em with such a
graceful demeanour, that I could not refuse 'em.
These two Persons were the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> who under pretence of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lost their way, came out of curiosity to see
me.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had for a long time an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire to be acquainted with me. He had seen
my Picture, among others of the Ladies of the
Court of <hi>France</hi> that had been sent him; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
he was an Amorous Prince, who took delight
in Adventures, understanding that I liv'd in a
Castle bordering upon his Dominions, his Curiosity
led him to give me a Visit, in company with the
Marquess of <hi>Fleuri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was unwilling to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himself to any body but only to me, that he
might not lose time, made a sign to the Marquiss to


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55945:66"/>
engage in a discourse with the Old Gentleman, and
the Lady, my Friend, while he kept me in discourse:
And then so soon as he could speak without being
heard by any body but my self, Madam, said He,
you see <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Prince, who for above these two years
has had so great a Passion for you, which has made
him forget his Quality, that he might have the
Honour of seeing you. I am the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi>
but I do not ground my Hopes of gaining your
Favour so much upon my Quality, as upon the
most tender and p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssionate Love that ever was
pledg'd to Woman-kind. While he was thus
talking to me, I kept my Eyes attentively fix'd
upon him: A sort of surprize which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and afraid lest I should interrupt him, tho
it were onely to shew the astonishment I was in,
he earnestly desir'd me not to disclose it to others
that He had discover'd himself; and after a World
of Amorous Ejaculations, he press'd me to tell
him what Impression they had made upon my
Heart.</p>
               <p>But I was not over-hasty to let him understand
my Sentiments; I perceiv'd in my self an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Marquess of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> before I knew who
he was; and I was sorry that I had shewn any
thing of Complacency to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I foresaw he would prove an Obstacle to my
growing Passion: In short, I was already more in
love then I could imagin my self to be. Instead
of answering to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Amorous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
I ask'd him with a kind of unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Transport, the Name of the Person that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
him; but immediately repenting that I
had bin so foolish to put such a Question to him, I fell
into a sort of Rambling Gibb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish, that put the Duke
into a fit of Laughter. However, he attributed


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55945:67"/>
the little Ramblings of my Expressions to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of my Mind, and still press'd to know what he
was to hope for. By which time, having a little
recollected my self from the Agitations that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyl'd
my surprized Thoughts, I told him, I could
not think my self any way oblig'd to him for a
seeming Honour that so much expos'd my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He laught at my niceness in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
and told me, that the thing which he
requir'd from a Woman that he lov'd, was, that
she would lay aside that part of Delicacy. Upon
this Subject we had a long discourse, and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
ended in many earnest Invitations, which
he made me, to the Court of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marquess <hi>de Fleuri,</hi> as my Friend afterwards
told me, was under a strange disturbance all the
while that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was talking to me;
and she could perceive, I was a Person who had
made no small Impression in his Breast. Therefore,
before we parted, the Marquiss took his Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and whispering me in the Ear, <hi>Madam,</hi> said
He, <hi>I shall dye if you surrender to the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>a
Heart which I alone deserve, because of that Infinite
Love which I have for you.</hi> He was unwilling to
say more to me, for fear of being observ'd; and I
must confess, it was my happiness that I could not
have time to discourse him in private; for I should
have had much ado to have conceal'd from him
the Joy which the assurance of his Love infus'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me; considering how little we are Mistresses of
our selves in the first Agitations of a violent Passion.
At the same time the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> desir'd leave
that he might tarry the next day also at my House;
which the Pleasure of the Marquiss <hi>de Fleuri</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and the Hopes of understanding who he was,
easily prevail'd upon me to grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55945:67"/>
When my Friend the Lady and I were alone
together, I gave her an account of the Conversation
I had had with the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but said not a
word to her of my Inclinations for the Marquis
<hi>de Fleuri:</hi> Not, that I distrusted the Sincerity of
her Friendship; but because Secrecy is always the
first thing that inspires us with a Real Passion. My
Friend would hardly believe me at first, when I
told her that one of the Persons was the Duke of
<hi>Savoy;</hi> but fully at length convinc'd, she blam'd
me for consenting to let 'em tarry all the next day.
She foresaw better then I did, the Consequences
of this Adventure; and told me moreover, that
if it should come to be known, the Higher the Duke
of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Quality was, the more my Reputation
would suffer. I assur'd her, that he should never
have any occasion to boast of any thing that could
do me an Injury, and that I did not find in my
self the least Inclination for him. We spent all
that night in discoursing of this Adventure, not
being able in all that time to think of disclosing to
her my Sentiments for the Marquiss <hi>de Fleuri;</hi> a
fault for which I have often since that time deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
blam'd my self; for a Woman has never
more need of the Counsel and Advice of a prudent
and discerning Friend, then when a Passion begins
to blind her. When she thinks to be her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductress,
she makes a thousand false Steps, and falls
into a thousand mistakes.</p>
               <p>Thus then, consulting no body but my self, I
resolv'd upon two things that were ill contriv'd,
yet which at the same time seem'd to give me an
occasion to satisfy both my Inclination and my Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
I took a Resolution not to let the Marquiss
<hi>de Fleuri</hi> understand the Sentiments I had for him,
nor to discourage the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that I might


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55945:68"/>
not be depriv'd of the Marquiss's Company. This
Design appear'd to me Heroic; besides, that it
concern'd me to try whether the Marquiss lov'd
me really or no; and I thought there was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way to convince my self of this Truth, then
by making a shew of having a greater Fondness
for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> then I had. The next day
I put my project in Execution; as being onely ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and complaisant to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoiding to discourse or cast my Eye upon the
Marquis <hi>de Fleuri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whose love for me,
was one of those sorts of Passions, that never lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
by degrees, but seek a speedy satisfaction;
he was so charm'd with my converse and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that without any more ado, he propos'd to me
what his Passion made him desire. On the other
side, I who had a design to manage him, return'd
him no such Answer as I should have done; so
that he thought there was now no more to be
done, but to find an Opportunity that we might
be both in Private together. He dissembl'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and having made me promise him to take a
Journey into <hi>Savoy,</hi> he took his leave of me, and
I believ'd him really gone. The Marquis of <hi>Fleuri</hi>
endeavour'd in vain to speak to me before they
took horse, for I still avoided him; so that all he
could do, was to slip a Billet-Doux into my hand,
which I had not the Power to refuse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so soon as they were out of sight, I open'd
it in great haste, and found the following words.</p>
               <p>Nothing but an Affection for you as violent as mine,
could force me to betray the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by giving you
notice that he is this night to be let into your Chamber.
Your Conversation has flatter'd him; but since I have


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55945:68"/>
found you worthy of my love, I cannot believe you give to
his so much Encouragement.</p>
               <p>The Marquis of <hi>Fleuri</hi>'s Merit was too well
known, and I had had such an advantageous Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of it, that I was over-joy'd when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
'twas He that lov'd me no less passionately
then I did him already. However his Bill<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t put me
into a great perplexity, so that I thought at first to
have shewn it to my Friend; but in regard I was
unwilling she should understand the Sentiments
which the Marquiss had for me, I only told her
what I had heard of the Duke's Resolution. She
lay'd before me, that I had done ill to flatter the
Passion of that Prince, and ask'd we what was my
Intention? I answer'd her, that I saw no likelihood
that he could put his Design in execution; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that I would break his Measures, by keeping
her all Night in my Company, and giving order
that no body should be let into the Castle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
she advis'd me to take another course, and to spend
the Night among the Ladies in the Neighbourhood.
But alas, I could not relish that Advice; for the
hope of the Marquiss's Company over-rul'd me to
stay at home, and there expect the issue of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
And I thought that standing upon my
guard would be enough to secure my Reputation.</p>
               <p>After I had given all such Orders as I thought
necessary to frustrate the Duke's Enterprize, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
betimes in company with my Friend. I thought
that after such Precautions as I had taken, there
could be no fear of the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> But I had
to do with a Prince sufficiently ingenious to bring
about his Amorous Designs. One of my Women
whom he had brib'd, had let him in betimes into
the Castle, and lockt him up in my Wardrobe.


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55945:69"/>
The Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> was also hid in one of the
Courts, where being discover'd by one of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
there was presently a loud Cry of <hi>Thieves;</hi> all
my Servants were immediately in Arms, and they
had certalnly kill'd him, if my Friend and I, so
soon as we heard the noise, had not immediately
ran down to his rescue. By that means we sav'd
the Marquiss's Life. In the mean time the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> enter'd my Chamber: But in regard I was
now assur'd of his being in the Castle, I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to my Chamber without my female Friend, in
company with the Old Gentleman and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> seeing his Design discover'd,
shew'd himself; and I flew out in bitter Language
against him; but he did but laugh at me; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> to follow him, he left
the Castle before day. On the other side, I was vext
to the Soul at the Marquiss's departure; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
I perceiv'd so much affliction in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
for the same Reason, that I was about to
have stopt him.</p>
               <p>Some days after I receiv'd a Letter, wherein he
sent me word, that he lov'd me above all Women,
though he could not question but that I lov'd the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> as well. But then the vexation which
the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi>'s Letter gave me, made me
sensible that I lov'd him more and more: Yet I
could not understand why he should be so positive
that I lov'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Thereupon I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
to mind all that I had said, and all that I had
done, that could manifest any such Inclination for
that Prince; and not being able to live in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
wherein I was, I took a Resolution to go
to the Court of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:55945:69"/>
I never examin'd whether or no my Design was
contrary to my Honour, and I shut my Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whatever could divert me from it; and only
listning to my Love, made hast to be gone.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was surpriz'd at my Arrival;
for he never expected to see me at <hi>Turin,</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what had past. But being one who lov'd to
flatter himself, he thought I had repented of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us'd him no better, and imagin'd that the
motive of my Journey was out of a design to please
him.</p>
               <p>The Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> was jealous of the same
thing; and was mortally perplex'd at it; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were to make himself amends for his loss,
or to be reveng'd upon his Rival, he made all his
Applications to a Person for whom the Duke seem'd
to have a very great Affection. This was a young
Lady of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> whose Name and Adventures are
known to all the World. So that when I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a journey into <hi>Savoy</hi> for the sake only of the
Marquis of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> he was labouring to forget me,
and lov'd another.</p>
               <p>I spar'd for nothing of Bravery to make a shew:
Wherein I follow'd my natural Inclination to Luster
and Expence. This made a cry at Court, that all
my Finery was at the Duke's Charge, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
was carri'd away with the common Opinion:
And this Opinion advanc'd his Affairs with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress.
For a fancy took her in the head, that the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had an affection for me: And judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the present what he might hereafter do for
me, she listen'd to the Marquis of <hi>Fleuris</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses.</p>
               <p>I undeceiv'd her Royal Highness, who had suffer'd
her self to be prepossess'd as well as others: And
giving her a faithful account of what had pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55945:70"/>
the Duke and my self, my Sincerity pleas'd
her, and she was pleas'd to honour me with her
Friendship.</p>
               <p>My heart however could not be at rest: The
Marquiss of <hi>Fleury</hi> seem'd to shun me in all places:
I knew of his Intriegue with the Lady of <hi>Bretagne;</hi>
nor was the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>One day also discoursing with me about it, he
told me, I was the cause he suffer'd unreveng'd the
Affront which the Marquiss had put upon him;
and that I might judge by that, that he intended
to have no other Mistress but my self. I discover'd
to him some part of my Sentiments, which no way
satisfi'd him; and I lay'd before him the injustice
which the Marquiss did him, and that in honour
it became him not to relinquish to another, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom he had once lov'd: And Jealousy infus'd
into me a wonderful Eloquence. The Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
also could not but perceive how much I was
concern'd in the injury which the Marquis did him:
For according to the manner that I talk'd to him,
it might be easily perceiv'd that I was more offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at it then the Duke.</p>
               <p>But as much taken up with the Person whom he
admir'd as the Marquiss was, he could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that I had little kindness for the Duke: And
the love which he had once had for me, and which
was not quite extinguish'd, made him keep a strict
watch upon the Motions of that Prince; and he
perceiv'd that the Duke was ill satisfi'd with me,
and that I avoided him with care. This was the
reason that he forbore to shun me, and that I had a
suddain opportunity to discourse him. He talk'd
to me of his Suspicions; I undeceiv'd him; and
my joy to find that he still lov'd me, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to conceal from him the affection I had for
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:55945:70"/>
Nor did he make an ill use of his Information:
Never was a violent Passion accompany'd with
more respect. I desir'd him to be contented with
the Assurance which I gave him that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
and conjur'd him to be careful of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
I met with a Character in him far
different from that of other men, who believe
they have a right to be rude and uncivil with
a Woman whom Scandal has not spar'd. Quite
the contrary, the Marquiss told me, that he would
do himself the kindness to convince me by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful
adherence, how much he was assur'd that
I deserv'd a better Reputation; and begg'd my
permission to do me that Service in publick, as to
persuade the World into the same Opinion he
himself had of me. Which demeanour of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to me so noble, and so generous, that I
could not refuse him what he requested; and
from that time forward he began to redouble his
Addresses to me, as to a Woman that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to marry. For I flatter'd him with hopes
that I would marry him, though it were not my
design: And perhaps I may be blam'd for putting
him in hopes of a thing which I never intended
to do. I will not deny but that there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Treachery in it on my part: But one
Consideration which some People perhaps will
censure for Chymerical, would not permit me to
think of such a Match. I foresaw, that so soon
as the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> should marry me, there
would have bin those who would have laid before
him, with a world of aggravation, the Stories that
render'd my Conduct suspected in <hi>France.</hi> And
I was afraid, that his Passion being satisfi'd, would
have bin rambling after other Objects, while I must
have bin the forsaken Monument of his extinguish'd


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55945:71"/>
Love. And I look'd upon the expiration of his
Love as the greatest Misfortune that could befal me.
This was the Reason that prevail'd with me against
that Match: Now that which oblig'd me to put him
in hopes of marrying me, was this. I imagin'd that
nothing could be more for my Honour, nor more
conduce to the re establishment of my Reputation,
then to see a man of his Merit, and his Delicacy,
make me the only Subject of his Addresses, and
judge me worthy to be his Wife, when so many
People seem'd to take delight in scandalizing me for
a Woman that had neither vertue nor government
of her self. I thought it lawful for me to make use
of such an occasion to recover my Honour.</p>
               <p>The Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi>'s Constancy to me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and drew upon me the
hatred of the Damsel of <hi>Bretagne.</hi> She had bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
jealous of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Sedulities to
me; but the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi>'s Inconstancy offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Vanity to that degree, that she resolv'd to
be reveng'd both of me and him. To this purpose
she reconcil'd her self to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whose
Levity she manag'd so well, that she easily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd
what she undertook.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> soon after sent the Marquiss
of <hi>Fleuri</hi> to the Court of <hi>France:</hi> And though we
saw that this Employment was only a pretence to
part us, yet there was no remedy but Obedience.</p>
               <p>However, I was not so sensibly displeas'd at this
same Separation as I should have bin, had we not
bin both in hopes to meet each other again at <hi>Lion,</hi>
where the King and the Duke, with both their
Courts, were to be toward the end of the Year.</p>

               <p>THE Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> after he had thus remov'd
the Marquis of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> minded nothing more
then to lay such a Snare for me, as might either put
him into a Condition to triumph over me, or else
give him an occasion to revenge himself upon the
Marquis by defaming my Conduct.</p>
               <p>The Damsel of <hi>Bretagne</hi> and I became very good
Friends upon the Assurances I gave her, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had bin engag'd in any Intreague with the Duke
of <hi>Savoy.</hi> She begg'd my pardon for being jealous
of me; and because it concern'd me that the Duke
should court her more then evr he had done, I did
my utmost to preserve a good understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em, and by a persuasion of bad Policy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Duke to visit her at my Lodging. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she came frequently, and there it was that the
Duke met her as often. Nor did the Report, that
the Duke came thither for my sake, much trouble
me, because it was well known that I never was
with him but in the Damsel's company: Besides
that, I thought him quite estrang'd from me, while
he was so passionate a Lover of his Mistress. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Report continu'd that he was still a zealous
Servant of mine; and there were People that sent the
Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> word, that the Duke was never
from my Lodging, and that we were both engag'd
together in a familiarity which began to make a
noise. This Rumour renew'd his first Jealousies;
he wrote to me therefore in such terms, as plainly


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55945:72"/>
shew'd him to be persuaded that I was not cautious
enough of my own Reputation, or his Delicacy, and
earnestly desir'd me to find out a way to avoid the
Duke's coming any more to my Lodging. 'Twas
in vain to lay before him the Reasons I had to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him; there was a necessity that for his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I must break off the Duke's Visits.</p>
               <p>To that purpose I faign'd my self sick, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Privacy: But it was said, that all whatever
I should do would turn to the prejudice of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
And they who made it their business to
defame me, made their Comments upon my Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and gave out that I was with Child. In <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
'twas said, that the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> had done
my Business; but into <hi>France</hi> they sent him word,
that it was by the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> There were also
some People who pretended to know the truth from
my own Servants; and perhaps there might be some
one among 'em who might undertake to support
this false Report: For frequently our Servants are
our most dangerous Enemies.</p>
               <p>When I understood what the World said of me,
I shew'd my self, to undeceive such Persons as had
too lightly given credit to the Scandal; and People
of Sense were undeceiv'd. But in regard there are
some who will sooner believe the worst then the
best, there were others gave out I had miscarri'd;
and others looking upon things according to their
prepossession, pretended to discover in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and my Gate several signs of that Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture;
yet I was never better in health, never lookt
better then I did at that time.</p>
               <p>But the most pernicious Effect of this Calumny
was not what was reported in <hi>Savoy,</hi> but what was
believ'd in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
persuaded of the truth of it, and wrote to me to


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55945:72"/>
the same purpose. Upon the receit of his Letter I
was not a little nettl'd and imbitter'd against him:
His giving credit to such Reports with so much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
render'd him so different to me from what he
always had bin, that I repented of having thrown
away my Love upon him: And then it was that I
found by experience, that Absence operates more
ways then one to the prejudice of Love. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
a little coldness between us, and we forbore
writing one to another. He that will undertake to
love a Woman, ought to have a strong Head, more
especially when the Person upon whom he desires to
place his Esteem, has the misfortune to have Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
For I believe there is no man strong enough
upon that account, since the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> who
was a man of the best Character that ever I knew,
was so weak as to believe whatever Tales and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
reach'd his Ears.</p>
               <p>These Scandals and Reproaches pleas'd the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as much as the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri</hi> was
vext to hear 'em; and thereby 'twas easy to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the difference of their Love.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had only a Roughhewn
Passion for me, ne'er laid my Defamations to heart:
Nay, he rather believ'd it would be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to win a Woman who had little Reputation to
be cautious of. For this is that which happens but
too frequently: There are few Women, when the
greatest part of their Honour is sacrific'd, make any
scruple to offer up the remainder. On the other
side, the Marquis of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> who never lov'd me
but because he thought I had not merited my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
was at his wits end to have the least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to question my Innocence; his Love not being
able to support it self without Esteem, which was
the foundation of it, he valu'd not a Heart accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd
to surrender.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55945:73"/>
At the same time the Marquiss of <hi>Cah</hi>—fell in
love with the Damself of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> which was a
Match of great Advantage for her; and in regard
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had a desire to bestow her, he
desir'd me that I would be pleas'd to visit her some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and to accompany her when the Marquiss
propos'd to carry her abroad: He also desir'd me to
speak to the Marquiss <hi>de Cah</hi>—in favour of his
Mistress; which I did with that success, that he
marry'd her within a year or two after.</p>
               <p>One day the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> propos'd the taking
of a Tour by Water upon the <hi>Poe;</hi> where I was
present with all the Court. In our return, it was
perceiv'd that the Barge which carri'd us began to
leake: And presently the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> order'd us
to be set ashore, where Coaches were ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us, and carry us to <hi>Turin,</hi> from whence we
were not above a League, and Night drawing on.
I know not by what Enchantment, thinking to
have taken Coach with the Marquiss of <hi>Cah</hi>—and
his Mistress, I mistook, and put my self into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which drove away like Lightning, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I found my self alone with a single Person whom I
knew soon after to be the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> I was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
vext that it should be said I return'd alone
with the Duke; but I had juster cause soon after to
be more afflicted. The Wheel of our Coach broke,
as the Duke himself had taken order, and we were
forc'd to alight, as Fortune, or rather Design would
have it, near a House which belong'd to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss
of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> and which flew open to us as soon
as the Duke's Name was heard. It seems, 'twas
no new thing in that Principality to see the Duke
engage himself in such Adventures, and never was
Prince less shie of publick Discourse upon that score.
I made no scruple to enter the House, believing the


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55945:73"/>
other Coaches had follow'd us; but they had taken
another Road, and I was all alone with the Duke
of <hi>Savoy.</hi> However, I thought to meet with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the House; and when I understood that it
belong'd to the Marquis of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> I flatter'd my
self that no Misfortune could befall me, and that in
the House of so dear a Lover I should be nimble and
cunning enough to defend my self from any Affront
that his Rival could put upon me. Hardly were
we enter'd, when a certain Person arriv'd; you
will scarcely believe it, when I shall tell you it was
the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> seeing I have told ye that
he was in <hi>France:</hi> However, it was He, and you
shall hear the reason why he return'd.</p>
               <p>Receiving no Letters from me, and being no less
able to persuade himself to write to me, he took a
Resolution to come and satisfy his Curiosity and his
Jealousies upon the Place it self; for he lov'd me
really, and was at his Wit's-end that he could not
be assur'd of my Vertue. Nor was it a hard matter
for him to take this Journey, because the Court of
<hi>France</hi> was then removing to <hi>Lion;</hi> and therefore
taking his advantage of these Circumstances, he
took Post and came to his House with a design to
remain there <hi>Incognito,</hi> and not to make known his
return to any but those by whom he intended to
inform himself of the truth of things.</p>
               <p>He arriv'd almost as soon as We; and the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
telling him that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was but
just come before with a Lady, his thoughts misgave
him presently that 'twas my self. He was at a stand
whether or no he should conceal himself, when the
Duke who was desirous to know who he was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him; and presently taking notice of him,
ask'd him why he was not in <hi>France,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was return'd without his Order. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss,


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55945:74"/>
in his own excuse made answer, that his
Negotiations being at an end, he thought he might
be permitted to leave a Place where he had nothing
more to do.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who despair'd not all this
while to vanquish my Reluctancy, commanded
the Marquis to go and stay for him at <hi>Turin,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unwil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing he should see me in his Company.
Thereupon the Marquis made a shew of yielding
him Obedience, tho having more exactly inform'd
himself who the Lady was that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
had brought along with him, he understood it was
my self. But then it was that he minded little the
Disobeying of his Prince, provided he could but
convince himself by his own Eyes of what he had
bin long doubtful, and in some measure perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Now in regard he was better acquainted
then any Body with the Apartiments of his own
House, he hid himself in a Closet, where he could
hear and see what was done in the Chamber where
we were together.</p>
               <p>Nothing could have fallen out more to my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
for the Marquis <hi>de Fleuri</hi> was a witness
how coursely I handl'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and his
Esteem for my Vertue restor'd me to his Heart, and
made him lay aside all his Jealousies. In the mean
time the Duke press'd me to correspond with his
Passion, and he urg'd his Importunities to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that the Marquis thought it no longer became
him to conceal himself, but that it was time to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
me in that distress. He appear'd then, and
never considering that he expos'd himself by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Ruin, he enter'd the Chamber where we
were, and approaching the Duke with a world of
Respect, he besought him to be pleas'd that he
might afford me the Succour which I implor'd.


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55945:74"/>
The Duke laid his hand upon his Sword, and had I
not interpos'd between, he had certainly kill'd the
Marquis; which he might have easily done, because
he neither offer'd to defend himself, nor to avoid
the Duke's fury by flight. However the Duke's
wrath was not appeas'd by the Marquis's Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he confin'd him to his House, and forbid him
to stir from thence till further Order; I also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
the Duke's Resentment; for he sent me
back to <hi>Turin,</hi> and told me 'twas his Pleasure I
should appear no more at Court; and so taking
Horse he rode a private way to <hi>Turin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Report and Scandal would have never spar'd me,
had it bin known that I had bin alone with the Duke;
but I was sufficiently bespatter'd the next day; for
then it was known that the Duke and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
had had a Rancounter. It was reported that
I had given the Marquis a Meeting, and that the
Duke would never have minded coming back alone
with me, had it not bin to break the measures which
the Marquis and I had taken to meet one another.</p>
               <p>All this while, I must do the Duke that Justice,
that he was always an Enemy to Violence; and
that he had not been so rude with me, but that he
thought me to be of the Humour of those Women
who would have that torn from them which they
most eagerly desire to part with. So that whatever
was violent in the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Behaviour was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be attributed to the misfortune of my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He might have manag'd me better, had he bin
better acquainted with my Humour, and had he
not built too much upon the Opinion he had of my
former Intrigues.</p>
               <p>The next day he came to see me, and having
made me a thousand Excuses, desir'd me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
again at Court. And as for the Marquis of


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55945:75"/>
                  <hi>Fleuri,</hi> he requested me in respect of him, not to
take it amiss, that he continu'd in his confinement
forsome few days, for returning without his Order.
But the Marquis of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> who did not believe
he should come off at so cheap a rate, was not to
be found when they sought for him, neither did
any Body know what was become of him.</p>
               <p>Though I was a little surpriz'd that he had not
found a way to send me word where he was, yet
was I not much disturb'd at it; but rather glad that
he had betaken himself to flight, because I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
he was return'd into <hi>France,</hi> whither I was
suddenly to follow him. In short, I departed
with the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi> in a little time after, and
we came to <hi>Lions,</hi> where the Court of <hi>France</hi> was
expected in a day or two.</p>
               <p>The Marquis of <hi>Fleuri</hi> had bin in that City <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,</hi>
ever since what had past in his own House;
and now he was no longer jealous; nay, the same
adventure seem'd to have given a new vigour to
his Passion; he frequently came to see me; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I was afraid least he should be discover'd, I
perswaded him to bethink himself of reconciling
himself to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> which I thought it
might be no difficult thing to do at a time when
that Prince had nothing but Divertisement in his
thoughts; and it is true that there never were
seen so many Pastimes and Divertisements as while
the two Courts remain'd at <hi>Lions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marquis told me that he knew but one as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
means to appease the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which
was for me to marry him. Thereupon he call'd to
my remembrance the hopes I had given him to
that purpose, and press'd me with so much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
no longer to delay a Thing that would
restore him to his Master's favour, and make him


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55945:75"/>
perfectly happy, that I had not the power to let
him understand my resolution never to be his Wife.
I only told him I did not think he could regain the
Duke's Confidence by such a Marriage, because his
Highness lov'd me still too well, to let me choose
for a Husband a person with whom he thought he
had just reason to be offended.</p>
               <p>The Marquis <hi>de Fleuri</hi> was too Amorous to be
satisfy'd with that Excuse, and upbraided me with
want of Affection for him. But then I told him
frankly that I would never marry him, because I
fear'd that Marriage would abate his Love. He
could not relish so exquisite a Piece of Delicacy;
and therefore thinking my mind alter'd, he began
to revile me, and intermixt his Taunts with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
too much bitterness. That displeas'd me, and
I found there was too much unpoliteness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in his Love. I was at my Wits end, that he
had not so much Delicacy as my self; and out of a
strange and fantastick Humour not easie to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
the more I lov'd him, the more reason
I thought I had to be dissatisfy'd with him. Fain
would I, that it would have contented him to be
assur'd, that I gave him in my heart a Precedency
above all other men, and that he had bin as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
as I, of what I imagin'd would one day
destroy so fair a Union.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it was known that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Fleuri</hi> was at <hi>Lion,</hi> and that he visited me
every day. And I know not whether he were in
hopes to engage me to marry him, by giving out
that we were already marry'd; but such a Report
was spread about, and I understood that he was
Author of it.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> also spoke to me about it,
and upbraided me for not having inform'd him


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55945:76"/>
how nearly I was concern'd in the Marquis of
<hi>Fleuri</hi>'s Fortune; and protested to me that since he
was my Husband, he would not only pardon him
for what was past, but that he would endeavour
by his Favours to render my Residence in <hi>Piemont</hi>
acceptable to me. I assur'd the Duke that there
was no such thing as a Marriage, but I besought
him to restore the Marquis to his Confidence. This
Request made his R. Highness believe that I had
some reasons to keep my Marriage private. He
therefore sent for the Marquis, and restor'd him
to his Familiarity. Thereupon, so soon as I saw the
Marquis of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> I chid him for not undeceiving
the Duke in his opinion of our being marry'd;
and I told him that I took it very ill that he himself
had spread abroad the Report of it. He did not at
all deny it, but desir'd me to forgive a fault which
he thought necessary to reconcile him to the Duke
his Master. Afterwards he gave me an Account,
after what manner the Duke had restor'd him to
his friendship, and made that an Argument that I
could have no longer any reason which could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from Marrying him. I return'd him the
same Answers I had done when he urg'd me to
give him my consent; but seeing me stedfast in my
determination not to marry him, he flew out into
such a violent Passion that I could not have
thought him guilty of, and told me, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think that whatever had been said of me
was true. I was so sensible of that Affront, that in
the height of my Anger which it had infus'd into
me, I forbid him to see me any more. With that
he flung out of the Room, and I was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
at his obedience, then I was with his Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Language; for his manner of leaving me,
made me judge that it would be no difficult thing
for him to forsake my Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:55945:76"/>
I never had such violent pangs of Grief as then;
but at length I recover'd my Courage and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and whatever passion I felt for the Marquiss,
I scorn'd to recall him agen. Thus we should always
be Mistrisses of our Passions, were we not too much
in love with 'em.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Marquiss of <hi>Fleuri,</hi> after
he had left me, took post, and went I know not
whither. And they that were my former Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers
took no compassion upon me on that occasion.
But I made use of the old Remedy, Patience, and
leaving both the Courts at <hi>Lyon,</hi> return'd to my
own Territories, resolv'd to comfort my self for
the loss of a Person who had not delicacy enough to
be contented with my heart. For if I had not the
advantage to bring the Marquiss to my Sentiments,
I had at least the consolation not to have bin so
weak as to conform to his.</p>
               <p>The Lady who recounted this Story to me, told
me an infinite number of other Adventures that
had befallen her; and while I tarri'd in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
we often made those Reflexions together,
which her Destiny and mine gave us an occasion to
make upon the Misfortunes of Women.</p>
               <p>After I had put an end to those Affairs which
detain'd me in the Province, I return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi>
There the Baron <hi>de Sarcelles,</hi> who was my Kinsman,
came to see me so soon as I was arriv'd, and gave
me to understand, that during my absence he had
made a particular Acquaintance with <hi>St. Albe</hi> and
his Wife; that he gave frequent Visits to both; and
in short, that he had listed himself in the number of
their Friends. He told me farther, that Madam
<hi>St. Albe</hi> had charg'd him to make a perfect reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
between her and I; that she was absolutely
undeceiv'd in every thing that had bin infus'd into


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55945:77"/>
her concerning my familiarity with her Husband;
that she most earnestly desir'd to give me cause to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
what was past, and to become one of my Friends.
As for <hi>St. Albe,</hi> I had heard no tidings of him all
the while I stay'd in the Province: And though I
was fully convinc'd that he durst not write to me
for fear of displeasing me, yet I was troubl'd that
I could hear nothing of him.</p>
               <p>I persuaded my self that <hi>Sarcelles</hi> spoke to me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner by <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Order, who had
brought his Wife to hear Reason, and had advis'd
her to be Friends with me, that he might recover
the lost advantage of my Society. I lov'd <hi>St. Albe</hi>
too well to deny my consent to a Reconciliation that
flatter'd him with so much delight. And besides,
I was glad to find his Wife reduc'd to Reason, and
that she sought my friendship: So I told <hi>Sarcelles,</hi> that
I would willingly wait upon her, and that he might
carry me to her when she pleas'd. Nor did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to bring us together; at what time we talk'd of
nothing that was past; nor did any thing fall from
me, during our whole discourse, that could give her
an occasion to recollect her memory: and when she
went about to talk of any thing to that purpose, I
always interrupted her; and because she loaded
me with her Caresses, I imagin'd that she lov'd me
in good earnest. I ask'd her for her Husband; she
told me, he was in the Country, and that he would
not return in three Weeks. I durst not ask any
more particular Questions; but I made no doubt
but that when he should come to know that I had
visited his Wife, he would write to me, and hasten
his return; nevertheless, I heard no news concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. I repay'd Madam <hi>de St. Albe</hi> her Visit,
who after that came frequently to see me, always
bringing <hi>Sarcelles</hi> along with her, which made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55945:77"/>
'em to be good Friends, but I little suspected 'em
to be in that familiar league together as they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> return'd by this time out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but was not very hasty to come and see me;
which very much disturb'd me; but because I
thought he would not presume to visit me without
leave, I went to his House, two days after I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
he was come home. He was then with his
Wife, but receiv'd me coldly; nor did he say one
word to me how joyful he was that I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a frequent Visitant of his Wife, which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from him. I observ'd however in his Eyes,
that still he lov'd me, and that it was with great
constraint upon himself that he forbore to let me
know how glad he was to see me again. He seem'd
to me to be sad, and I saw that he was dissatisfi'd:
However, I said not a word to him in his Wife's
presence; but having giv'n him my Hand to lead
me to my Coach, Well, Sir, said I, how like ye
Madam <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Discourse in reference to me? Is
not this a wonderful Change? If outward Shews
may be believ'd, I am apt to think she loves me
with all her heart. <hi>St. Albe</hi> return'd no Answer.
Upon which, why so silent? said I. You cannot
but know the cause, repli'd he; I am troubl'd, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that you have so easily done for <hi>Sarcelles</hi> what
you have so often refus'd to do for me. How so,
repli'd I, was it not you that persuaded Madam
<hi>St. Albe</hi> to be reconcil'd to me? Upon those words
he smil'd, and told me, I could not be ignorant
of the Motive that induc'd her to that Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Place would not permit us time suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to clear this Mystery; for had I kept him lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
it would have bred suspicion; and therefore
I only desir'd him to come to me the next day and
unfold this Riddle; telling him withal, that I should


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55945:78"/>
not take him for my Friend, if he did not release
me from the trouble I was in. He promis'd to obey
me; and so I left him for that time, not knowing
what to think of the Story.</p>
               <p>So soon as I came to my Lodging, I told Madam
<hi>Laval</hi> what I had heard and seen, and we thought
we had divin'd the cause of <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Melancholy.
But he came the next day and unfolded it himself.
I am no more a Visionary, said he, nor a Jealous
Shallow-brains then another; nor do I love Madam
<hi>St. Albe</hi> so well as to be alarum'd at her private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities.
But I love you, Madam, with a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
that renders me sensible of your Honour. All
the World believes that <hi>Sarcelles</hi> courts my Wife,
and that you are the Manager of their Private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</p>
               <p>This Complaint of <hi>St. Albe</hi> touch'd me to the
quick: I ask'd him whether he could accuse me of
so foul a piece of Treachery? No, Madam, repli'd
<hi>St. Albe,</hi> though I had some reason to wonder at
first, that you should visit my Wife at <hi>Sarcelles</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
a Person whom I hate, and whom I had ere
now full dearly made repent of his Insolence, but
for the honour which he has to be your Kinsman,
yet I did you justice without delay. I thought you
were impos'd upon by the Artifices which they us'd
to draw ye to my House, and I thought that your
Compliance proceeded only from your Civility and
your Natural Goodness. Do you believe, said I,
hastily interrupting, that I had no other Motive—and
so saying, I blush'd, and fix'd a more tender
look upon him then ever I had done, while he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
me in the same manner, and both stood speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
for a time. Yes, Madam, repli'd <hi>St. Albe</hi> at
length, though you have always bin so cruel to
make me sensible of your indifferency for me, I was


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55945:78"/>
less troubl'd to imagin with my self that you sought
see me again, then to believe you capable of Malice
or Blindness. As for Malice, said I, I never had
any; but I think I have bin a little too blind; and
I would have you be convinc'd, that 'twas my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see you again that was the cause of my Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
For, in short, <hi>St. Albe,</hi> I knew your Merit
to the full, nor could I be insensible of so many
Testimonies of your Friendship, as you have giv'n
me. I thought, added I, it had bin you your self
who had persuaded Madam <hi>St. Albe</hi> to desire my
company: I saw nothing in her Conduct with <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles</hi>
that gave me any cause of suspicion, and I am
apt to believe that nothing criminal passes between
'em. <hi>St. Albe</hi> took no notice of my last words; he
only minded to assure himself of the sincerity of my
Sentiments for himself; and though he could not
doubt but that I lov'd him, yet was it the first time
I ever disclos'd my Sentiments to him. Nor did I
repent that I had let him understand 'em: He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with so much respect the Joy and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports
which the assurance of my Love infus'd into
him, that he still appear'd to me more worthy of
my love: And I believe there would be little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to upbraid Women for being so weak as to let
men know they love 'em, if all Lovers were as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful
and as delicate as <hi>St. Albe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had a hunderd times renew'd his Oaths
to be eternally mine, and to exact no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his love, then the pleasure of loving me,
and being by me belov'd, I put him again upon the
Story of <hi>Sarcelles,</hi> and he told me, that he had bin
for a long time a Sedulous Courtier of his Wife, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that it had bin the talk of the Town, and
that <hi>Sarcelles</hi> and his Wife foreseeing that his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
might at length be tir'd, they bethought


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55945:79"/>
themselves that the only way to preserve their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was to draw me to Madam <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s House,
because that <hi>St. Albe</hi> being still in love with me, the
pleasure of my Company would make him amends
for the trouble that <hi>Sarcelles</hi> gave him.</p>
               <p>I found much probability in <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Relation,
and that put us into new Confusions: For I could
not forbear visiting Madam <hi>St. Albe</hi> without depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my self of her Husband's Company, and exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating
her a second time against me: On the
other side, I could not continue my Visits without
blasting my Reputation in the World. I understood
also that Publick Report had begun to bespatter me
already, by giving out upon my renewing my Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
to Madam <hi>St. Albe,</hi> that we acted all four by
concert; and that <hi>St. Albe</hi> for the pleasure of my
company had prostituted his Wife to <hi>Sarcelles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Report appear'd so injurious to my own,
and the Reputation of <hi>St. Albe,</hi> that for the more
speedy stifling it, I resolv'd neither to visit <hi>St. Albe</hi>
nor his Wife any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St Albe</hi> had too great a value for my Honour, and
was too sensible of his own, to disapprove my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
But because it was too great a trouble to us
to want the company of one another, there was an
Expedient found out, that I should refrain for some
time from visiting Madam <hi>St. Albe,</hi> and that during
that time I should oblige <hi>Sarcelles</hi> to carry himself
with more caution.</p>
               <p>But this turn'd also to my prejudice: For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it was known how coldly <hi>St. Albe</hi> had receiv'd
me, and that the Visit was not known which he
paid me the next day, 'twas reported abroad that
I forbore to see his Wife, because the Husband had
found it out that I favour'd <hi>Sarcelles</hi>'s Designs.
Which made People believe that I lov'd <hi>St. Albe</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55945:79"/>
then he did me; and I was lookt upon as a
Woman that never minded any thing else, provided
I might but satisfy my own Passion. However, I
deserv'd a better Reputation; and I believ'd that
few Women would have had the courage that I had,
to refrain the Company of a Person I lov'd, when I
had so favourable an opportunity to see him every
day.</p>
               <p>About the same time Madam <hi>St. Albe</hi> fell sick,
and notwithstanding all the Remedies that could
be administer'd to her, she dy'd of the Small Pox.
Her Death ruin'd <hi>St. Albe,</hi> who having no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by her, was oblig'd to restore what she brought
him: And because he had bin no good Husband of
his own Estate, he was forc'd to despoil himself of
all he had to satisfy his Wife's Heirs: So that he
fell from a Plentiful Estate into great Poverty.</p>
               <p>It was now some time ago that the Dutchess of
<hi>Chatillon</hi> had propos'd to marry me to the Duke
of—who was a Widower, and who had a
Daughter much about the Age of my Son. The
Duke also agreed, if the Match went on, that my
Son should marry his Daughter, which was a very
advantageous Match for my Son, and which I ought
not to have refus'd, had it bin only because Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> propos'd it: But I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to marry agen; not that the Experimented
Vexations of my first Marriage made me afraid to
venture, but the Esteem and Affection I had for
<hi>St. Albe.</hi> Nevertheless, because I could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
the death of his Wife, I had accepted the Civil
Proposals of Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> and could give no
other Reason to put off my Marriage, but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
years of my Son.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de St. Albe</hi> dy'd just at the same time
that Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> prest me to forbear insisting


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55945:80"/>
upon that Reason. But <hi>St. Albe</hi> being a Widower,
I thought it became me not to marry any other;
and that which before was only an effect of my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
was now a Reason of Generosity. I was
rich, and he was poor; I thought I could not in
justice refuse to relieve him, and I knew no way to
afford him a more noble Relief, nor more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to my Inclination, then to marry him. This
was the real Motive which engag'd me in a Design
which has bin so much blam'd by those who accus'd
me of only consulting a blind Passion. But to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
my self from this Reproach, I shall give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the manner how our Marriage came to be
concluded, by which it will be the better seen how
worthy <hi>St. Albe</hi> was of the Advantage he met with
in marrying me. Any other Woman, had she bin
in my place would have done as I did: For I dare
be bold to say, there are Women still who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sentiments, and they who believe they act only
out of humour or interst, are not acquainted with
'em.</p>
               <p>When <hi>St. Albe,</hi> after the loss of his Wife, saw
himself reduc'd to lose the best Estate which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
there was nothing talk'd of about the Town
but my Marriage with the Duke of—and whether
<hi>St. Albe</hi> apprehended that the Match was too too
much for my advantage for him to endeavour to
persuade me against it; whether really he did not
believe I lov'd him so well as to prefer him before
the Duke of—or lastly, whether he were
asham'd to find himself without an Estate, he left
<hi>Paris,</hi> and withdrew to some Remainder of his
own, which when he had sold, he design'd to go
for <hi>Holland,</hi> and seek for some Employment in that
Country. As for my own part, I had seen him but
once since the death of his Wife; and though I had


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55945:80"/>
taken a Resolution to marry him, I had not said a
word to him of it; I only offer'd him what Money
he stood in need of to redeem his Estate. He had
thankt me for my Offers, but would not accept 'em:
Two days after which, he left the Town, and I
knew not for some time what was become of him;
when at last, after much Expectation, I receiv'd
the following Letter.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>The LETTER.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Thought it proper, Madam, to inform ye, that I am
quite discharg'd from the Heirs of Madam <hi>de St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be.</hi>
If I made no use of the Assistance you had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to offer me toward the conclusion of that Affair, be
assur'd, it was not out of my fear of being burthensome to
ye, nor of being beholding to you. I know the generosity of
your Soul; but I did not think it convenient to accept
your Favours at a time when Fortune offer'd you an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to Title and Dignity in the World, if any such
there be that may be thought equal to your merit. I must
always love ye however, but suffer me to conceal my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny
from ye, till your Marriage is accomplish'd. Never
enquire, or trouble your self, whether I shall be happy or
miserable: Whatever be my Lot, I shall be truly happy,
when I know that you enjoy your full content.</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>Upon the reading this Letter, I felt my self tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moil'd
with various Sentiments. At first I was
charm'd with <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Generosity: Then I accus'd
him of loving me too little, since he gave me my
Liberty with such a seeming unconcern'dness. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
his Letter did not become a tender Lover,
and a little thing would have made me deem him
inconstant. But at length, I knew him too well to
continue long those sinister thoughts of his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55945:81"/>
and I made this judgment of him, That he
lov'd me so much the more, the more resolv'd he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to sacrifice himself for my sake.</p>
               <p>Thereupon I sent away a Messenger with a Billet,
wherein I earnestly desir'd him to return to <hi>Paris,</hi>
having something of importance to impart to him;
and for the more speed, I order'd the Messenger to
take Post. He found him ready to go for <hi>Holland;</hi>
but not being able to withstand my Orders, he laid
aside those Thoughts, and return'd immediately to
<hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>IN the mean time, Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> was so
importunate with me to conclude my own, and
my Son's Marriage, that I thought it my Duty no
longer to dally with her. I told her therefore, that
for my own part I was fully resolv'd not to marry;
only if she could so bring it to pass that my Son
might marry the Duke's Daughter, the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
she would lay upon me, would be still the
same. But she told me, the Duke would never
consent to the Marriage of my Son, unless he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me first. To which I answer'd, that if it were
so, there was no farther thinking either of the One
or the Other. Upon which Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
me with having little Affection for my Son,
since he would never meet with a Match so Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
as the Duke's Daughter. But I repli'd,
that my Son was too young to think of Marriage,
and that I had no mind to sacrifice my Liberty and
Repose to his Interests. I see now, said Madam
<hi>de Chatillon,</hi> that you intend to marry <hi>St. Albe.</hi> Which
words she utter'd in such a Tone, as hinder'd me at
first from acknowledging it to be my real design.
If you marry him, added she, you will commit a
great piece of Folly: It is a Match that will be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
condemn'd; and besides, I am afraid 'tis a
<hi>Match of Inclination.</hi> Afterwards she laid before me
the Inconveniences that would attend it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, because it was my Interest that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> should approve my Resolution to


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55945:82"/>
marry <hi>St. Albe,</hi> I gave her such a Portraiture of the
Man as did not displease her; and when I shew'd
her his last Letter, she alter'd her mind. After she
had read it, she told me, that she piti'd <hi>St. Albe,</hi>
and that she would not advise me to abandon him
to his despair.</p>
               <p>You may easily judge how joyful I was to see
that Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> approv'd my Design. What
a pleasure it is to be applauded in our Wishes and
Desires! After that, I made no scruple to discover
my heart to a Friend who confirm'd me in my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.
I acknowledg'd to her that I had refus'd the
Duke for no other reason, but only because I was
resolv'd to marry <hi>St. Albe;</hi> that I was mov'd with
his ill Fortune; and that after what he had done for
me, I lookt upon it as a piece of Treachery and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
to forsake him. Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
my Generosity, and promis'd to serve me
as far as lay in her power; but she told me withal,
that my Marriage was to be kept secret; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
all my Concerns into her hands. Then send
<hi>St. Albe</hi> to my House, repli'd she; 'tis requisite that
I should talk with him first, and that I should fully
understand him, before I acquaint him with his
Happiness: For if he resembles other Men, I would
never advise ye to marry him. 'Tis necessary, that
before you make him your Husband, you should be
sure; that you may have nothing to tax your self
with afterwards; and that you know whether he
can make you so happy as you expect.</p>
               <p>I was glad that Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> was pleas'd to
take upon her the trouble; well assur'd that <hi>St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be</hi>
would appear to her the same that she would have
him to be; and besides, I was not sorry that any
other but my self should prepare him for a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which he so little expected. It came into my


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55945:82"/>
mind also, that while Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her this Affair, I might be able to say, that 'twas
She who had advis'd me to it. And I desir'd no
more then to be able to clear my self from every
thing that might be objected against my Conduct
in this respect.</p>
               <p>After I parted with Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> I met
with <hi>St. Albe,</hi> who tarried for me at my Lodging.
I told him, that I could not but disapprove a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Niceness, that would not suffer him to be
beholding to me; that I knew the Condition of his
Affairs, and that I had thought of a way to set him
up again, of which Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi> would tell
him more; that what we had design'd to do for
him would be no Obstacle to my Marriage with the
Duke of—At which last words <hi>St. Albe</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
chang'd Colour—Alas, Madam, said
he, why have you sent for me back? for in your
presence that strength fails me which I had remote
from your sight. Go to Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> said I, she
will revive your Courage. Which said, I would not
permit him to speak any more, but sent him away.
I must confess however, that had he stay'd but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so little longer, I should not have had the power
to have conceal'd my Intentions from him. For I
was nothing scrupulous of my Sentiments since Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi> approv'd 'em.</p>
               <p>The next day <hi>St. Albe</hi> went to wait upon Madam
<hi>de Chatillon,</hi> who shewing him the last Letter which
he had written to me, and which she had then in
her own Custody; What was your Design, said
she, in writing this Letter? Confess the truth,
did not you believe it would have wrought with
the Marchioness to have broke off her Marriage with
the Duke of—? For if it were true that
you approv'd that Marriage, you would have left


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55945:83"/>
her to conclude it without saying any thing.
I will not dissemble with you, added she; for it
is manifest by this Letter, that you did fancy to your
self ridiculous hopes, and that you imagin'd that
for love of you, a match so much to her advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
would have bin broken off. Is it possible that
you should so little understand your self, or that you
should be ignorant how impossible it is for my
Friend to marry you? This Lecture put <hi>St. Albe</hi>
quite out of Countenance, who after a silence for
some time, Madam, said He, what is there so Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in that Letter? or where have I given De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of those vain Hopes for which you
blame me? Never dissemble, reply'd Madam <hi>de
Chatillon,</hi> you love the Marchioness, you believe
her to be in love with you, and you would have
her marry ye? Who I! Madam—answer'd <hi>St.
Albe;</hi> No—Madam—so far from it, that
were it her desire, I would be the first to oppose it. I
have too high a value for her Honour, to allow that
she should prefer an Unfortunate Beggar, who has
nothing but an Honest Heart, before a Person that
is going to exalt her to that Illustrious degree which
she deserves above any Person in the World. I am
glad, said Madam <hi>Chatillon,</hi> to hear ye confirm what
you have writ to her; for I must not conceal it from
you, that the Marchioness would hardly be induc'd to
marry the Duke of—did she not believe you to be
so just a Person as to consent to it: you have been
already too badly us'd by Fortune, to be loaded with
more sorrows; 'twas her pleasure therefore, I
should see you, that I might prepare you for this
Marriage; and to shew you that you are still in her
thoughts, she is resolv'd to give or lend you forty
Thousand Crowns to set you up in the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
with this you must be content, and I must


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55945:83"/>
tell you, few Women would have been so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
But this is not all, she and I have consulted
together, and we have some thoughts of helping
you to a Wife; and it will be your fault if you do
not marry a handsome Lady that will bring you a
fair Fortune. If you love the Marchioness, you will
promise me to accept of this Match. This is that
you must resolve upon, nor shall you stir from hence,
till you have promis'd to marry the person that we
recommend to your Affection. I promise you,
Madam, whatever may contribute to render the
Marchioness happy. I marry'd once already for the
Love of her; and you may assure her, that in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her I ne're conceiv'd the least vain hope of
what you seem'd to intimate: I only made my
happiness consist in loving her, and I will always
love her. You would talk at another rate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
Madam <hi>Chatillon,</hi> interrupting him, were you
her Husband: believe me, Wedlock alters the
strongest Inclinations; and were the Marchioness
inclin'd to marry ye, I would perswade her to the
contrary, for fear lest Wedlock should have the
same effect upon you. Wherefore, Madam, cry'd
<hi>St. Albe,</hi> does your Ladiship take such delight in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
by soothing me with those Idea's with
which I never flatter'd my self? I will amuse ye
then no longer, reply'd the Dutchess, the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
intends to marry ye. She is an unwary Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who in so doing follows her own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never considering to what Extremities this
Marriage will expose her. But I hope that you will
be more discreet than she; and that 'tis none of
your desire that she should render her self ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to all the Kingdom. <hi>St. Albe,</hi> upon those words,
beheld the Dutchess with an awful silence, and
perceiving she had done, Madam, said he, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55945:84"/>
not think you serious in your Discourse: I never
flater'd my self that the Marchioness had so much
inclination for me, as you would seem to perswade
me: but if it be true, that her design is the same
which you mention, I am assur'd that the infinite
Respect and Love which I shall have for her till
the separation of Death, will justifie her Choice;
and that there is no Body that will censure her for
marrying the only person who atall times did justice
to her merit; I lov'd her as soon as I saw her; from
that very time I never ceas'd to adore her; and the
love which I have for her has bin always stedfast and
permanent. Can it be possible, added he, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with Delight, and throwing himself at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s Feet, that the Marchioness should
have any such design as that wherewith you bless
my Ears? Oh Madam, in the Name of God, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
ye never to oppose it. If you love her, you
ought to desire her happiness: I dare presume to
say, that I am the only person who can make her
happy.—Here his Tears stop'd him, and would
not permit him to say more. Madam <hi>de Chatillon</hi>
also felt her self wholly vanquish'd; and raising him
from the ground, No, said she, I shall never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
your Union; she can also tell ye, that 'twas I
who confirm'd her in her resolution to marry ye.
And I can farther assure ye, that if she does not
marry you, she will never be Wife to any other
Person.</p>
               <p>In what an Extasie of Delight and Satisfaction
was over-joy'd <hi>St. Albe,</hi> when he heard such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations
of his Felicity as these! He embrac'd
the Dutchesses Knees, conjuring her at the same
time to deal sincerely with him. Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon</hi>
answer'd him, that to let him see, she did not
deceive him, she would send for me; which she


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55945:84"/>
did, and I as soon repair'd to her Lodgings, impatient
to know what had past between 'em, where <hi>St. Albe</hi>
was still upon his Knees when I entred the Room.
'Tis well y'are come, Madam, said she, for I know
not what to do; and if you do not take some spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
care, I'm afraid <hi>St. Alhe</hi> will die at my Feet. I
knew not what the Dutchess had said to him, and
therefore seeing him in that condition, I was afraid
she had put him into a fit of despair, by telling him
that I intended to marry the Duke of—. Scar'd with
these thoughts, Ah, Madam, said I, you have bin
too cruel to put the poor <hi>St. Albe</hi> in pain—and
to <hi>St. Albe,</hi> cry'd I, What has she told ye, that so
terribly afflicts ye?—Then turning to me, and
embracing my Knees in the same manner,—No,
Madam, cry'd he, I cannot believe what I have
heard—my happiness is so unconceivable, that
it astonishes me. I was then afraid lest Madam <hi>de
Chatillon</hi> had told him too much; and blushing, I
askt him, what happiness it was had so transported
him? Alas, Madam, reply'd he, I am not able to
express it; all that I am sensible of is only this, that
I adore ye; I wish that you could read it in my
heart. I find then, reply'd I, that Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon</hi>
has betray'd me, and 'tis in vain to dissemble
any longer. Rise, <hi>St. Albe,</hi> and hearken to me;
I love you; and all that you have done for me for
these dozen years together has convinc'd me that
you merit my Affection. I never thought that the
Disposal of Providence would order things in such
a manner as to testifie the impression which your
Accomplishments have made in my heart. I must
also tell ye farther, that tho we are now in a fair
way both you and I to a lasting Union, I should
hardly have resolv'd upon it, had <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes

               <p>'Tis true, 'twas Passion that fix'd my Resolution
to marry <hi>St. Albe;</hi> but I saw nothing of so much ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
in the Match, that was any way a lessening
to my Honour. He was a Gentleman, and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of singular merit: And I am persuaded, that
had he bin as rich as I, they who blam'd the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
most of all, would have bin the first Advisers
of me to it. For my part, I was not of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
that, Estate and Fortune are to be the Rules
of Wedlock; but on the other side, the less <hi>St. Albe</hi>
was worth, the more I thought my self oblig'd to
do things generously. But Generosity is not a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that men imagin we ought to boast of when
we marry. That Engagement is only lookt upon
as a driv'n Bargain, where we are to propose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to our selves but Profit and Interest. But I
insist too much upon the Justification of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct:
'tis enough for me, that my Marriage was
approv'd by all those that are endu'd with noble
and vertuous Sentiments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> was nothing alter'd in his Behaviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had marri'd me, but rather redoubl'd his
Consideration and Respect for me. I thought my
self then going to lead a Life of Happiness and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity:
But I was not yet arriv'd at the end of my
Sorrows. My Marriage being made publick, all
the Women, except Madam <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> forsook me,
lamenting my ill Conduct: And had you heard
'em, you would have thought they would have
more easily excus'd a piece of forbidden Galantry
then this Lawful Marriage. Such is the Unjustice
of the World, to judge of things by fantastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and Capriccio. They pardon'd me no more for
having married a man that I lov'd, then formerly
for having sought a Separation from a Husband
that I could not endure.</p>

The Old Count of—who had serv'd me in my
former Misfortunes, took my part at Court, and
came to visit me, on purpose to give me an Account
of the Good Offices he did me, by answering those
that told Idle Tales and Stories to the Queen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
my Marriage. At my House he met with
Mrs. <hi>Laval,</hi> with whom he enter'd into a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
She was witty and comely withal; and
the Count took a liking to her. He judg'd by her
Fidelity, and her constant Adherence to me, that
a man might be happy in his old Age to have a
Woman of her Character; and with these, and
perhaps some other Considerations, he return'd the
next day, renew'd his Discourse with Mrs. <hi>Laval,</hi>
and in eight days after made her a proposal of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
And though he had Children marri'd, yet
for her he was a considerable Match. For my part,
I had such a desire to see Mrs. <hi>Laval</hi> advanc'd to a
degree becoming her Merit and her Vertue, that I
spar'd for nothing to bring about the Match. At
length the old Count marri'd her, but kept a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Wedding, and the Marriage being a Secret, his
new Wife remain'd at my House; whither while
the old Count came every day to her, People began
to talk of them, as they did of <hi>St. Albe</hi> and me, when
they thought we were not marri'd.</p>
               <p>The Count therefore, to stop the Mouth of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
declar'd his Marriage, carri'd his Wife, whom
henceforward I must call the Countess of—to
his own House, and caus'd all the Honours to be
paid her, that were due to the Wife of a Person of
his Quality.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the Old Count's Marriage became
a Story full of divertisement; and they who had
enur'd their Tongues to Scandal and Calumny,
could not forbear talking. They renew'd the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55945:86"/>
of my past Galantries, and fail'd not to bring
in the Countess of—for her share, of whom they
told a hundred Idle Tales.</p>
               <p>I found my self in this manner become a third
time a prey to Envy and Reproach. Which when they
fasten once upon any Woman, let her Conduct be
never so void of Offence, she cannot shun the
Whirrits of their Malice.</p>
               <p>The Children of the Count of—beheld
their Father's Marriage with an Evil Eye; and not
being able to null it, they endeavour'd at least to
poison the pleasure of it. To which purpose they
maliciously order'd Letters to be deliver'd to the
Count, wherein they gave him Hypocritical Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
of my irregular Life, and that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess
his Wife was my Companion and Sharer in all
my Pleasures.</p>
               <p>The Count, who was a Person but of weak
Parts, gave credit to those Letters, became jealous,
and desir'd his Wife to see me no more. But she
refus'd to give him that Satisfaction, convinc'd as
she was, that he was in the wrong to require it of
her: Withal she conjur'd him to tell her who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
into him those vain Suspicions of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
Upon that he shew'd her the Letters he had
receiv'd, and she thought she knew the Hand: she
also shew'd 'em to me, and I found they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Blossac.</hi> He was both a Friend and nearly
related to the Children of the Count of—and in
regard he was acquainted with my first Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it was an easy thing for him to make what
use of 'em he pleas'd, as he had done in those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
For there was nothing more lewdly invented,
no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more unworthy an honest Gentleman, then
what he sent to the Count.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:55945:86"/>
Though I had an Opinion bad enough of <hi>Blossac,</hi>
yet I did not think he could have bin guilty of so
much Baseness; nor could I divine any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it, unless it were out of despight for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Scorn that I had put upon him. My second
Marriage had more incens'd him; whether that he
were naturally an Enemy to every thing that was a
pleasure to me, or that in despight of his wicked
Disposition, he had still preserv'd some remainders
of a passion for me. For th<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> are some People who
let loose their fury against a Woman, for no other
Reason, but because they cannot forbear having an
affection for her. They revenge themselves upon
her for the want of merit, which renders 'em de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
in her Eyes: Nor do I believe there can be
any Enemies more dangerous to the Reputation of
Women, then Lovers that cannot gain the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
Affection of their Mistresses.</p>
               <p>The Countess then, no longer doubting but that
the Letters were written by <hi>Blossac,</hi> gave her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
a desccription of him, and demanded justice
of him for the Calumnies thrown upon her. The
Count, who was a Man of sincerity, but somewhat
of a rude and unpolish'd nature, swore that if it
were <hi>Blossac</hi> who had written those Letters, he
would force him either to prove his foppish Tales,
or else make him eat his words. Presently the
Count went to look for him, and having found
him, he ask'd him whether he had writ the Letters
which he had receiv'd? But instead of returning
an Answer, <hi>Blossac</hi> fell a laughing; and then with
the Aire of a Person zealous for the Count's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
he told him, that he had nothing to object
against his Wife; only he was willing, as his Friend
and Servant, to let him know that I was very bad
Company, that no body was better acquainted


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55945:87"/>
with me then he, for that he had formerly bin a
sharer of my Favours; till finding me to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Coquette,</hi> he forbore my Company. <hi>Mon. Blossac,</hi> says
the Count, this that you say deserves a serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
My Wife has told me other things, which
no way agree with what you tell me: Come along
then, and let us see whether you will make good
these Stories to her Face. <hi>Blossac</hi> answer'd, that
he was not a Person <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was to be compell'd to
give such strict Accounts; that he had done the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Friend to inform him of what he knew;
and that he might make what use of his kindness he
pleas'd; if not, he might let it alone. And having
so said, he would have snatch'd the Letters out of
the Count's hands; but the Count lifting up his
Cane, threaten'd to use him like a Rascal as he
was. Upon which <hi>Blossac</hi> drew; but he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to put up his Sword and retire. The Count
made a great noise about this Adventure; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
also to the Queen, and soon after <hi>Blossac</hi>
was committed to the <hi>Bastille.</hi> But though he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to be guilty enough, I was not lookt upon
as innocent. 'Twas believ'd that he was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Bastille</hi> for the Falshoods written in his
Letters, but for having utter'd Truth, which a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Gentleman is never allow'd to publish. So that
all the Ridiculous Stories that had bin so often and
so unjustly attributed to me, were renew'd upon
occasion of this Quarrel.</p>
               <p>This Tempest was no sooner calm'd, but the
Death of my Mother, which happen'd about the
same time, gave an occasion for the raising of new
Batteries against my Reputation. Tho all the Estate
that was at her disposal was but very small, yet
she made a Will, by which she disinherited both me
and my Son, and left what she had to a Kinsman


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55945:87"/>
a far off, a Man that was hardly known in the
World. This Kinsman, desirous to make the best
of the Will, finding he should be hardly able to
make it good, endeavour'd to insinuate into the
Public, that the reason why my Mother had disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
me, was, because to her certain knowledge,
she was assur'd that my Son was none of my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's.
And for proof of this, he publish'd the
Reasons which my Mother had given of her being
so well assur'd; that is to say, he reviv'd whatever
my Husband had formerly invented to ruin me.
All which Scandals had bin so often reported, so
often refuted, that I wonder'd there should be still
any People so vain as to give themselves the trouble
of renewing 'em. But it is not with Calumny and
Reproach, as with other things that displease and
grow nauseous with being often repeated. Stories
that have bin told a thousand times over, are still
new, when they are reviv'd to the prejudice of
another; and there are People who have itching
Ears, and who are always ready to listen to 'em.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Count had wedded Madam <hi>Laval,</hi>
I married my Son, and at another time it would
have bin the greatest grief to me in the World to
have liv'd a-part from two Persons so dear to me;
but I had a Husband, the Consolation of whose
Company made full amends for those Lesser Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets.
We spent the Winters at <hi>Paris;</hi> and when
he departed for the Army, I retir'd to one of my
Mannors, where I had no greater pleasure, then to
write to him, and receive Letters from him. Three
years of my Marriage we spent in perfect Union;
nothing troubled our Felicity: And in truth, all
the honour of so happy a Union was due to <hi>St. Albe.</hi>
For never did man accompany his tenderness with
more respect and good humour; but men were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55945:88"/>
born to enjoy an uninterrupted and lasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in this World.</p>
               <p>The Mannor where I made my usual Residence,
when my Husband was in the Army, adjoin'd to
the Estate of a Gentleman whom I must call the
Count of <hi>Velley:</hi> A Person whom particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
had oblig'd to quit the Service, and who had
purchas'd a considerable Employment in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
Now in regard he was not satisfi'd with
the Court, he rarely went thither; nevertheless his
Business call'd him frequently to <hi>Paris.</hi> This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so soon as he had made himself acquainted with
<hi>St. Albe</hi> and my self, propos'd to us the letting
him have an Apartment in our House at <hi>Paris.</hi> He
was a Widower, and had only one Daughter about
Eighteen years of Age, whom he had caus'd to be
bred up in a Convent. However, <hi>Velley</hi> was yet
young enough, well shap'd, and had a great deal of
Wit: He was born with so great an Inclination for
all sorts of Sciences, and was so studiously addicted
to 'em, that he had attain'd to a considerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in 'em: But among all the Good Qualities,
he had one very Bad one, which had like to have
ruin'd <hi>St. Albe</hi> and my self, and which we never
were so curious as to mistrust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Velley,</hi> who could not believe, after all that had
bin reported of me in the World, that I was an
Enemy to Gallantry, took a fancy to court me.
Now in regard I was not sensible of any Inclination
for him, I was not offended with the marks which he
gave me of his Love; I treated him also after such
a manner as made him believe I was not displeas'd
with his Courtship: I also perceiv'd what he drove
at, because he redoubl'd his Sedulities, and gave
me sufficient Intimations that he was passionately
in love with me. Till then I little minded his


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55945:88"/>
Courtship; but when I found him in earnest, I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
my self more warily, and so behav'd my self
toward him, as to let him see there was no hopes.
And whether it were that my entire devotion to my
Husband made him forbear his Courtship, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he lookt upon my Severity as an Artifice which
I made use of to engage him the more, he spoke
no more to me concerning his Passion, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to live together as if he had never mention'd
any such thing to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> return'd from the Army, and we went
to spend the Winter at <hi>Paris. Velley</hi> accompani'd
us, and having fetch'd his Daughter out of the
Convent, presented her to me. She was witty,
and chearful in her humour, and I was glad of such
a pleasant Companion in my House. 'Tis true that
her Beauty was so lively and so charming, that had
I bin never so little addicted to Jealousy, or rather
could I have imagin'd that <hi>St. Albe,</hi> who lov'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Me and the War, could have bin of a humour
to alter his Inclination, I might have bin afraid of
her Allurements. I gladly therefore accepted <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s
Proposal to let him have an Apartment in my
House, though my Husband told me it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
to lodge Strangers under the same
Roof: but I assur'd him they were People that
would be no trouble to us in the World. He was
not accustom'd to contradict me, and therefore
would not oppose a thing which I seem'd to desire;
but added he with a smile, blame no body but your
self for what may happen, for Mademoiselle <hi>de Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
is very amiable. I answer'd him also with a smile,
that instead of alarumming my self at that, I desir'd
he might find her to his humour, for I lov'd him too
well to dislike what he lov'd. But he found too soon
that I did not mean as I said.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:55945:89"/>
About a Month <hi>Velley</hi> and his Daughter had liv'd
with us, when I perceiv'd that <hi>St. Albe</hi> labour'd
with a secret melancholy that tormented him, and
which he strove to conceal under various Infirmities
of which he complain'd; he spent the Nights
without sleeping; he sigh'd continually, and me
thought he avoided the sight of me; for when I
came to him to ask him what he ail'd, he shun'd
me, and sighing only cry'd that he was very ill.
This began to disturb me, and I desir'd him to
enter into a Course of Physick, to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that nothing but death could cure him. I
redoubled my cares and my Caresses, which he cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiv'd, and which I attributed to his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
I judg'd him to be very sick indeed, since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being a comfort, I was become a trouble
to him. I was so persuaded that his indifference
for me was no other then an Effect of his Disease,
that I durst not complain of it for fear of adding to
the pain of his distemper, the trouble which I
thought it would be to to him, should he perceive
me to be discontented with him. I made it my Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to divert him, and in regard that <hi>Velley</hi> was a
Jolly-man, I desir'd his Conversation. But I found
that his Company rather augmented then lessen'd
my Husband's Disturbances: only methought that
<hi>Mademoiselle de Velley</hi>'s appearance gave him some
Relief.</p>
               <p>This began to create disturbances within me of
another nature: I felt Suspicions and Jealousie
brooding in my Breast. But then thought I to my
self, if he loves <hi>Mademoiselle de Velley,</hi> wherefore
does his Love make him sick, since he sees her eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, and she, if I mistake not, no way seems dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
with his Company? It must be doubtless
then Remorse of Conscience for being thus perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55945:89"/>
to me; and he seeks to punish himself for his
falseness in loving another.</p>
               <p>I had so good an opinion of him, that I made no
question but that his sickness, supposing he did love
<hi>Mademoiselle de Velley,</hi> proceeded from his being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
of his having Sentiments offensive to me;
but then again I was as soon of another mind, and
thought him like those Husbands who cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the sight of their Wives when once they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unfaithful. While I was rowling these
thoughts in my mind, <hi>Velley</hi> enter'd my Chamber,
seemingly pierc'd with Grief and Vexation: in
which condition, when I ask'd him what he ail'd,
Madam, said he, I have strange News to tell ye,—you
here behold a Man at his Wits end—of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
I must leave your House—I understand
your Husband <hi>Monsieur St. Albe</hi>'s Disease—Here
are two Letters which he has written to my
Daughter, and which I intercepted—read 'em,
and then tell me, whether I am not the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
man in the World to come to your
House, to be the trouble of your felicity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
I took the Letters, trembling, I open'd 'em,
and found the Hand to be <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s. The first
contain'd the following Expressions.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>WHY lay ye to my Charge my Affection to my
Wife? Is it because you are not convinc'd
after all that I have said to ye, that Acknowledgment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forces me to have some sort of value for her. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
her only to raise my Fortune; but 'tis my Heart,
'tis Inclination and Choice that fix me to your self; and
if you continue your Rigours, you will certainly be the

'Tis impossible to express the shame and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

I had not strength enough to read the other, but

you have for me. For in short, what would you have me
do to convince ye that I hate my Wife, since what I do
every day before your Eyes, is not sufficient to perswade
ye of the Truth? You see I can hardly endure to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <hi>VElley</hi> strove to comfort me, and ask'd me,
what Satisfaction I desir'd his Daughter
should make me? 'Tis not your Daughter, said I,
that I complain against, but against a Man who has
abus'd my most sincere and constant Love. Speak,
Madam, reply'd <hi>Velley,</hi> what Commands will you
be pleas'd to lay upon me; I adore ye, I will sacrifice
my life to serve you in your revenge; for I must not
dissemble with you, the injury done you has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
in my heart all those Sentiments of Kindness
and Affection which formerly my Love disclos'd to
your Disdain. Let your Husband alone to follow
his indiscreet Passion: I'le answer for my Daughter,
that her Verture shall sufficiently punish him for his
Treachery. And as for your self, Madam, forget
an unworthy Husband were it only to make a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
change, and vow your Embraces to a Lover that
adores ye.</p>
               <p>I was at that instant so deeply perswaded of <hi>St.
Albe</hi>'s infidelity, and so resolv'd to revenge my
self, that I hearken'd to every thing that <hi>Velley</hi> said
to me; and I thought that the more he lov'd me,
the more ready I should find him to assist me with
his Counsel and his Services; and to tell ye the
whole Truth, I must confess my Vanity was so
humbled by <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Contempt, that I would have
listen'd to any man that would have but pretended
to afford me Consolation. For the supplys of Pride
are infinite in the heart of a Woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:55945:91"/>
I desir'd <hi>Velley</hi> not to forsake me; but to assist me
as a Friend. He advis'd me to take no notice to my
Husband of any thing that he had said to me; and as
he went out of my Chamber, he told me he was
going to study some pretence or other to put his
Daughter into a Convent; and indeed he carry'd
her that very day to <hi>St. Anthonies</hi> Abbey.</p>
               <p>After this Discourse I went to Bed, where I was
seis'd with a Fever. <hi>St. Albe</hi> desir'd to see me; but
I desir'd him to let me take my rest: however he
came into the Room without my leave. He took
me by the Arm, and as he was feeling my Pulse, I
perceiv'd the Tears that trickl'd from his Eyes. He
askt me whether I knew that <hi>Velley</hi> had carry'd his
Daughter to a Convent? But I made him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
for I believ'd the tears he shed to be no other
then the effect of his Grief for being separated
from his Mistress. He conjur'd me to take care of
my Health, but still I made him no answer; so that
he was forc'd to leave me.</p>
               <p>I spent that Night but very ill; and the next
Morning they told me that my Husband desir'd to
see me; but I sent him word that I had need of
rest, not having slept a wink all night. With that
he went away; and about Noon a Letter was
brought me from him; and I was also farther gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to understand that he had taken Horse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to give
him any occasion to suspect my Loyalty? No, 'tis a
pretence which he takes to lay the blame at my
door. But to what purpose does he absent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
'Tis because he thinks I love him too well to
endure him out of my sight; he believes me ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of his infidelity; he knows I am sick; and
desiring my death, he picks a quarrel with me,
that he may quite overwhelm me. For what else
can be his aim in betraying me? Alas, continu'd I
with tears in my Eyes, 'tis I who ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that his heart is taken from me. Is it possible
that <hi>St. Albe,</hi> that <hi>St. Albe,</hi> so different from all
other men, should be capable of so foul a Treason!
These were the Reflexions which I made; for I was
so prepossest against him, that it never came into
my mind that he might be innocent.</p>
               <p>After Dinner <hi>Velley</hi> came to see me, and gave me
an account how he had carry'd his Daughter to a
Convent: he told me also that she went with a
hearty good will, as being tormented to the soul
to be the occasion of <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s being in love with
any other but his own Wife. I told <hi>Velley</hi> that he
had left <hi>Paris;</hi> at which he seem'd to be in a great
fit of Admiration, and buzz'd it into my Head,
that <hi>St. Albe</hi> was meditating violence to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55945:92"/>
Then I shew'd him <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Letter, at which
he seem'd to be more surpriz'd; and after he had
stood a while in a Brown study, he told me that
my Husband had wrote to me in that manner for
no other reason but to puzzle and amuse me, and
to oblige me perhaps to run after him, but that it
behov'd me to stand upon my guard; for that if I
did not keep stedfast, he would make an ill use of
my weakness and my fondness for him. <hi>Velley</hi>
would afterwards have entertain'd me with Vows
and Protestations, and a long Preamble of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but I cut him off short, and told him that
besides other reasons which I had for not hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, my Husband's Letter furnish'd me with
one more: for in regard I thought he was in part
suspected by <hi>St. Albe,</hi> I was willing to shun him.
Afterwards I desir'd him to change his Lodging,
under pretence that it did not look well for a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to lye in my House, while my Husband was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>I shew'd the Letters which <hi>St. Albe</hi> had written
to <hi>Mademoiselle de Velley,</hi> to the Countess of—as
also the Letter which he had written to me upon
his going out of Town. She told me, she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
nothing of the Business; but that she fear'd
that both <hi>St. Albe</hi> and I were deceiv'd. 'Tis
requisite, added she, that I should see and discourse
<hi>Mademoiselle de Velley,</hi> perhaps I might then pick out
something of the Truth. I approv'd her Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and away she went to <hi>St. Anthonies</hi> Abbey
to find the young Lady; but the Bird was flown;
and the Abbess told her that her Father had sent
for her from thence to put her into another House.
The Countess coming back to bring me the News,
found <hi>Velley</hi> with me, who swore he knew nothing of
the matter, and therefore it must certainly be my


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55945:92"/>
Husband, who had made use of his Name to carry
away his Daughter<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At the same time also away he
ran, pretending to inform himself more fully of the
Particulars; and returning in the Evening, he told
me his Conjectures were too true; that his Daughter
was lost, and that he would prosecute my Husband,
who was the only man that could be suspected for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
stollen his Daughter. To which purpose he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
me to return him his Letters, which would be of
great service to him in point of Evidence. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to deliver 'em; for I had still some remainders of
kindness for <hi>St. Albe,</hi> which made me earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<hi>Velley</hi> to desist from all Proceedings against
him. I confess I had some reason to urge it for the
sake of my own Honour; but I was more concern'd
for <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Reputation.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a Report was spread abroad in
<hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>St. Albe</hi> and I were parted; 'twas also
said, that I desir'd to be rid of him, because he was
an Obstacle to my familiarity with <hi>Velley.</hi> And all
this while I kept my Bed, detain'd there rather by
my own Vexations, then by any Distemper that
troubl'd me. I also press'd <hi>Velley</hi> to leave my House,
because his Lodging in it at such a Conjuncture, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd
the greatest part of the Scandals that flew
abroad. And well it was I was rid of him; for no
sooner was he got to his new Lodging, but he was
apprehended by the King's Order, and carry'd to
the <hi>Bastile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I made no question but that <hi>St. Albe</hi> had really
stollen Mademoiselle <hi>de Velley;</hi> nevertheless, though
I was truly incens'd against him for his Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
yet I could not chuse but be afraid of
the danger that threaten'd him for stealing the
Young Lady; and I was extreamly troubl'd because
I knew not what was become of him; neither


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55945:93"/>
would I enquire after him, because I was unwilling
to let him have the pleasure to know that I troubl'd
my self about him. I was haughty enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the weakness which I found my self still sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of for an Ingrateful Person, who as I thought
deserv'd my hatred.</p>
               <p>Two or three days after <hi>Velley</hi> was apprehended,
I receiv'd a Letter from his Daughter, who sent
me word that she was in the Abby <hi>Aux-Bois,</hi> where
she desir'd to see me. You may be sure I did not
at all defer that Visit, but taking the Letters which
my Husband had written to Mademoiselle <hi>de Velley,</hi>
away I went in haste to the Abby <hi>Aux Bois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There I found her so much the more afflicted for
the confinement of her Father, because she was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the reason of his Commitment: And I
was so impatient to be inform'd of what I desir'd
to know, that instead of chearing her up, I ask'd
her briskly where my Husband was, and whether
he had not fetch'd her out of St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent?
He! Madam, answer'd Mademoiselle <hi>de Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
in great Surprize, what business of his was that?
'twas my Father fetch'd me from thence to put me
here. How! repli'd I, with some commotion of
mind, is it not true that my Husband courts ye?
No—I'le assure ye, repli'd she, nor do I apprehend
the meaning of these surprizing Questions. What
think ye then of these Letters, answer'd I, shewing
her the Letters which <hi>Velley</hi> had given me. I know
not what to say to 'em, repli'd Mademoiselle <hi>de Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
after she had read 'em, but I never receiv'd any
Letters from Monsieur <hi>de St. Albe,</hi> nor did he ever
declare to me that he had any such Passion for me.
Ah! Mademoiselle, cri'd I with a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
agitation, if what you tell me be true, where
am I, or what have I done? If my Husband be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55945:93"/>
how guilty am I! Mademoiselle <hi>de Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
was extreamly astonish'd to hear me talk at that
rate: Her Astonishment too appear'd to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned,
which made me ask her more Questions,
and her Answers confirm'd me in my thoughts that
<hi>Velley</hi> must have impos'd upon me. However, the
Letters seem'd to me to be <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
and I judg'd that he might have written
'em to some other Person. Upon that, I ask'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiselle
<hi>de Velley</hi> if ever my Husband had said any
thing to her concerning her Father's making love
to me? She answer'd that <hi>St. Albe</hi> had never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
any such thing to her; but that by his Sighs
and his profound Sadness he seem'd to her to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
that there was an Intreague between <hi>Velley</hi>
and My self. I blam'd her for not having given me
notice of it: However, now believing I had div'd
to the bottom of the Villany that had bin put upon
me, I desir'd Mademoiselle <hi>de Velley</hi> to go along
with me home; to which the Abbess was the more
willing to consent, persuaded that I took her away,
that she might be the more at liberty to sollicit her
Father's Enlargement. This made all People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that I was concern'd for <hi>Valley</hi>'s Confinement,
and that we corresponded in private. But I valu'd
not what they could say; my Business was only to
clear up the truth of a Mystery, wherein I began to
perceive that a Surprize had bin put upon me. My
Cautions vanish'd then, lest <hi>St. Albe</hi> should think I
ran after him; I order'd him to be sought for in
all places where I thought he might be found. But
I could hear no tydings of him, and I saw my self
become a prey to all the most dreadful Torments of
Grief and Disquiet. I did whatever lay in my
power to discover the truth of this Adventure, and
us'd my utmost endeavours to speak with <hi>Velley,</hi> in


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55945:94"/>
hopes he might be able to afford me full satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but no body was permitted to come to him;
so that I fell sick again, and Grief had infallibly
kill'd me, had not an unknown Person put into my
hands a Pacquet of Letters directed to me. I knew
<hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Hand and Seal, which made me open 'em
in great haste, to read the following Lines.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>LETTER.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Send you, Madam, the Letters which convinc'd me of
your Infidelity and my Misfortune. Judge by the
reading of 'em what effect they were most likely to produce
in a heart that ador'd you: I cannot survive this Change
of Yours. I have lost the desire of revenge, because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it without publishing your Inconstancy. After a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Life I am going to my Grave; and I love you
still so well as not to be asham'd of a Death which all the
World will attribute to my weakness; but which perhaps
will not appear to you so full of shame, whenever you are
pleas'd to call to remembrance how dearly I have always
lov'd ye.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>After I had read this Letter, I open'd with the
same impatience the Letters enclos'd, and which
contain'd the Proof of my Infidelity. And indeed the
Hand and Style of these Letters was so like my own,
that if I had not certainly known that I never wrote
'em, I should have bin deceiv'd. The Contents were
these.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>LETTER.</head>
                     <p>WHerefore d'ye upbraid me thus with what I did
for my Husband? 'Tis a piece of cruelty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
to my remembrance Things that overwhelm me with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Is it not sufficient that I here declare that I only live


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55945:94"/>
at present for your sake; since I have made you master of
my Person and my Heart, can you envy what I did for
another out of civility and necessity? Find out a way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from his sight, and to remove those troublesome
Testimonies that torment me.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>I had not patience to read the rest of the Letters
which were all of the same nature: For now I no
longer doubted but that my Hand had bin counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
as well as <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s, and that the whole was
done by <hi>Velley.</hi> In short, 'twas he who wrote 'em; for
he had a singular Talent to counterfeit all manner of
Hands; and as afterwards I understood, he was
sent to the <hi>Bastile</hi> for having counterfeited the Hand
of a Great Minister of State. I was then sensible of
the Fraud that had then put upon me, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
losing a moment's time, I enquir'd of him that
brought the Pacquet, where my Husband was. I
understood by him that he was at <hi>St. Florentin:</hi>
Thither I flew in a Post-Calash, and in Thirty
hours I arriv'd where <hi>St. Albe</hi> was. I found him
very sick, and almost past his Senses, as it were
gasping between Life and Death. I threw my self
about his Neck, and embracing him, with Tears
in my Eyes, I cri'd out aloud, My Dear <hi>St. Albe</hi>
look upon your own Wife. He open'd his Eyes, I
redoubl'd my Outcries, and Embraces, and at last
I perceiv'd that he began to know me. 'Tis not to
be express'd what then I felt in my heart; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that never any Person was sensible of the like;
for where is that Woman that ever was under the
same Circumstances?</p>
               <p>Half an hour after <hi>St. Albe</hi> came perfectly to
himself, and knew me exactly: However, he had
not strength enough to speak; only his feeble
hands by grasping mine, exprest his meaning;


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55945:95"/>
and I saw the Tears come trickling from his Eyes;
which was the cause I felt two contrary Passions at
the same time strugling in my Breast, Joy and
Grief. How griev'd was I to see him in that
plight! how overjoy'd to find him still the same
in affection and tenderness! How dearly soever I
lov'd him before, I never felt till then such tender
motions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Albe</hi> by degrees recover'd strength, and I
gave him an account of <hi>Velley</hi>'s Villany, shewing
him the Letters which he had counterfeited. But
he was no sooner convinc'd of my Innocency, but
he had like to have relaps'd into the same Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from which I had recover'd him, such were
the effects of his Grief, Repentance and Joy; Oh,
Madam, said he, I am unworthy of your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
Is it possible I should be so base to suspect
your Vertue? I ought to have distrusted my
own Eyes, rather then have injur'd your Vertue,
as I have done. Revenge your self, dear Madam,
upon a Husband so unworthy your Embraces, and
let me die to make an Atonement for such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
Jealousies. Live, answer'd I, my dear <hi>St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be,</hi>
if you desire that I should live; 'tis I that am
th' Offender; 'tis I that never understood your
Real worth; and had I not bin quite forsaken by
my Senses, I could ne're have thought it in your
power to become unfaithful. These Renovations
of Conjugal Friendship contributed more then all
the Doctors Prescriptions to <hi>St. Albe</hi>'s Cure. So
that in a little time he was in a condition to travel,
and we return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> to the wonder of all those
who had bin Testimonies of this Adventure.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Velley</hi> kill'd himself in Prison
to avoid the Punishment he foresaw would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on him. A Death so terrible was a greater


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55945:95"/>
revenge for the Villanous Legerdemain that he had
play'd us, and we began to pity his Daughter. And
therefore, knowing well she had no share in her
Father's Crime, we sollicited for her, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Confiscation of her Estate.</p>
               <p>This Adventure which had thus embroil'd my
Husband and I, did but serve to unite us more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
together: I began to relish the Delights of
my Marriage, and never was <hi>St. Albe</hi> more kind
and obliging then after that time. And therefore
in retaliation, I thought it my duty to spare for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might render him happy. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of—which I purchas'd for him in
the King's Houshold made all people murmur, and
set my Relations all in an uproar about my Ears.
But <hi>St. Albe</hi> was esteem'd at Court for his true
Merit; and he perform'd an Action besides, which
stopt the Mouths of his Detractors, and made 'em
judge more clearly of his Character. He had a
tender love for my Son, because he was my Son,
and for that he had a high value for every thing
that belong'd to me. He had no sooner obtain'd
the Government of—which the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon him without asking, in recompence of
his good Services; but he obtain'd a Grant of his
Employment for my Son, and made him a Present
of it. On the other side, my Husband still bare in
mind a lively resentment of <hi>Blossac</hi>'s ungenteel Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
to my prejudice, and had long waited an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of revenge, which at last Fortune put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hands.</p>
               <p>They Both serv'd in <hi>Flanders;</hi> where <hi>St. Albe</hi>
understanding that <hi>Blossac</hi> made it his Business to
speak disgracefully of Me and himself in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that he frequented, his Patience could no
longer contain it self. He forgot the Prohibitions


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55945:96"/>
against Duelling for my sake, and sent <hi>Blossac</hi> a
Challenge: <hi>Blossac</hi> met him at a private Place at a
distance from the Camp, where while they were
actually engag'd one against the other, they were
surrounded by a Party of the Enemy; and instead
of duelling each other, were forc'd to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Blossac</hi> was presently wounded, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to surrender to three Troopers, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
whose Prisoner he should be, were about to
have knock'd out <hi>Blossac</hi>'s Brains, when <hi>St. Albe,</hi>
who had disingag'd himself from those that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runded
him, perceiving <hi>Blossac</hi>'s danger, forgot his
private Enmity, and flying to his Succour, fell
upon the three Troopers that had taken him, kill'd
one, and putting the other two to flight, sav'd
<hi>Blossac</hi>'s Life, and rescu'd him from the Danger he
was in. 'Tis true that <hi>St. Albe</hi> was assisted by
some Officers of our Troops, who observing some
Passages between him and <hi>Blossac,</hi> and seeing 'em
Both walk off together privately from the Camp,
follow'd 'em at a distance, and came in time
enough to beat off the Enemy's Party; which had
they not done, as well <hi>St. Albe</hi> as <hi>Blossac</hi> might have
both undergone the same Fate, and both perish'd
together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blossac</hi> could not be so ill-condition'd as not to
be mov'd with what <hi>St. Albe</hi> had done for him;
so that he acknowledg'd in all Companies that he
was beholding to <hi>St. Albe</hi> for his Life, and offer'd
to make me all the publick Satisfaction I desir'd.
He confess'd that all his Evil Practises were only
the effect of his Despite to see himself rejected by
me; yet after all, he could not forbear his having
a very great affection for me: He desir'd <hi>St. Albe</hi> also
to beg my pardon in his behalf. <hi>St. Albe,</hi> contented
with this Satisfaction, demanded no more; and


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55945:96"/>
having inform'd me of this Adventure, we both
concluded that <hi>Blossac</hi> had bin sufficiently punish'd
for his ungenteel demeanour, by the shame and
mortification of being beholding for his Life to a
Person against whom he had always had an uncivil
Enmity. From that time forward he always shun'd
me: Nor did I know, nor did I care whether he
continu'd his love to me or no; but this I am
sure of, that the Hatred of Men of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
is less pernicious to Women, then their
Love; and that the greatest Misfortune that can
befal us, is to be belov'd by men, who not being
able to win the Affection of those they court, prove
so base as to seek their Revenge by throwing Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
and Calumnies upon those that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>light their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses.
There are another sort of men no less to
be fear'd by Women; and those are they who
would prefer themselves to a Reputation by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with those they court, when there is no
such thing; and as if I had bin destin'd to suffer
whatever could attack a Woman's Honour, I was
still expos'd to that Misfortune.</p>
               <p>Now though it were not to be question'd but
that I had a singular Affection for <hi>St. Albe,</hi> yet
there were People who persuaded themselves, it
was impossible that a Woman upon whom Scandal
had fasten'd so many Adventures, should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to a Husband. The Chevalier <hi>de Clausonne</hi>
prepossess'd with this Error, undertook to court
me; He was a Young man very handsome indeed,
and who had no other defect, but the vanity to be
thought a Fortunate Man in the World. He took
an acquaintance with my Husband, and became one
of his intimate Friends. <hi>St. Albe</hi> was naturally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
grateful for Civilities done him, and moreover
he lov'd Mirth and Good Company, and because


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55945:97"/>
he look'd upon <hi>Clausonne</hi> to have a Sportive Wit,
he introduc'd him into my Company. And now
you shall hear what method <hi>Clausonne</hi> took to bring
about his Design. He came every day to my House,
but he let fall nothing in his Conversation that
might give me the least occasion to distrust him;
so that believing he had no farther Ends, I was
pleas'd with his Company. He was still ready to
do whatever I desir'd him; which made me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
write to him, and frequently send to his
Lodging. On the other side, he was no less care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to make known the confidence I had in him:
However, he was not very apt to shew the Billets
he receiv'd from me; but though he did not shew
'em, he omitted nothing that might make People
believe that the only reason why I wrote to him so
often was, because I lov'd him. All this he reckon'd
as an honour to him; and by the manner of his
letting it be imagin'd that we understood one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he gain'd the Credit to be look'd upon as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon the Score he aim'd at, by all those who
knew not upon what accompt I suffer'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
'Tis one of the greatest Faults a Woman can
commit, to be guilty of these sorts of Familiarities
with Young men; and I would never advise any
of our Sex to follow my Example. 'Tis true,
that I was far from thinking it could be believ'd
that a Woman of my Years and Experience should
begin to dote upon a Young man. Nevertheless
the World imagin'd it, and began to talk aloud,
that my Husband was the Cully to his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with <hi>Clausonne.</hi> And the Chevalier him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
confirm'd this Report by his Assiduities,
and the Impostures which his Vanity invented.
But at length I came to understand what People
talk'd of <hi>Clausonne</hi> and my self, und told my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Husband


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55945:97"/>
of it, who did but laugh it, and advis'd
me to contemn reports, and to admit <hi>Clausonne</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Company as I was wont to do. He laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, that if I forbid him my House, it would
but give a credit to those Fooleries that were spread
abroad, whereas the still permitting him to keep me
Company would extinguish all those flying Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
I follow'd my Husband's advice, and since
he did me that justice which I deserv'd, I did not
think it became me to vex my self with with what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thought of me. For these reasons I still admitted
<hi>Clausonne</hi> to come to my House, with the same frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as before. But I never troubled him with any
more Errands, nor with any more of my Billets:
I also took the same care to avoid being with him
alone, and never spoke to him but in Company. He
was apprehensive of this Alteration, and suspecting
the cause of it, he went and told the Confidents of
his Vanity, that I had oblig'd him to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with more caution, because I perceiv'd that my
Husband began to be jealous of him. They gave
credit to <hi>Clausonne</hi>'s story; and there needed no more
for them to give out that <hi>St. Albe</hi> was jealous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
they reported also that there had been some fallings
out between him and I upon the account of my
pretended Gallantry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clausonne</hi> came not now to my House as he was
wont, but he affected to follow me where ever I
went, and he carry'd this Affectation so far, that I
took notice of it, and order'd him to be told that I
took his way of proceeding very ill; and that if he
did not mend his Manners he might chance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
it. He was afraid of my Threats, and after
that, carefully avoided my Company; and at length
he gave out that I was fickle in my humour, and
had sacrific'd him to my Husband's Jealousie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55945:98"/>
Tho this Affair seem'd to be but a Trifle, yet it
was a very great damage to my Reputation: for it
is not enough for a Womans Honour that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is satisfy'd with her Conduct: We are in an
Age so prepossess'd against the Wisdom and Vertue
of Women, that if a Woman lives lovingly with her
Husband, people believe he is either blind, or else
that he does but dissemble. <hi>Clausonne</hi> indeed ought
to have bin punish'd for his idle presumption; but
the remedy had bin worse then the Disease; which
shews how unhappy the Condition of Women is,
seeing it is the same thing whether they revenge or
not revenge their injur'd Reputation.</p>
               <p>But my Husband's good Opinion made me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
for the injustice of the World; and it was
apparent after so many adventures that our Union
could never be disturb'd but by death. But so it fell
out, that <hi>St. Albe</hi> dy'd in the flower of his Age, and
in the midst of all his Hopes: and after that, my
time was wholly taken up in grieving for the loss of
so dear a Husband, and so worthy of my sorrow.
Pardon me therefore if I recite the Particulars of so
sad a Separation.</p>
               <p>At the Battel of—and the taking of—which
follow'd that Battel, <hi>St. Albe</hi> had given all the Proofs
of Prudence and Va<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ur that could be expected
from an Officer of his Reputation; and it is said
he could not have fail'd of as high a Recompence
as could have bin confer'd upon a Soldier. But
three or four days after the taking of—advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a little too far to observe the March of the
Enemy who was going to fall upon one of our
Garisons, he receiv'd a Musquet-shot through his
Body, which was not thought so dangerous at
first.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:55945:98"/>
So soon as he was wounded, he wrote me word
that his Wound was but very slight, and desir'd
me not to afflict my self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I could not obey him
in that; I was extreamly troubl'd for him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd
to the Town whither they had remov'd him.
For two or three days he was in such a condition
as made us hope he would live. But all of a sudden
his Fever redoubl'd, and it was thought he had an
Aposteme in his Breast: however it were, he was
the first that knew all Remedies were useless, and
that he should die. Perceiving himself therefore in
that condition, he sent for me to his Bed side, and
ordering all the People to be put out of the Room,
he utter'd these last words of a Dying man.</p>
               <p>Flatter not your self, Dear Wife, with hopes of
my Cure; I am too sensible that you and I must
part. Then taking me by the hand, My business is
done, said he, and I must leave a Life wherein I had
no other delight but that it gave me an Opportunity
to serve and please you. Many things might escape
me which perhaps you might not so well approve
of, perhaps they might be contrary to your good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
but attribute them rather to my defects, then to
any ill intention: for I have always sought to render
my self worthy the Honour you did me. I die full
of acknowledgment of your Goodness. I liv'd
happy because you lov'd me: and I owe that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reputation I have acquir'd, to the Design I had
of rendring my self worthy of your Love. I have
endeavour'd to live like an honest Man, and to do
my duty, because I had the Honour to be your
Husband. I have made no Will, because I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is your own, and what you may
dispose of. Assure your Son I die his Servant; and
be kind to my Servants. So farewell, farewell for
ever. Withstand your Grief, and promise me you


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55945:99"/>
will not suffer your self to be overwhelm'd with
sorrow. And as you are the only person that makes
Life desirable to me; be so kind to my weakness,
for I must confess that seeing you, I have not that
Tranquility I ought to have to think of the Grand
Affair; be so kind, I say, as to withdraw your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from my sight.</p>
               <p>While he thus breath'd forth these dying words
into my Bosom, my Condition was to be pity'd. I
bath'd his hands with my Tears. My sobs and sighs
were the Passing-bells that towl'd his departure; nor
do I know which of us two were most concern'd
in the last moments of our Separation. When he
desir'd me to leave the Room, my strength forsook
me, and I know not what became of me. He was
sensible of my being fallen into a swoon, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his tenderness did but hasten him to his end, he
was unwilling to spend in useless sorrows the small
remainder of those minutes that were left him to
prepare for death; therefore he call'd the people,
and caus'd me to be carry'd away.</p>
               <p>They put me to Bed, where I came to my self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in two or three Hours: I would fain have return'd
to him, but they would not let me; nor would
they let me be at liberty till he had breath'd forth
his last gasps. Every one was taken up with his
own grief. His Servants were all in tears; the
Soldiers prest in, in Crouds, to see him, and kiss
his hands. The Officers withdrew profoundly si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and had not strength enough to oppose my
passage into his Chamber, where I beheld him
breathless. Good God! what a Spectacle was it
to me! 'Twas a Miracle that I surviv'd him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I stopt the Deluge of my Tears to pay him my
last Duties, and I signaliz'd my Love by the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of his Obsequies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:55945:99"/>
Here I end the Story of my Life; tho in the
Design which I propos'd to my self, to shew the
great unjustice done our sex, I may be able to find
new Proofs of that Injustice in what afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
me when I had utterly renounc'd the world. For I
found by experience that the most exact retirement,
and the most sincere and blamless Conduct are no
sufficient shelter from the Thunderbolts of Scandal.
When a Woman has once bin famous for being a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Gallantry, people will have it that she must
still retain the same inclination in retirement; and
every Friend or Director that comes to her, must be
her Servant.</p>
               <p>I hope to continue the Design I have begun in
justification of Women. I have known several who
have bin as little spar'd by publick Report as my
self; and I shall shew by the recital of their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
more clearly then by my own, That outward
Appearances are frequently deceitful, and that there
is more misfortune then Irregularity in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Women.</p>
