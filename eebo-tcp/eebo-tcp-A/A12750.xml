            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To all vertuous Ladies Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>or Worshipfull, and to all other of</hi> Heuahs <hi>sex fearing God, and leuing their iust reputation, grace and peace through Christ, to eternall glory.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT was the similie of that wise and learned <hi>Lactantius,</hi> that if fire, though but with a small sparke kindled, bee not at the first quenched, it may worke great mischiefe and dammage: So likewise may the scandals and defamations of the malevolent in time proue pernitious, if they bee not nipt in the head at their first appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The consideration of this (right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Worshipfull Ladies) hath incited me (though yong, and the vnworthiest of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands) to encounter with a furious enemy to our sexe, least if his vniust imputations should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without answere, he might insult and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himselfe a victor; and by such a conceit deale, as Historiographers report the viper to doe, who in the Winter time doth vomit forth her poyson, and in the spring time sucketh the same vp againe, which becommeth twise as
<pb facs="tcp:18300:3"/>
deadly as the former: And this our pestiferous enemy, by thinking to prouide a more deadly poyson for women, then already he hath foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med forth, may euaporate, by an addition vnto his former illeterate Pamphlet (intituled <hi>The Arraignement of Women</hi>) a more contagious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectation then he hath already done, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath threatned to doe. Secondly, if it should have had free passage without any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere at all (seeing that <hi>Tacere</hi> is, <hi>quasi consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi>) the vulgar ignorant might haue beleeued his Diabolicall infamies to be infallible truths, not to bee infringed; whereas now they may plainely perceiue them to bee but the scumme of Heathenish braines, or a building raised without a foundation (at least from sacred Scripture) which the winde of Gods truth must needs cast downe to the ground. A third reason why I haue aduentured to fling this stone at vaunting <hi>Goliah</hi> is, to comfort the mindes of all <hi>Heuahs</hi> sex, both rich and poore, learned and vnlearned, with this Antidote, that if the feare of God reside in their hearts, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all aduersaries, they are highly esteemed and accounted of in the eies of their gracious Redeemer, so that they need not feare the darts of enuy or obtrectators: For shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) is the end of them that shoote such poysoned shafts. Worthy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of imitation is that example of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who when he was told that a certaine man did
<pb facs="tcp:18300:3"/>
exclaime and raile against him, made this milde answere; Some dogs barke more vpon custome then curstnesse; and some speake euill of others, not that the defamed deserue it, but because through custome and corruption of their hearts they cannot speake well of any. This I alleage as a paradigmatical patterne for all women, noble &amp; ignoble to follow, that they be not enflamed with choler against this our enraged aduersarie, but patiently consider of him according to the portraiture which he hath drawne of himselfe, his Writings being the very embleme of a monster.</p>
                  <p>This my briefe Apologie (Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Worshipfull) did I enterprise, not as thinking my selfe more fit then others to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take such a taske, but as one, who not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any of our Sex to enter the Lists of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring with this our grand enemy among men, I being out of all feare, because armed with the truth, which though often blamed, yet can neuer be shamed, and the Word of Gods Spirit, together with the example of vertues Pupils for a Buckler, did no whit dread to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with our said malevolent aduersarie. And if in so doing I shall bee censured by the iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to haue the victorie, and shall haue giuen content vnto the wronged, I haue both hit the marke whereat I aymed, and obtained that prize which I desired. But if <hi>Zoilus</hi> shall adiudge me presumptuous in Dedicating this my <hi>Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18300:4"/>
vnto personages of so high ranke; both because of my insufficiency in literature and tendernesse in yeares: I thus Apologize for my selfe; that seeing the <hi>Bayter of Women</hi> hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his mouth against noble as well as ignoble, against the rich as well as the poore; therefore meete it is that they should be ioynt spectators of this encounter: And withall in regard of my imperfection both in learning and age, I need so much the more to impetrate patronage from some of power to sheild mee from the biting wrongs of <hi>Momus,</hi> who oftentimes setteth a rankling tooth into the sides of truth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I being of <hi>Decius</hi> his mind, who deemed himselfe safe vnder the shield of <hi>Caesar,</hi> haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to shelter my selfe vnder the wings of you (Honourable personages) against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting heate of this fierie and furious Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; desiring that you would be pleased, not to looke so much <hi>ad opus,</hi> as <hi>ad animum:</hi> And so not doubting of the fauourable acceptance and censure of all vertuously affected, I rest</p>

                  <p>In that you haue termed your virulent foame, <hi>the Beare-bayting of Women,</hi> you haue plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly displayed your owne disposition to be Cyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, in that there appeares no other Dogge or Bull, to bayte them, but your selfe. Good had it beene for you to haue put on that Muzzell, which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> would haue all Christians to weare; <hi>Speake not euill one of another:</hi> and then<note place="margin">Iames 4. 11.</note> had you not seemed so like the Serpent <hi>Porphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> as now you doe; which, though full of deadly poyson, yet being toothlesse, hurteth none so much as himselfe. For you hauing gone beyond the limits not of <hi>Humanitie</hi> alone, but
<pb facs="tcp:18300:6"/>
of Christianitie, haue done greater harme vnto your owne soule, then vnto women, as may plainely appeare. First, in dishonoring of God by palpable blasphemy, wresting and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euerie place of Scripture, that you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged; which by the testimony of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 16.</note> is to the destruction of them that so doe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it appeares by your disparaging of, and opprobrious speeches against that excellent worke of Gods hands, which in his great loue he perfected for the comfort of man. Thirdly, and lastly, by this your hodge-podge of heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Sentences, Similies, and Examples, you haue set forth your selfe in your right colours, vnto the view of the world: and I doubt not but the Iudicious will account of you according to your demerit: As for the Vulgar sort, which haue no more learning then you haue shewed in your Booke, it is likely they will applaud you for your paines.</p>
                  <p>As for your <hi>Bugge-beare</hi> or aduice vnto Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that whatsoeuer they doe thinke of your Worke, they should conceale it, lest in finding fault, they bewray their galled backes to the world; in which you allude to that Prouerbe, <hi>Rubbe a galled borse, and he will kicke:</hi> Vnto it I answere by way of Apologie, that though eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie galled horse, being touched, doth kicke; yet euery one that kickes, is not galled: so that you might as well haue said, that because burnt folks dread the fire, therfore none feare fire but those
<pb facs="tcp:18300:6"/>
that are burnt, as made that illiterate conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you haue absurdly inferred.</p>
                  <p>In your Title Leafe, you arraigne none but lewd, idle, froward and vnconstant women, but in the Sequele (through defect of memorie as it seemeth) forgetting that you had made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of good from badde, condemning all in generall, you aduise men to beware of, and not to match with any of these sixe sorts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>viz. Good</hi> and <hi>Badde, Faire</hi> and <hi>Foule, Rich</hi> and <hi>Poore:</hi> But this doctrine of Diuells Saint <hi>Paul</hi> foreseeing would be broached in the latter<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 3.</note> times, giues warning of.</p>
                  <p>There also you promise a Commendation of wise, vertuous, and honest women, when as in the subsequent, the worst words, and filthiest Epithites that you can deuise, you bestow on them in generall, excepting no sort of Women. Heerein may you be likened vnto a man, which vpon the doore of a scuruie house sets this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription, <hi>Heere is a very faire house to be let:</hi> whereas the doore being opened, it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a dogge-hole and darke dungeon.</p>
                  <p>Further, if your owne words betrue, that you wrote with your hand, but not with your heart, then are you an hypocrite in Print: but it is rather to be thought that your Pen was the bewrayer of the abundance of your minde, and that this was but a little morter to dawbe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the wall, which you intended to breake downe.</p>

To beginne with the first.</p>
                     <p>The efficient cause of womans creation, was <hi>Iehouah</hi> the <hi>Eternall;</hi> the truth of which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in <hi>Moses</hi> his narration of the sixe dayes<note place="margin">Genesis 1. 28.</note> workes; where he saith, <hi>God created them male and female:</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> exhorting all <hi>the earth to sing vnto the Lord;</hi> meaning, by a Metoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, <hi>earth,</hi> all creatures that liue on the earth, of what nation or Sex soeuer, giues this reason, <hi>For the Lord hath made vs.</hi> That worke then can<note place="margin">Psal. 100. 3.</note> not chuse but be good, yea very good, which is wrought by so excellent a workeman as the Lord: for he being a glorious Creator, must needes effect a worthie creature. Bitter water can not proceede from a pleasant sweete foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nor bad worke from that workman which<note place="margin">Psal. 100. 4.</note> is perfectly good, &amp; in proprietie, none but he.<note place="margin">Math. 19. 17.</note>

                        </gap>ll cause, or matter whereof woman was made, was of a refined mould, if I may so speake: for man was created of the dust of the earth, but woman was made<note place="margin">Genesis 2. 7.</note> of a part of man, after that he was a liuing soule: yet was shee not produced from <hi>Adams</hi> foote, to be his too low inferiour; nor from his head to be his superiour, but from his side, neare his heart, to be his equall; that where he is Lord, she may be Lady: and therefore saith God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning man and woman iointly, <hi>Let them rule</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Genesis 1. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>ouer the fish of the Sea, and ouer the foules of the Heauen, and ouer euery beast that moueth vpon the earth:</hi> By which words, he makes their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity equall, and all creatures to be in subiection vnto them both. This being rightly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doth teach men to make such account of their wiues, as <hi>Adam</hi> did of <hi>Eue, This is bone of</hi>

                        <hi>my bone, and flesh of my flesh:</hi> As also, that they neyther doe or wish any more hurt vnto them, then vnto their owne bodies: for men ought to loue their wiues as themselues, because hee<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 28.</note> that loues his wife, loues himselfe: And neuer man hated his owne flesh (which the woman is) vnlesse a monster in nature.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the formall cause, fashion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of woman was excellent: For she was neyther like the beasts of the earth, foules of the ayre, fishes of the Sea, or any other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour creature, but Man was the onely obiect, which she did resemble. For as God gaue man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18300:13"/>
a lofty countenance, that hee might looke vp toward Heauen, so did he likewise giue vnto woman. And as the temperature of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is excellent, so is womans. For whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, by reason of their grosse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, haue excrements for their habite, as foules, their feathers, beasts, their haire, fishes, their scales, man and woman onely, haue their<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> skinne cleare and smoothe. And (that more is) in the Image of God were they both created; yea and to be briefe, all the parts of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, both externall and internall, were corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent and meete each for other.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and lastly, the finall cause, or end, for which woman was made, was to glorifie God, and to be a collaterall companion for man to glorifie God, in vsing her bodie, and all the parts, powers, and faculties thereof, as instruments for his honour: As with her voice<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 20.</note> to sound foorth his prayses, like <hi>Meriam,</hi> and the rest of her company; with her tongue not to vtter words of strife, but to giue good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell vnto her husband, the which hee must not despise. For <hi>Abraham</hi> was bidden to giue eare<note place="margin">Genesis 21. 12</note> to <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife. <hi>Pilate</hi> was willed by his wife not to haue anie hand in the condemning of CHRIST; and a sinne it was in him, that hee<note place="margin">Math. 27. 19.</note> listned not to her: <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel</hi> councelled <hi>Iaacob</hi> to do according to the word of the Lord:<note place="margin">Genesis 31. 16</note> and the Shunamite put her husband in mind of harbouring the Prophet <hi>Elisha:</hi> her hands shold<note place="margin">2 Kings 4. 9.</note>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:18300:14"/>
be open according to her abilitie, in contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting towards Gods seruice, and distressed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, like to that poore widdow, which cast two mites into the Treasurie; and as <hi>Marie</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Magdalen, Susanna,</hi> and <hi>Ioanne</hi> the wife of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> Steward, with many other, which of their substance ministred vnto CHRIST. Her heart should be a receptacle for Gods Word, like <hi>Mary</hi> that treasured vp the sayings of CHRIST<note place="margin">Luke 1. 51.</note> in her heart. Her feete should be swift in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to seeke the Lord in his Sanctuarie, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Magdalen</hi> made haste to seeke CHRIST at his Sepulchre. Finally, no power externall or<note place="margin">Iohn 20. 1.</note> internall ought woman to keep idle, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it in some seruice of GOD, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her Creator, and comfort of her owne soule.</p>
                     <p>The other end for which woman was made, was to be a Companion and <hi>helper</hi> for man; and if she must be an <hi>helper,</hi> and but an <hi>helper,</hi> then are those husbands to be blamed, which lay the whole burthen of domesticall affaires and maintenance on the shoulders of their wiues. For, as yoake-fellowes they are to suftayne part of ech others cares, griefs, and calamities: But as if two Oxen be put in one yoke, the one being bigger then the other, the greater beares most weight; so the Husband being the stronger vessell is to beare a greater burthen then his wife; And therefore the Lord said to <hi>Adam, In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate thy bread,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:18300:14"/>
                        <hi>till thou returne to the dust.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That he that prouideth not for his houshold is</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>worse then an Infidel.</hi> Nature hath taught sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse creatures to helpe one another; as the Male Pigeon, when his Hen is weary with sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on her egges, and comes off from them, supplies her place, that in her absence they may receiue no harme, vntill such time as she is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreshed. Of small Birds the Cocke alwaies helpes his Hen to build her nest; and while she sits vpon her egges, he flies abroad to get meat for her, who cannot then prouide any for her selfe. The crowing Cockrell helpes his Hen to defend her Chickens from perill, and will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger himselfe to saue her and them from harme. Seeing then that these vnreasonable creatures, by the instinct of nature, beare such affection each to other, that without any grudge, they willingly, according to their kind, helpe one another, I may reason <hi>à minore ad maius,</hi> that much more should man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which are reasonable creatures, be helpers each to other in all things lawfull, they hauing the Law of God to guide them, his Word to bee a Lanthorne vnto their feete, and a Light vnto their pathes, by which they are excited to a farre more mutuall participation of each others burthen, then other creatures. So that neither the wife may say to her husband, nor the husband vnto his wife, I haue no need of thee, no more then the members of the body may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18300:15"/>
so say each to other, betweene whom there is<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 21.</note> such a sympathie, that if one member suffer, all suffer with it: Therefore though God bade <hi>Abraham</hi> forsake his Countrey and Kindred, yet he bade him not forsake his wife, who being <hi>Flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone,</hi> was to bee copartner with him of whatsoeuer did betide him, whether ioy or sorrow. Wherefore <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, <hi>Woe to him that is alone;</hi> for when<note place="margin">Eccles 4. 10.</note> thoughts of discomfort, troubles of this world, and feare of dangers do possesse him, he wants a companion to lift him vp from the pit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, into which hee is fallen: for a good<note place="margin">Eccles. 4. 10.</note> wife, saith <hi>Plautus,</hi> is the wealth of the minde, and the welfare of the heart; and therefore a meete associate for her husband; And <hi>Woman,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, is the glorie of the man.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 7.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Marriage is a merri-age, and this worlds Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, where there is mutuall loue. Our blessed Sauiour vouchsafed to honour a marriage with the first miracle that he wrought, vnto which<note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> miracle matrimoniall estate may not vnfitly bee resembled: For as Christ turned water into wine, a farre more excellent liquor; which, as the Psalmist saith, <hi>Makes glad the heart of man;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal, 104. 15.</note> So the single man is by marriage changed from a Batchelour to a Husband, a farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent title: from a solitarie life vnto a ioyfull v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and coniunction, with such a creature as God hath made meete for man, for whom none was meete till she was made. The enioying of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18300:15"/>
this great blessing made <hi>Pericles</hi> more vnwilling to part from his wife, then to die for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; And <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> to poure forth that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall exclamation against death, for depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him of his deerely beloued wife, <hi>O cruell hard-hearted death in bereauing mee of her whom I esteemed more then my owne life!

                        <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 23.</note> which hee entirely loueth, and for which hee gaue his very life; the decrest thing any man<note place="margin">Iob 2. 4.</note> hath in this world; <hi>Greater loue then this hath no</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>man, when he bestoweth his life for his friend,</hi> saith our Sauiour: This president passeth all other patternes, it requireth great benignity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18300:16"/>
and enioyneth an extraordinary affection, For <hi>men must loue their wiues, euen as Christ loued his Church.</hi> Secondly, as the Head doth not iarre or contend with the members, which <hi>being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>yet make but one bodie;</hi> no<note place="margin">1.

Thirdly, and lastly, as<note place="margin">1.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus if men would remember the duties they are to performe in being heads, some would not stand a tip-toe as they doe, thinking themselues Lords &amp; Rulers, and account euery omission of performing whatsoeuer they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether lawfull or not, to be matter of great disparagement, and indignity done them; whereas they should consider, that women are enioyned to submit themselues vnto their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands no otherwaies then as to <hi>the Lord;</hi> so that<note place="margin">Ephes 5.</note> from hence, for man, ariseth a lesson not to bee forgotten, that as the Lord commandeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done, but that which is right and good, no more must the husband; for if a wife

                  <p>GReat was the vnthankefulnesse of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler vnto <hi>Ioseph;</hi> for though hee had done him a great pleasure, of which the<note place="margin">Gen. 40. 23.</note> Butler promised requitall, yet was hee quite forgotten of him: But farre greater is the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of those men toward God, that dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to speake and exclaime against <hi>Woman,</hi> whom God did create for mans comfort. What greater discredit can redound to a workeman, then to haue the man, for whom hee hath made it, say, it is naught? or what greater discurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie can be offered to one, that bestoweth a gift, then to haue the receiuer giue out, that hee cares not for it: For he needes it not? And what greater ingratitude can bee shewed vnto GOD then the opprobrious speeches and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull inuectiues, which some diabolicall natures doe frame against women?</p>
                  <p>Ingratitude is, and alwayes hath beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted so odious a vice, that <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <hi>If one doubt what name to giue a wicked man, let him call him an vngratefull person, and then hee hath said enough.</hi> It was so detected among the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> as that by a Law they prouided, that such should suffer death as felons, which prooued

                  <p>I demand whether <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> were not women, who both of them sang hymnes of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing vnto the Lord; the one for his mercy in granting her victory ouer <hi>Israels</hi> enemies, the<note place="margin">Iudg. 5.</note> other for his fauourable giuing vnto her a son,<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>And where-asse you say, Page 4. line 22. <hi>that a woman that hath a faire face, it is euer matched with a cruel heart, and her heauenly lookes with hellish thoughts:</hi> You therein shew your selfe a

Many examples seruing to confute your vniuersall rule might bee produced, but these are sufficient to dispell this your cloud of vntruth. As for your audacitie in iudging of womens thoughts, you thereby shew your selfe an vsurper against the King of heauer, the true knowledge of cogitations being appropriate<note place="margin">Math. 12. 25.</note> vnto him alone.</p>
                  <p>If your assertion, That <hi>a woman is better lost then found, better forsaken then taken</hi> (Page 5. line 4.) be to be credited, me thinkes, great pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is, that afore you were borne, there was none so wise as to counsell your father not to meddle with a woman, that hee might haue es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped those troubles, which you affirme, that all married men are cumbred with, Page 2. line 20. As also that hee might not haue begotten such a monster in nature <hi>Asse</hi> your selfe, who (like the Priest which forgot he was Parish Clearke) defame and exclaime against women, as though your selfe had neuer had a mother, or you neuer beene a child.</p>
                  <p>You affirme (Page 10. line 18.) that <hi>for the loue of women, Dauid purchased the displeasure of his God:</hi> It had beene good that you had cited the place of story where you finde it, For I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet in Scripture read, that the Almighty was displeased with <hi>Dauid</hi> for his loue to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

                  <p>Page 11. line 8. you count it <hi>Wonderfull to see the mad feates of women, for shee will now bee merry, then sad:</hi> but me thinkes it is farre more <hi>wonder-foole</hi> to haue one, that aduentures to make his Writing as publique as an In-keepers Signe, which hangs to the view of all passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to want Grammaticall Concordance in his said Writing, and ioyne together <hi>Women</hi> plurall, and <hi>shee</hi> singular, <hi>Asse</hi> you not onely in this place, but also in others haue done.</p>

A man can but haue either a good wife or a bad; and if he haue the former, you say he doth but seeme to amble to hell; if the latter, he were as good trot to the diuell: But if married men ride, how trauaile Batchelours? surely, by your rule they must go on foote, because they want wiues; which (inclusiuely) you say are like hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to carry their husbands to hell.
