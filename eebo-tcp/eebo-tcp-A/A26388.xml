            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſo forgetfull of the Rocke from whence we were hew'n, and the hole of the Pit from whence we were digged, as not to think our ſelves enough concern'd in <hi>their</hi> mercies, to bleſſe God for them.</p>
            <p>And as the God of our mercies did ſo ſeaſonably prevent us, ſo hath his goodneſſe and mercy all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long followed us in affording means of light and life to us, from one generation to another. If <hi>we remember the days of old,</hi>

And this we mention upon no other account than to remember you of our being brought forth in a Land of Bleſſings, which we think it our duty to look back upon as a providence too full of goodneſſe to be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>But (as in which our own concernments are more ſpecially wrapt up) we deſire moſt of all to ſpend our ſerious conſiderations upon the Lords gratious dealing, as to Goſpel mercies, with this Nation, in our days.

When, or where did the King of Saints ever ride up and down, in his ordinance of preaching the Goſpel in ſo much Glory and Triumph, as in this Age and Nation! This bleſſing is doubled, is multiplyed upon us, in reſpect of other times and places, whether we look backward or round about us, we are preſented with a neceſſity of acknowledging that <hi>the light of the Moon,</hi> with us, <hi>is as the light of the Sunne,</hi>

many of our people have with the things of God, how unhappy a qualification this is for any thing that is evill, and what unavoidable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages the Devill hath againſt thoſe poor ſouls, whom he is ſure to ſet upon in the dark. Though we are conſtrained to beleeve, that ſome are very well able to digeſt their convictions, and have light enough to ſee themſelves wallowing in the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world; yet can we not but be perſwaded of very many, that both the <hi>Mother</hi> &amp; <hi>Nurſe</hi> of their miſcariages is their <hi>ignorance,</hi> being never yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſo much illumination, as throughly to perceive the filthy and damnable nature of ſin,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23 Acts 4. 12.
