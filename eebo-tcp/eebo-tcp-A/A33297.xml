            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To <hi>Jacob</hi> indeed it was shewed, that of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> should <hi>Shiloh</hi> come: but whether Male, or Female, nothing certain. <hi>David</hi> was assured that a Son of his should sit upon his Throne for ever: But till <hi>Isaias,</hi> it was not known that he should be born of a pure Virgin: that a <hi>woman should compass a man.</hi> Isa. 7. 14. <hi>Behold a Virgin,</hi> that famous Virgin (the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sets it forth with an Accent) spoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>shall conceive and bear a Son.</hi> The very place of his Birth was not set forth till <hi>Micha</hi> did it. <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. Not the just time till <hi>Daniel</hi> foretold it. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. Thus by degrees, and piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal (as it were) God spake of old to the Fathers by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. Every age almost, brought sorth some new thing touching the Babe of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> (lapt up in the swathbands of the Holy Scriptures) either in express and evident terms, and testimonies, or else in mirrors, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Lastly <hi>John Baptist (Fibula Legis &amp; Gratiae,</hi> as one calls him) the Buckler of the Law, and Gospel, pointed him out<note place="margin">Chrysolog.</note> with his finger, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

For his Nobility, He is <hi>Gods</hi> own <hi>Son:</hi> For his Riches, He is <hi>heir of all things:</hi> For his Wisdom, <hi>He made the Worlds:</hi> For his Eminency, <hi>He is the brightness of his Fathers Glory, and the express Image of his Person:</hi> For his

               <p>The quallity and kind of <hi>Christs</hi> Death is remarkeable for three Characters which were engraven on the Death of the Cross, which he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Death</note> 1. For the painfulness of it. The nature of that Death was painfull: For Death it self is painfull; no man payes that debt with ease. When <hi>Asa</hi> dies, he cryes, <hi>Ah my feet.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> dyes, he complains, <hi>O my cold Body.</hi> When the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Child dyes, he cryes, <hi>Ah my pained head.</hi> When <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>zzah</hi> dyes, he cryes, <hi>Oh my Leprous skin.</hi> Life is a precious Pearl: But there are three things besides, which made <hi>Christs</hi> Death painfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His violent Death.</note> 1. Violence. It's painfull to die of any violent disease: but when five deaths do all concur, and strive which of them shall dispatch the poor man soonest, this must needs be more painfull. Such was <hi>Christs</hi> Death, which made him complain. <hi>Psal. 22. 16. They pierced my hands and my feet,</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 34. <hi>One of the Souldiers with a Spear pierced his side, and forthwith there came out blood, and water.</hi> Here are five Deaths that invaded a living man: Death on each hand, and on each legg, and death on his side, though this last, came a little too late. Now a violent Death it must needs be, when strong and great nails did pierce the most nervous parts of his Body, his hands and his feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His slow Death.</note> 2. Slowness. Four leasurely violent Deaths seized on him. Blood is the life of the living Creature: then look how long his blood was coming out, his Life was dropping out as long. It's a great aggravation for a man to be long a dying, and yet cannot die. To have his torment quick, and yet his Death slow is an Image of Hell, where men <hi>seek Death, and yet cannot finde it. Christs</hi> slow Death was divided into four quarters. Death at each hand, and at each foot made his pain the greater. The weight of his Body did hang upon those four tormenting nails, his pierced Hands and Feet, as if Death had delighted to hold <hi>Christ</hi> long at sea, and to deny him it's last sad service.


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95889:27"/>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> had been before dying a terrible Death in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when he was boiled (as it were) in a bloody sweat: and two circumstances shew that the two Thieves Death was nothing in slowness of torment comparable to <hi>Christs</hi> death.</p>
               <p>1. The sad and direful preparatories to <hi>Christs</hi> Death, as he was the night before in a Soul-death, when those <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it were <hi>Drops,</hi> or <hi>great hail stones</hi> of blood, frozen, or hardened together (as <hi>Stephanus</hi> thinks) through extream terrour: when he was scourged, and Crowned with Thorns.</p>
               <p>2. He was so weakned in Body thereby, that he was not able to bear his own Cross: which made him complain. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>I may tell all my Bones. My strength is dried up like a Potsheard:</hi> So that <hi>Christ</hi> began to die the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and continued dying twenty four hours, the Lords anger and curse being on him, and then bodily pain, with the curse of the Law all this time wrought upon him. And <hi>Christ,</hi> in bearing the pains of the second Death, did suffer that which all the Elect should have sustained in their Souls for ever. <hi>Isa. 53. 6. The Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all:</hi> and though <hi>Christ</hi> died but one Death for all the Elect, yet in the extremity of the pain, it was many Deaths to him.</p>
               <p>3. Many degrees of Life were taken from him. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how much of Life Christ had, and the removing of it by violence must be so much the more painfull. Now life natural had in <hi>Christ</hi> a sweet and a peaceable dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the possession of life was with excellent delights: It was planted besides the Glorious God-head personally, and so had sweet company, and that made it pleasant. It had not been so much to take away the Life of a common man, whose life is not priviledged with Grace, and the Grace of a Personal union with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. His shame full death.</note> The second Character that was engraven on <hi>Christs</hi> Death, was, that it was shameful, and reproachful. Now Shame is, first, Fundamentally in the cause: Sin, and Sin acted by men against that Law of God is the onely


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95889:28"/>
foundation of Shame: <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 25. Aaron <hi>made the People naked to their Shame.</hi> So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. Shame and sin are neer a kin. And thus <hi>Christ</hi> was no more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Shame than he was of sin. He came out of the Womb clothed with the white Robe of Innocency, and he never contracted one black spot on that fair Robe of the highest Image of God from the womb to the Grave, and therefore there was no shame fundamentally in <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is Shame formally in sin: and that, first, In be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ashamed Actively. Secondly, In bearing of Shame Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively. In the former consideration, because sin is a shameful thing in itself. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 13. There is an Internal blushing, and Shame rising from sin; the Conscience of the sinner (if it be not cauterized) thinking ill of sin, and esteeming it self base in doing it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>What fruit had you in those things whereof you are now ashamed?</hi> So <hi>Christ</hi> thought ill of sin, and esteemed the Creature base in sinning. 2. <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord being our surety, though he could not be ashamed of any sin he did himself: Yet being made a sin for us, he did bear the shame of our sin: and thus he was not free from shame passively, as it's a punishment of sin. <hi>Isa. 50. 6. I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</hi> Heb. 12. 2. <hi>He endured the Cross, despising the shame.</hi> So then in these respects <hi>Christ</hi> did bear our Shame.</p>
               <p>1. In that, though he was the Lord of Glory, and <hi>thought it no robbery to be equal with the Father;</hi> yet he abased himself to become man: yea, the lowest of men, a Servant. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 7.</p>
               <p>2. All the tokens of reproach and shame were on his sufferings: As,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In Gestures: they put a Crown of Thorns on his head: and a Reed for a Scepter in his hand to mock his Kingly Power. They saluted him with mocks, and bowing the knee to him.</item>
                  <item>2. In words. They cried out, <hi>Hail, King of the</hi> Jews: They scorned his Prophetical dignity, when they blindfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, saying, <hi>Prophesie who it is that smote thee.</hi> And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95889:28"/>
his Priesthood, they put a Robe on him: and when he was on the Cross offering himself as our Priest in a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, all that passed by, wagged their Heads, and shot out their Lips, saying, <hi>He trusted in God, let him deliver him,</hi> &amp;c. Then did they spit in his face, which in the Law was a great shame. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 9, 50. <hi>Job</hi> 30. 10.</item>
                  <item>3. His Death was shameful, the Death of a thief, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: So it's called, Christs <hi>reproach. Heb. 13. 13. Let us go forth bearing his reproach.</hi> It was a shameful thing to see the Lord of Glory, bearing his own Cross on his back, and all the children, and base ones of the City wondring at him, and crying out upon him. This is called the <hi>reproach,</hi> or Shame of <hi>Christ. Heb.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 7.</item>
                  <item>4. They shamed him in pulling off his Garments, and scourging him. As, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 26. They brought him bound to <hi>Pilate</hi> as if he had been a Common Thief. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 2. Hence <hi>Isa. 53. 3. He was despised, and rejected of men: and we hid as it were our faces from him.</hi> He had all shame put upon him: He was branded as the greatest Thief of the three: He went out at the Gate of life, bleeding, pained, cursed, shamed, forsaken, despised and mocked. Even the Sun seemed to be ashamed to see its Creator in so painful and shameful a condition, and therefore hid its head.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. His cursed Death.</note> The third Character which was engraven on <hi>Christs</hi> Death, was the curse of God. Now the Curse that <hi>Christ</hi> was made, Was,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Lords pronouncing him a Curse. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. <hi>Cursed is he that hangeth on a Tree;</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> applies to <hi>Christ. Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 13. This indeed was a Ceremonial curse; but had a special Relation to <hi>Christ,</hi> who was under a real, and Moral Curse.</item>
                  <item>2. Gods devoting and setting him apart in his eternal Counsel for suffering the punishment of sin.</item>
                  <item>3. The dishonour that was put upon him; and so was <hi>Christ</hi> under a curse. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 7. <hi>He was a worm and no man. Isa.</hi> 53. 3. <hi>The least of men:</hi> the contempt and refuse of men. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>The Stone rejected by the builders.</hi> Hanging is the death of the poorest, and basest of men: and thus was <hi>Christ</hi>


                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95889:29"/>
used. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 30. <hi>Whom ye slew and hanged on a Tree.</hi> Act. 2. 23. <hi>Whom by wicked hands ye have Crucified and slain.</hi> Hanging is more then slaying: It's putting him to a base Death that is cursed of God and man: and this to be inflicted on a King lineally descended of the Blood Royal, the Kingly Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> the onely man on Earth that by birth and Law had Title to the Crown of <hi>Judea,</hi> was the worst that men or Devils could do.</item>
