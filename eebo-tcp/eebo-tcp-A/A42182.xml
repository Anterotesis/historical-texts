            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Should Appologize for my ſelf, for Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt ſo many Men, and for encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring ſo many Loads of Paper with a few ſingle Sheets, were I convinced they had any Authority for what they ſay, or write; who have Nicknamed <hi>His Royal Highneſs, the Duke of York, TRAYTOR,</hi> or <hi>PAPIST:</hi> But ſince I have no other Cauſe to believe the Diſcourſe, than the fickle, and unthinking Humour of thoſe who have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Dictates of a diſcontented Party; and would, at the ſame time, have miſnamed
<pb facs="tcp:32592:5"/>
the Government, had it not been wary of their Proceedings and, on the ſuddain, arraigned their Actions; I know no reaſon, why I ſhould not ſpeak my Opinion, as well as ſuch <hi>Whirlygig-State-Projectors;</hi> eſpecially, ſince the ſence of what I here Write, is ſignified to us by ſuch Authorities, that we have no need to queſtion the Truth of them.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Judicious Reader,</hi> I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this little Treatiſe to your ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and I hope it may prove good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick this Spring Time, to our <hi>Sir Politick-Would-be's,</hi> who ever rejoyce when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is at a default, though the Blot be for their Advantage: And then if any <hi>Wicked Stateſ-man</hi> will but <hi>Hound</hi> them on, O what a noiſe will they make! though not half ſo well well coupled, as an indifferent Pack of Beagles; and 'tis their eager purſuit, generally, that makes them looſe their Credit. But this is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
<pb facs="tcp:32592:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I may be ask't, What I have to do to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf with the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Loyalty?</hi> To the <hi>Candid Reader,</hi> I hope, this will be a full Anſwer: <hi>Ever ſince I was Eleven Years Old, I have lived under this Government, as it is now Eſtabliſhed;</hi> and my Heart has hitherto Bleſſed the <hi>King,</hi> and I have wiſhed Him Succeſs in all His undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and I have had good Cauſe to do ſo, ſince His Majeſties Laws are a Delight, and need not be grievous to any of His Subjects: On this bottom I juſtify my ſelf, in Writing upon this Subject concerning the <hi>Duke,</hi> who, by all <hi>Loyal</hi> Men, is lookt upon to be a <hi>good Subject,</hi> a <hi>Dutiful Brother</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>One</hi> that ſeeks the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Nation:</hi> Whereas thoſe who ſay the contrary, and give him the Name of <hi>PAPIST,</hi> and <hi>TRAYTOR,</hi> do generally ſhew themſelves to be of Diſloyal Principles, and ſuch as the Nation have little
<pb facs="tcp:32592:6"/>
reaſon to credit. And from hence I infer, That thoſe who are obedient to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> will love the <hi>Duke of York;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> are (as all good Subjects ought to be) to Serve <hi>God,</hi> and Honour the <hi>King:</hi> And therefore, his being ſlander'd with the Name of <hi>PAPIST, TRAYTOR, Enemy to the KING,</hi> and Kingdom, or any o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Name, that the giddy heads of theſe idle People can imagine, can make no other impreſſion in the Hearts of wiſe Men, than to raiſe a juſt indignation againſt their Malice, and a Heart endeavour to prevent the danger that may enſu<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head>THE Royal Favourite CLEAR'D.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a Time (in the Year 1680.) when this <hi>Illuſtrious Prince, James Duke of York,</hi> ſeem'd to the moroſe, and ruder ſort of <hi>People,</hi> to lie under a Cloud; And the Factious, at <hi>that</hi> Time, ſeem'd to Eclipſe His Glory: And then to aſſert His <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> to be a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32592:7"/>
good Subject to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and that there were no reaſonable Arguments ever brought to prove him a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> was all one to them, as to have affirmed, That the <hi>Pope</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, or that the Real Preſence was in the Elements of Bread and Wine after Conſecration, and as little it would have been believed.</p>
            <p>Yet ſome there were, even in that Time, (whereof one was my intimate <hi>Acquaintance</hi>) that had the Courage, and the Honeſty, to juſtify the <hi>Dukes Loyalty,</hi> and to beat back all the Arguments then uſed to prove Him a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore take his method, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce my Diſcourſe with thoſe Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments that make moſt to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and cannot without impudence be deny'd.</p>
            <p>For, What can be more Demonſtrably
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32592:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plain to prove the <hi>Duke</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> than the Words of the Act of <hi>Parliament, 25 Car. 2. To throw Popiſh Recuſants out of all Offices, and Places of Truſt, and to Diſplace them from the Houſehold, Service or Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Majeſty, or of His Royal Highneſs, the Duke of York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is here not the <hi>King,</hi> and His <hi>Brother,</hi> wiſely conſidered by this Act? does it not fence them about, and guard them from <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> approaches, that might ſlyly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themſelves into Courts and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without a Teſt? Now, ſince God and Nature has provided ſo well for Us, as to give Us ſo wiſe a <hi>King,</hi> and ſo Illuſtrious a <hi>Prince;</hi> Both ſpringing from the Loyns of that Moſt Glorious Martyr, <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> our Late King, who dyed for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion:</hi> Can we exerciſe our jealouſies over again, and dodge with the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32592:8"/>
Government with pitiful ſcruples, and Wreſtings of ſuch generous expreſſions, and Confidence the then <hi>Parliament</hi> had of the <hi>Duke,</hi> at the Time of making that Act? Againſt ſo plain an Exception of His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the direct words of which can never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to be in the penalty of that Law; though, at that Time, the <hi>Duke</hi> might ſee occaſion to lay down ſeveral of His great Offices, which might make ſome ſort of Men conjecture it was done for that end and purpoſe; As if it were not ſufficient to belie one <hi>Prince</hi> to His Grave, but we muſt endeavour a Second time to do ſo in his Iſſue; And as if the malice of one Age were not enough to make a Nation miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that it muſt be Intailed upon their Poſterity, to render it utterly deſtroy'd in the next.</p>
            <p>Were it not that the Eyes of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32592:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
part of the Nation are opened by theſe, and the like Obſervations, twere probable, we might once more ſuffer under the like Circumſtances: But, thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> who has put it in the Heart of our <hi>King,</hi> to guide us in the ways of Peace, and to bear with the Infirmities of thoſe who have been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly infected with <hi>Anti-Monarchick,</hi> and <hi>Deſtructive Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, What can the <hi>Parliament</hi> mean, when they made an Act in the Thirtieth Year of <hi>Car. 2d. To diſable every Perſon from Sitting in the Houſe of Parliament, that would not take the Teſt?</hi> To make a Proviſo, <hi>That it ſhould not extend to the Duke of York;</hi> were it not that they valeued him as a Perſon of that Honour, and Generoſity that they could do no leſs than diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of His Majeſties Subjects, eſpecially ſince He is ſo neerly Related to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32592:9"/>
the Crown, has ſo well deſerved of the King, and has been ſo often thankt for His good Services by themſelves: This is ſo plain, and the Character of a <hi>Papiſt</hi> fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Duke</hi> ſo malicious, that it needs no Vindication, were it not to undeceive a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Men whoſe Fathers having ſuck'd in the Poyſon of Rebellion in the Laſt Age, have made it their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to introduce it in this.</p>
            <p>Can any thing give us more Aſſurance of <hi>His Royal Highneſs,</hi> than the Words of the beſt of Kings, who in a Speech to His <hi>Parliament</hi> on the 6th. of <hi>March,</hi> in the 31 Year of His Reign, told Them, <hi rend="margQuotes">He had Commanded His Brother to abſent Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Him, becauſe He would not leave the moſt malicious Men room to ſay, He had not removed all Cauſes, which could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to influence Him towards Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:32592:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is here not a Reflection on the King himſelf by the moſt malicious, which the King is pleaſed to take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Notice of? And, when He Commands His Brothers Abſence, is it not to ſtop the mouths of the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? And, their ſpiteful calling of the <hi>Duke, PAPIST,</hi> Or His inclining the <hi>King</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Popiſh Councels,</hi> call'd by His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> any thing elſe than a Pretence? what then ſhall be ſaid to ſuch malicious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, if even Their own Requeſt granted, though never ſo unreaſonable, will not give them ſatisfaction? it behoves therefore <hi>His Majeſty</hi>'s good Subjects, to be more unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and Hearty to one another, that ſo it may break the Hearts of all Malicious Pretenders, who, under the mask of <hi>Liberty, Property,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> endeavour the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Ruine of the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> who can hence forward be ſo blind,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32592:10"/>
and ſottiſh, to credit a correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Duke of York,</hi> for the bringing in of the <hi>Roman Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as has been pretended? And, who can, for the time to come, imagine Letters and Intreagues of that nature, when the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the Deſign that has hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ſuppoſing thoſe Letters to be the <hi>Duke</hi>'s, can reach no farther than a Civil Behaviour, which is due to the <hi>Turk, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul,</hi> or <hi>King of Morocco?</hi> We are obliged to Trade in thoſe Countrys; yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, with ſafety and ſecurity, without a Correſpondence: And, who are ſo proper to tranſact ſuch Affairs, as the prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State?</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, 'tis Monſtrous to raiſe a Belief of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> from the <hi>King</hi>'s Speech, which clearly explains its ſelf; or from the afore-recited Acts of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32592:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Parliament,</hi> which many would interpret to the prejudice of <hi>His Royal Highneſs,</hi> though the <hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> on <hi>Sunday April</hi> 1679. does even then credit its own Report, with no other Reaſons than what may ſeem to the <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader,</hi> to be here fully Anſwer'd: And it muſt the rather be thought ſo, when the Triple Vote of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> was afterwards incountred with the Opinion of the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> who rejected the Bill againſt the <hi>Duke,</hi> becauſe <hi>They</hi> were not ſo ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Now having deliver'd to you the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition of a <hi>Happy Favourite,</hi> ſeated on the Right Hand of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as well by His own Merit, as His Princes choice; who was Honoured and eſteemed by good Men, and was a Terrour only to the Bad:</p>
            <p>Let Us trace Him from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32592:11"/>
by the Impetuoſity of his Enemies, from the Preſence of the <hi>King,</hi> and luſter of a Court, into a ſolitary Baniſhment: Let us obſerve Him leaving our ſhoare, and rendring himſelf to the unconſtant Ocean, which is not yet ſo unſettled, as the Land from which He parted: And, though many Waves lifted up their Voices againſt Him: yet, by the greater number, let us conſider Him (though among Enemies) Wafted into a Safe Harbour: For, being a Noble Foe, He could Fear no danger in His Misfortunes, when in His Triumphs He could not inſult over His Adverſaries amongſt Forreigners, His Cardinal Vertues (ſo much ſlighted by Us) made Him more Honoured, than He was <hi>Here,</hi> with the Addition of His Guards, and Dignities: <hi>There,</hi> amongſt the moſt zealous <hi>Papiſt,</hi> He was lookt upon as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured <hi>Proteſtant Prince,</hi> bearing the Figure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32592:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of His Father's goodneſs and conſtancy: <hi>There,</hi> He propagated Our <hi>Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> whilſt <hi>Here</hi> He was falſely ſurmiſed to endeavour its Deſtruction: Whilſt He was <hi>There,</hi> with thoſe who would have been glad of any Opportunity to affront our Nation, He manifeſted ſo much Duty and Loyalty, ſo much Love and Reſpect for His King and Country; That He made faithful Friends and Ally's, of Thoſe that might otherwiſe have been our Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and would have trampled upon our Religion, and made Their will Their Law: So that the malice of a Baniſhment intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Adverſaries, could not prevent the Charactar of a Peace-maker, a worthy Patriot, a grand Polititian, a Friend (as well as Brother) to the King, a <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of thoſe that diſpitefully uſed Him, and Trayterouſly ſought his Ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:32592:12"/>Thus are the falſe <hi>Achitophels</hi> miſtaken, and, againſt their Wills, are ſaved from the danger they would avoid by Him, whom They intended to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>But now, it is Time to conſider of His Return: Our Vigilant <hi>King</hi> ſitting at the Helm; and carefully watching every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government, found it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo prudent a Stateſ-man ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lie under Hatches: He no ſooner ſpake, than all who Loved the King had Their Eyes upon the ſhoare, and Their Dayly Prayers for the <hi>Duke</hi> were, That the Seas and Winds might render His Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age pleaſant and delightful; and that each gentle Gale might direct Him into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of our <hi>Hearts</hi> and Armes, that we might deliver Him ſafe into the Embraces of his King and Brother.</p>
            <p>Behold Him come, <hi>His</hi> Sailes fill'd with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32592:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Honour and Renown; Though ſurly <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> dreading His own Overthrow, had laid an Ambuſh behind a Mountainous Wave, to encounter Him: But He was not to be overcome in thoſe Seas, on which He had Victoriouſly rode <hi>High Admiral:</hi> To Him, <hi>Neptune</hi> muſt Bow, though armed with His Trident, and mounted on the <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And one would gueſs, 'twas in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this League Marine, that he ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent in his <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Mighty</hi> Flouds to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the <hi>Low Countrys,</hi> leſt himſelf ſhould be again controuled by that dreadful Power he never could withſtand.</p>
            <p>Therefore in vain do you ſtrive, you hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of diſcontented Common-wealths-men, in vain do you ſet yourſelves againſt this <hi>Hero,</hi> you ſhall be forced to contribute to his Greatneſs, whom all the World admires,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32592:13"/>
even your Meritorious ſufferings ſhall add to his Glory.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>(Kind Reader)</hi> take one view more, and then farewel: Behold the <hi>King</hi> like <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the mid'ſt of the Multitude of his Councellors, conſulting the ſafety of himſelf, and of his Kingdoms, diſpencing his gentle Influences every where, and like a Deity, warming the coldeſt corners of the Land: And then caſt your Eyes on a Rebellious, and ſtiff-necked Nation, ſuch as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was of Old, wanton with eaſe and plenty, froward and diſcontented; Who would never ſerve their God, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they pleaſed, nor obey their Prince in any of his juſt Commands. And after this proſpect Review our <hi>Hero,</hi> whoſe Vertues are a Task for the whole World to imitate. And ſee him in Obedience to his <hi>Kings</hi> Commands, making an eaſy Progreſs into
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32592:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Hearts of theſe untameable People; though the way that leads to their Hearts, as well to as their Country, is naturally Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many difficulties: See him Settling, Confirming, and giving a Luſtre to that Religion that here we would exclude him from, together with his Birth-right, and make him wander for a God, as well as for a Country.</p>
            <p>Behold him incouraging the Kings Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and good Subjects, and reducing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled minds of a diſcontented Party into their due Obedience.</p>
            <p>Thus, our <hi>High Commiſſioner</hi> has God and the King, Religion, and Loyalty to juſtify his proceedings; whilſt thoſe who Damn him, with their pretended God with Us, are like to ſuffer Heavens Vengeance for their Preſumption, if God gives them not the Grace of Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32592:14"/>Now, from theſe and ſeveral other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may be given, I hope there is none that will be ſo fooliſh, or obſtinately wicked, as to perſiſt in the Opinion of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s ſeparating himſelf from the Intereſt of the <hi>King,</hi> and Kingdom, after ſo many inſtances to evince the contrary: But if any ſort of Men can be ſo Crazy, or Mad, to continue in ſo palpable an error; the World muſt conclude them buſy bodies, and Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in what they have nothing to do; Common-wealths-men, Trayterous Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators, and ſuch as would diſturb the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, and for a livelyhood would wiſh our Waters as much diſturbed, or more then the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were, by their late Inundation: And whilſt theſe Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries remain, Faction cannot be thought ſtrange, or Rebellion quite out of Faſhion.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially, when His <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:32592:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>King</hi>'s only Brother, ſhall be Aſſaſſinated in Effigie, for want of a fitter opportunity to exerciſe their Malice upon His Perſon: Tis againſt the <hi>Duke</hi> they lay their Seige, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Duke</hi> they ingage a Party: But the Government is not ſo unwary, as not to provide againſt their dangerous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, knowing their Squint-Eyed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge carries with it a Malicious intent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſon of <hi>His Sacred Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to conclude, were I to give my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion what remedy might beſt ſerve to Cure this <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> it ſhould be to be Touch'd, were it not ſo Univerſal that it would prove the greater evil of the two, in bringing a Conſumption upon the <hi>Kings Exchequer,</hi> which none can ſo well remedy, as a Loyal, Grateful <hi>Parliament,</hi> by making a bountiful return to their moſt Gracious King and Governor: I ſhall ſay no more,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32592:15"/>
who am but a Wellwiſher to the <hi>King,</hi> and Kingdom: Only, may Heaven preſerve <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> and this Government, as now Eſtabliſh'd; <hi>And</hi> may <hi>His Majeſty</hi> have a long and happy Reign; And when He has finiſhed His Days, may his Memory be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned to future Ages, as His Clemency and Goodneſs has been manifeſted to Us, and the reſt of the World, in This.</p>
