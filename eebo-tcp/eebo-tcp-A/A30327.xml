            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Elf-Love is so natural to us, that
as it makes us apt to flatter our
selves on all occasions, so it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
us to accept too easily of
the flatteries of all others; even
those flatteries which Decency
makes us turn away from, and seem to dislike,
are hearkned to by us: We open our Ears
to them; we lay them up in our Memory,
and do often please our selves with vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on them. But we are so little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to find fault with our selves, or to
reflect on our Errors and Follies, that when
Thoughts of that kind break in upon us, we
fly from them; we impute them to Vapours,
to Fits of the Spleen and Melancholly. Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
to know our own Faults, or to be
humbled under the sense of them, makes us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
when any venture on the most charitable, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101250:3"/>
often the most unacceptable Act of Friendship,
the telling us of our Faults. If it is possible,
we will either deny or extenuate them: or if
Sense and good Breeding makes us civil to such
Friends, yet we will feel a Sharpness arise, we
will Love them the less for it; and if we can,
we will be ready to revenge our selves by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
some Admonitions to them; perhaps
not without some Acrimony of Look or Stile.
All this arises from the partiality and injustice
with which we treat our selves, which must
incline us to love others the better, who treat us
in the same manner.</p>
            <p>But as long as we have Faults, it is very fit
that we be made acquainted with them: And
since we are too much blinded in our own
favour, it is a great Happiness to fall into the
hands of such Friends as will not spare us:
It is better that we should hear of them even
from Enemies, than to be kept in an Ignorance
that must be fatal. There are few in the
World who do not commend Friendship as the
chief Happiness of Life, and are not ready to
run out upon the advantages of having found
a true and faithful Friend; and yet even those
who are very copious upon so common a Theme,
do not much care for the best Offices of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101250:3"/>
No man can perform this Act of Friendship,
without some force put upon himself; unless
there is a great mixture of Roughness and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliousness
in his Temper. Few love to
touch a tender part, or to grieve a person who
is dear to them. Therefore the harder it is to
reprove another, it ought to be the more valued,
and the better received. Caresses and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations
pass easily among Friends: These are
the common and natural Vents of Friendship.
Reproofs and Admonitions go against the grain;
therefore Friends ought to encourage them,
let their Friends know, that they expect them,
and by the good Entertainment that they give
the first Essays made of this kind, to secure
themselves of a continuance of the like Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> understood well the happiness of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an ancient, and as it were a hereditary
Friend made sure of; therefore he says a little
after the words of my Text,<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Thine own Friend,
and thy Father's Friend, forsake not.</hi> And in the
words I have read, he sets out the best use and
effect of Friendship. In the preceding words
he had set out the Mischiefs that may arise from
<hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Anger,</hi> which are <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>outragious:</hi>
To which he adds, <hi>But who can stand before En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy?
Wrath</hi> and <hi>Anger</hi> are commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101250:4"/>
by ill usage, or injury; so Innocence
may protect a man from them: But <hi>Envy</hi> is
an ill-natur'd passion, that is raised without any
provocation. The Vertues, or the Reputation,
the Prosperity and Happiness of others, set men
on to detract from their Fame, or undermine
their Happiness, without any prospect of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to themselves. Men therefore whose
Qualities, as well as their Condition, expose
them to Envy, though they must expect their
share in it, yet are by my Text directed to
the best Methods to prevent the advantages
that Spiteful men may take; for if their Friends
are before-hand with their Enemies in their
Reproofs, and if they themselves are so wise as
to be corrected by their means, then envious
Men will not find much matter to work on.
Their Friends see their Faults while they are yet
secret, before they break out into open obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
so by the kind severity of their rebukes,
they save them that shame, which the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that Envy will soon make, may bring upon
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Open rebuke is better than secret love.</hi> A
Friendship that carries a man to <hi>rebuke</hi> another
plainly and roundly, with a due measure of
severity, is better then <hi>secret Love;</hi> that is, a
fond, tender, and indulgent Love, that may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101250:4"/>
be sincere and deep, but is so blind and feeble,
as either not to see Faults in their Friends; or if
they see any, not to be able to disturb their
Quiet by seasonable Reproofs. Another sense
is given to these words; <hi>Open,</hi> that is, publick
<hi>rebuke,</hi> is better than <hi>secret love;</hi> that is, <hi>rebuke</hi>
in <hi>secret.</hi> Some can bear Reproofs in secret,
but are not the better for them; therefore in
such Cases, though we ought always to begin
our Admonitions in private,<note place="margin">18 S. Matth. 15.</note> according to our
Saviour's Rule; yet when these do not prevail,
we ought to <hi>rebuke before all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 20.</note> that if the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is not reclaimed by it, yet <hi>that others may
fear.</hi> This is chiefly to take place when mens
<hi>sins</hi> are so publick,<note place="margin">24 Verse.</note> that <hi>they go before to judgment,</hi>
and do as it were extort it. Such <hi>wounds,</hi> when
given by a friend with a good design, and in a
proper method, are <hi>faithful,</hi> that is, they are
sincere, they are proofs of his Fidelity to the
Ties of Friendship, they will also attain their
End; and as the Incisions of a Skilful Surgeon
are faithful, and do quickly heal again, so such
Rebukes will have a good effect. Others ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the word, <hi>Beautiful;</hi> there is nothing more
amiable in True Friendship, than so exact and
just a Freedom, as makes a man neither to
overlook nor to neglect the Faults of his Friend.
On the other hand, the <hi>Kisses</hi> or Caresses of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101250:5"/>
an Enemy, who covers his Hatred with the Shews
of Friendship, and with a dissembled Behaviour,
who kisses on design to betray, as <hi>Iudas did his
Master;</hi> These are <hi>deceitful;</hi> they are false in
them; they flatter persons to their faces, for
those very Faults for which they will censure
them severely in Corners: they are also <hi>deceitful,</hi>
while they see people commit Faults which they
hope will be their ruin; and yet lest they
should find that out, and prevent their ruin
by seasonable Correction, they study to humour
them in them, that they may become Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
and be Infallibly ruined by them. But
the word may be also rendred <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi>
or <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>pressing,</hi> as well as <hi>deceitful.</hi>
The sense will then be, the <hi>Kisses</hi> or Caresses <hi>of
an Enemy</hi> will be redoubled; they will be offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in them both in season and out of season.
Flatterers, when they perceive that their base
Obsequiousness is acceptable, they follow close
upon that Scent; they are Assiduous and Abject
in it. And whereas Friends are cautious, and
must wait fit Opportunities to reprove, Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
find Access at all times, and are ever Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
every thing that is either said or done
by him, whom they hope either to subdue or
ruin by their mean Compliances. Nor is it
easy to shake off that servile Crew; their <hi>kisses
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101250:5"/>
are hard;</hi> they strike against a weak part; few
Men are wise enough to find them out, or
strong enough to resist them. Some are so
course in their Flatteries, that they must quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be nauseated; but Men of Design, who
have the Art to season their Flattery, to hit
right in it, and are dextrous in the Methods
of offering it, are often too hard for Men, who
in all other respects may be very valuable, but
in this only do really lessen themselves, by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
others to magnify them too much.</p>
            <p>Thus I have opened the various Rendrings
of the Words of my Text; all amount to the
same sense in general, That we do then express
our Friendship in the best manner, when we do
plainly and openly Reprove our Friends for
their Faults, which will be much more useful
to them than any Fondness, how deep or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
soever, when it makes us excessively Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to them. Such Reproofs may be as
Wounds, and give a very painful Uneasiness:
but even that will be Medicinal; it will bring
our Faults into View, and into our Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
when we see that others observe us, it
will bring us into a habit of looking more
carefully to our selves, and of observing all
our Words and Actions with due Attention:
Whereas on the other hand, Enemies, who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101250:6"/>
have no other Regards but for their own Ends,
or perhaps for our Ruin, they will by frequent
Flatteries, well timed, and skilfully infused, so
corrupt our Minds, that as they will render us
more uneasy to the Rebukes of our true and
faithful Friends, so they will feed our Self-love
to such a height, that we shall be thereby exposed
to Errors that may end very fatally, and make
us perish unpitied, as well as live inexcusable.</p>
            <p>The Words thus opened, do lead us to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our Obligations to this Duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
others: That will be soon setled, if
we do consider the Zeal that we owe to God
and to his Honour.<note place="margin">69 Psal. 9.</note> 
               <hi>If the zeal of his house</hi>
does as it were <hi>eat us up,</hi> then <hi>the reproaches of</hi>
those who do as it were attack and defy him,
<hi>will fall on us.</hi> We will feel a lively concern in
us for the Honour of Religion; and when we
see it dishonoured, we will interpose, if it were
but to express a just Indignation at Impiety
and Vice. If we have any regard to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of other Men, whether with respect to
this Life, or to the next; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
if we are under strict Ties of Kindred,
Friendship, or any other Relation to them;
but chiefly if we watch over their Souls, and
must give an account of them; then certainly
we will not so far <hi>hate our brother in our heart,<note place="margin">19 Lev. 17.</note>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101250:6"/>
as to suffer sin upon him, but will in one way or
another reprove him,</hi> lest by such a vicious fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
we bring <hi>his blood on our own head;</hi>
               <note place="margin">33 Ezek. 6.</note> that
is, entitle our selves to a share in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that those Sins which we connived at
may bring down both on him and on us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eli</hi> had a large share of Punishment for his
Remisness to his Sons:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 13.</note> We have Sins enough
of our own, we need not therefore take an
additional Load of <hi>partaking in other mens sins;</hi>
and indeed,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5 22.</note> if we desire to <hi>keep our selves pure,</hi>
and to maintain in our Minds a just abhorrence
of Sin, we ought never to contract so easy
a neighbourhood and familiarity with it, even
in others, as to let it pass without feeling an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
at it, and expressing that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest
methods we can fall on. We owe it to
the Society we live in, and to the next Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is growing up before us, to take care
that Sins, especially open ones, and such as are apt
to spread and infect others, should be either repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by secret Reproofs, or the Sinners be brought
to open Shame and Punishment, that such as see
the one, may likewise see or hear of the other.</p>
            <p>If Sins grow National, and are avowedly
practised without Shame or Check, they will
probably be put to the account of the whole
Nation, and so they may draw down Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101250:7"/>
Judgments, from which we have no reason to
expect an Exemption, if we do not except our
selves, by doing our duty in order to their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
But when that is done, we may expect
a distinction, even in a common Calamity; or
at least we shall have this comfort, even if we are
overwhelm'd in it, that we were not wanting in
our Endeavours to stave it off, by putting a stop
to those Sins that brought it on.</p>
            <p>I will dwell no longer on this; for how little
soever some may like Reproof, as generally
those who need it most, like it least; yet all
will agree in the general, That it is absolutely
necessary for the preserving the Order and Peace
of Society, that there should be both Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to admonish, and Magistrates to punish
Offenders. It is therefore more necessary to
shew how this ought to be managed to the best
advantage, and with the most probable hopes
of succeeding in it.</p>
            <p>The first and most necessary Rule, is that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by our Saviour, That no man should offer
to reprove another, who is eminently and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
faulty himself; he who having a <hi>beam
before his eye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7 Matth. 3, 4, 5.</note> does not remove that, but goes
about to take a <hi>small chip of wood out of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
eye,</hi> does justly lay himself open, according
to our Saviour's words, to the Imputation of <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101250:7"/>
The aversion that is in every man to the
being subject to the Corrections of others, will
then rise up into a just Indignation, when he finds
that he is thus set on, by a man who is known to
be more guilty than himself. It is an impudent
thing to make that pass for a crime in another,
which we know we are practising every day our
selves. Nor is it enough to authorize a man to be
a Monitor, that he does not offend just in that sort
and manner for which he blames others. He must
be a man of Integrity in all respects; Education,
Age, Habits, and the different Circumstances of
Life, may make a great diversity with relation to
particular Sins; yet both Virtue and Vice are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
Things; and if a man is in some parts
of his Life irregular, especially if he lives in those
Sins that carry a Train along with them, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
cannot have a great Effect. Let a man be
ever so sober and temperate, yet if he is false
and deceitful, if he is unjust and spiteful, those
things which require Thought and Study, and in
which Men do pursue a design, and where they
are not convinced of their Faults, nor redress
them by restoring or repairing that in which they
have wronged others; all this man's Reproofs
will be thrown off, as soon as it is known how
crafty or false he is: they will be reckon'd among
the Arts of Hypocrisy, by which he studies to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101250:8"/>
gain some Credit and Authority, that it may
help him to go on in his other wicked Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and may at least keep him long from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suspected of them, or discovered in them;
for a man who passes for a grave Admonisher
of others, seems to be thereby covered from all
black Imputations. I am afraid some Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of this sort that have been made, may
have brought a Scandal upon all Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Religion: For as there is no Principle
nor Party in Religion that can support Men in
those deceitful Practices; so no man is guilty
of them, but he himself knows it, he goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them with Deliberation and Study, and he
lives in them still, till by as full a restitution as
he can possibly make, he has compleated his
Repenting of them. After all, it is not enough
to qualify a man to <hi>rebuke with authority,</hi> that he
cannot be charged with as bad things as those
are for which he blames others; he must <hi>shine
as a light in the world;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Phil. 15.</note> there must be something
Eminent and Exemplary in his whole Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
His Candor and Integrity, his Humility and
Meekness, his Modesty and Charity, must be so
conspicuous,<note place="margin">5 Matth 16.</note> that <hi>his light may thereby shine before
others;</hi> and then he may more reasonably hope,
that others may be wrought on both by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and Influence to <hi>glorify his Father which is
in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101250:8"/>
Another Rule to be observed in Reproving
is, to do it in such a manner, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
we are their Friends whom we reprove,
and that we Correct them for their own Good.
Some by indulging too much to a sharp and
morose Temper, reprove with an acrimony
and heat, that is liker to provoke than to gain
upon any:<note place="margin">Ps. 141. 5.</note> We ought to <hi>reprove in kindness</hi> (for
so the words of the Psalm may be rendred)
and then those smitings will be as an <hi>excellent
oil that will not break their heads</hi> whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.
The tenderness we express will enforce
our Admonitions, and it will raise the spirits of
those, whom freer Reproofs might otherwise Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
too much: As therefore we ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chiefly
when we begin to deal with any in this way,
to address our Reproofs in the softest manner
possible, and shew while we Reprove others,
a readiness in our selves to submit to the like
Reproofs from them, so we ought to watch all
occasions in which it may be in our power to
do acts of kindness to them; that having by
this means got some interest in their affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we may have thereby the more credit with them.
We ought to be ready to own how near we our
selves may have been in other parts of our
life to those very faults for which we blame
them. We ought to make our first essays at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101250:9"/>
fit times and in the likeliest way to succeed, in
private, or in a Letter; thus to make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
in the properest manner, that so we
may conquer and gain him whom we take to
task; and we must be sure to join with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
that may be necessary, such mollifying
strokes as may secure to us a ready access for
the future, if there is occasion to return again
to the like Admonitions; but then tho we must
rise in the severities of our stile, yet we ought
never to sink in the expressions of our affection,
as long as we have any hopes of succeeding in
the way of private Admonition.</p>
            <p>But the most comprehensive Rule in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Reproofs, is to order them with
discretion and prudence; otherwise all we can
do that way will have no effect; we will pass
either for hypocritical, morose, supercilious, or
fantastical Men. This is a thing of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and may be so much diversified, that it
will not be easy to bring it all under clear and
certain Rules; but some few of the more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are to be considered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> With relation to the things for which
we find fault with others, they ought to be of
some Importance: In trifles it is not worth the
while to reprove. To stand too nicely upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101250:9"/>
small matters, may give others such a mean
opinion of our Understanding, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
on greater occasions will make no
impression, because they have been often applied
to such inconsiderable things. The insisting
too much on a peculiar Cut of the Hair, as
was too common in the last Age, or on
Modes of Dress, is a sure way to bring our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
into such Contempt, that all we can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
at, will look like Affectation or Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
We ought not to lay too much weight
on small or disputable things, but should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
our Zeal to the importance of the
Matters we are concerned for. We ought also
to have some good reason to believe Men to be
guilty of those things for which we deal roundly
with them. It is hard enough to submit to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
even when Men know that they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, but if they know they are Innocent,
they will very naturally justify themselves, they
will accuse their Reprovers as Credulous and
Uncharitable, and will not fail to put them in
mind at another time when reproved, though
they know themselves guilty, how that upon
another occasion they were unjustly suspected
and blamed; therefore when we do Reprove,
we ought to make just allowances for the false
Reports that go in the World, and be ready
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101250:10"/>
both to be disabused by them, or at least to
make all the just abatements that in reason can
be supposed, and be ready rather to lessen than
to aggravate the Offence.</p>
            <p>Another measure of Discretion is with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Persons to whom we may address our
Reproofs; generally speaking, Junior or Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Persons ought not to Reprove those who
are above them in Age and Rank; yet some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
must be made even to this, <hi>for Old Men
are not always Wise.</hi> Our Saviour after he had
given the Rule which I named first of all, of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
our own greater faults before we presume
to blame others for lesser ones, adds another
that will require great attention,<note place="margin">Matt. 7. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Give not that
which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
pearls before swine, lest they trample them under
their feet, and turn again and rend you.</hi> Some
Men are of so boisterous and insolent a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that we can have no reason to believe they
will be the better for Reproof, or that they are
capable of bearing it. They will probably
turn upon us with fury, and ask us, What
right we have to tell them of their Faults:
Perhaps to revenge themselves, they will treat
us opprobriously and charge us falsely with
gross faults for no other reason, but because we
have offered some charitable Reproofs to them:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101250:10"/>
These are the Persons meant by our Saviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Figure of <hi>dogs,</hi> who will <hi>turn</hi> upon us
and <hi>rend</hi> us, by all the injuries they can think
on. Others are as Swine so brutal and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
so depraved and stupid, that they despise
all that can be laid before them. When it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that our Admonitions are like either to
have no effect at all, or to have bad ones, we
may reckon that we are not under the common
Obligations of Reproving, if there are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities
of our succeeding in them.</p>
            <p>Another measure of Discretion to be used in
Reproving, is to chuse the time of doing it as
nicely as we can; but even in this, caution must
be used: Commonly speaking, Afflictions
bring Men into a temper fit for being the better
for Admonition; but some may sink so much
under their burthen, that it may be too severe
to lay more load upon them. In sickness, as
the danger may be greater, so the Obligation
is more indispensable: But in all those cases it
will be necessary to use a due mixture of Skill,
as well as Fidelity, that we may not <hi>add affliction
to the afflicted,</hi> more than is absolutely necessary
both for the good of those concerned, and for
the discharge of our own Consciences. A
prudent method in addressing Reproof, we see
in <hi>Nathan,</hi> who though he acted upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101250:11"/>
Commission from God,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> yet introduced
that severe Message he had to <hi>David</hi> by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
which engaged him before he saw into
the Prophet's design, to pronounce his own
Condemnation. A Man may furnish himself
with many Stories of what passes daily in the
World, by the telling of which he may prepare
a Person to bear with his freedom: In some
of those Stories a guilty Person may find both
his faults and the consequences of them so
plainly set forth, that if he does not feel that,
he would not feel, or at least he would not
bear a closer application.</p>
            <p>But the last and chief Rule in managing
Reproof, is to order it so, that it may not pass
barely as a finding fault with another upon some
general and popular Notions, which will have
no great operation, but that it may carry with
it so full a Conviction, that he who is Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
may see that there is great and just causes
for such Admonitions. I shall in this descend
to Instances of two sorts, which relate to some
of those things, the Correcting of which is
chiefly designed by these Societies.</p>
            <p>When we Reprove any for entring into that
lewd commerce of forbidden pleasure, at which
the corruption of Youth does commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
we ought to let them see, that if they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101250:11"/>
break through the measures of Modesty, their
Appetites will grow more and more violent
and unruly. These will be for some time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by the checks of Conscience; but when
by ill practices often repeated, those are blunted,
and young Men free themselves from stricter
Rules, this will involve them in ill designs,
these will draw them into much lying, and
many base methods to support the expence of a
vitious course of life. They will become sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in all their Affairs, and thus their care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
being once slackned, they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to hope that they can succeed in their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as they can have none to expect a Blessing
from God upon their endeavours. Nor can
they go long or far in those unlawful pleasures,
but they will be discovered, and by that they
must suffer much in their Reputation; for
though Men may take too much pleasure in
lewd Company, yet few care to deal with such
Persons, or put any confidence in them: And
this is all evident, besides the ill effects that such
a course of life may have on their Persons and
Families; for if the Banks of Modesty are
once cut through, they are seldom made up
again; such a course of life must strangely
agitate the Mind between the violence of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the fear of a discovery: This must let
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101250:12"/>
in such a black train of base and cursed
thoughts upon a Man's Mind, and must set
him at such a distance from God and all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Exercises, that the setting this in a true
light before one, with such stories as may be
easily pick'd up to confirm from daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
what is thus to be set out; all this, I say,
may through the Blessing of God, make a deep
Impression, and raise stedfast Resolutions of
keeping this Sin at the greatest distance, by not
entring into those liberties, into that conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and into those nearnesses to it, which
may be fatal, and must certainly be so, where
Nature is so strong on the side of Sin, that it
ought not to be too much trusted to.</p>
            <p>Another instance of managing Reproofs shall
be given in the Sin of Swearing. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but a very unbecoming answer, when
Men are told of their Swearing, <hi>I ask you
Pardon, I did not think on't:</hi> As if the Offence
were against a Mortal like our selves, and not
against the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and
Earth: Much as if a Subordinate Magistrate
finding fault for a high Offence committed
against the King, should be so answered. Alas!
how small is the Offence committed against us
in comparison of the dishonour done to God!
And it aggravates the Sin when a Man is so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101250:12"/>
habituated to it, that he falls into it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
or so much as knowing that he had
so transgressed. But if a Man who has unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
accustomed himself to this cursed Dialect,
will be so far calm as to hearken to what may
be offered to him, it may be fit to shew him
that the root of all Religion is a Veneration for
the Deity, and that nothing weakens this more,
than a Custom of thinking and speaking slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of God; nothing is more unbecoming the
dread that ought to possess us, and the awe of
God under which we ought to live, than this
profane practice; which is so contrary to all
decency and just respect: Besides, no Man
goes into the habit of common Swearing, but
he will be very apt to support Falsehoods with
repeated Oaths; and the more he sees he is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
he will study to fortify his credit by
whole peals of them; though such as do not
believe a Man upon his Word, are seldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by the frightfullest Oaths he can bring
forth, which do rather serve to increase than to
lay jealousy. Now if we have any right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God, we must conclude that an Oath
being an Appeal to him, a false Oath is an
Appeal to him as it were to vouch for our Lies:
And if no Honest Man could with patience
hear another appeal to him to give credit to a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101250:13"/>
Lie, What do we think of the God of Truth,
if we can imagine that false Oaths will go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished?</p>
            <p>This matter may be carried yet further, to
shew what dismal consequences arise from the
habit of common Swearing: Nothing tends
more visibly to the perverting the course of
Justice, and the dissolving our whole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which turns much upon Swearing, than
a vicious habit that takes away the fear of an
Oath. He who never Swears but upon great
and just occasions, comes to it full of dread,
and full of the Impressions that arise from a
belief of the Attributes of God: Whereas he
to whom common practice has made Oaths
become familiar, cannot have that fear of an
Oath that is necessary to strike the sense of an
Obligation from it deep into his Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> is the Nation of the whole World
that has studied the most to secure it self by
Oaths. All Employments are entred upon by
peculiar Oaths; many of these are very large
and comprehensive. How great is the extent
of the Oath of a Grand Jury? Does not all
matters of Life and Death, as well as of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
turn upon the regard that Jurors have to
their Oath? so that Blood-shed, or Property,
given unjustly by their Verdict, must lie heavy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101250:13"/>
on them; and to bind it the heavier, they take
the Oath of God upon them to give a just Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.
The Evidence given upon Oath, is that
which must direct both Judge and Jury. A Man
must have strangely subdued his Conscience that
dares prevaricate and go against it, when he is
under the quick sense of an Oath newly taken.
When Men are once corrupted to such a degree,
there is an end of all Justice and Order. How
far are we got into this? What loud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
do we hear every where of Sets of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
Witnesses, and of Partial Juries? The
Obligations to Justice and Equity ought to be
strong of themselves, nothing can force them
more than these sacred Bonds of a solemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to God. But can Men, whose common Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
is made up of Oaths and Imprecations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
an Oath so much as to be under any deep
Impressions of dread and horror from it?
Oaths of Magistrates, or Men in other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are very Comprehensive, and too soon
let go out of their Minds. It were a good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to enter such Oaths as one takes, in a Book
that comes often in view, that so it may be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
considered as a powerful motive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him to the faithful discharge of his Duty.
It were to be wished, that the Oaths of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
were more explicite; but Men of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101250:14"/>
will consider Oaths well before they come
to take them, that so they may make a true
judgment whether they think they can or will
keep them, and accordingly they will either
avoid the occasions of being entangled by them,
or if they do take them, they will be governed
exactly by them.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, when all this is laid
together, it will appear that the cursed habit of
common Swearing, has so many ill tendencies
and effects, that there being nothing on the
other hand to recommend it, but a depraved
Custom, every one will soon see, what need
there is to watch over himself, till he wears out
of that profane and impious Stile; and if he
is not watchful enough over himself, he will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be convinced, how much he is obliged to
those to help him to be more careful; when all
he suffers by it, is that at the expence of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
trouble and shame, and a small Forfeit, he is
taught to keep his Tongue with more caution.</p>
            <p>And now I have done with all that I intend to
say from my Text: It remains that I say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
with relation to the occasion of our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together at this time.</p>
            <p>We have enjoyed a long continuance of
Peace and Plenty; even a long and devouring
War has made no great Impression: We have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101250:14"/>
been safe and quiet at home, when all the
World about us was in a flame. Nor has the
great expence of the War altered the face of
Plenty every where: I am sorry to say it, our
Luxury and Vanity, the Symptoms of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
Plenty, have not lessened upon all that
Charge; I wish it were not too visible, that they
increase upon us. We may remember how near
we were to great dangers; it is not so long
since we saw a Cloud gathered and set over our
heads, that we had reason to fear was to burst
out in Storms and Tempests; and must have
thrown us into terrible Convulsions, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
utter Ruin.</p>
            <p>All this went over with so little disturbance
that we scarce felt our Danger, till we were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from it; and after a War that gave so
melancholy a prospect, in a course of many
Years, we are now at Peace with all the World
abroad: But, alas! Are we at Peace with God
or among our selves? Does not Impiety and
Atheism, that walk abroad without either fear
or shame, seem to dare and defy God even to
his Face? This is such a plain Revolt from God,
and a rising, as it were, up against him, that we
have no reason to think that he will not at last
arise and visit for all these things. How soon
can he withdraw his Defence? And then how
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101250:15"/>
easily may that which we rely on be blasted?
Storms may shatter our Fleets, and if God
should for our Sins deliver us so far to an Enemy
that they should but once Land upon us, How
naked and defenceless are we? How soon must
all be over-run? And what a scene of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Pillage, of desolation and Ruin would
quickly open upon us? But we need not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Enemy than our selves; we are going into
such strong and deeply rooted Animosities, our
hatred to one another, our jealousy of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
our quarrels and factions, do so increase,
and are growing to such a height, that if no
Temper can be found, and if there is no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
from the Goodness of God, or the
Wisdom of Men, to put a stop to the progress
of all these Evils, they must end fatally at last;
we may go on to bite and devour one another,
till in conclusion we are consumed one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
What can put a stop to all these sad things
that we may justly fear? A general Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is too great a Blessing to be soon hoped for.
In these matters Men seldome go all of the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from one extreme to another. God knows
how near we are the extreme of an universal
Depravation. It gives us some small beginnings
of hope, that in and about this great City, from
which the Nation is apt to take its ply, whither
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101250:15"/>
to good or bad; there has been for some years
past a Spirit stirring, that looks like a reviving, as
if even our <hi>dry bones could live:</hi> A Spirit of true
devotion, a seriousness in the service of God, a
frequency at Sacrament, with a Zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and against Vice, shew themselves upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eminent occasions, as if by a noble Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the more that the Men of Impiety shew
themselves, and enter into Clubs and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
to advance their wicked designs, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Zeal should take fire from thence, and be
fortified by the joint endeavours of those, who
while many say,<note place="margin">Malac. 3. 14, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>It is Vain to serve God,</hi> and <hi>what
profit is it that we have kept his ordinance?</hi> those <hi>who
fear the Lord speak often one to another. Their words</hi>
how secret soever <hi>are heard by God,</hi> and all is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>in a book of remembrance written for them that
fear the Lord, and that think of his name, for they
shall be his; and in that day when he makes up his
jewels, he will spare them as a man spareth his own
son that serveth him.</hi> Blessed be God for this <hi>door
of hope</hi> which he is thus opening to us! and
Blessed be they of the Lord who have offered
themselves so willingly before him and before all
the People! Their Name shall be of a good
Savour in the present and in the succeeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
who have begun the first to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
so noble a Design, to put a stop to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101250:16"/>
vicious practices, and to raise a true Spirit of
Piety and Virtue among us. These are <hi>the salt of
the earth, the Pillars of it, and the light of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Go on you noble Christians, shine more and
more as patterns of those Virtues which you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to recommend to others. Your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
wait for your halting, that by your Errors
they may bring up a scandal upon Religion and
Godliness. The publick Crimes of some who
pretended highly, brought within our memory
such an ill reputation upon Religion, that we
have laboured under the ill effects of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
ever since. This we hope will make you
the more watchful and diligent, lest by your
means the Name of God should be agains Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.
Go on and see to the Execution of the
Laws, but do it with a Zeal becoming the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and not with a Pharisaical or bitter Zeal.
Be not discouraged, neither by the slow progress
that you can make, nor by the contradiction
and slanders that you may meet with. Go on
and prosper, for great is your Reward in Heaven;
and while you study to repair the Breaches that
are made in the House of God, you may hope
that God will build up Houses for you and your
Posterity, and will at last receive you into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Habitations. <hi>To whom be Glory for ever.</hi>
