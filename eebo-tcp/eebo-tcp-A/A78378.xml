            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Early beloved Friends, my Spirit is and hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a deep ſence of your joy and pure rejoycing, of your ſorrow and ſufferings; And in the midſt of it, my heart hath been melted and overcome, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable love which hath flowed from my life to you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when I have beheld your glory and beauty, your comlineſs and purity, your innocency and ſimplicity; And theſe things my ſpirit hath viewed, and I have beheld them <hi>with much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> and my heart hath been ſo raviſhed with them, even in the night watch, that ſleep hath vaniſh't from me; And inſtead of being overtaken with that which nature is ſubject unto; <hi>My heart hath been filled with joy, my mouth with the high praiſe of the Lord upon my bed;</hi> And therein my ſoul hath Solaced it ſelf, being abundantly revived with the freſh ſtreames of my fathers love, which from my ſoul hath flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth like unto a mighty ſtream: And though my life hath breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth praiſes <hi>abundantly</hi> unto the Lord, yet my heart is full, and my cup doth overflow, and my ſoul is poured forth into your boſoms, where my Fathers love and life is ſhed abroad, in which I do moſt dearly ſalute you.</p>
            <p>Oh friends! your work is <hi>weighty,</hi> your adverſaries <hi>many,</hi> and your temptations <hi>not a few,</hi> and theſe things my ſoul have weighed, and ſeriouſly pondered upon; And I have obſerved how the Nations in the moſt parts where your reſidence is, are angry with you, and bends their brows againſt you, and great have your ſufferings been (in which the Lord hath not left you <hi>comfortleſs.</hi>) And ſo is it with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren beyond the Seas, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hoſe faith and patience the Lord tryeth, by their being exerciſed in manifold Tribulations, but it appeares by their writings that the Lord is exceeding good unto them, and that their conſolation by his Spirit <hi>abounds</hi> even in the midſt of them, which tend to the furtherance of the Goſpel; And truly I am glad when I conſider how patiently you have ſuffered <hi>violence</hi> to be done unto you, without doing <hi>violence</hi> to your adverſaries, which thing is become of good report among all that feareth the Lord, who have heard of your long ſuffering and forbearance, which we have learned of our Lord and Maſter, <hi>who pleads our cauſe</hi> and clears our innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and teſt f<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>th to the faces of your adverſaries by his witneſs that they have <hi>meaſured that meaſure</hi> to you which they would not have met unto themſelves, but when the cup of <hi>trembling</hi> comes to be put into their hands, then ſhall they with ſorrow and grief of heart remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they have done unto you, who have patiently ſuſtained grievous ſufferings from them, but without controverſie many of them who have affl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted you, muſt drink of that cup of ſuffering which they have put into your hands, and then ſhall the <hi>oppreſſions</hi> wherewith they have <hi>oppreſſed</hi> you, become their exceeding <hi>heavie</hi> burthen; But however friends, if the Lord ſhould yet ſuffer your ſufferings to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed and continued for a ſeaſon, <hi>faint not you in your mindes,</hi> but be ſtrong in the power of the Lords might, and be ye tender affectionated one towards another, for an <hi>unſpeakable neceſſity</hi> I ſee in the Light of the Lord of your being tender one over another, that you may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and a refreſhing one to another in the Lord, in your ſeveral <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Meetings</hi> and <hi>Families,</hi> where you are diſperſed and ſcattered abroad in the Nation and Nations, <hi>as lights in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Friends, beware of giving place to that which would gender ſtrife among your ſelves, and bring you into varience one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that ſpirit is not of God but of the World, and that will not eaſily paſſe by <hi>offences,</hi> but will both give them and take them, neither will that bind up breaches, but make them worſe, neither will that edifie the body, but will bring ſuffering upon it, and the ſuffering which that ſpirit brings upon it, is more intollerable for the body then the ſufferings that its open adverſaries brings upon it, for it will rejoyce in the failings of the weak, and it will be lifted up when the Righteous are caſt down, and will look more at the failings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then at its own; Now my adviſe to you is, to beware of it and watch vigilently againſt it, as againſt one of your <hi>greateſt and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies</hi> of your ſouls and eternal peace.</p>
            <p>And Friends, you that are diſperſed abroad in ſundry parts of the <hi>Counties,</hi> and it may be, are not above two or three <hi>Families in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;</hi> and paradventure ſome of the family are friends, and ſome are not; Therefore you had need to be vigilent and circumſpect; and alſo beware of letting in the ſpirits of them that are of another ſpirit then that which you are of, leſt thereby you looſe your <hi>Authority and Dominion</hi> over them, and ſo bring trouble upon your ſelves, which may eaſily befal you, if you be too <hi>intimate and familiar</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Again, you had need to watch over one another <hi>in tender love</hi> for good, that if you ſee evil appearing in one another, you may betimes minde one another of it, though I know it will be a greater croſs to you to ſpeak to the <hi>party</hi> that is <hi>guilty,</hi> then it would be for you to ſpeak to another of the thing, and when they come to hear of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting others, with that which concerned them, and you not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of the thing before, hence may <hi>prejudice</hi> ariſe.</p>
            <p>Which when this is gotten up, they in whom it is ſeated will ſtrive to beget it in others againſt ſuch as they have prejudice againſt, and this will tend rather to the making of <hi>parties</hi> then unto peace; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be <hi>adviſed (Oh! friends)</hi> to take heed of that, and I beſeech you in the bowels of love, be perſwaded to live in love, peace and unity one with another, and be ye good <hi>paterns and examples</hi> one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in all things, leaſt that you ſhould bring <hi>burthens</hi> upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which <hi>(the Lord knoweth)</hi> you had not need to do, for I know all of you in your ſeveral places wherein you are ſet, who are truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoak have much to bear already, ſo that there is more neceſſity for your bearing <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne anothers burthen then there is for your adding unto one anothers burthen. Therefore keep t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the life in your ſelves, that in the love which beareth all things you may be comprehended more and more.</p>
            <p>And all you who are <hi>Rulers of Families,</hi> who have the overſight both of children and ſervants, be ye Paterns of love, of meekneſſe and wiſdom, of diligence and long-ſuffering, that ſo your Families may be brought into theſe things, to the praiſe of God, and to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; And beware of tollerating any <hi>evil vice</hi> in your families, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too much liberty to that which would be <hi>Idle, Wanton,</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant;</hi> Oh! let not that be nouriſhed neither in children nor ſervant, but ſtand you in power of God, that his living witneſs may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all your words and actions, and juſtifie you in them all then will you be at errour to that in your families which would <hi>work wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe,</hi> and a <hi>praiſe</hi> to that which breaths after the Lord.</p>
            <p>And you that have <hi>unbelieving Wives or unbelieving Husbands, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Children,</hi> and ſuch ſervants in your families as are out of the Truth, walk wiſely towards them in all things; And ſtrive not with them in your <hi>wills</hi> in that nature which they are in, leaſt you hurt your ſelves thereby and harden them; And know this, that ſuch will ſooner be won to the truth by your <hi>Loving</hi> and <hi>Courteous behaviour</hi> towards them, then they will by your ſtriving with them in the heat of your ſpirits; and when you feel indignation ariſe in your hearts againſt their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Rudeneſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wantonneſſe,</hi> and ſo upon the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that may fall a threſhing and judging that in them which the indignation in you riſeth againſt; then take heed of a <hi>mixture,</hi> I mean of that which is <hi>haſty,</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> in your ſelves, <hi>mixing</hi> it ſelf with the <hi>godly zeal</hi> in you, and that may kindle a <hi>ſtrange fire</hi> in them, which will not conſume that which the Lords indignation <hi>burns againſt,</hi> but will rather <hi>ſet their whole courſe of nature on fire,</hi> and then you may ſhew more wiſdom in your forbearing to ſtrive with them, till that be ſomewhat over, then you would by your continuing beating and threſhing that which is not capable of your judgment; for this I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>(to wit)</hi> that the truth of God hath much more place in a man, if it be ſpoken to him when he is <hi>calm, temperate</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> then it hath if it be declared to him when he is <hi>roufe, boiſterous</hi> and <hi>paſſionate,</hi> which naturally many men are ſubject to upon provocation, as we our ſelves heretofore have been, when we were where they are; therefore let us the rather bear with them, conſidering how our Lord and Saviour hath born with us, who have <hi>obtained mercy</hi> from him, Glory, Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Renown be to his Name for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>And Oh ye <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants!</hi> be ſubject and obedient unto your <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Superiours</hi> in the Lord, and be not <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>perverſe, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> nor <hi>obſtinate,</hi> but <hi>dutiful and ſubmiſſive, tractable and condeſcending</hi> to every of their equal and juſt <hi>requirings,</hi> that there may be no varience, ſtrife, emulation nor contention in your families, but that love and peace may abound among you all; And ſee that you flee and avoid all <hi>youthful luſts,</hi> and that you put away <hi>childiſhneſs,</hi> and become <hi>grave, ſober,</hi> and <hi>diſcreet,</hi> daily provoking one another to love and to good works, and not to lightneſs nor wantonneſs, nor to folly and vanity which doth not become Saints; And withall be ye perſwaded and adviſed to dwell together in unity, love and peace, and be ye helpful one to another in what you may; And thereby <hi>ingage</hi> you one another in love to ſerve one another, and thereby you will come to be indeared one unto another, and ſo will come to be refreſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſweet ſincere milk of the Word of life from the breaſts of conſolation.</p>
            <p>Moreover Friends, as touching your meetings, let them be kept duely and orderly <hi>(while you may)</hi> in the Wiſdom and Counſel of the Lord, and obſerve the time that is appointed for friends to meet, that it may no longer be obſerved by friends, that it is oftentimes <hi>an hour or two,</hi> after the time appointed before friends be wholly gathered, this ought not to be, for ſeveral inconveniences <hi>attends</hi> this neglect, wherefore from henceforth <hi>(Oh friends!)</hi> be perſwaded and adviſed to amend it.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were upon me to lay before you, <hi>Oh! my dearly beloved,</hi> to whom my heart is open, and often doth my life extend it ſelf from Sea to Sea to meet you, and dearly to falute you in the bowels of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire love, which <hi>full often yearns</hi> towards you; Oh! you <hi>faireſt</hi> and <hi>deareſt</hi> of all the Families of the Earth, God Almighty multiply his peace among you, and with his living preſence <hi>perpetually</hi> accompany you, ſo ſhall all Nations call you bleſſed; <hi>Farewel</hi> in the Lord from henceforth and for evermore.</p>
