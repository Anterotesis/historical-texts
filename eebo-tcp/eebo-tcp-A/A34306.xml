            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
Her Royal Highness,
THE
PRINCESS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT high Station, which, by
Your Birth You hold above the
People, exacts from every one,
as a Duty, whatever Honours
they are capable of paying to Your Royal
Highness: But that more exalted Place, to
which, Your Vertues have rais'd You, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb facs="tcp:52713:4"/>
the rest of Princes, makes the Tribute
of our Admiration and Praise, rather a choice
more immediately preventing that Duty.</p>
            <p>The Publick Gratitude, is ever founded on
a Publick Benefit; and what is universally
bless'd, is always an universal Blessing. Thus
from Your self, we derive the Offerings which
we bring; and that Incense which arises to
Your Name, only returns to its Original,
and but naturally requires the Parent of its
Being.</p>
            <p>From hence it is that this Poem constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on a Moral, whose End is to recommend
and to encourage Vertue, of consequence has
recourse to Your Royal Highness's Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
aspiring to cast it self beneath Your
Feet, and declining Approbation, till You
shall condescend to own it, and vouchsafe to
shine upon it as on a Creature of Your
Influence.</p>
            <p>'Tis from the Example of Princes, that
Vertue becomes a Fashion in the People,
For even they who are averse to Instruction,
will yet be fond of Imitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52713:4"/>
But there are Multitudes, who never can
have Means, nor Opportunities of so near
an Access, as to partake of the Benefit of
such Examples. And to these, Tragedy,
which distinguishes it self from the Vulgar
Poetry, by the Dignity of its Characters,
may be of Use and Information. For they
who are at that distance from Original Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as to be depriv'd of the Happiness of
Contemplating the Perfections and real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of Your Royal Highness's Person,
in Your Court; may yet behold some small
Sketches and Imagings of the Vertues of Your
Mind, abstracted, and represented in the
Theatre.</p>
            <p>Thus Poets are instructed, and instruct;
not alone by Precepts which persuade, but
also by Examples which illustrate. Thus is
Delight interwoven with Instruction; when
not only Vertue is prescrib'd, but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.</p>
            <p>But if we are delighted with the Livelyness
of a feign'd Representation of Great and
Good Persons and their Actions; how must
<pb facs="tcp:52713:5"/>
we be charm'd with beholding the Persons
themselves? If one or two excelling Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
barely touch'd in the single Action, and
small Compass of a Play, can warm an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
with a Concern and Regard even
for the seeming Success and Prosperity of the
Actor: With what Zeal must the Hearts of
all be fill'd, for the continued and encreasing
Happiness of those, who are the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Instances of Elevated and Persisting Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue?
Even the Vicious themselves must have
a secret Veneration for those peculiar Graces
and Endowments, which are daily so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
conspicuous in Your Royal Highness;
and though repining, feel a Pleasure which
in spite of Envy they per-force approve.</p>
            <p>If in this Piece, humbly offer'd to Your
Royal Highness, there shall appear the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of any one of those many Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
which You so promiscuously possess,
to be drawn so as to merit Your least Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
it has the End and Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its Design. And however imperfect
<pb facs="tcp:52713:5"/>
it may be in the Whole, through the Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
or Incapacity of the Author, yet,
if there is so much as to convince. Your
Royal Highness, that a Play may be with
Industry so dispos'd (in spight of the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Practice of the Modern Theatre) as to
become sometimes an innocent, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Entertainment; it will abundantly
gratifie the Ambition and Recompence the
Endeavours of,</p>

            <stage>Spoken by Mr. <hi>Betterton.</hi>
            </stage>
            <l>THE Time has been when Plays were not so plenty,</l>
            <l>And a less Number New, would well content ye.</l>
            <l>New Plays did then like Almanacks appear;</l>
            <l>And One was thought sufficient for a Year:</l>
            <l>Tho' they are more like Almanacks of late;</l>
            <l>For in One Year, I think they're out of Date.</l>
            <l>Nor were they without Reason join'd together;</l>
            <l>For just as One prognosticates the Weather,</l>
            <l>How plentiful the Crop, or scarce the Grain,</l>
            <l>What Peals of Thunder, and what Show'rs of Rain;</l>
            <l>So t'other can foretel by certain Rules</l>
            <l>What Crops of Coxcombs, or what Flouds of Fools.</l>
            <l>In such like Prophecies were Poets skill'd,</l>
            <l>Which now they find in their own Tribe fulfill'd:</l>
            <l>The Dearth of Wit they did so long presage,</l>
            <l>Is fall'n on us, and almost starves, the Stage.</l>
            <l>Were you not griev'd, as often as you saw</l>
            <l>Poor Actors thresh such empty Sheafs of Straw?</l>
            <l>Toiling and lab'ring at their Lungs Expence,</l>
            <l>To start a Iest, or force a little Sence.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:52713:6"/>
Hard Fate for us! still harder in th' Event;</l>
            <l>Our Authors Sin, but we alone repent.</l>
            <l>Still they proceed, and, at our Charge, write worse;</l>
            <l>'Twere some Amends if they could reimburse:</l>
            <l>But there's the Devil, tho' their Cause is lost,</l>
            <l>There's no recov'ring Damages or Cost.</l>
            <l>Good Wits, forgive this Liberty we take,</l>
            <l>Since Custome gives the Losers leave to speak.</l>
            <l>But if provok'd, your dreadful Wrath remains,</l>
            <l>Take your Revenge upon the coming Scenes:</l>
            <l>For that damn'd Poet's spar'd who dams a Brother,</l>
            <l>As one Thief scapes, that executes another.</l>
            <l>Thus far, alone does to the Wits relate;</l>
            <l>But from the rest, we hope a better Fate.</l>
            <l>To please and move, has been our Poets Theme,</l>
            <l>Art may direct, but Nature is his aim;</l>
            <l>And Nature miss'd, in vain he boasts his Art,</l>
            <l>For only Nature can affect the Heart.</l>
            <l>Then freely judge the Scenes that shall ensue,</l>
            <l>But as with Freedom, judge with Candour too.</l>
            <l>He wou'd not loose thro' Prejudice his Cause;</l>
            <l>Nor wou'd obtain percariously Applause.</l>
            <l>Impartial Censure, he requests from all,</l>
            <l>Prepar'd, by just Decrees to stand, or fall.</l>

               <l>I'th' Evening <hi>Osmyn</hi> was to die; at Mid-night</l>

               <l>O my Heart's Comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis not given to this</l>
               <l>Frail Life, to be entirely bless'd. Even now.</l>
               <l>In this extreamest Joy, my Soul can taste,</l>
               <l>Yet am I dash'd to think that thou must weep</l>
               <l>Thy Father fell, where he design'd my Death.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Gonsalez</hi> and <hi>Alonzo,</hi> both of Wounds</l>
               <l>Expiring, have with their last Breath, confess'd</l>
               <l>The just Decrees of Heav'n, in turning on</l>
               <l>Themselves, their own most bloody Purposes.</l>
               <l>Nay, I must grant, 'tis fit you shou'd be thus—</l>

               <l>Ill-fated <hi>Zara!</hi> Ha! a Cup? alas!</l>
               <l>Thy Errour then is plain: but I were Flint</l>
               <l>Not to o'er-flow in Tribute to thy Memory.</l>
               <l>She shall be Royally interr'd. O <hi>Garcia,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whose Virtue has renounc'd thy Father's Crimes,</l>
               <l>Seest thou, how just the Hand of Heav'n has been?</l>
               <l>Let us that thro' our Innocence survive,</l>
               <l>Still in the Paths of Honour persevere;</l>
               <l>And not from past or present Ills Despair:</l>

            <l>THE Tragedy thus done, I am, you know,</l>
            <l>No more a Princess, but in <hi>statu quo:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And now as unconcern'd this Mourning wear,</l>
            <l>As if indeed a Widow, or an Heir.</l>
            <l>I've leisure, now, to mark your sev'ral Faces,</l>
            <l>And know each Critick by his sowre Grimaces.</l>
            <l>To poison Plays, I see some where they sit,</l>
            <l>Scatter'd, like Rats-bane, up an down the Pit;</l>
            <l>While others watch like Parish-Searchers, hir'd</l>
            <l>To tell of what Disease the Play expir'd.</l>
            <l>O with what Ioy they run, to spread the News</l>
            <l>Of a damn'd Poet, and departed Muse!</l>
            <l>But if he 'scape, with what Regret they're seiz'd!</l>
            <l>And how they're disappointed if they're pleas'd!</l>
            <l>Criticks to Plays for the same end resort,</l>
            <l>That Surgeons wait on Tryals in a Court;</l>
            <l>For Innocence condemn'd they've no Respect,</l>
            <l>Provided they've a Body to dissect.</l>
            <l>As <hi>Sussex Men,</hi> that dwell upon the Shoar,</l>
            <l>Look out when Storms arise, and Billows roar,</l>
            <l>

Devoutly praying, with up-lifted Hands,</l>
