            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

No priſoner but is willing to leave the priſon-houſe, for the enjoyment of his owne houſe; No excile but is willing to leave the land of baniſhment for the repoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his owne Country: No ſoule that knowes its owne bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der corruption, its owne alienation, and exilement from Chriſt, (in part at leaſt,) during the dayes of its abode in this earthly tabernacle. but with Paul, hath <hi>a deſire to depart and be with Chriſt which is farre better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our deceaſed Brother making uſe a little before his death of theſe words to his wife, almoſt to the ſame purpoſe Saint Paul made uſe of them to his Philippians. <hi>Haveing a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt which is farre better; Nevertheleſſe to abide in the fleſh is more needfull for you.</hi> Is that which invited and moved me, to treat of theſe words, in this houre of his funerall, and from them to deduce ſome inſtructions for the proffet and conſolation of the living.</p>
            <p>The words propound unto us, and preſent before us, the choyſe of a gracious ſoule the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> wherein it deſires to <hi>dwell,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> which it deſires to <hi>behold,</hi> the <hi>Pearle</hi> which it deſires to <hi>poſſeſſe,</hi> the <hi>Haven</hi> wherein it deſires to <hi>harbour,</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> whereon it longs to <hi>feed,</hi> and the <hi>Fountains</hi> whereof it doth deſire to draw and drinke a full and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting <hi>draught,</hi> even Ieſus Chriſt, and nothing elſe, <hi>Haveing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to depart and to be with Chriſt which is farre better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words there is. 1. <hi>Motus,</hi> a motion, the internall moving, ſtirring, longing, and working of the ſoule, excited, aſſiſted, inabled, acted, moved, framed, and diſpoſed, bent, and inclined, thereunto by the gracious preſidentiall, active, and mighty power of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Like the motion and ſtirring of the heart of a priſoner, longing after, and looking out at the priſon windowes for ſome tidings of liberty and freedom-: like the motion of a man in darknes, waiting for the appearance of the light; like the motion of a wife, in the time of 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158538:3"/>her husbands abſence, looking for, and expecting her husbands returne: a motion raiſed, excited, quickned, and ſtrengthned, by a collation and compariſon of the ſoules future felicity, with its preſent miſery. as the huſbandman compares, the joy of his future <hi>harveſt,</hi> with the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> of his preſent winter. The ſouldier the glory of his future <hi>Crowne</hi> with the difficulty of his preſent <hi>battle;</hi> The traviller the comfort of his future <hi>Paradice;</hi> with the ſadnes of his preſent <hi>Wildernes:</hi> lively ſence of preſent miſery, ſweet and powerfull apprehenſion of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and enſueing glory, fill the ſoule truly gracious with longings of unwearied, and ſacred vehemency. Aſſurance of future happines makes a good man reſtles under the preſant burthen of his corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Here is <hi>Movens.</hi> The party longing deſiring to depart; and that is Paul a choſen veſſell, afaithfull ſervant of God a liveing member of Chriſt. <hi>None can truly deſire to be diſſolved but he that is ſure to be ſaved.</hi> No man willingly leaveth his preſent habitation, but he that is aſſured of a better dwelling. No wiſe man willingly to caſt of his preſent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but he that hath another, a better to put on: No man can be upon right grounds willing to be diſſolved, but only that man who is truely fanctified: he who is not throughly intereſted in Chriſt, cannot wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly leave all for Chriſt: Eleazar Abrahams ſervant, <hi>put a jewell upon Rebeccaas face,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 24.53.</note> 
               <hi>and bracelets upon her hands, and gave her jewels of ſilver and jewels of gould and rayment,</hi> and then ſhee was willing to goe with him, willing to leave all, and enjoy Jſaac for her husband. That ſoule alone which Chriſt beautifieth with the ſaveing gifts of his ſpirit, the love tokens of Chriſt, better gifts then jewels of ſilver, and gold. Js the ſoul, the only ſoule, that can forſake the deareſt things of this life, that can readily leave its habitation in this mortall fleſh, and take up its everlaſting abode with Chriſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, here is the <hi>end</hi> or finall cauſe, why the gracious ſoule doth leave all, and deſires to goe hence: it is for <hi>Chriſts ſake,</hi> that it may have the full fruition of Chriſt, that it may mount aloft and come to Chriſt: as the bird when the cage is broken or the priſoner when the priſon houſe is beaten downe, and throwne into the duſt have liberty, the one to fly, and the other to walke abroad and meete their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

To perſwade you to <hi>conſecrate your ſelves and all your abilities unto God</hi> to be active and lively indeed for God, to bee faithfull in keeping Covenant with God, to bee full and fruithfull in every good way and worke of God; to worke and keep your ſoul in ſuch an underſtanding, holy, humble, penitent, beleeving, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, ſincere, circumſpect, and univerſally gracious frame and temper, condition and poſture, that you be able at all times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in all eſtates and conditions every one for himſelf to ſay with the Apoſtle. <hi>I have a deſire to be diſſolved and be with Chriſt which is ſerve better.</hi>
