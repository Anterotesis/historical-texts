            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon an ardent dispute, with a Doctor of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, <note place="margin">9.</note> reverend for his Piety and Learning, concerning the <hi>Legitimate</hi> use of the Sympathetick Powder; that I might at one stab destroy his inveterate <hi>Presumption,</hi> that the Capital Energy of that Magnetical Remedy, adored for the sanation of wounds at distance, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed rather from the Sophistical Activity of that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor, who gave the first incurable wound unto huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, derived by the mediation of an <hi>implicit Compact,</hi> then from any native and genuine endowment of the <hi>Vitriol:</hi> I prevailed with him, to enterprize an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the efficacy thereof after this manner. Having furnished him, both with the Powder, and a cloth distained with the blood of a Gentleman, freshly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not yet dressed by any Chirurgeon: I also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him in the Application. At the performance whereof, he made solemn profession, that he did utterly


<pb facs="tcp:47802:11"/>
disavow all <hi>Confederacy,</hi> immediate or secondary, with Satan, all expectance of his concurrence, and coeffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and all confidence in the cooperation of intense <hi>Imagination:</hi> as also, that he adventured on this tryal, onely for information of his judgment, whether it lie in the destiny of Natural Agents, to transmit their Virtue unto, and execute the Commission of their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical Proprieties upon objects at distance. However, within few hours, the Patient (wholly ignorant of the means used) found his blood retired to its wonted rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and the lips of his large wound perfectly Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated. Upon which admirable success, the Divine, having also haply met with a cure for the nicety of his Conscience, from a prevaricate <hi>Adversary,</hi> became a fervent <hi>Proselyte,</hi> to our Doctrine of <hi>Magnetism:</hi> soon after writing his <hi>Palinodia,</hi> in these words; <hi>Indubitanter credo, Causas Naturales, quanquam nobisignotas, operari in praefata sympathetica sanatione.</hi>

Sir <hi>K.

<pb facs="tcp:47802:12"/>
Danger. That in this forlorn plight, despairing to finde ease or benefit, by the fruitless continuance of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and fearing the speedy invasion of a Grangraen; he consulted Sir <hi>K.

D.</hi> That thenceforward, for three days, all former symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes departed, the part recovered its pristine lively Colour, and manifest <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Consolidation</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued: but then Sir <hi>K. D.</hi> to compleat his Experiment, dipt the Garter in a sawcer of Vineger, and placed it upon glowing coals; soon whereupon the Patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed into an extream Agony, and all former evils instantly recurred. And finally, that having obtained this plenary satisfaction, of the <hi>sympathy</hi> maintained betwixt the blood extravenated, and that yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the veins; as also of the Soveraign <hi>Balsamick Faculty</hi> of the <hi>Vitriol:</hi> he took again the Garter out from the Vineger, gently dryed it, and freshly dressed it with the Powder; whereupon the <hi>Sanation</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such admirable success, that within few days, there remained onely a handsom <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> to witness there was once a wound.</p>

            <p>Another Block there is, at which not onely the herd <note place="margin">25.</note> of Fools, but even the greatest Clerks use to stumble, in their quest of this Secret. Requisite it is (say they) that every Natural Agent be immediately applied to its determinate Patient; otherwise, its specifical Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, though neer so potent and expedite, must be lost in a fruitless expence, and unsatisfaction of its particular end; but the <hi>Sympathetical Remedy</hi> is not topically ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximated to the <hi>Wound;</hi> therefore must it be, either no Natural Remedy, or a vain and inefficacious one, at best. But this Argument, though at first appearance plausible, weigheth not one grain in the ballance of more exact Reason, against our theory, and may be easily blown out of the way, by this distinctive Answer.

                  </gap>. The sympathy betwixt objects removed at distance each from other, is done by the mediation of an Universall Spirit, which governing the Sun, and other coelestiall orbs, is endued with exquisite sense. 152. The imagination, in Creatures enriched with an Elective Faculty, is various, arbitrary, and unconfined: but in others, of the same determinate identity alwayes. 153. The first degree of power magicall, dwelleth in the formes of the three grand Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury. 154. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is by the Phansies of the Forms of the Mixtum, or integrall Composition: which being destroyed, the Principles yet remaine. 155. The third ariseth from the Phansy of the Soule. 156. What beasts are endowed with magicall power, and can act beyond the circumference of themselves, <hi>per nutum</hi> onely. 157. The fourth degree of power magicall, is from the excited intellect of man. 158. The word Magick, is analogous, and appliable to many things, in a third relation. 159. Every magicall power, stands in need of, and is improved by Excitation. 160. What may be said a subject capable of Magnetism. 161. How Magnetism differs from other Formall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties. 162. The superfluous humours &amp; Excrements of the body, have also their Phansy. 163. Why Holy Writ doth give the attribute of life, rather to the blood then to any other humor in the body. 164. The seed inhaeriteth the Phansy of the Father, by traduction: Whence Nobility hath its originall. 165. The skins of the Wolfe and sheep retain a Phantastique enmity, of their former life. 166. What the Phansy of the blood, freshly added to the Unguent, can doe. The manner of the Magnetisme in the Unguent. 167. The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a magneticall cure done by the Unguent, and that done by a rotten egg. 168. The grand mystery of humane Imagination, the foundation of Naturall Magick. 169. The Intellect impresseth the Entity, it selfe created, upon the externall object: and there it really perseveres. 170. How to make powerfull pentacles or magicall Characters. 171. The Phansy, by a naile, as by a medium, holds captive the spirit of the Witch. 172. If Satan can move a body, without any corporeall extremity: why cannot the inward man doe the same? and why not rather the spirit of the Witch? 173. The virtue of the Unguent, not from the imagination of its Compounder: but from diverse simples married into one Composition. 174. The Author makes profession of his Faith.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the eighth year of this age, there came to my hands an Oration declamatory, made at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge</hi> of the <hi>Catti,</hi> wherein <hi>Rodulphus Gocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> (to whom the publick profession of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy was lately committed) paying his first fruits to the University, endevours to make good, that the cure of wounds, by the <hi>Sympathetick,</hi> and <hi>Armarie Unguent,</hi> first invented by <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> is meerly natural. Which Oration I wholly read, and sighed, that the history of natural things had faln under the protection of so weak a Patron. The Author, nevertheless, highly pleased him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with that argument of writing, and with a continued barrenness of probation, in the year 1613. published the same work, with some enlargement. Not long since, I also met with a succinct <hi>anatome</hi> of the fore-mentioned Book, compiled by a certain <hi>Divine,</hi> savoring more of a fine-witted <hi>Censure,</hi> then a solid <hi>Disputation.</hi> Whereupon my judgment, what ever it were, was much desired; at least, in that relation, that the thing invented by <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> neerly concerned him, and my self, his disciple. I shall therefore declare, what I conceive of the <hi>Physician Goclenius,</hi> and what of the <hi>Divine,</hi> the <hi>Censor.</hi> The <hi>Physician</hi> in the first place, proposes, and with ostentation promises to prove, the magnetical cure of wounds to be pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural; but I found the undertaker insufficient, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form so weighty a task; in regard he no where, or at best but


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47802:28"/>
very slenderly, makes good the title, or his own large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Collecting, hence and thence from divers <hi>Authors,</hi> many <hi>rhapsodies</hi> or gleanings, by which he conceives he hath, to ample satisfaction, proved, that in the inventory of created natures, there are certain <hi>formal</hi> or <hi>essential vertues,</hi> which men term <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy;</hi> and also that from the concession of these, the <hi>Magnetical Cure</hi> is meerly natural. Many things, I say, borrowed from the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, Conjurers,</hi> and <hi>Impostors,</hi> he hath amassed together into this one discourse, that thereby he might evidence and confirm that <hi>Magnetism,</hi> which notwithstanding, himself was wholly ignorant of. With design, partly, that by a delightful entertainment of those mindes that are eager in the quest of novelties, he might seduce them from a direct progression to the mark; and partly to raise them to an admiration of the <hi>Author,</hi> who seemed to have read, and ransacked not onely <hi>vulgar,</hi> but also all other more <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>antique writers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which consideration, the <hi>Physician</hi> does very absurdly confound <hi>Sympathy</hi> (which erroneously, and under various notions he very often introduces) with <hi>Magnetism;</hi> and from <hi>that</hi> concludes <hi>this</hi> to be natural: For I have observed this <hi>Vulnerary Unguent</hi> to cure, not onely <hi>men,</hi> but <hi>horses</hi> also; with which our Nature holds not so neer an affinity (unless we grant our selves to be Asses) that from thence the <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick Unguent</hi> should deserve to be accounted common to horses, as well as to us.</p>
            <p>With the same absurd indistinction, he also confounds <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> with <hi>Fascination</hi> and <hi>Ligation,</hi> and both with <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;</hi> namely, with great anxiety and travel of minde, he crouds together upon the Stage, in one Scene, without any distinction, all secret, and more <hi>abstruse effects</hi> what ever; that being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of reasons, he might thereby support his own <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi> I will by an example difference <hi>Fascination</hi> from <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi> and both from <hi>Magnetism.</hi> A <hi>Dog</hi> holds an <hi>Antipathy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> (for <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy</hi> are both daughters of the same Mother) with a <hi>Hen;</hi> for he preys upon her, and she flies from him; but when she hath newly hatched her Chickens, and excluded them from the protection of their shells, she boldly


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47802:28"/>
assaults, and puts to flight a dog; though of himself very courageous; to wit, the soul of the Hen, by fascination, chaining up the soul of the dog; the former Antipathy, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity of weapons for guard, and great ods of strength afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hinderance to the action: But in this, <hi>Magnetism</hi> is no where to be found.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what other instances the <hi>Physician</hi> inserts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Impresses, Characters, Gamaheu,</hi> or <hi>Magical Images, Ceremonies,</hi> and such like, for the most part, vain <hi>observances,</hi> are but random shots, wholly impertinent to the present scope, and rather stagger the doctrine of <hi>Magnetism,</hi> by rendring it suspected, then support or advance it. But of these positively to determine any thing, is a task not sutable to my wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goclenius</hi> furthermore wanders from truth, and indeed with no less <hi>temerity</hi> then <hi>ignorance;</hi> fondly dreaming from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> that the weapon, wherewith the wound was inflicted, if rolled up in the weapon salve, did work the cure on the wound. For in vain is the weapon, or point of the sword anointed with the <hi>Armary Unguent,</hi> prescribed by him, unless it be distained with blood, and that blood be first dried upon the sword. For to <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> the <hi>Sympathetick Unguent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> is one thing, in respect of the blood effluxed out of the wound; and that <hi>Unguent,</hi> wherewith arms, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no tincture of blood, are to be emplastrated, clearly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and for this reason, he Christens the former, the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick,</hi> and <hi>Sympathetick,</hi> the latter, the <hi>Armary Magnetick Unguent:</hi> Which therefore (and to good purpose) receives into its confection, besides the ingredients essential to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Honey,</hi> and <hi>Bulls fat.</hi>

            <p>In fine, <hi>Goclenius,</hi> to humor his own <hi>genius,</hi> hath altered the prescription of <hi>Paracelsus;</hi> affirming, that the <hi>Usnea,</hi> or moss, is to be selected onely from the skulls of such, as have been <hi>hanged.</hi> Of which his own, and grosly erroneous inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enquiring a reason, he blushes not foolishly to imagine, that in strangulation the <hi>Vital spirits</hi> violently retreat into the skull, and there constantly shroud themselves for some time, until the moss shall, under the open canopy of the Air, grow up, and periwig the <hi>Cranium. Paracelsus</hi> hath expresly taught


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47802:29"/>
the contrary, and by multiplied experience we are confirmed, that <hi>Usnea</hi> gathered from the skulls of such, who have been broken on the wheel, is in virtue no whit inferior to that of men strangled with a halter. For truly from <hi>Animals</hi> there is not drawn the <hi>Quint Essence</hi> (in regard the principal, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramont <note place="margin">3.</note> essence perisheth together with the <hi>influent spirit,</hi> and <hi>life)</hi> but onely the <hi>virtue mumial,</hi> that is, the <hi>originary, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantate,</hi> and <hi>confermentate spirit,</hi> safely remaining, and in an obscure <hi>vitality</hi> surviving, in bodies extinct by violence.</p>
            <p>What other things <hi>Goclenius</hi> hath delivered, of remedies to repair a ruinous memory, as we cannot but declare them, in no relation, congruent to the scope intended; so also we nothing doubt to prove them meer pageants and impertinent flourishes.</p>
            <p>Betwixt our <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Physician,</hi> there is at all no dispute <hi>de facto,</hi> about the verity of the <hi>fact;</hi> for both unanimously concede the cure to be wrought upon the wounded person: The contention lies onely in this, that the <hi>Physician</hi> asserts this Magnetical Cure to be purely <hi>Natural,</hi> but the <hi>Divine</hi> will needs have it <hi>Satanical,</hi> and that from a compact of the first <hi>inventor.</hi> Of which censure, in his <hi>Anatome</hi> of our <hi>Physicians</hi> discourse, he alledges no positive reason; conceiving it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently satisfactory, if he, on the score of his own solitary judgment, abolish it, though he subjoyn no grounds for the abolition; that is, acquiescing onely in this, that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the feeble and invalid arguments of the <hi>Assertor;</hi> which, in sober truth, is a matter of no diligence, no learning, and of no authority to erect or establish beleif. For what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails it, to the procurement of faith, from no stronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then the futility of specious reasons, urged by some ignorant head, to give a definite judgment on the thing it self? and to declare it impious, if himself hath not so much as in a dream thought upon any one petty reason, for the support of his sentence? What if I, being a Laick, should with course and untrimmed arguments, commend Presbytery, and another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject my reasons as unworthy and insufficient, will the order of Priesthood it self be therefore rejected? Of what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I pray, is the ignorance, or temerity of any one to

            <p>Wherefore I, who have undertaken, in opposition to our <hi>Divine,</hi> to make good, that the Magnetick Cure of wounds, is the single, and ordinary effect of Nature; in the first place, think <hi>Goclenius</hi> worthy to be excused, if without success he hath sweat in the indagation of the grand and approximate <hi>Cause</hi> of this rare effect. What wonder, when our <hi>Divine</hi> makes publick confession, that himself is utterly ignorant of that cause, and onely for that reason refers it to <hi>Satan,</hi> as to the <hi>Author</hi> and master-wheel in this abstruse motion: <hi>For such is the infirmity of our delapsed nature, that we are destitute of the knowledg of the most, and most excellent things.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to palliate this defect of our understanding, we, though not without some tacite reluctancy within, obliquely wrest many effects, whose efficients are beyond the ken of our blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed reason, to the <hi>sanctuary of ignorance,</hi> and refer them to the Catalogue of <hi>Occult Qualities.</hi> For who, among <hi>Divines,</hi> ever had a plenary and demonstrative knowledg of the true and proper cause of <hi>Risibility,</hi> or any other <hi>Formal propriety:</hi> For example, of the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>fire.</hi> Dost not thou fall upon that <hi>Fallacy, Petitio Principii,</hi> an absurd begging of the question, if thou answer, that extreme heat belongs to fire, because it is of the essence of fire? In truth, the <hi>Essences</hi> of <hi>Forms,</hi> in regard they are unknown to us, <hi>à priori,</hi> from their <hi>Causalities;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also is the original, or pedigree of <hi>Formal proprieties,</hi> wholly abstruse, jejune, and undiscovered; and where we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any <hi>Formal passion</hi> subjoyned, the minde, as if tired with vain scrutiny, soon ceaseth from the disquisition of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it self, sitting down contented with the empty notion, and bare name of <hi>Occult proprieties.</hi> Go to, I beseech thee, does the <hi>Anatomist,</hi> our <hi>Censor,</hi> happily know the reason why a <hi>Dog</hi> swings his tayl when he rejoyces, but a <hi>Lyon</hi> when he is angry; and a <hi>Cat,</hi> when pleased, advances hers in an erect posture? What therefore, when himself cannot give a reason for the motion of a tayl, will he so much wonder, that <hi>Gocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

hath given an improper and insolid reason of <hi>Magnetism?</hi> and from the refutation of that, presume that he hath more then sufficiently demonstrated that sanation of wounds to be <hi>Satanical,</hi> which is the genuine effect of <hi>Magnetism?</hi> Far from us be so great temerity of censure.</p>
            <p>Come on then; why dost thou call that cure <hi>Dibolical?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5.</note> Insooth, thou oughtest to have annexed the reason of thy cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, unless thou expectest it should be denied by others, with the same facility, wherewith thou affirmest it to be diabolical. <hi>Lawyers</hi> require onely the affirmative confirmed; but <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> both parts, that the ignorance or protervity of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> party, may not appear greater then that of the <hi>Affirmant.</hi> Dost thou happily maintain the Cure to be Diabolical, because it cannot be clearly understood (by thee) that there is any natural reason for it? I will not beleeve, that from thy own infirmity, thou mayst deliver so idle and stupid a sentence of the vertue of it. For thou well knowest, that <hi>the imbecillity of our understanding, in not comprehending the more abstruse and retired causes of things, is not to be ascribed to any defect in their nature, but in our own hoodwinkt intellectual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Proceed therefore; whence hast thou assurance, that <hi>God,</hi> in his primitive intention, hath not directed this <hi>vertue Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical</hi> to the benefit of the wounded? Shew us your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; hath God elected you the <hi>Secretary</hi> of his Councel? Certainly, however you may waver in your belief, you shall in conclusion finde, that amongst you <hi>Divines,</hi> the Magnetick <note place="margin">6.</note> cure can be accounted Diabolical for no other reason then that the shallowness of your <hi>judgment</hi> cannot comprehend, nor your <hi>Function</hi> admit it to be <hi>natural.</hi> What wonder, that no <hi>Divine</hi> hath ever scented these <hi>subtilities?</hi> for after the <hi>Priest</hi>

               <note place="margin">8.</note> of her nicer operations, but adopted <hi>Physicians</hi> onely to be her darlings, and none but such, who instructed by <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotechny,</hi> examine the <hi>proprieties</hi> of things, by sequestring the impediments or clogs of <hi>vertues ambuscadoed</hi> in their grosser

materials, such are their <hi>crudity, venenosities,</hi> and <hi>impurities;</hi> that is those <hi>bryars</hi> and <hi>thorns</hi> every where, from the first <hi>Malediction,</hi> inoculated into the creatures in their spring or virgin estate. For since Dame <hi>Nature</hi> (the <hi>Proto-Chymist)</hi> her self doth every day sublime, calcine, ferment, dissolve, coagulate, fix, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly we also, the onely faithful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of <hi>Natures Oracles,</hi> do by the same helps and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages draw forth the <hi>Essential qualities</hi> of things from the dark prison of their materials, and bring them to the Meridian light of reason.</p>
            <p>But the Divine, that he may be able to discern what is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigious,</hi> from what is <hi>natural;</hi> it is requisite, that he first bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the definition from us, lest the Cobler shamefully adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beyond his Last: Let the Divine enquire onely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, but the Naturalist concerning Nature.</p>
            <p>Assuredly the goodness of the Creator was largely diffused on all the works of his hands, who created all things for the <note place="margin">9.</note> use and benefit of ingrateful man: neither admitted any of our Divines as an Assessor in his Councel, how many, and how excellent vertues he should endow his Creatures withal. In the interim, I am wholly unsatisfied how he can be excused from the sin of Pride, who because he comprehends not the natural cause, as measuring all the immense works of God by the narrow extent of his own head, does therefore audaciously deny, that God hath bestowed any such vertue on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as if man, a vile worm, had fathom'd the power of God, and were privy to the designes of his Councel. He esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the mindes of all men by his own, who thinks that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done which he cannot understand.</p>
            <p>To me, seriously, it appears a wonder in no respect that God hath, besides a body perfectly resembling the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon his Creatures a noble <hi>vertue</hi> also, which our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can explicate by no other term then that of <hi>Magnetism.</hi> Ought it not to suffice, to the indubitate concession of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netism,</hi> that onely one single example (I shall hereafter bring in others, numerous and apposite) be introduced, of the natural efficiency of that stone, according to the model or pattern whereof, even other endowments, variously distributed


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47802:31"/>
amongst the creatures, may be clearly understood? What, because the thing is new, <hi>paradoxical,</hi> and above the reach of your understanding, must it therefore be <hi>Satanical</hi> also? Far be it from us to conceive so unworthily of the <hi>Divine Majesty</hi> of the <hi>Creator;</hi> nor indeed ought we thus to court or gratifie the <hi>Devil,</hi> by transferring this honor upon him; for what can <note place="margin">10.</note> ever affect him with a more full delight, then that the glory of good works be ascribed to him, as if he had been the grand Author of them?</p>
            <p>That material nature does uncessantly by its secret Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, suck down forms from the brests of the superior Orbs, <note place="margin">11.</note> and greedily thirst after the favor and benign influence of the celestial Luminaries, you willingly concede; and moreover, that the stars in exchange attract some tribute from inferior bodies, so that there is a free commerce, and reciprocal return from each to other, and one harmonious concord, and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of all parts with the whole universe: And thus Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, in regard it is vigorous and pregnant in every thing, hath nothing new in it but the name, nor is it paradoxical, but to those who deride all things, and refer to the dominion of <hi>Satan,</hi> whatsoever falls not within the narrow circle of their own understanding. In good truth, this kinde of wisdom is never to be found by him that seeks it with derision.</p>
            <p>But I beseech you, what of <hi>Superstition</hi> hath the <hi>Armary Unguent?</hi> whether because it is compounded of the <hi>moss,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">12.</note> 
               <hi>blood, mumy,</hi> and <hi>fat</hi> of man? Alas! the <hi>Physician</hi> uses these inoffensively, and to this purpose the <hi>Apothecary</hi> is licensed to sell them. Or perchance, because the manner of using and applying the Medicine is new to you, unaccustomed to the vulgar, but admirable to both; must the effect therefore be <hi>Satanical?</hi> Sub due your passion, and calm your rage, ere long you shall be more fully satisfied.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>manner of its application,</hi> contains in it nothing of evil. First, the <hi>intention</hi> is good and pious, and directed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">13.</note> to a good and charitable end; namely, the healing of our sick, languishing neighbor, without pain, without danger, and without the consumption of his purse: And do you call this <hi>diabolical?</hi> In fine, the <hi>remedies</hi> themselves are all meer <hi>natural</hi>

Our wishes are that your self had, by so firm evidence, ratified your negative posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God,</hi> the supreme Good, did not, in the Creation, confer upon the ingredients of the <hi>Unguent,</hi> any such <hi>natural vertue,</hi> and <hi>mumial Magnetism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Magnetical</hi> remedy can, on no side, be laid open to the <note place="margin">14.</note> encroachment of suspect; since, both in the <hi>confection</hi> and <hi>use,</hi> it hath no superstitious rites performed, it requires no mysterious words, no characters, or impresses, no prestigious ceremo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>For we account that properly to be <hi>Superstition,</hi> when men <note place="margin">16.</note> relie upon the single power of an implicit faith, or imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or both concurring, above any particular vertue, which of it self is not sufficient, or by the primitive intention of the Creator, not destined to the production of that particular effect. By which it is clearly manifest, that our <hi>Magnetick cure</hi> hath none the smallest tincture of <hi>Superstition.</hi> Do thou therefore, O <hi>Divine!</hi> great with a sarcasm, with design at least to detect and deride the <hi>Devil,</hi> make an experiment of the <hi>Unguent,</hi> that so thou mayest destroy and totally abolish that <hi>implicit compact</hi> with him; nevertheless thou shalt, <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> or <hi>nolent,</hi> without either direction from, or obedience to thy will, finde the same effect result from thy application of it, that usually does upon ours; which does not at all succeed upon the conjunction of superstitious causes.</p>
            <p>Whoever reputes the <hi>Magnetical Sanation</hi> of Wounds to <note place="margin">17.</note> be Diabolical, not because it is performed by unlawful means, or directed to an unwarrantable end; but because in the manner of its operation, it progresses in a path, which his reason cannot trace: He also convicted by the same argument, shall either give the quidditative and peculiarly express causes

of all those admirable effects of the Loadstone, which in the sequel of my discourse I am to mention; or confess, that those <note place="margin">18.</note> rare operations of the Loadstone, are the impostures and the legerdemain of <hi>Satan;</hi> or shall compulsively concede with us, (which indeed will be the safer way) that in nature there is a <hi>Magnetism,</hi> that is, a certain hidden property, by this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, in reference to the conspicuous and confest prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of that stone, distinguisht from all other abstruse, and to common heads unknown, qualities.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Loadstone</hi> placed upon a thin small Trencher of wood, floating on water, does instantly in one determinate point <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stralize,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">19.</note> and in the other <hi>septentrionate.</hi> That extreme, which by its verticity regards the <hi>Southern Pole,</hi> when by touch it hath impregnated a piece of steel or iron, will immediately steer it to the <hi>North;</hi> and the other extreme which looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Northern Pole,</hi> having invigorated a needle of steel, will incline it to the <hi>South.</hi> By its <hi>Septentrional</hi> point, which is its <hi>belly,</hi> it attracts iron or steel to it; and by its <hi>Australe</hi> end, which is its <hi>back,</hi> it thrusts iron or steel from it. The <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonary</hi> side, by friction of the point of a <hi>Compass needle,</hi> posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally from the right hand to the left, endows it with a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or polary faculty, whereby it is directed to the <hi>South:</hi> But if the friction be ordered in a quite contrary position, from the left hand to the right, the direction of the point of the needle will also be contrary, and neer to the <hi>North.</hi> Thus also the <hi>Australe</hi> side of the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> according to the variety of locality, or position in friction, varies the polarity. Nay, what carrieth a neerer face of miracle, if a <hi>Loadstone</hi> by its affriction hath invigorated and excited a piece of iron, with a magnetical activity, that is, a power to attract another piece of iron; the same new made Magnetical iron, if inverted upside down, and in that Antipodean position, a second time, rub'd upon the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> will, in the same moment, be devested of its magnetical infusion, and clean forget its lately acquired power of attraction. All which various and admirable effects of the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> thou mayest, if thy judgment relish them, finde made good by multiplied observations, by <hi>William Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> not many yeers past, a Physician in <hi>London,</hi> in his Book

The iron-attracting faculty, if in a composition, married to the mumy of a woman, then the back of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone applied to her thigh, on the inside, and the belly of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other imposed upon her loyns, about the lowest spondil of the back, will safely prevent an abortion threatned; but on the contrary, the belly of one Loadstone applied to her thigh, and the back of another to her back, will both wonderfully facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate her travail, and expedite her delivery.

For there are many effects natural, which yet do not ordinarily happen; namely, such as are rarely incident.

            <p>This one experiment, of all others, cannot but be free from <note place="margin">23.</note> all suspect of imposture, and illusion of the Devil. A certain inhabitant of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> in a combat had his nose mowed off, addressed himself to <hi>Tagliacozzus</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Alii scribunt Taliacotius.</note>, a famous Chirurgeon, living at <hi>Bononia,</hi> that he might procure a new one; and when he feared the incision of his own arm, he hired a Porter to admit it, out of whose arm, having first given the reward agreed upon, at length he dig'd a new nose. About thirteen moneths after his return to his own Countrey, on a sudden the ingrafted nose grew cold, putrified, and within few days, dropt off. To those of his friends, that were curious in the exploration of the cause of this unexpected misfortune, it was discovered, that the Porter expired, neer about the same punctilio of time, wherein the nose grew frigid and cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. There are at <hi>Bruxels</hi> yet surviving, some of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that were eye-witnesses of these occurrences. Is not this Magnetism of manifest affinity with mumy, whereby the

nose, enjoying, by title and right of inoculation, a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of life, sense and vegetation, for so many moneths, on a sudden mortified on the other side of the Alpes?

But on a sober consult with thought, it seems more advised, to supersede that theme, when I shall first have mentioned this one obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; I know an Herb, commonly obvious, which if it be


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47802:34"/>
rubbed, and cherished in thy hand, until it wax warm, you may hold fast the hand of another person, until that also grow warm, and he shall continually burn with an ardent love, and fixt dilection of thy person, for many days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I held in my hand, first bathed in the steam of this love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procuring plant the foot of a Dog, for some few minutes: The Dog, wholly renouncing his old Mistress, instantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me, and courted me so hotly, that in the night he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably howled at my Chamber door, that I should open and admit him. There are some now living in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> who are witnesses to me, and can attest the truth of this fact. For the heat of a mans hand warming and resolving the plant, I say not a bare, simple and solitary heat, but excited and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate with a certain effluvium, or emanation of spirits natural, doth peculiarly determine and individuate the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the plant to himself; and by this ferment communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to a second person, doth by Magnetism allect the spirit of that person, and subdue him to love.</p>

            <p>A second Fit of the Gout surprized a Noble Matron, of my <note place="margin">33.</note> acquaintance, after the first paroxysm had gone off, and left her; and thenceforward the Gout, by an unwonted recidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and periodical recourse, infested her without remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for many moneths together. But she not apprehending whence so violent and unexpected a return of the disease had happened to her; at length she rising from her bed, as often as the fury of the fit, by intervals, somewhat remitted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her self in a Chair, wherein a brother of hers, many years past, and in another City, cruelly tortured with the Gout, was wont to sit, she instantly found that from thence the disease did awake, and afresh invade her. This effect like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is, on no pretence whatever, to be ascribed to <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>doubt;</hi> since both these were much yonger then the effect. But if it hapned that any third person subject to the Gout sate in the same Chair, to him there succeeded not any reincrudation of the disease. For which reason, the <hi>mumy</hi> of her dead brother deservedly rendred the Chair suspected of <hi>contagion;</hi> which penetrating through all her cloaths, did to the sister onely, and not to any other podagrical person, excite those frequent refluxes and paroxysms, which otherwise had slept, and not invaded her. The cause truly was the <hi>Magnetism</hi> of the brothers <hi>mumy,</hi> infected with a <hi>prodagrical miasm</hi> or tincture, effluxed from him, and impressed upon the Chair, determinately operating on the <hi>uterine mumy</hi> of the sister; and that a long tract of time after his funeral. I beseech you, what can you discover in this of any <hi>implicite Compact,</hi> with our grand adversary <hi>Satan?</hi>

            <p>A <hi>Saphire</hi> enobled with a deep coerule tincture, if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, and a small time rub'd upon a <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> whereby <note place="margin">34.</note> the <hi>Plague</hi> pathognomonically discovers it self, and after a while be removed, the absent Jewel then ceaseth not Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically to allect and extract all the pestilential virulency, and


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47802:36"/>
contagious poyson from the infected party; provided that this be done, before the Patient hath suffered too great a prosternation of spirits, and decay of strength. Physicians therefore use (which to us much advances the reputation of <hi>Magnetism)</hi> gently and slowly to draw a circle with a <hi>Saphire,</hi> round about a <hi>pestilential tumor:</hi> To this end, lest the venome exhaling, should in that part, where it insensibly evaporates, exspatiate and dilate it self to a wider range, and so in that circumferential expansion infect some noble part adjacent. For in that place where the virulency exhales, magnetically attracted from the infected body as it were through a trunck, or conduit-pipe, all the round or circle instantly grows black, and at length torrified into an <hi>Eschar</hi> falls of: the heart, in the interim, being preserved from the fatal contagion. Nor is there any postern door left open to <hi>evasion,</hi> by objecting, that we are to conceive the poyson attracted to the <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> in the same moment, when the round was drawn about the place, or at least then critically conquer'd by the internal champion of life, the heart; and not to attribute it to any <hi>Magnetism</hi> of the <hi>Saphire</hi> removed at distance. But however, the <hi>sick</hi> will give in their testimony, that they did not perceive any relief in the instant of the <hi>Saphires</hi> touch; but a good while after: The poyson indeed, gradually, by little and little, departing from the body, by the <hi>Magnetical attraction.</hi> Yea, the <hi>place</hi> it self will afford a more certain and satisfactory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence on the behalf of <hi>Magnetism;</hi> for it grows not black and torrid in the minute of, or by the affriction of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire;</hi> but many minutes after, being immediately combust by the pestiferous, that is <hi>Arsenical,</hi> vapor, in that one path, and no other, expiring from the <hi>Centrals.</hi> For where the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome does continually exhale, the venemous <hi>radii</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated and bound up into one <hi>Gone</hi> or pyramidal point, there it is of necessity that the part suffer extreme violence, grow black, and be torrified; which effects, as they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in successive motions of time, so also they inform us, that the virulency does successively breathe forth, in obedience to the <hi>Magnetical alliciency</hi> of the absent <hi>Gem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your reply perchance will be, that every Agent doth require


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47802:36"/>
a certain, and limited duration of its impression: that the <hi>Saphire</hi> did not benefit the Patient in the present, but left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it an <hi>impression,</hi> which was by degrees to subdue the remainder of the <hi>Plague;</hi> but not that the <hi>Saphire</hi> did attract any thing at all, after its remove from the <hi>Carbuncle.</hi> Here you shall observe, that every Agent of Nature does act in an instant in the first moment of congression, unless there be some obstacle or remora of disobedience in the Patient; but in the body infected there can be no impediment from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, or stop of reaction, since it longs for a relief with all expedition, and in expectation of it, uncessantly pants and labors in all veins of the body.</p>
            <p>It would be clear another thing, if the <hi>Saphire</hi> were first to suffer preparation, concoction, or alteration, that so from the concretion there might be educed the imprisoned <hi>Agent,</hi> which should afterwards diffuse and spread it self through all parts of the body. But when the <hi>Saphire</hi> conserves its native <hi>integrity,</hi> and continues <hi>undissolved</hi> and <hi>incorrupt,</hi> it requires onely a certain determinate time for this, that it may, by the touch and mediation of the <hi>mumy,</hi> associate and unite its own <hi>influential ray</hi> to the pestilential <hi>vapor,</hi> and so captive it, that afterwards being withdrawn, it may forcibly command it from the heart. To this association and marriage, I say, that there be a convenient alligation of the <hi>virtue Saphirical</hi> to, and as it were a Conglomeration with the <hi>venome,</hi> there is required a determinate measure of time (grant the eighth part of an hour) wherein the Compass line may be drawn about the pestilential <hi>Bubo.</hi> For if there were onely some bare, single impression of the <hi>Saphire,</hi> which constantly adhering to the place after the touch, should by little and little conquer and eradicate the <hi>venome,</hi> within the precincts of the body; and no <hi>Magnetical alliciency</hi> of the absent stone: There could no reason be found out, why that particular place of the circle, should be benegroed and torrified, nor why the virulent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation should not range in a larger circumference then the cicumdate line. What is more, if many <hi>Carbuncles</hi> freshly shew themselves in divers places at once; yet that onely <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">35.</note> which was circumscribed with the <hi>Saphire,</hi> undergoes


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47802:37"/>
combustion and denigration, all the other sinking down again, and vanishing insensibly. And therefore, I beseech you, what impression attractive can the <hi>Saphire</hi> leave behinde it, after its remove, if not a <hi>Magnetical</hi> one? Principally, when the <hi>Attractum</hi> doth imply an inseparable relation to the <hi>Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hent;</hi> and so transpositively.</p>
            <p>Yea, if the <hi>Saphire</hi> should from its self transmit any virtue into the sick body, after twice or thrice using, it would inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be subject to diminution and decay of power, (for so the hoof of the <hi>Elk,</hi> by often use of it, to suspend and resist the invasion of <hi>Epileptick paroxysms,</hi> by degrees becomes evirate and despoiled of all activity) that faculty, which is imprest upon the <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> being exhaust and spent; which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly in the <hi>Saphire</hi> falls not out alike; for so much the more excellent and efficacious a <hi>Saphire</hi> is esteemed, by how much the more frequently it has suckt out the venome of the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It may be you'l answer, that the <hi>Saphire</hi> does generate a new third quality in the Patient, by reason whereof it begins to attract and drain the poyson, that way onely; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Saphire</hi> be then removed, yet that nature never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, once encouraged and invited into action, ceases not to persevere in the expulsion, and maintains that Crisis, through that passage onely, where the poyson first began to be expell'd. First, we <hi>enquire,</hi> whether the <hi>Saphire</hi> does attract by a first, <hi>manifest quality</hi> (imagine heat) or by a <hi>formal magnetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety?</hi> But this Magnetical essential faculty requires not any previous generation, or result, of a new quality, within the body; but onely the conjunction of its virtue attractive, to the pestilential aer, so that it may perform its office of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. From whence the inference is; that <hi>the attraction is performed by the absent Saphire.</hi> This <hi>assumption</hi> holds clearly good, because every natural <hi>Attrahent</hi> does attract <hi>adse,</hi> to it self; for to this end onely does it attract. For which reason, a new third quality, generated in the body, would rather attract the virulent exhalation <hi>concentrically</hi> and <hi>inwards,</hi> and could by no means be invited <hi>outwards,</hi> by an <hi>excentrical</hi> attraction.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>second enquiry</hi> is; whether the <hi>Saphire</hi> may not have generated, and emitted a virtue from it self, and imprest that


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47802:37"/>
virtue on the <hi>skin</hi> onely? For neither can this stand; since then, it would not be necessary, that a circle should be drawn about the <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> with the <hi>Saphire;</hi> but it would be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that any other more remote and commodious part of the <hi>skin</hi> be toucht; which, by the suffrage of experience, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely false. Our <hi>third query</hi> is, whether the <hi>Saphire</hi> haply can unlock and expand the pores of the skin? and whether <hi>Nature,</hi> on the single stock of its power, could not have made use of its own <hi>expulsive faculty,</hi> without the attraction of the <hi>Saphire?</hi> If we say, not; then the <hi>Saphire</hi> cannot be allowed to attract, but onely to have assisted and corroborated the <hi>expulsive faculty.</hi> But this opinion is soon subverted by the effect; in that no place suffers combustion, either without or beyond the <hi>round;</hi> and also because the other <hi>Carbuncles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to bud forth, do at the same time sink away and vanish, though never toucht by the <hi>Saphire.</hi> Since indeed, if onely the <hi>expulsive faculty</hi> were corroborated, that would expel the venemous fumes every way round, and could not be restrained to any one certain and elect place.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Nature</hi> had already, before the admotion and affriction of the <hi>Saphire,</hi> giving sufficient testimony of its own valor and ability, in expelling the <hi>Carbuncle</hi> singly and of its own accord. Whence also it appears a gross falsity, that <hi>Nature</hi> once excited and rouzed up to expulsion, by the saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical infusion, does afterward persevere in, and stoutly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that critical motion; since observation assures us, that frequently the <hi>Saphire</hi> is but slowly applied, and comes too late, to assist the beginning of the expulsion. For which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, notwithstanding any thing you shall be able to oppose, it is of absolute necessity, that <hi>the pestilential venome is magnetically attracted by the absent Saphire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will you therefore, that the natural magnetism of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Unguent</hi> be more plainly and amply discovered unto you? or will you disparage and calumniate the noble allici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the <hi>Saphire;</hi> and also write to the <hi>Calumniator?</hi> you will (I suppose) judg it to have much more of reason and solid truth to comply with our faith; that as death, wounds, diseases, slaughters crept in, and made encroachments on


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47802:38"/>
humane nature, by means of the Devil, from whom nothing proceeds but mischief: So also that every good gift comes down from the <hi>Father of lights.</hi> It being a position universally assented unto by all men: That <hi>that must be</hi> good, <hi>which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the subject, nor the object, nor the means, nor the end proposed, can accuse and convict of evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence was it, that the antient <hi>Prelates</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were <note place="margin">36.</note> wont heretofore to wear rings enricht with a <hi>Saphire;</hi> the use and excellent virtue of that precious stone being, for the major part, hardly understood among them. For to whomsoever the charge of <hi>souls</hi> is committed, to them also of equity, and duty, it belongs to visit and be assistant to the infected with the <hi>plague;</hi> the dark mist of ignorance, in our days, obnubilating and eclipsing the knowledg of the most excellent pieces of <hi>Nature;</hi> in whose room have succeeded, an affected spruce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of language, a vain-glorious trimness of the windy and dead letter, and a confident, presument garrulity. Which may be the subject of our serious <hi>sorrow,</hi> but more of our <hi>wonder;</hi> that all mechanique Arts do daily receive advancement, and ascend by the degrees of new discoveries, neerer towards their perfection; but the study of <hi>Philosophy</hi> onely stands ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext and discouraged with <hi>unjust censures,</hi> and now is in its <hi>Apogaeo,</hi> or retrogradation. I have dwelt the longer upon this subject, the <hi>Saphire,</hi> in respect it contains a case, in all points alike, and wholly quadrant to that of the <hi>Armary Unguent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this particular, therefore, <hi>Man</hi> also hath his <hi>magnes,</hi> or domestick power of alliciency; whereby, in time of the plague, <note place="margin">37.</note> he draws in, through the invisible pores of the skin, the <hi>pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Atomes</hi> exhaling from the infected. For <hi>Nature,</hi> which at all other times is wont to admit nothing but wholsome and alimentary juice and with great diligence and exactness to sequester that juice, from the inalimentary and excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of it; at this time, yeelding and wholly submitting to its <hi>magnes,</hi> greedily sucks in the pestiferous aer, and invites <hi>death</hi> into the inmost closet of <hi>life.</hi> Ediametro contrary to this <hi>intestine magnes, Providence</hi> has furnisht us with another peculiar, <hi>antagonistical magnes</hi> (this we insert, that our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute may not become barren and fruitless, in any one part of

it, namely the <hi>Saphire,</hi> or a translucid piece of <hi>Amber;</hi> which rubbed to calefaction upon the <hi>seven planetary pulses,</hi> (those on the jugular Arteries, on the handwrists, neer the instep, and on the throne of the heart) and hung about the neck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a <hi>Periapt or Amulet,</hi> are too hard for the <hi>humane magnes,</hi> conquer and destroy his attraction, and by that supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of attraction, become the most certain <hi>Amulets</hi> and <hi>Counterpoysons</hi> to the fatal contagion of this plague: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if there precede not a requisite confriction of the Pulses, they are altogether invalid, and of no efficacy.

            <p>Will any man, think you, account these effects Diabolical; and attribute them to a <hi>covenant</hi> made with Satan?</p>
            <p>It is sufficient, that we have introduced a few, but select, satisfactory, and pertinent <hi>examples,</hi> whose case holds a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect analogy, and even proportion with that of the <hi>Armary Unguent;</hi> we shall now seasonably turn our selves to your <hi>Arguments.</hi>

               <hi>reliques of Saints;</hi> if nothing but that simple, impossible <hi>matter,</hi> which the disciples of <hi>Aristotle</hi> dream of, can remain, and not some <hi>accidents</hi> constantly continue in the <hi>corrupted</hi> body, which were heretofore in the <hi>living.</hi> Behold! whither a paganical error may precipitate those, who improvidently carp at others. I say, to imagine that to be absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, which is absolutely necessary, is the part of the most absurd and grossest ignorance: For example, that <hi>light,</hi> from the body of the Sun even down to the earth, in a more swift


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47802:39"/>
motion then the twinkling of an eye, through all the smallest Atomes of the air, does produce new <hi>species,</hi> and those <hi>species</hi> produce another stock and supply of <hi>species</hi> of <hi>light.</hi> This properly is to be blinde in Sunshine; for if we had not diffused upon us the identical <hi>light</hi> and vigorous <hi>influence</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but onely the thousand, of thousands of millions, <hi>species</hi> of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>virtue solary;</hi> no <hi>sublunary</hi> could have growth or vegetation, nor could ever any <hi>fire</hi> be kindled by the refraction and union of its beams.

Doth not the needle of the <hi>Mariners compass,</hi> through a firm glass, closely sealed up with melted soder (in which there can be no pore or crany discovered) steer it self to the <hi>Artick pole?</hi> and is it not attracted to a piece of iron placed within the orb of attraction, the pole during that seduction, wholly neglected? Wherefore the same numerical <hi>Accident,</hi> streaming in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>radius</hi> from the <hi>Loadstone</hi> into the <hi>aer,</hi> passes through the glass, and perhaps goes as far, as to touch the <hi>pole</hi> it self. And <hi>Magnetism</hi> likewise is a <hi>Celestial quality,</hi> of neer affinity <note place="margin">40.</note> to the <hi>sidereal influences;</hi> neither is it confin'd to any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate distance of place; as neither is the <hi>Magnetical Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent,</hi> of which our dispute.</p>
            <p>You smile, because <hi>Goclenius</hi> chooses for an ingredient into the <hi>Unguent,</hi> that <hi>moss</hi> onely, which is gathered off the scull <note place="margin">41.</note> of a man <hi>of three letters</hi>

without the smallest wound, or penetration of the skin.

            <p>You may object; if the <hi>Magnetism,</hi> or grand magnetical arcanum, lie onely in the <hi>Usnea;</hi> then all other ingredients of the composition are fruitless, vain, and unnecessary. <hi>Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> soon salve this doubt, by replying; that some of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are efficients paramont, and principal; others of inferior virtue and subordinate; some are conjoyned as impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, to obtund and refract the violence of contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense qualities; others as spurs, to excite the dormant; and others to advance and promote the weaker and less active Magnetism, to a higher and more noble <hi>entelechy.</hi> And that these reasons support the necessity of a multiplicity of simples, in the confection of the <hi>unguent.</hi> On this consideration, as it was a flat impertinency to argue, that if the <hi>usnea,</hi> chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the magnetism, then is man, to no purpose, exentera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to furnish the Unguent with some other ingredients; so also would it be a direct absurdity to plead, that if the <hi>usnea,</hi>

on the single stock of its own endowment, be not enriched with sufficient <hi>magnetism;</hi> nor the <hi>fat,</hi> nor the <hi>blood, &amp;c.</hi> therefore will not that <hi>magnetism,</hi> which we attribute to the <hi>unguent,</hi> also be found in the whole composition; since single ingredients cannot impart that virtue to a composition, which they formerly did not contain in their primitive constitutions and simple natures. I must ever now and then be compelled to act your part, and contrive arguments and cavillations for you, against my self. But however, it had been your duty, formerly to have been instructed from vulgar and rustick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, that <hi>in a compound medicine there doth frequently emerge and result a new third quality, which was never before, in</hi>

            <p>You may again object; if the <hi>Usnea</hi> hath acquired its <hi>magnetism</hi> from the mumial virtue of the bones, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal influence of celestial orbs: then, of consequence, may the same be gathered, not onely from sculls, but from all <note place="margin">51.</note> other bones of the sceleton. But this illation is also ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for <hi>Nature</hi> her self confesseth a subjection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the condition of the <hi>soyl;</hi> and for that reason, <hi>Pepper</hi> new gathered transplanted into <hi>Italian</hi> ground, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates into <hi>Ivy: Hellebore</hi> set in the <hi>Tridentine</hi>

wonder also, that one distinct <hi>magnetical seminality</hi> of <hi>usnea</hi> be, from the celestial sphears, distilled upon the <hi>scull;</hi> and a second seminality, of another peculiar <hi>classis,</hi> upon the other <hi>bones</hi> of the <hi>Sceleton.</hi> Onely the bone of the head is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent use against the <hi>Epilepsie;</hi> but so are not any of the other bones. Then, to conclude, all the brain is consumed and dissolved in the scull, by the continual irroration and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing of which precious liquor (I mean that of the brain) the scull acquires such virtues, which we have discovered to be wanting to the other bones</p>
            <p>I have sufficiently known the customes of <hi>contradicents.</hi> For when they have nothing more of moment to alleage against the <hi>thing</hi> disputed of, they become the more contumelious, break forth into reproaches, and fall foul upon the person of him, that is their adversary in opinion. Wherefore it may be, some or other will exclaim, that <hi>Magnetism</hi> is some new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, invented onely by <hi>Paracelsus;</hi> but that he was a lewd, dissolute, and ignorant fellow. And again, if there had been any such excellent virtue in nature, it could not have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in darkness, and undiscovered to so many ages, and its revealment have been suspended till the advent of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning the reproaches, and scurrilous subsannations of many, shower'd down upon the head of a man, that was the Ornament of <hi>Germany:</hi> I answer, that they are empty, vain, and below a sober thought, and do no more, then ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the assertor of them more indign and contemptible then before; as one that earnestly endevours to condemn, not onely the <hi>living,</hi> but the <hi>dead</hi> also. For there is no reason why I an unequal Orator, who have undertaken the Encomium of no man, should fall upon the praise of him for those things, which his own monuments hold forth to the world, concerning his learning, wisdom, and divinely infused endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but I come directly to ballance the <hi>invective arguments</hi> themselves. This <hi>Objection</hi> therefore is barren of any thing but <hi>pride,</hi> since it insolently dares to assume the condemnation, not onely of the living and dead, but even of <hi>God</hi> himself; namely, that he ought not to have infused the knowledg of

so divine a secret into <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> but some other person (some <hi>Jesuite</hi> perhaps;) nor to have manifested so great a consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and harmony of Nature, in the days of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> but much earlier, in the infancy of the world. But I beseech you, why came <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> so late, and in the evening of the world, to be the founder and establisher of a <hi>Society,</hi> so useful and profitable to the whole world? Why did he not spring up, and appear many ages sooner? Alas! wretched man, whither doest thou hurry thy self by presumption?

Since <hi>there is nothing, that enshrowds our mindes in a greater mist of error and seduction, then that we are conformed to Custom, out of an easie and ungenerous credulity, submitting our assent to rumor, and the dreams of the multitude.</hi> We are therefore gallantly to attempt the emancipation of our faith from the tyranny and pedantism of popular tradition, to pursue the liberty of our intellectuals, and to enjoy, not enslave the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of our judgment.</p>
            <p>You may again plead, that in <hi>Sublunaries</hi> there is no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential virtue, that can be paralleld to the impressions of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlunaries;</hi> but if you shall stumble at this stone, you will at the same instant fall upon the reprehension of all those learned men, who have taken the direct path to <hi>Philosophy;</hi> since they have rightly observed to us, that in <hi>inferior</hi> bodies there is an inference or tribute delivered down from <hi>superior,</hi> and reciprocally an analogy or resemblance of <hi>inferior</hi> in <hi>celestial</hi> bodies.

This properly is the cause of every <hi>natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> and when the single creature, by the perswasion and seduction of its own domestick heaven, becomes exorbitant from the motion of the universal heaven, as the most common rule, immediately there succeed irregularity, acrasie, confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defects.

            <p>You will further urge, that we are to come yet neerer to the main point, nor is it yet placed above doubt, that in <hi>Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> there is a quality that holds a parity to the impression of <hi>Superlunaries,</hi> and such a one truly, which can transmit it self to an object removed at large distance; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is presupposed in the Armary Unguent; and so that <hi>Magnetism</hi> is indeed a <hi>virtue celestial,</hi> but yet in no degree of emulation, to be ascribed to <hi>Sublunaries,</hi> much less to the counterfeit <hi>weapon-salvo.</hi> But what else, in the main, is this (I beseech you) then to deny Magnetism, without or besides Magnetism?

            <p>Since in earnest I have held forth examples of the Fact, in <hi>Sublunaries,</hi> and brought upon the stage very many and very apposite <hi>instances,</hi> as that of the insititious or engrafted <hi>Nose,</hi> of the <hi>Saphire,</hi> of <hi>Arsmarte, Asarum,</hi> and most other <hi>Herbs.</hi> But you deny (I sufficiently know, because you know it not) either that those effects, mentioned in the list of examples, do not at all succeed upon the coaptation and marriage of such and such causes; or else you will affirm those effects to be caused by the sole power of the Devil.

But return to your self, good Sir, for ere long you shall both understand; and firmly believe it, unless your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacity render you uncapable of instruction.

            <p>For I will now shew, that there is, without that <hi>Classis</hi> of <hi>things</hi> and <hi>herbs,</hi> which you have undeservedly suspected, a mutual influence and commerce of some certain pieces of <hi>Nature,</hi> by effluvium or emanation of spirits; and that this concordance is observed between objects at very great distance removed each from other. The <hi>Vine,</hi> when it is in the <hi>flower,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">63.</note> perturbs and causes a kinde of sickness (for so Vintners term it) in the Wine. You will excuse that this conturbation is not caused by any violence or impression of the Stars; when we solidly prove the contrary. For if the Stars did immediately occasion the germination and efflorescence of the Vine, and also the turbulency and sickly fermentation of Wines in their Vessels; it would of necessity be, that both those effects should happen every yeer, in one determinate, appointed, and definite moment; which observation concludes to be false. For sometimes the Vine emits her flowers, and the Wine is troubled before the solstice, and in the same Country, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til another yeer, long after; but the Sun and all the Chorus

of fixed Stars constantly, onely some few minutes of difference allowed, return to the same point of heaven, once every year; therefore would the Vine flower, and Wines suffer a contur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation always at one and the same set time. But if you seek an evasion, and shall rejoyn, that other Planets, beside the Sun, which possess not annually, about the solstice, one constant and equal position or situation in heaven, are the causers of this languor in Wines; onely in this relation, that the motion of the superior Orbs is most common, as to which all subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and particular heavens are to conform, all Vines would for the plurality of them flower in the same yeer, in all places at once; which is false upon the testimony of experience. For as there is a <hi>Nature Astral</hi> conferred upon, and implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the ground, so also the same particular <hi>Nature</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into the Vine; which particular <hi>Nature</hi> doth <hi>per se,</hi> by its own domestick power (no otherwise then the Earth hath, from the fructifying benediction of the <hi>Creator,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a power of <hi>germinating per se)</hi> produce the flower, fruit, and seed, and conform and dispose it self to the rhythme of the most general motion of the Celestial Orbs. Men posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirm further, that Wines are never perturbed in those Regions, in which no Vines grow; wherefore the flower of the Vine, and not the motion of the Celestial Spheres, doth perturb Wines, and that many hundreds of miles from thence; but truly, so much the more powerfully, by how much the neerer the Wines are to the Vine, that produced them.</p>

declare, that the <hi>Loadstone</hi> doth of its own accord, by the swinge of a native inherent verticity or polary directive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, steer it self to the Pole, but is by no means attracted by the Pole. For one <hi>Loadstone</hi> in a lateral variation defects to three, another to six, seven, and eleven degrees from the Pole; but none (for what I could ever discover) doth in a direct line lie parallel to the Axis of heaven, and punctually point upon the Pole. Therefore if the <hi>Loadstone</hi> were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the Pole, it must receive that convulsive influence, either from the Pole it self, or from some other Star adjacent to the Pole; but not from the Pole it self, in respect every Attrahent does attract towards it self by a direct, and not by an oblique line: wherefore if the <hi>Loadstone</hi> were attracted by the Pole, it would in a just level point upon the Pole; and so the result is, that <hi>Loadstones</hi> (at least according to what solid and multiplied observations have taught me) suffer no attractive force, or vertical invitement from the <hi>North-star,</hi> nor from any other neighboring <hi>Star.</hi> For since the whole <hi>Asterism</hi> of <hi>Charls his Wain</hi> knows no Sabbath, but is ever wheel'd about by a perpetual circumrotation; if it did at all attract, it would occasion a perpetual inquietude, and uncessant revolution of the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> by reducing it one while many degrees towards the East, and another while as many degrees towards the West, and every twenty four hours sometimes elevate it towards the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and anon depress it towards the <hi>Nadir;</hi> which experience positively contradicts: Wherefore the <hi>Loadstone ows its polarity to a natural inherent faoulty, flowing from its own seminal Entity, and not to any forain alliciency, or attractive influx transmitted from the North-star.</hi> But that otherwise the <hi>Loadstone</hi> may, by its own instinct, be elevated towards the <hi>Zenith,</hi> we have upon ocular demonstration found it true, by a certain <hi>Instrument</hi> invented by <hi>Guilielme Guilbert</hi> (the glory of which excellent <note place="margin">Diagramma hujus instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments extat in lib 4. de Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nete.</note> invention <hi>Lodovicus Fonseca</hi> hath lately endevoured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Laboring your reason to finde out a way of evasion you will thus contend for the prerogative of the Pole; that the Pole doth indeed attract the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> but according to the various and certain material disposition of several <hi>Loadstones,</hi> it doth allect them not in a right line towards it self (for such is the condition and will of the <hi>Attrahent)</hi> but to some other place situate in vicinity. The substance of which is; the Pole truly invites the <hi>Loadstone</hi> to it self in a direct line, but the <hi>Loadstone</hi> becomes refractary, and comes not in a direct line, by reason of some unknown <hi>impediment,</hi> (which you term a certain peculiar disposition of it) existent in the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> which is superior in power to, and vigorously resists that traction of the Pole; although the influential alliciency of the Star, at the distance of so many thousand miles, arrive at the body of the <hi>Loadstone</hi> entire, and without the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay or diminution of vigor. You perceive, how much truth you have granted to your <hi>subterfuge?</hi> and how, though by compulsion, you affirm that in the <hi>Loadstone</hi> there dwells a certain (you call it <hi>certain,</hi> which indeed to you is purely <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary,</hi> and to all men else wholly <hi>uncertain) motive disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> besides, and superior to the attraction of the Pole; which yet at the same time, you peremptorily deny the <hi>Loadstone</hi> to possess? which in the ballance of reason carries this weight: the <hi>Loadstone</hi> is endued with a <hi>domestick Pilot, a directive faculty,</hi> which guides it to some determinate place, but is not at all attracted by the Pole.</p>
            <p>Driven from this starting hole, you flie for refuge to some other Celestial Attrahent; seated in vicinity to the Pole; by replying, that the <hi>Loadstone</hi> is attracted, and doth not direct it self, by any internal polary virtue; attracted not by any one particular and determinate Star, or point of Heaven, but by a certain Circle or Zone, at a neer distance, environing the Pole. I answer, That this evasion is far fetched, for this imaginary Circle must be extended to the latitude of eight degrees at least; namely, from three to eleven degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I have observed some <hi>Loadstones</hi> to fufill that large variation. Wherefore if there were a power of attraction equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in all parts of this Circle, one and the same <hi>Loadstone</hi>


               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47802:48"/>
would continually vary, and in the same hour deflect, now to three, and anon to eight or eleven degrees from the Pole, or Central Star; which is a falshood manifested upon frequent experiment. Therefore, to help out this <hi>Chimera,</hi> there must be conceived many lesser Orbites or rounds one within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in a Circle of so great latitude; every one of which subalternate Zones must select and attract its particular Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. Which being conceded, you inevitably fall again into the same <hi>pitfal;</hi> namely, that the Loadstone contains within it self a certain disposition or <hi>elective power,</hi> whereby it should conform to the traction of one round, rather then of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and by consequence, when you have stretched your absurd conceptions to the highest pin of phansie, there will be nevertheless a <hi>motive virtue,</hi> or <hi>native verticity</hi> in the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
            <p>Yet we have not a clear prospect into the nature of this <hi>abstrusity.</hi> If the Pole did attract the Loadstone, the attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must depend either upon the elemental and material tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or upon the specifical form of the Loadstone; but a <hi>Glass;</hi>

            <p>A <hi>Magnet</hi> swimming freely upon a calm water, in a small boat of cork, hoiseth sail, and gives one broad side to the North, and the other to the South.

               </gap>e this Argument. A <hi>Magnet</hi> float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a skif or shallop of Cork, on a quiet pond, if the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real quarter</hi> of it be violently ravished from its own beloved position, and turned about to the South; immediately, as if wheeld about by some counter-violence, it readdresseth to its old mistress the North. For which reason, if the <hi>Magnet</hi> were by an influential line from the Pole, drawn back again to the Pole, and this return did not proceed immediately from the <hi>spontaneous direction</hi> of the stone; of necessity, by that convulsion of the Pole, the whole skif would be towed and haled to the North bank of the Pond, which never happens; for both the <hi>Magnet,</hi> and its <hi>Shallop,</hi> by the acquisite directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Septrentrional</hi> side, stand still upon the water and remain unmoved. There is therefore inherent in the <hi>Magnet</hi> an influential virtue, which being not obliged to the propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or contiguous admotion of its object, is, after the nobler manner of celestial influences, freely and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption or languor transmitted so far as to the Pole it self; since there is a spontaneous <hi>eradiation,</hi> or emission of atomical <hi>radii</hi> from the body of the <hi>Magnet</hi> to the Pole. And thus, when there hath been found and presented to the view of reason, onely one <hi>influential virtue</hi> in <hi>sublunaries</hi> (conced it <note place="margin">69.</note> in the Loadstone) diradiating, and in one continued thread of atomes arriving at an object seated at remote distance, which cannot upon any pretence be ascribed to Satan; it will also be sufficiently demonstrated, that there may be many other influential proprieties equivalent to this of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> wholly and purely <hi>natural,</hi> as in the forecited examples, and the <hi>Armary Unguent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now since the <hi>Magnet</hi> or <hi>Iron</hi> excited by the <hi>Magnet,</hi> do by instinct of their own pilot, and the spontaneous direction of themselves convert to the Pole; there must of necessity be conceded some certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Quality</hi> eradiated and extended from the body of the <hi>Magnet</hi> to the Pole; which, in regard we assuredly know it to be done without any <hi>Corporeal efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi>


               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:47802:50"/>
we denominate a <hi>spiritual quality;</hi> in this particular dissenting from our <hi>Divine,</hi> who places a <hi>Spirit</hi> in irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable difference to all <hi>corporeal nature,</hi> as an <hi>essence</hi> wholly <hi>preternatural.</hi> But <hi>Physicians</hi> oppose a <hi>Spirit</hi> against the more <hi>gross compage,</hi> or more material and less rarified substance of a <hi>hody.</hi> And in this distinctive notion we say, that <hi>the light of the Sun,</hi> the <hi>influx of celestial bodies,</hi> the <hi>narcotical ejaculation of the Torpedo,</hi> the fatal <hi>optick emission of the Basilisk, &amp;c. are qualities purely and wholly spiritual;</hi> why, because they are darted at and strike upon an object at great distance, not by the communion or association of <hi>substantial evaporation;</hi> but are, as by a medium of imperceptible light, deradiated and shot from their Subject to a fit and determinate object.</p>
            <p>These things thus conceded and made indubitate by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reason and experiment, it is sufficiently manifest, that our <hi>Divine,</hi> when yet he understood not <hi>Goclenius,</hi> hath nevertheless carped at him, and indeed many times when he deserved it not. (1) Because <hi>Goclenius</hi> placed a <hi>spiritual qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in so course a lodging, as a <hi>corporeal unguent.</hi> (2) That he affirmed the influential alliciency of a magnetick body to be derived to its appropriate object, through a <hi>medium</hi> or vehicle, as light is deradiated from the globe of the Sun. (3) That such <hi>spiritual qualities</hi> are, by the mediation of a certain <hi>sensation of the universal or mundane spirit</hi> (the grand and sole causant of all <hi>sympathy)</hi> transmitted to a remote and determinate object. This <hi>Archeus</hi> or <hi>universal Spirit</hi> our <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> interprets to be some <hi>Cacodaemon,</hi> some cursed <hi>genius,</hi> but by no law, that I understand, except that of his own licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment; since in real verity, it is a more pure and vital breath of Heaven, a Spirit which comprehends and cherishes within it self the Sun, and all the herd of lesser Stars, a minde or intelligence which diffused through all the limbs or parts of this great <hi>Animal,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> doth inform and regulate the whole; and so by a certain commerce, communion, and conspiracy of otherwise-discordant parts, and an harmonious marriage of the distinct virtues of single essences, doth order and govern the vast engine of the Universe, according to the

We are to observe therefore, that in a Wound, there succeeds not onely a bare <hi>solution of continuity,</hi> or <hi>disunion</hi> of the part; but also that there is an <hi>exotick</hi> or <hi>forain quality,</hi> whereby the lips of the Wound being enraged and provoked to a certain <hi>excandescence,</hi> by and by grow tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and apostemate, yea, the whole body from thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes afflicted with <hi>Fevers,</hi> and a grievous <hi>syndrome</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curse of dangerous <hi>symptomes:</hi> for thus an <hi>Eg,</hi> whose shell <note place="margin">71.</note>

is but slenderly crackt, soon putrefies and turns adle, when otherwise it might have been a long time conserved. Now this <hi>extraneous</hi> and <hi>peregrine quality</hi> the <hi>Armary Vnguent</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately sucks out of the Wound, whereupon the lips of the Wound, being at length oppressed and impeded by no Accident, are delivered from all pain and sickly aestuation of spirits, and suddenly hasten to accretion, incarnation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidation. <hi>Nature</hi> her self is the sole <hi>Chiron,</hi> that by the <hi>Soveraign balsam</hi> of the vital blood doth reunite the severed parts, and soder up the incontiguity: the <hi>Physician</hi> is onely her servant to be assistant to her in the remove of those <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,</hi> which otherwise might oppose and infringe the power of her action: nor does the <hi>Medicine</hi> deserve the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of <hi>Sarcotical,</hi> or by its own virtue regenerate flesh in a Wound, but then to full satisfaction of our hopes executes the commission of its faculty, when it hath removed those accidental remoraes that did retard and hinder the operation of <hi>Nature:</hi> all which <hi>impediments</hi> the <hi>Armary Vnguent,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its own single stock of power, doth securely and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take off and banish.</p>
            <p>Your rejoynder will be, that the Armary Unguent, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of reason, ought not to exhaust the forementioned <hi>quality,</hi> rather then the natural vigor of the body, and strength of the veins: and that the blood, since it continues uncorrupt in the Unguent, ought to procure health, and not any indisposition, to the wounded party: according to the example of the <hi>Carline Thistle</hi> above mentioned. I respond, that there is a plurality and variety of Magnetisms: for some attract Iron, some Straws, some Lead, others Flesh, the purulent effluxion of Wounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Magnetick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of some consists onely in this that they can onely extract the pestilential Atomes from the centrals of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, if you shall annex the sanation in our Unguent to your own Argument, your own weapon will wound you.</p>
            <p>For from thence, that the genuine effect of the Unguent is to cure perfectly, speedily without pain, without cost, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and decay of strength: Hence, I say, it results a manifest

All which events as they are ever annexed to <hi>Diabolical</hi> cures: so are they never observed to follow upon a cure wrought by our Unguent. Our appeal lies to <hi>Experience,</hi> for so many as ever received a cure by the Unguent will freely give in their testimony on our side. Now <hi>Satan</hi> is no Oracle that delivers truths, no Counsellor to good, unless with design to insinuate his delusions the smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and cannot but betray himself by this, that he never long continues in the truth, he so speciously pretended: for always, when he has been an instrument of any good, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the hostility of his nature, he in the close tempers his favor with a larger allay of evil. And introth the same method would he according to the custom of his malicious friendship, have observed in the Unguent had he been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed as an <hi>Author</hi> or <hi>Fautor,</hi> either as <hi>Principall</hi> or <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory:</hi> at least this remedy would then have failed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">73.</note> evirate, when the wounded patient is rescued from the jaws of death, and reprieved from the Gates of Hell, who otherwise, tainted with the mortal contagion of sin, would by reason of his dangerous wound have poured forth his <hi>soul</hi> together with his <hi>blood;</hi> unless perchance you seek to evade by saying, that <hi>Satan</hi> in that <hi>Crisis,</hi> that <hi>punctilio</hi> of danger, suffered a change of his <hi>cruelty</hi> into <hi>compassion,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested himself of his essential and inveterate enmity, and put on the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> nay, fell not onely to commiserate, but even dress the <hi>wounds of humanity;</hi> and that he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired some interest, some jurisdiction over the wounded patient, himself leaves doubtful and open to dispute, in that he preserves him by the Magnetical Unguent, whom he had rather should perish.

               <p>OPportunity now invites us to discover the <hi>grand and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximate cause of Magnetism in the Vnguent:</hi> First, by the consent of mystical Divines, we divide man into the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> man, assigning to each distinct part the powers of a certain <hi>minde,</hi> or <hi>informative principle;</hi> for in this disjunctive acception, there is a <hi>will</hi> competent to <hi>flesh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">74.</note> 
                  <hi>and blood,</hi> which properly is neither the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> nor the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and our <hi>heavenly Father</hi> reveals some things to the <hi>inward man,</hi> and some things are revealed by <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> that is, the <hi>outward man,</hi> in the single and abstracted relation of <hi>Animal.</hi> For how can the adoration of idols, envy, and other such branches arising from the root of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,</hi> be justly listed amongst the works of the flesh (since they consist onely in the <hi>imagination)</hi> if to the flesh also there did not peculiarly belong an <hi>Imaginative faculty,</hi> and an <hi>elective will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, that there are miraculous <hi>Ecstasies</hi> competent to the <hi>inward man,</hi> is a tenet true beyond the dispute or haesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sceptick. And that there are also <hi>Ecstasies</hi> in the <hi>outward man,</hi> is unquestionable by the most impudent infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Yea <hi>Martin Delrio,</hi> an Elder of the Society of <hi>Jesu,</hi> in his <hi>Magical Disquisitions</hi> brings in a certain youth, in the City <hi>Insulis,</hi> rapt with so intense and violent cogitation, and ardent desire to see his mother, that as if transported by an high <note place="margin">75.</note> 
                  <hi>Ecstasie,</hi> he saw her many leagues distant, and returning again to himself perfectly remembred all things his fancy met with in this more-then-<hi>Pisgah</hi> Vision, and reported many signes to attest his real and presential visit of his mother.</p>
               <p>Many such examples occur to our quotidian observance, which in conformity to our purpose of brevity we with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry omit. But that this desire did arise from the outward


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47802:53"/>
man, namely, from flesh and blood, is most certain; for otherwise the soul once disliged and enfranchised from the body, can never, unless by miracle, be again reunited to it. Therefore in the blood there dwells a certain <hi>Ecstatical power,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">76.</note> which, if at any time it shall be excited by an earnest and ardent desire, is able to transport and on the immaterial wings of fancy waft the spirit of the outward man to some deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate object though at vast distance removed; but this <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical faculty</hi> lies dormant in the outward man, as <hi>in potentia,</hi> in hability; nor is it deduced into act, unless first rouzed and excited by the <hi>imagination</hi> accensed and exalted by <hi>fervent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,</hi> or some other art equivalent to <hi>affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, when the blood has undergone some gradual <note place="margin">77.</note> corruption, then and not till then are all the powers of it, which before lay lock't up <hi>in potentia,</hi> and slept in an unactive hability, awakened and called forth to action, without any praevious excitation of the <hi>imagination:</hi> For by corruption of the grain, the <hi>seminal virtue,</hi> otherwise drowsie, torpent and steril, springs forth into the act of fertility. For since the <note place="margin">78.</note> 
                  <hi>essences</hi> of things, and their <hi>principles of vitality</hi> know no obedience to the tyranny of <hi>corruption,</hi> by the dissolution of the inferior harmony, the separation of their corporal <hi>Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneities,</hi> they awake into a vigorous <hi>activity,</hi> and freely execute the commission of their <hi>faculties.</hi> And from hence is <note place="margin">79.</note> it, that every <hi>occult propriety,</hi> the compage of their bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by certain praevious <hi>digestions</hi> (which we call <hi>putrefactions)</hi> once dissolved, as it were emancipated from the bondage of <hi>corporeity,</hi> comes forth free, expedite, and ready for action. Wherefore when the Wound, by the ingression of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive aër, hath admitted an <hi>adverse</hi> and <hi>extraneous quality,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">80.</note> from whence the blood immediately aestuates and ferments in the lips of the Wound, and otherwise is converted into a purulent matter; it happens that the blood in the Wound freshly made, doth, by reason of this <hi>exotick quality,</hi> suffer some degree of <hi>putrefaction</hi> (which blood then received upon the weapon, is emplastered with the Magnetick Unguent) by the mediation of which gradual <hi>putrefaction,</hi> the <hi>Ecstatick power</hi> of the blood, formerly latent <hi>in potentia,</hi> is drawn into


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47802:53"/>

For then is it, I say, that the Magnet sets it self a work in the Unguent; and by the concurrence and mediation of the Ecstatick power (for so I christen this quality, in defect of a more convenient Epithite) sucks out the <hi>noxious tincture</hi> from the lips of the Wound, and at length by the mumial, balsamical and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive virtue acquired in the Unguent, the Magnetism is consummate, and the Cure perfected.</p>
               <p>Lo now you have the true and positive reason of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">81.</note> Magnetism in the Unguent, deduced from Natural Magick; to which the <hi>Soul of Reason, and Light of Truth</hi> is pleased to assent, in that sentence, <hi>Where the treasure is, there the heart is also:</hi> For if the treasure be in Heaven, then the heart, that is, the spirit of the internal man is fixed upon <hi>God,</hi> who is the true <hi>Paradise,</hi> who onely is the <hi>life of eternal life.</hi> But if the treasure be laid up in transitory and fading things: then also is the heart and spirit of the outward man chained to things that must perish and confess their dust. Nor is there cause why you should infer any <hi>mystical signification,</hi> or second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by understanding not the <hi>spirit,</hi> but the <hi>cogitation</hi> and <note place="margin">82.</note> naked <hi>desire,</hi> for the <hi>heart:</hi> for that would sound frivolous and absurd, that where-ever a man should place his treasure, in his cogitation, there also would his cogitation be placed; and <hi>Truth</hi> it self interprets this present Text literally, and without enfolding any mystery or deuteroscopy; and by an example annexed manifestly shews the real and local presence of the <hi>Eagles</hi> with the <hi>Carcase.</hi> And in this signification also the spirit of the <hi>internal man</hi> is said to be locally in the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> (which is very <hi>God</hi> himself) within us: and the heart or spirit of the <hi>external man</hi> locally dwells about its treasure.

               <p>For which consideration, I shall in this place opportunely insert the Magnetism of <hi>Eagles</hi> to <hi>Carcases</hi> newly slain: for Fowls of the aër are not endowed with so much acuteness of the <hi>sense of smelling,</hi> that by the nostril they can receive an invitation in <hi>Italy,</hi> to come and feast on dead bodies in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> For neither can an Odor be diffused to so vast a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferential distance, since both the great latitude of the Sea interposed must of necessity hinder, and the elemental pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Odor, subject to diminution and impairment in so long a tract of aër, forbid so huge an expansion of the Atomes streaming from the odorible Body; nor is there any ground whereon to build your conception, that birds can by their sight discover carcases at so large distance, especially when they lie Southward, behinde some high Mountain. But what need is there for us, by the tedious force of words, to inculcate the Magnetism of Fowl; since <hi>God</hi> himself, the <hi>Alpha and Omega of Philosophy,</hi> hath in express terms decreed the process of intercourse or commerce betwixt the heart and its treasure, to be the same with that betwixt <hi>Eagles</hi> and their prey of dead bodies: and so on the contrary, interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably?

Which would contain a most gross falsity: for the heart of man progresseth not to its treasure, with design to devour it, and sate it self therewith, as Animals are by the swinge of appetite rapt on to their food. And therefore the comparison betwixt the heart of man and the Eagle holds not good in the final cause

                           <p>Next you shall observe, that although he be a mortall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary to Witches also, in so much as 'tis essentiall to him to maintain a most destructive hostility against all the Sons of <hi>Adam:</hi> yet in respect they are his confest slaves, and sworn Subjects of his own black Kingdome, he never, unlesse against his will, and by compulsion, detects them, never betrays them into the hands of the Magistrate, nor exposes them to the scorne and reproches of other persons; and that for three reasons. (1) Since he is the Grand-father of pride, he very well knowes, that by the detection of his favorites there is much detracted from his reputation, authority and dominion. (2) Since he is an insatiate <hi>Nimrod,</hi> an implacable persecutor

of soules, he is not ignorant, that by the punishment and flames, which justice inflicts upon his Zanies, many other men, else willing and prompt to list themselves in his regiment, and fall under his jurisdiction, are discouraged, deterred, and quite averted. (3) Because he often observes many a Witch, whom with an obtorsion or wresting round of her neck, and secret stopping of her breath he could heartily wish to destroy, converted by her punishment, to become an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state from him, and repenting at sight of the flames, and by this meanes snatched out of his clutches.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From the <hi>former</hi> of our propositions I conclude, that <hi>Satan,</hi> if he were able singly by his own power to destroy man, whom the guilt of mortall sinne hath made obnoxious to the tyranny of death, would upon no motive whatever be induced to suspend and procrastinate the execution or his destructive malice: but he doth not, therefore he cannot destroy him. But yet the <hi>Witch</hi> doth very frequently murder man; and hence also it is clear, that the <hi>Witch</hi> hath a power to destroy him, no otherwise then an <hi>assassine</hi> hath a power, at the liberty of his own will, to cut the throat of him that is fallen into his hands: and therefore in this detestable action there is a certain power peculiarly belonging to the <hi>Witch,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon <hi>Satan;</hi> and by consequence <hi>Satan</hi> is not the <hi>principall efficient</hi> and grand <hi>executor</hi> of the homicide; for otherwise, if he were the prime <hi>executor,</hi> he could in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect stand in need of the <hi>Witch</hi> for a <hi>Coadjutrix</hi> and <hi>Assistant;</hi> but would ere this time, by his own single power, have cut off and swept into the grave the greatest part of mankinde. Most miserable and deplorable indeed were the condition of the posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> which should lie in subjection to so horrid a tyranny, and stand obnoxious to the fate of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary cruelty: but we have the <hi>Almighty Preserver of men,</hi> more faithfull in his mercies towards us then to subject the workes of his own hands to the arbitrary dominion of <hi>Satan.</hi> Therefore <hi>in this impious act there is a certaine power clearly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">88.</note> 
                  <hi>peculiar, and naturall to the Witch, which proceeds not from Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, what the nature, extent, and quality of this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall</hi>


                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:47802:56"/>
(yet naturall) <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Witch</hi> may be, we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly explore and gravely consider. It is manifest in the first place, that it is not any <hi>Corporeall</hi> strength of the masculine sex; for there concurres not any forcible attraction of the members of the body, and <hi>Witches</hi> are for the most part old, feeble and impotent women: Wherefore of necessity to the production of this notable mischiefe there must concurre some other power, of farre more vigour and activity then the strength of the body, and yet purely <hi>naturall</hi> to man. This power therefore must be ambuscadoed in that part, wherein <note place="margin">89.</note> we most nearly resemble the <hi>Image of God.</hi> And although all pieces of the hexameron Creation doe in some relation or other repraesent that most sacred and venerable <hi>image</hi> of the <hi>Creator:</hi> yet in regard man doth most elegantly, most properly and most exactly reflect that shadow of Divinity, therefore doth the <hi>image of God</hi> shine more transcendent in man, and as Lord Paramount beare rule and exercise dominion over the <hi>repraesentative Divinity</hi> of all other Creatures. For haply by <note place="margin">90.</note> this praerogative all created Sublunaries are made subordinate to his royaltie, and prostituted at the feet of his Soveraign will. Wherefore if <hi>God</hi> execute his will, and produce reall effects <hi>per nutum,</hi> intuitively, and by the single efficacy of his <note place="margin">91.</note> word: then <hi>man</hi> also to make good his title of being the true mirrour or repraesentative of the <hi>Deity,</hi> ought to enjoy a power of doing some actions <hi>per nutum.</hi> For neither is that new, paradoxicall or troublesome to our faith, nor peculiar onely to <hi>God</hi> himself: since <hi>Satan,</hi> the most vile and abject of all Creatures, can also move solid and ponderous bodies from place to place at pleasure, onely <hi>per nutum:</hi> for he hath no corporeall organs, no extremities, wherewith to touch, locally move, or assume any new body to himself. No lesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">92.</note> ought this priviledge to belong to the inward man, in his <hi>spirituall capacity;</hi> if we allow him to beare the <hi>image of God,</hi> and that no idle and unactive one. If we name this faculty <hi>magicall,</hi> and this appellation sound harsh, and terrible in the eares of your ignorance, I shall not quarrel with you, if you please to denominate it a <hi>spirituall vigour</hi> or <hi>energie</hi> of the inward man: for wee are not at all sollicitous about <hi>names,</hi> but


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47802:57"/>
ever with as direct an eye of reason as I can, I look upon the <hi>reality</hi> of the thing it self. This <hi>magicall</hi> power therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally resides in the <hi>inward man:</hi> whether by this title you <note place="margin">93.</note> understand the <hi>soule</hi> or <hi>vitall spirit</hi> of man, is now indifferent to us: since the <hi>inward man</hi> doth hold a certain correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the <hi>outward</hi> in all things, which commerciall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, <note place="margin">94.</note> thriving and as it were glowing with a fervour of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in a peculiar manner, is an appropriate disposition and proportionate propriety. On which ground it is necessary, that this active faculty be disseminated and diffused through the whole <hi>compositum</hi> of man: but indeed in the <hi>soule,</hi> more intense and vigorous, and in <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> far more remisse and languid.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vitall Spirit</hi> in the throne of <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> that is the <note place="margin">95.</note> outward man, sits Viceroy to the <hi>Soule,</hi> and acts by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: and is the same <hi>plastick spirit,</hi> which in the seed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends, contrives, and models the whole figure of man, that Magnificent structure, limms out all the lineaments and accurate adumbration of the parts, and understands the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate ends of all its designes and undertakings: which as <note place="margin">96.</note> Praesident and guardian accompanies the infant from the first moment of its conception, to the last of its dissolution: and which although together with the life it bid adieu to the body, yet some little remaines, as if strongly united unto and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermentated with the corporeall masse, for a while sojourn in a <hi>Carcase</hi> extinct by violence. But out of a dead body, whose lamp of life languished and went out of its owne accord, both the <hi>implantate</hi> and <hi>influent</hi> spirit depart hand in hand together. For which reason <hi>Physicians</hi> distinguish this <hi>spirit</hi> into the <hi>originary, implantate and inhaerent, or Mumiall,</hi> and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent</hi>

I answer, that this Vigour and naturall <hi>Magick</hi> of the <hi>Soule,</hi> which acts <hi>extra se,</hi> beyond the dimensions of her selfe, by virtue of the <hi>image of God,</hi> doth now lye raked up and obscured in man, and being impoverished in its force of excitation, is grown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, somnolent and stupid, ever since the praevarication of <hi>Adam</hi> (all which particulars we shall hereafter, in conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place and order commonstrate) which power, however it be charmed into a lethargick inactivity by the opium of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sin, and drunk with the narcoticall fumes of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, within us: yet it retaines force sufficient to performe all its requisite offices in the body.

               </p>
               <p>To this purpose also mainely conduceth the practice of the <hi>Cabal,</hi> which may restore to the <hi>Soule</hi> this her naturall and <note place="margin">106.</note> magicall praerogative, and rowze it up from the slumber and inchantment of <hi>Carnality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will explain my self yet farther, like a Mathematician, by <hi>Examples,</hi> and assume the very <hi>operations</hi> of <hi>Witches:</hi> which although of themselves they are full of impiety and horrid mischiefe; yet they grow upon the same root indifferently disposed to the production of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evill</hi> fruite, namely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Magicall facultie.</hi> For it proclaimes not the majesty of Free-will, or the tractate of it, if we from thence collect argument concerning a thiefe, an assassine, a whoremonger, an apostate, or Witch. Grant therefore that a Witch kill a horse, in a stable removed at good distance: there is some certain naturall power derived from the spirit of the Witch, and not from Satan, which can oppresse, strangle, and perish the vitall spirit of the horse. Grant that there be two <hi>subjects</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">107.</note> of diseases and death, and that one of these is the <hi>body</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every disease takes up its quarters: and because all Entities discharge their activities on this, as the most passive and flexible, men have conjectured, that the other spirituall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion was derived immediately from Satan: but the other is the impalpable and invisible Spirit, which is constituted in a capacity of suffering every disease, <hi>perse,</hi> in its own solitary nature. The Spirit once invaded by any forreign hostility, and subdued to the obedience of <hi>passion,</hi> the body also cannot but submit to <hi>compassion</hi> and deuteropathy; since every action is terminated in the body (for the <hi>mind</hi> after once it is adliged to the body, alwaies flowes downward, as when the Palate is misaffected with paine, the tongue alwaies tends thither, on the designe of relieving it) but on the contrary, the <hi>body</hi> may often be assaulted and entered by the force of a disease, and yet the <hi>spirit</hi> remain exempted from <hi>sympathy.</hi> For there is a


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47802:59"/>
classis of <hi>diseases</hi> onely <hi>materiall,</hi> which arise singly from a <hi>materiall tincture.</hi> So various and numerous are the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of death, that, when we have taken the just dimensions of our frailties, we shall finde no ground left us, to erect any structure of pride upon. The act therefore of the praevious touch of the Witch is purely <hi>naturall:</hi> although the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this magicall virtue depend upon the auxiliary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of <hi>Satan,</hi> in as near an interest, as if the Witch had cut the throat of the horse with a sword, which <hi>Satan</hi> had put into her hands. This act of the Witch is <hi>naturall</hi> and <note place="margin">108.</note> 
                  <hi>corporeall:</hi> as the other praecedent act is <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>sprituall.</hi> For indeed man doth naturally consist no lesse of a <hi>spirit,</hi> then a <hi>body:</hi> nor is there reason, why one act should be accounted more naturall then the other; or why the <hi>body,</hi> the courser part of man, should be allowed a power of action, but the <hi>spirit,</hi> the more noble and coelestiall part, (in its relation of being the <hi>Image of God)</hi> accounted idle, unoperative, and altogether devoid of any activity peculiar to it self: yea the <hi>Vitall spirits,</hi> in most exact propriety of language, are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate actors of <hi>sensation, motion, memory, &amp;c.</hi> but the <hi>body,</hi> and dead carkasse cannot, in any respect whatever, owne those faculties: wherefore every action stands more relatively and properly regardant to its <hi>Agent,</hi> then to the <hi>body,</hi> which at best is no more then the transitory lodging of the <hi>Agent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it is evidenced, that there passeth a <hi>spirituall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">109.</note> or gleame of magicall virtue, from the <hi>Witch,</hi> to the <hi>man</hi> or <hi>horse</hi> appointed for destruction, according to that <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome: That no action can be done, without a due approximation of the Agent to the Patient, and a reciprocal unition or marriage of the virtues of each, whether the admotion or approximation be corporeall or spirituall:</hi> which by an example ready provided to our hand we can both prove and illustrate.</p>
               <p>For if the heart (which is the presence-chamber of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall spirit) of a horse slain by a witch, taken out of the yet warme and reaking carcase, be empaled upon an arrow, and <note place="margin">110.</note> roasted upon a broach, or carbonadoed, immediately the vitall spirit of the witch, without the intervention of any other <hi>medium,</hi> and anon the whole witch (since not the <hi>body,</hi>


                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47802:60"/>
but onely the <hi>spirit</hi> is capable of <hi>sensation)</hi> becomes tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the unsufferable pains and cruelty of the fire; which truly could by no meanes happen, unlesse there praeceded a conjunction or reciprocall intercourse of the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>Witch,</hi> with the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>horse.</hi> For the horse after strangulation retaines a certain <hi>mumiall virtue</hi> (so I call it, whenever the virtue of the vitall nectar, or blood, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermentate with the flesh) which is the originary, <hi>implantate spirit,</hi> such as is never found resident in bodies, that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct by voluntary deaths in any chronique disease, or other ataxy, irregularity, or disruption of the inferiour harmony, that is the temperament of the body: to which the <hi>spirit</hi> of the Witch is associated, as joynt commissioner. In the reak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yet panting heart therefore, the <hi>spirit</hi> of the Witch, before it shall, by the dissolution of the praecedent conspiracie, or divorce of the united spirits by putrefaction, have returned backe into her bosome, is imprisoned and held captive, and the retreat of it praevented by the arrow transfixed, and by the torrefaction of both spirits together: and hence comes it <note place="margin">111.</note> to passe, that the witch is afflicted and throwne into a horrid agony in her <hi>sensative spirit.</hi> This effect admits a <hi>change,</hi> or <note place="margin">112.</note> double <hi>construction,</hi> from the <hi>intention</hi> of the experiment. For if revenge be the motive or incitement to the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, then is the effect unwarrantable and inconsistent with the charitable rules of Christianity: but if an honest and conscientious designe, to compell the Witch to detect her self, to betray her to the justice of the Magistrate, to procure security to our neighbour and our selves by the remove of so impious, blasphemous, and nocuous a vassall of Satan, that the greater glory to God, and peace and benevolence to men, may redound from the discovery; then undoubtedly the effect cannot be disallowed or condemned by the most rigid, precise, or puritanicall judgement. We are not to conceive, that all the spirit of the Witch sallyed forth, and transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the heart of the Horse (for so the Witch her selfe had perished, falne into an eternall swoune) but that there is a certaine <hi>univocall participation,</hi> or <hi>identicall traduction</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>vitall light</hi> of the Witch: in an equall analogie


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47802:60"/>
to the <hi>Plastique spirit,</hi> or sole delineator and architect of the most curious and magnificent fabrick of man, which in every distinct emission of the geniture or seed is covertly ambusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed and propagated, sufficient to the procreation of a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous issue, the originary <hi>spirit</hi> of the father yet remaining unimpaired, and conserving its individuall integrity. For in sooth that participation and inheritance of the <hi>vitall light</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">113.</note> is <hi>magical,</hi> and a rich and fruitfull communication of the specificall essence, by the fertill virtue of that benediction, delivered by the <hi>Protoplast of all seminall formes, Let all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls and Vegetalls bring forth seed,</hi> and hence is it that one individuall seed produceth ten myriads of other seeds aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, and as many seminall spirits comprehending the whole specificall essence, by the same mysterious way of traduction, whereby one Tapor is lighted by the flame of another. But what the proper nature of this Magneticall spirit, and what the Magicall entity begotten in the wombe of phansie may be, I shall more largely declare in the processe of our discourse: For it becomes me to retreat from my digression, and now to progresse in that path, which directly leads to our intended scope.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any pretence of reason, why any should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that this <hi>reaction,</hi> or rebound of <hi>magicall</hi> power upon the heart of the <hi>Witch,</hi> is only imaginary and a chimaera of licentious <hi>phanfie,</hi> or a plainly superstitious and damnable imposture and delusion of <hi>Satan;</hi> since by this token the <hi>witch</hi> is infallibly detected, and <hi>volent nolent</hi> compelled to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick, which in one of our praecedent <hi>suppositions</hi> we have sufficiently demonstrated to be <hi>è diametro,</hi> opposed to the intention of <hi>Satan:</hi> for the <hi>effect</hi> holds constantly good, and never failes to succeed upon experiment, as having its funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall causalities laid in <hi>reason</hi> and the <hi>spirituall nature</hi> of the inward man, but not at all built upon <hi>superstitious</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters.

The reason of this <hi>life in death,</hi> this <hi>plea of the grave</hi> and loud language of silent corruption, which hath empuzled the <note place="margin">114.</note> anxious disquisitions of many subtile heads, we conceive to be thus: in a man dying of a wound, the <hi>inferiour virtues,</hi> which are <hi>mumiall,</hi> (for these are not subject to the restrint of our will, and operate not in conformity to the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This also is the cause, why the <hi>Plague</hi> is so frequent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant to <hi>seidges,</hi> and why the beleaguered see the revenge of their dead acted upon their enemies by the surviving Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of their friends bloud: for the <hi>magicall spirit</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, in the heat of the encounters &amp; sallyes, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a character and impression of revenge, and sometimes the defendants, especially th common Souldier, being by want and other extreame miseries reduced to desperation, and man and wife, conjoyned as well in death as life, falling into the cold armes of the grave, bequeath heavie imprecations and maledictions to the surviving Officers, who engaged them in the calamity, and might, had their charity been but halfe so weighty as their wealth, have relieved their famine: by <note place="margin">116.</note> which earnest curse, there are more strong and durable <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> engraven on the <hi>sidereall-spirit</hi> of the dying man (chiefly of a great bellyed woman) which survive the funerall of the body.

               <p>For if we expect a perfect cure from the dressing of the weapon, truely the <hi>mosse</hi> and other its fellow ingredients will prove insufficient to worke a cure, when the weapon is not distained with blood effused from the wound: Since there is required a more violent and efficacious, namely, a <hi>taurine,</hi> impression, and an aëreall communication of <hi>florid honey.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">122.</note> And thus have wee, to the satisfaction of the most incredulous and prejudicate, made it out, that the admirable efficacy of the <hi>Unguent</hi> ought to be imputed, not to any auxiliary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of <hi>Satan</hi> (who could performe the cure without the use of honey and Bulls blood) but to the communion of <hi>Naturall qualities,</hi> by the energy of the posthume <hi>Character of Revenge,</hi> remaining firmly impressed upon the blood and concreted fat.</p>
               <p>Our Adversaries will whisper, and secretly exult, that the power of our <hi>Magnetical Unguent</hi> could have hardly been supported, but by <hi>Analogical Arguments</hi> drawn from the abstruse operations of <hi>Witches,</hi> from the impostures of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the <hi>spiritual magick</hi> of the invisible world, which is a <hi>science</hi> onely imaginary, of no solid concernment or weight in the ballance of reason, and a dangerous, if not damnable, error. Nevertheless, not any sinister obliquity or perversion of truth, nor any indirect design in us, by specious similitudes to impose upon the weaker credulities of the illiterate: but the gross ignorance of others, and the deplorable condition of humane fragility, which by the propensity of our vitiated nature more readily inclines to evil, more nimbly apprehends evil, and is more familiarly instructed by evil, then good,

hath compulsively directed our pen to observe this method in the explanation and probation of our thesis. However, what we have represented in this scene concerning <hi>Satan,</hi> and his familiar Zany the <hi>Witch,</hi> affords no encouragement or ground for others to hope a perfect conformity or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the power of our <hi>Unguent</hi> with that of Witches; for neither the <hi>spiritual faculty</hi> of the <hi>Vnguent,</hi> nor the <hi>ecsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique phansie</hi> of the blood, are excited by the manuduction or impulsion of <hi>Satan.</hi> The mark we shot at was, that there is inhabitant in the Soul a certain <hi>Magical Virtue,</hi> infused by the primitive bounty of her <hi>Creator,</hi> naturally proper and of right belonging to her by that just title, that <hi>Man is the image and noble effigies of the Deity;</hi> and that this virtue is qualified with a celestial activity, and semidivine prerogative of operation, that is, a power of acting <hi>per nutum,</hi> intuitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, spiritually, and at vast distance, and that too with much more vigor and efficacy, then by any corporeal helps and assistance. The reason briefly and plainly thus; the soul is the diviner particle, and more noble moity of man, far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighing the body both in dignity of essence and extraction: therefore also is the activity competent to it spiritual, Magical, and of superlative validity. That the Soul by the dictates of this Virtue, which hath suffered a consopition and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its primitive agility by the counter-magick of the forbidden Apple in Paradise, doth regulate, manage, and move onely her own peculiar body: but the same being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitated and awakened again into action, she extends her dominion beyond the narrow limits of her earthly cloyster to an object at distance, and becomes so longimanous as to operate onely <hi>per nutum,</hi> by intuition conveyed through convenient mediums: for upon this point is founded the whole basis of <hi>Natural Magick,</hi> but in no respect upon the <note place="margin">123.</note> brittle and sandy foundation of Benedictions, Ceremonies, and vain superstitions; for these vain and impious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances <note place="margin">124.</note> were all introduced by him, who hath ever made it his study, to conspurcate and defile the best things with the sophistication of his tares. And in this sense we have not <note place="margin">125.</note> trembled at the name of <hi>Magick,</hi> but with the Scripture


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47802:64"/>
understood it in the best interpretation: and yet we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, to be indifferently imployed to a good or evil end, namely by the lawful use or abuse of this power. And so <note place="margin">126.</note> under this term we comprehend the highest ingenite cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of natural things, and the most vigorous power of action, equally natural to us with <hi>Adam,</hi> not wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished nor obliterated by original sin, but onely obscured and as it were consopited, and therefore wanting experge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and excitement. And therefore we declare, that Magnetism is not exercised by <hi>Satan:</hi> but by that which hath <note place="margin">127.</note> no dependance upon <hi>Satan:</hi> and consequently that this power, which is peculiarly connatural to us, hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busively fathered upon <hi>Satan,</hi> as if he were the sole patron and promoter of it: that this Magical Faculty lieth dormant in us, charmed into a somnolent inactivity by the opiate of the primitive sin, and therefore stands in need of an <hi>Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi>

               <p>That those who are ignorant of most things we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, should yet remain dubious and unsatisfied in many things, is necessarily certain: wherefore we have determined to make a summary rehearsal of all: chiefly that so what we have spoken in the former part of our dispute, concerning the duello or conflict of spirits, and the reciprocal amity or mutual conspiration of their united virtues, may receive the clearer explanation. It is a task worthy our sweat and oyl, to discover and handsomely define the arms, militia, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of spirits, and their Commonwealth: in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are with great sobriety of judgment, and acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of reason, to perpend the <hi>example</hi> of a <hi>pregnant</hi> or great bellied <hi>woman,</hi> who when she hath intently and with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of desire fixed her minde upon a Cherry, immediately there is impressed upon the fruit of her womb the model, or pourtract of the Cherry, in that part, whereon the ingravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated woman laid her hand. Nor doth there remain onely a bare and idle figure of a Cherry, and a spot or maculation of the skin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a certain <hi>real production,</hi> which buds; blossomes, and ripens in its due season, at the same time with other trees, the signatures of colour and figure passing gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al changes till it come to maturity. High and sacred, in good troth, is the power of the <hi>microcosmical spirit,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any arboreal trunck produceth a true Cherry: that is flesh, by the sole seminality and conception of Phansie, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with all the proprieties and virtue of a real Cherry. Hence we understand two necessary consequences. The <hi>first</hi>


                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47802:65"/>
that the <hi>seminal spirits,</hi> and in some latitude of acception the <note place="margin">132.</note> very <hi>essences</hi> of all creatures do lie ambuscadoed in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and are onely educed and hatched into <hi>realities</hi> by the <hi>microcosmicratical Phansie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>other,</hi> that the <hi>Soul</hi> in the conception of thought <note place="margin">133.</note> doth generate a certain <hi>idea</hi> of the thing conceived in the minde: which as it before lay concealed and raked up, as fire in flint; so by the concitation of <hi>Phansie</hi> it doth produce a certain real <hi>idea</hi> or exact pourtraict, and an essential deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, in every part responding to the <hi>quiddity</hi> of the Cherry, which cannot be a meer <hi>quality,</hi> but something like a <note place="margin">134.</note> 
                  <hi>substance,</hi> of an ambiguous essence between the <hi>body</hi> and the <hi>spirit,</hi> that is the <hi>Soul.</hi> This production is so far <hi>spiritual,</hi> that it is not wholly exempted from a <hi>corporeal</hi> condition; since the actions of the <hi>soul</hi> are terminated in the <hi>body,</hi> and the other inferior faculties subservient to her: nor yet so far <hi>corporeal,</hi> that it may be circumscribed by dimensions, which is onely proper to a <hi>seminal Entity,</hi> as we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly related. This <hi>ideal Entity</hi> therefore when it falls from the invisible and intellectual world of the <hi>microcosm,</hi> it then puts on <hi>corporeity,</hi> and then first becomes subject to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed by the determinate dimensions of <hi>Locality</hi> and <hi>Numeration.</hi> The proper <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>intellect</hi> is an abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, naked and pure <hi>essence,</hi> subsisting of itself; and not an <hi>Accident,</hi> by the consent of Practical, that is Mystical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. This <hi>Protheus,</hi> the <hi>intellect,</hi> doth thus as it were cloath and apparel this conceived <hi>essence</hi> with <hi>Corporeity.</hi> But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard every operation of the <hi>soul,</hi> whether external or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, hath its <hi>fieri</hi> in its own proper <hi>image:</hi> therefore can not the <hi>intellect</hi> discern and know, the <hi>Will</hi> like and select, and the <hi>Memory</hi> recollect and recogitate, unless by images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this same image of the object the <hi>intellect</hi> doth cloath in <hi>corporeity:</hi> and because the <hi>Soul</hi> is the <hi>simple Form</hi> of the body, which readily converts and applies her self to every member, therefore cannot the <hi>intellect</hi> entertain and harbor two images at one and the same time, but successively first one and then another. And thus the <hi>Soul</hi> wholly descends upon the intellect, and the yet-tender and embryon <hi>image</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">135.</note>


                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:47802:66"/>
newly conceived and impressed, and afterwards forms the cognition of the peculiar essence into a persistent and durable image, or <hi>ideal Entity.</hi> The <hi>minde</hi> being once polluted by the leprous miasm, or contagious tincture of sin, soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obnoxious to the wrath of <hi>God;</hi> and because this was at once deturpated and depraved, being devested of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its primitive condition; therefore <hi>Death</hi> found an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon our nature, not by the original decree of the <hi>Creator,</hi> but by the degeneration of man delapsed into filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and impurity, and ungenerously degrading himself, by reason of this <hi>ideal entity</hi> now arrayed with comparative corporeity; which corruption and turpitude, with deplorable fertility springing up in every the most venial peccadillo, we must extenuate and mortifie by showers of poenitential tears in this world, or too late bewail in the next. This <hi>entity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while it remains in the forge of the <hi>intellect,</hi> is but lightly and slenderly characterized, nor doth any where, but in a pregnant woman, receive a more firm consistence, which in the masculine sex it never obtains but by the <hi>Will;</hi> more familiarly thus, the <hi>Agent Intellect</hi> always procreateth an <hi>ideal Entity,</hi> or <hi>semi-substantial pourtraict</hi> of the essence of an object; but cloaths it not with <hi>corporeity,</hi> unless by the immediate action of the <hi>Will,</hi> great-bellied women onely excepted. <hi>Sin</hi> therefore, whether we allow it to be a <hi>reality,</hi> or <hi>non-reality,</hi> at least a consent and propensity to evil, can never be committed without the real production of this kinde of <hi>Entity,</hi> and the assumption and indution of it. And this <note place="margin">136.</note> truly hath ever been the Cause of the <hi>foecundity of seeds:</hi> for the <hi>Phansie,</hi> excited by the orgasmus or heat of <hi>lust,</hi> produceth a slender <hi>reality</hi> or <hi>ideal entity,</hi> which when the <hi>soul</hi> hath clothed with <hi>corporeity</hi> (for the action of the minde, while it remains immured in walls of flesh, always tends downward and outward) it instantly diffuseth this new <hi>ideal entity</hi> into the liquor of the <hi>seed,</hi> which without this impregnation had still continued barren and devoid of any <hi>Plastique power:</hi> which action is performed as it were by an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>minde,</hi> the <hi>will</hi> being ravished, by the true Magick <note place="margin">137.</note> of the outward man, into a kinde of short <hi>ecstasie,</hi> in which


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47802:66"/>
there happens a communication or bequest of a certaine <hi>Mentall light</hi> to the <hi>entity</hi> descending into the body or masse of <hi>seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whensoever therefore the <hi>Cogitation</hi> draws the <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>will</hi> into consent; so often is there hatched and incorporated a filthy, spurious <hi>ideall entity:</hi> by which production the <hi>will</hi> is said to be <hi>confirmed:</hi> and this <hi>ideall entity</hi> with all expedition rangeth through the body, whithersoever it is sent on an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by the <hi>will:</hi> and by this meanes the <hi>will</hi> now moves the arme, now the foote, anon the tongue, and so all other parts.</p>
               <p>Againe when this <hi>entity</hi> is disseminated upon the <hi>Uitall Spirit,</hi> on a designe of love, reliefe, or harme to any object, then it wants no more then a slight and easie excitement from the auxiliary hand of <hi>God,</hi> of the <hi>Cabalistique</hi> Art, or of <hi>Satan;</hi> that so the portion of the spirit, which is impraegna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ideall entity, may sally abroad and atcheive the enterprise enjoined it by the <hi>will.</hi> Thus every <hi>male</hi> projects <note place="margin">138.</note> his seed at distance from the dimensions of his body: which seminall emission carries along with it that foecundity, which it drew from the infused <hi>entity,</hi> and executes its procreative commission beyond the trunck of the individuall protoplast. Undoubtedly bodies scarce make up a moity of the world: but Spirits possesse a full mediety, and indeed the major part of the world. And therefore in this whole Context, I call <hi>Spirits the Patrons of Magnetisme:</hi> not those that are sent <note place="margin">139.</note> downe from heaven doe we mean, much lesse those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from the horrid Abysse below; but such only which have their originall, and existence in man himselfe: for as fire is, by excussion, kindled from flint, so also from the <hi>Will</hi> of man, by a kinde of secret scintillation, something of the vitall influent spirit is desumed, and that something assumes an <hi>ideall entity,</hi> as its <hi>ultimate forme</hi> and complement. Which perfection once obtained the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which before was purer and more refined <note place="margin">140.</note> then the aethereall aër, becomes subtilitated like <hi>light,</hi> and assumes an ambiguous or midle nature between <hi>Corporeall</hi> substances and <hi>incorporeall.</hi> But it is sent ambassador whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the <hi>Will</hi> directs it, or thither at least, whither the <hi>innate


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47802:67"/>
infallible science of spirits</hi> doth command it, according to the intentions and scopes of the taskes to be performed: the <hi>ideall entity</hi> therefore, being now ready prepared for its journey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>light</hi> (understand it in some latitude of sense) and shifting off corporeity, confesseth no restraint or circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive laws of places, times, or dimensions. And this refined and exalted <hi>semisubstance</hi> is neither the <hi>Devill,</hi> nor any <hi>effect,</hi> nor any <hi>conspiration</hi> of his: but a certain <hi>spirituall action of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man,</hi> plainly and purely naturall and haereditary to us. This mysterious <hi>wisdome</hi> who ever entertaineth with that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of judgement and praeparation of nature and unprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate thought, which becomes the gravity of a mind greedy of magnalities, shall easily understand, that the <hi>materiall world is on all sides governed, regulated, and coerced by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall and invisible: and that all corporeal created natures are placed at the footstoole of man, as being subordinate to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of his will.</hi> And this very thing truely is the <hi>Cause,</hi> why even the mumie, the fat, the mosse, and the humane blood, namely the <hi>Phansy</hi> naturally existing in them, in the <hi>Unguent,</hi> should domineer over the blood of a Dogge, of a Horse, &amp;c. shed upon a piece of wood, and buried in a pot of the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet we have not said enough concerning the <hi>Magnetisme of the Unguent:</hi> We shall therefore now pursue a hint, which <note place="margin">141.</note> we started in our praecedent lines. That the <hi>Magnetisme</hi> of the <hi>Loadstone</hi> and other inanimate Creatures is performed by a certain <hi>Naturall sensation,</hi> the immediate Authrix of all <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi> is a truth unquestionable. For if the <hi>Loadstone</hi> direct it selfe to the Pole, it must have a certain <hi>knowledge,</hi> lest it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">142.</note> subject to deviation and error in its direction: and how, I beseech you, can it have that requisite knowledge, if it be not <hi>sensible</hi> of its owne locall position? In like manner if it convert to iron placed at great distance, and neglect the Pole, of necessity it must first know the situation of the iron. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the single <hi>Magnet</hi> is endowed with various <hi>senses,</hi> and also with <hi>imagination:</hi> nor will it be enough, that it be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>sensation,</hi> unlesse we also adde the provokement and goads of occult <hi>friendship</hi> and <hi>Philauty</hi> or selfe-love; and so


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47802:67"/>
that the <hi>Loadstone</hi> is endowed with a certaine <hi>Naturall phansy,</hi> by the power of whose impression all <hi>Magnetismes</hi> in the whole Catalogue of Creatures are performed. For <note place="margin">143.</note> by one <hi>phansy</hi> it is directed to <hi>iron,</hi> and by another to the <hi>Pole;</hi> for then is its virtue diffused onely through a small space of the aër to the object near at hand: but that <hi>Phansy</hi> is changed, when it praevents an abortion, restraines the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous flux of Catarrhes, or hinders the falling downe of the intestine in a rupture: and by a third <hi>phansy,</hi> different from both the former, doth the <hi>Loadstone</hi> attract any thing of glasse melted by fire: for any the smallest fragment of a <hi>Loadstone</hi> injected into a good quantity of glasse, while it is in decoction, of green or yellow turns it into perfect white. For albeit the <hi>Loadstone</hi> it selfe be of a deep (though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">144.</note> shadowed) sanguine tincture, and be wholly destroied and consumed by the fire that dissolves the glasse: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding while it retaines any relict of its <hi>vital essence,</hi> it exhausteth the <hi>tincted liquor</hi> even from the candent glasse, and devoureth the <hi>tincture</hi> of it: and thus we discerne, that the attraction of the <hi>Loadstone</hi> is not determined onely to <hi>iron;</hi> but also extends to that <hi>aerial part,</hi> which otherwise could not, without great difficulty, be divorced from the body of the glasse: and to this purpose is it commonly used by Glasse-makers. The <hi>phansy of Amber</hi> delights to allect <note place="margin">145.</note> strawes, chaffe, and other festucous bodies, by an attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we confesse, obscure and weake enough, yet sufficiently manifest and strong to attest an <hi>Electricity,</hi> or attractive <hi>signature:</hi> for married to the <hi>mumie</hi> of our bodies, it appears superiour to the <hi>humane Magnet,</hi> draws counter to it, and by that interest entitleth it selfe to the dignity of a <hi>Zenexton,</hi> or preservatory <hi>Amulet</hi> against contagion. But <hi>Amber</hi> mixed with <hi>Gummes,</hi> its <hi>imagination</hi> being then transplanted, attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Venome</hi> and bullets out of wounds: for the pleasure and desire of attraction is varied on either side, that is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various contemperation and allay of the <hi>humane mumie,</hi> and of the <hi>Gummes.</hi> But alas!

whole <hi>Compositum,</hi> by reason of the Form of it; such are the Magnetism of the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> the virtue of <hi>Tinctures,</hi> and all specifical and appropriate <hi>Medicaments;</hi> which are occasioned by reason either of the <hi>whole homogeneous neixture,</hi> or the particular <hi>form</hi> of some integral part, but not of any <hi>single</hi> or divided <hi>principle:</hi> such as these are naturally inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the trunck, leaves, root, and fruit of plants, and not in any one of the three principles diacritically separated from the compage or conjuncture.

this sort of <hi>magical bruites,</hi> are the <hi>Basilisk,</hi> a dog, many fishes described by <hi>Olaus Magnus, &amp;c.</hi> such also is the virtue inhabitant in the <hi>blood</hi> of many <hi>Animals:</hi> and hence doth <hi>Holy Writ</hi> deliver expresly, that the Soul so journs in the blood though extravenated, though decocted on the fire, yea, and (for ought can be alleaged to the contrary) though totally altered by corruption.

                  <hi>virtue</hi> as it were <hi>abstracted from the body,</hi> which is wrought by the excitement of the <hi>interior power of the soul:</hi> and from this arise most potent procreations, most noble impressions, and effects of supreme vigor and efficacy.

                  <note place="margin">158.</note> in most of her operations playes the <hi>Magician,</hi> and acts by the energy of her own <hi>phansie;</hi> and since this activity is by so much the more <hi>potent,</hi> by how much the more spiritual; therefore is the term or appellative of Magick exactly analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous and concordant.</p>
               <p>Of all which gradually different <hi>species of magical virtue,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">159.</note> there is hardly any one that stands not in need of excitation. For that of the lowest Classis requires excitement and educti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by some previous warmth, or gently fomenting heat, by which there is educed a certain vapor, or <hi>spiritual effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> by reason whereof the <hi>phansie</hi> restrained in a profound sleep, and drowsie inactivity, is awakened into action, and then begins a mediatory encounter between the <hi>corporeal spirits,</hi> which is of <hi>Magnetism,</hi> excited by a precedent touch. But that of the highest Classis, such as belongs to <hi>bruits</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> receives excitement from an <hi>intellectual conception;</hi> and that of the <hi>inward man</hi> is not at all excited, unless by the <hi>Holy spirit,</hi> and by his excellent gift, the <hi>Cabal;</hi> but that of the <hi>outward man,</hi> by strong <hi>imagination,</hi> by assiduous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense speculation, yea, and in Witches by Satan. But the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> of the <hi>extravenated blood</hi> (wherein the soul hath taken up her quarters) which lies lurking onely in <hi>potentia,</hi> is excited and invited into act, either by a more strong <hi>imagination</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, conceive it of the <hi>magician</hi> making use of the blood as a <hi>medium,</hi> and fixing his newly accensed entity thereon; or conceive it by the ascendent <hi>phansie</hi> of the <hi>Armary unguent,</hi> the excitatrix of the proprieties latent in the blood; or by a


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47802:71"/>
previous destination of the blood to corruption whereby the Elements are disposed to separation, and the Essences (which know no corruption) and the Essential phansies, which lay obscured in the <hi>potentia</hi> of the proprieties, sally forth into action.</p>
               <p>The <hi>phansie</hi> therefore of any subject whatever hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <note place="margin">160.</note> a strong and vigorous appetite to the spirit of its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar object, in order to the locomotion, attraction, expulsion, or repulsion of it: now in this, and no where else, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Magnetism, as the natural magical endowment of that subject, conferred upon, and firmly implanted in it, by the wise bounty of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is therefore a certain <hi>formal propriety</hi> segregated <note place="margin">161.</note> and manifestly distinct from the <hi>Sympathetique and abstruse qualities,</hi> in this particular relation: that the <hi>phansie,</hi> which is the motrix of those qualities, doth not directly tend to the Locomotion, but onely the Alteration of the object. And thus, though we grant, that every Magnetism be either <hi>Sympathetical,</hi> or <hi>Antipathetical;</hi> yet notwithstanding the inversion will fail, that every sympathy must be Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
               <p>But we retire from our digression to the grand mark our intentions level at.

For pregnant women labor with an absurd and ridiculous appetite to strange and unusual meats, and Cachectical Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, <note place="margin">162.</note> by a natural oestrum or libidinous fury of the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant womb, do with extraordinary celerity (though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great inamoenity and paleness) digest what ever they long for: but indeed, not from reason of similitude of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, nor from any consanguinity of humane nature requiring that particular meat, their irregular appetite so ravenously covets; but seduced by the <hi>exotique phansie</hi> of the <hi>vitious humors,</hi> accumulated in the vessels of the womb, and restagnated or belched up into the stomach, which


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47802:71"/>
over-mastering the true and natural appetite, goadeth them to this absurdity; by the expulsion of which noxious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, we have frequently cured such perversions and absurd appetites; or else we have mitigated and composed them, by permitting the irregular and frantick phansie of such humors to sate it self by fruition. In the <hi>blood</hi> therefore there inhabiteth a peculiar <hi>phansie,</hi> which in regard it is of more <note place="margin">163.</note> vigorous energy therein, then in other things, therefore doth <hi>Divine History,</hi> in a singular and emphatique Elogy, call the <hi>blood</hi> (though strongly decocted, and ready cooked for the table) the <hi>Mansion of the soul.</hi> And in regard this <hi>phansie</hi> of <note place="margin">164.</note> the <hi>blood</hi> is capable of <hi>traduction,</hi> and may be devolved to posterity; for this reason is it, that the manners, gestures, conditions, and genius of the Grandfather are revived and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come resplendent in his issue, long after the resolution of him into dust. <hi>Nobility</hi> took its first rise from well-deserving <hi>Virtue.</hi> hence most nobility be without just merit, suspected to be encreased by the continued and successive propagation of the family, unless the heroick inclinations and virtues of gallant ancestors, obscured by mortality, might, with proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of hope, be expected to finde a resurrection, and shine again in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <note place="margin">165.</note> conceived betwixt the <hi>Woolf</hi> and <hi>sheep</hi> remain firmly impressed upon their pelts? Wherefore the <hi>phansie</hi> of an <hi>Animal,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicaciously surviving death, is impressed not onely upon the <hi>blood:</hi> but also whoever sleeps under the coverture of a blanket made of the skin of a <hi>Gulo</hi> or <hi>Glutten</hi> (a beast of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, because insatiate, voracity, very common in <hi>Swedland)</hi> is forced continually to dream of feasting, hunger, voracity and the ensnaring of wilde beasts, according to the natural condition of that <hi>animal,</hi> while it was living: and thus, onely by an external coverlet. the <hi>phansie</hi> of the beast, which during life so journed in the skin, is devolved and traduced unto a man, that sleeps beneath it.

               <p>Hitherto have I suspended the revealment of a grand my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; <note place="margin">168.</note> namely, to bring it home to the hand of reason, that in man there sits enthroned a <hi>noble energy,</hi> whereby he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a capacity to act <hi>extra se,</hi> without and beyond the narrow territories of himself, onely <hi>per nutum,</hi> by his single beck, and by the natural magick of his <hi>phansie,</hi> and to transmit a subtil and invisible <hi>virtue,</hi> a certain influence, that doth afterward subsist and persevere <hi>per se,</hi> and operate upon an object removed at very large distance: by the discovery of which sole mystery, all that we have hitherto treated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ideal entity,</hi> conveyed in the arms of a spiritual emanation, and sallying abroad to execute the mandates of the <hi>will,</hi> concerning the <hi>magnetism</hi> of all Creatures, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well from humane <hi>phansie,</hi> as from the native and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>phansie</hi> of every thing, and also concerning the <hi>magical superiority</hi> of man over all other sublunary bodies, will receive illustration, and shine bright in the eye of our understanding. Tis a meridian truth, too clear to be eclipsed by controversie, that of steel there may be made a needle, which invigorated <note place="margin">169.</note> by the confriction of a loadstone, doth point out the pole to


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47802:73"/>
Seamen: but in vain is the steel hammered into a needle, and placed at free range in the navigatory Compass, to level at the north Star, unless there hath preceded a fit and requisite affriction of the loadstone. Which assertions since they sound loud enough to pierce the ears of the deafest incredulity, it remains convenient, that we frame and qualifie a Mariners needle, <hi>solo nutu,</hi> onely by the <hi>magnetism</hi> of our <hi>phansie,</hi> and magick of <hi>intuition.</hi> On the anvil therefore, whereon the steel is hammered into a figure of a needle, let the north point be chalked out, and that in a strait line: then stand you, when you play the Vulcan, with your back to the north, that so when the steel is beating under the hammer, you may draw it out into a needle towards your self and the north: I say therefore, that such a needle, thus <hi>positionally</hi> and <hi>intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itively</hi> framed, will acquire a vigorous <hi>polarity,</hi> and punctually observe the north Star, without any forein impregnation or magnetical infusion, and indeed without any variation, to which the ordinary needles invigorated by the loadstone are subject, which carries with it a very great mystery. Moreover that needle, which is made upon the foresaid line, by <hi>chance,</hi> and without the <hi>knowledg</hi> or <hi>intention</hi> of the Fabricator, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues bare steel, devoid of all verticity, and directs not to the pole. Hence is it a natural Consequence, that the imagination of the Fabricator, in the very moment of the needles nativity, when the glowing heat of the fire is somewhat abated, and the steel but obscurely red, doth impress this magnetical faculty into the steel needle, as a convenient and appropriate subject. Not that the celestial orbs do, in that punctilio of time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the verticity; for then it would descend and be impressed upon the steel, without the intention, consent or observance of the smith; which cannot satisfie experience: for if the Stars did transmit their influence at some certain hour, and in some determinate position, then might the <hi>Characteristical and sigillary science</hi> of the <hi>celestial orbs</hi> be allowed to put on triumphant wreaths, which we pass by.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Constellation</hi> which descends upon the steel (and <note place="margin">170.</note> it may be upon every <hi>magical image and seal)</hi> is derived from the <hi>Microcosmical Heaven,</hi> that is, from our own


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47802:73"/>
                  <hi>Olympus:</hi> vain and unsuccessful therefore have been those <hi>Magical seals and pentacles,</hi> which were not framed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurated by the magician in an high <hi>ecstasie</hi> and exaltation of his <hi>phansie:</hi> for all inferior <hi>Entities</hi> and <hi>Phansies</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to do homage to the transcendent magick of ours, by which prerogative <hi>Sapiens dominabitur astris,</hi> a wiseman shall regulate and countermand the influence of the Stars, to the dominion of whose sceptre the <hi>Parent of Nature</hi> hath subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whatever is contained in the vast Amphitheatre of Heaven. What we have here alleaged concerning the <hi>phansie</hi> impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a verticity upon the steel, as we have learned from the authentick testimony of many judicious pens, and from our own frequent experience: so may it be confirmed ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times to the observation of any whose curiosity shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to the easie trouble of the experiment. Thus the leaves of Asarum, and the tops of Elder, submit and conform unto the phansie of the decerptor, who impresseth upon the plant, and the plant upon the leaves a <hi>magnetical virtue,</hi> which in operation shall justly respond to the position of the hand that gathered them: when otherwise, the leaf being decocted (as the needle heat again in the fire) and given in a potion, the virtue of the phansie impressed upon it would of necessity perish, if the <hi>Magnetism</hi> were not cherished and maintained from the integral plant. That the blood of any <hi>Animal</hi> decocted and ready cooked for the trencher, doth yet contain the <hi>soul</hi> of that <hi>Animal,</hi> is true: but that virtue doth not depend upon the impression of <hi>humane and forein phansie,</hi> but ariseth immediately from the proper endowment of its own phansie. By the same reason also doth a dart thrust through the heart of a horse, killed by the execrable magick <note place="margin">171.</note> of a witch, binde up and hold captive the <hi>vital spirit</hi> of that <hi>witch,</hi> and twisteth it together with the <hi>mumial spirit</hi> of the <hi>horse,</hi> that so both may be torrified together, and by that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as by a sharp goad, the witch may be driven to betray her self: and that at length, by the justice of the magistrate, the base miscreant, detestable to <hi>God,</hi> and pernicious to man, may be eternally exiled from the conversation of mortals, and cut off, according to the Law of <hi>God.</hi> For if the operation be


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47802:74"/>
determined to any <hi>external object,</hi> the <hi>magical soul</hi> doth never attempt it without a convenient <hi>medium:</hi> and for this reason she makes use of the <hi>dart</hi> or nail transfixed through the heart.</p>
               <p>Now this position, that man is endowed with a power of acting, <hi>per nutum,</hi> or moving any object at remote distance, being proved by convictive evidence: it is also sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, by the same natural example, that this transcendent energy was conferred upon him by the wise indulgence of his Creator; and therefore, by the Charter of his Nature, doth justly belong unto him. Their conjecture hath ever had a <note place="margin">172.</note> strong hautgoust of absurdity, who have hitherto conceived, that <hi>Satan</hi> hath moved, altered, and transported any thing, and really applied <hi>Actives</hi> to <hi>Passives</hi> in locomotion, onely <hi>per nutum;</hi> while they have taken for granted, that the Devil was the first and grand <hi>Motor</hi> in the forementioned motions, that by those corporeal extremities requisite to contaction, he could violently snatch away, transmit, or any way move, at least an aëreal body (which they fondly imagine) though destitute of a soul. Absurd, I say, is it to believe, that <hi>Satan</hi> since his exile from the presence (I mean, the merciful influence) of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and fall from the glory of his own essence, doth still retain a <hi>magical dignity,</hi> whereby he can really act upon any natural subject, and produce what effect soever he please, onely by <hi>intuition,</hi> because in the primitive excellence of his once Angelical nature, he received such an endowment: but that the same prerogative was taken from, and ever since denied unto man, and given to the Devil, the most vile and despicable of Creatures: and that if there be any such real effects performed by man, they are to be ascribed to a servile <hi>compact</hi> with the devil. Open the eyes of your reason: for Satan hath hitherto proudly triumphed in your so great and so dangerous ignorance, with so high content, as if you had made his altars smoke with the grateful incense of <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>dignity,</hi> and devested your self of your own native prerogative, pulled out your own eyes, and offered them in sacrifice to him.</p>
               <p>We have said, that every magical virtue doth lie <hi>dormant,</hi>


                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:47802:74"/>
and want <hi>excitation:</hi> which holds perpetually true, if the object, upon which the energy is discharged, be not neerly disposed and qualified to admit it, if the phansie of it doth not promptly conform unto the impression of the <hi>Agent,</hi> or also if the <hi>Patient</hi> be equal in strength, or superior to the <hi>Agent.</hi> But on the contrary, where the object is conveniently, proxim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and obediently qualified to entertain the magical influx, as steel is to receive the magnetical infusion of a loadstone: or plainly weak, and conscious to it self (as are the homicide, adulterer, theif, and witch) there the <hi>patient,</hi> without much excitation, the sole <hi>phansie of the outward man</hi> being deduced into action and adliged to any convenient <hi>medium,</hi> at the first assault surrenders its self, and obeys the Magnetism. I say, the magician ever makes use of a <hi>medium:</hi> for thus, unless a pregnant woman hath extended her hand to her own thigh, forehead, or buttocks, the infant in her womb shall never be stigmatized in his thigh, forehead, or buttocks. Thus do the words or forms of <hi>Sacraments</hi> ever operate: because <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> from the work performed. But why <hi>exorcisms</hi> do not alway succeed in their operations; the defect is not in <hi>God,</hi> but onely because the <hi>unexalted and dully-excited minde</hi> of the <hi>Exoreist</hi> doth blunt the edg of the Charm, and render the words invalid and ineffectual. For which reason, no man can be a happy and perfect <hi>Exoreist,</hi> but he, who hath learned the art to excite the <hi>Magick</hi> of his own <hi>phansie;</hi> or by practise can do it <hi>ecstatically,</hi> without that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p>It may be you'l say, that our <hi>Armary unguent</hi> acquires no other magnetical virtue, then that which redounds to it from the <hi>phansie</hi> of him that compounds it: you are mistaken. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, should we allow you that error for truth, your cause could receive no support or advantage thereby; since then you would implicitely confess the effect not to be ascribed to <hi>Satan.</hi> So the <hi>Unguent</hi> would not be magnetical from any innate and natural <hi>phansie</hi> peculiar to it self, but from an external adventitious inspiration, namely the <hi>phansie</hi> of the <hi>Compounder,</hi> impressed upon it: since there can be no neerer <hi>medium</hi> of the foresaid Magnetism, then humane blood with


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47802:75"/>
humane blood; truly, the blood alone, as the most propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate and predisposed subject would suffice to the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Unguent,</hi> and all the other simples ingredient into the confection, would be frustraneous and unnecessary, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>blood of a Bull</hi> and <hi>hony,</hi> where the cure is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by applying the salve to weapons not distained with the blood of the Patient, which is manifestly false by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Finally, the Magnetism of the <hi>Unguent</hi> would then be <hi>general;</hi> in respect the <hi>Confectioner</hi> may, by the wilde and <note place="margin">173.</note> universal range of his Phansie, intend to make the impression, uncertain, undeterminate, and extensive to the wounds, not onely of <hi>man,</hi> but of all <hi>beasts</hi> whatever. What if the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders phansie</hi> were not fixed upon a dog; must the <hi>Unguent</hi> therefore have no virtue to cure the wound of a dog? Away with such idiotism, such ridiculous dotage.

               <head>The Summary.</head>
               <p>1. AFishing for Whales. 2. The spirit of Wine, depressed by cold, retires to the center of its vessel. 3. How Vineger dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Wine. 4. Wine in the superficies of a vessel, why less gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. 5. The Concretion of Tartar in Hogsheads. 6. How it affixes it self to the sides of a vessel. 7. It is coagulated in fixing. 8. The premises are made good. 9. The error of a Chymick Axiome. 10. The reason of Wine coagulated in Tartar, holds no analogy to that of Excrements coagulated in the Microcosm. 11. The difference betwixt Tartar, and the Stone concreted in the body of Man. 12. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar not altogether, or truly, the excrements of Wine. 13. A grand error of <hi>Paracelsus.</hi> 14. Tartar of Wine totally differs from any coagulated recrement in diseases. 15. A second lapse of <hi>Paracelsus.</hi> 16. Why Tartar is not incrustated on the Lees, in the bottom of a vessel. 17. Wines distinguisht by their Tartar. 18. Tartar neither Wine, nor the dregs of Wine. 19. Why an Alcale, or Lixival Salt, extracted from Wine, or Tartar, does dissolve Tartar. 20. The dregs of Wine, in some part the material of Tartar. 21. How ill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance holds 'twixt Tartar, and coagulations in the Microcosm. 22. Tartar to be referred to coagulated Salts, not to Stones, or excrements.</p>

The <hi>Cantabi</hi> (now <hi>Biscons)</hi> natives of a Province in <hi>Spain,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> before their conversation with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> in a voyage for the fishing of Whales, being on the coasts of <hi>Groenland</hi> (which Modern Travellers conceive lost) among the vast Quicksands, called <hi>Atalayae,</hi> surprised by intense cold, had their decocted Wines, of themselves generous and excellent, frozen to Ice. Instructed by this exigent, they beat off their hoops from their vessels, and exposed, to the open aër, the naked conglaciated Wines; with design, that the residue of Liquor might be totally frozen: This accordingly succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they boared the Ice, and at the Centre of it found a clear, transparent Liquor, of the colour of an Amethyst, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pure spirit of Wine, a fiery and vital essence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of conglaciation. This discovery taught them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; for they drank the Ice, melted at the fire, restoring to it a small quantity of this essential vital Nectar. The story is introduced for this end, that hence it may be observed, <hi>That the spirit of Wine, by a natural tendency, flies from cold, as from his proper enemy; and gently withdraws itself, from its former mansion, into the Centre of the Wine.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Wines are therefore exposed to the heat of the Sun, that they may grow Acide, and the spirit exhaling, leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it a flat, cadaverous substance, devoid of spirit and life, which is Vineger. But since it is far more noble and useful, that the spirit of Wine should retreat into the Centre, then perish by exhalation, therefore hath necessity, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Wines, hinted the invention of cold, deep Cellers. The <hi>Austrian</hi> Wines still operating on themselves by an uncessant, tumultuous heat of <hi>Fermentation,</hi> are, for the most part, gross and viscid. For which reason, the Cellers at <hi>Vienna</hi> are ordinarily digged to no less then a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>undred foot in depth. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Wines also, would suffer the same restless ebullition, and conflict betwixt their <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneities,</hi> were they not prevented by the admixture of a Lime, which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> calls <hi>Hiesco,</hi> at the very instant of their flowing from the Wine Press. Whence results it a clear and unquestionable truth, that the spirit of Wine, in cold <note place="margin">2.</note> Cellers, retreating from its adversary, cold, returns to the


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47802:87"/>
heart of the Liquor, as to a safe refuge, and there conceals it self. Wine, therefore, in the cortex, or outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of it self, is less generous, as having fewer spirits, then in the middle, or inmost retiring room. Hence it is a <note place="margin">3.</note> necessary consequent, that as, by reason of the exhalation of spirits, Wines set in the Sun, grow acide, and phlegmatick; so also, proportionably, the exterior <hi>Cortex</hi> of Wine in a cold Celler, must be more acide, then the Centrals. And thus, when the musts of Wines are freshly brought in from <note place="margin">4.</note> the Press, lodged in Store-houses, and have suffered <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> the spirit by and by flying from cold, concentres it self; and therefore the superficies of Wine, having already entred some degree of <hi>Acidity,</hi> immediately begins to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on the dregs, floating on the yet troubled and unclarified mass of Liquor. For an absolute impossibility it is, that there can be any the least Acidity; which having once met with a proportionate object, does not immediately begin to operate on it. This really <hi>is the Law, and unavoidable necessity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals.</hi> By example. Vineger, how flat and weak soever, having once touched upon the stone concreted in the head of a Creafish, vulgarly (but erroneously) called Crabs eye, can by no means contain it self, but must immediately act, to the dissolution of it, and resolve it into a clear, diaphanous Liquor. The Acidity of Wine, having once sated it self on the dregs, and spent much of its activity, by degrees, inclines <note place="margin">5.</note> it self to coagulation. But coagulate it cannot, without a conspiracy with, and assistance from the Fracid Odor of the vessel, impregnate with a spirit, or power of <hi>Fermentation;</hi> whereby it may, in some measure, admit of putrefaction. And for this onely reason, is the Coagulation made at the sides of the vessel, to which it affixes it self; according to that familiar <hi>Chymick Axiome: Omnis spiritus dissolvens, eddem actione quâ corpora dissolvit, coagulatur: Every dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent spirit is it self coagulated, in the same action, wherein it dissolves other concreted bodies.</hi> The more acide Wine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the extremities of it self, dissolves the dregs; and <note place="margin">6.</note> at the same instant, the acide dissolvent spirit is coagulated, together with the newly dissolved faeces, and soon applies it


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47802:88"/>
self to the neerest side, or concave of the vessel. And this, lest both (the dissolvent and dissolved) might not be hindred from coagulating; but on one side, at least, they might not be invironed by Liquor: And thus, by this progress and succession of natural motions, there is affixed a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction <note place="margin">7.</note> of Coagulation, <hi>Tartar.</hi> Observe also, that before the compleat act of Coagulation, there is no existent <hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum;</hi> and therefore the acide spirit in the verge of the mass of Wine, having newly dissolved the dregs, in a moment, before the act of coagulation finisht, seazes on the vessel, and by a Cement, or glue, native and proper to it self, there fixes, and constantly adheres. Otherwise depressed by gravity, it would immediately sink to the bottom. And this new <hi>Entity,</hi> thus coagulated, is the <hi>Tartar of Wine;</hi> of which our Discourse.</p>
            <p>That these are sober, solid truths, we have clear and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable <note place="margin">8.</note> evidence from Vineger it self. For Wine insolated to a calefaction of the vessel, may produce Tartar; but Vineger never. And yet Wine and Vineger are one and the same matter, differing onely in those qualifications, heat and cold; in the former, indeed, with Tartar, in the latter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>From the premisses, there breaks forth a considerable truth; that our forementioned <hi>Axiome,</hi> by <hi>Chymicks</hi> concluded of <note place="margin">9.</note> eternal verity, grosly fails in that it makes the dissolution of any concreted body, to be done in the instant of time, and numerical action, with the coagulation of the spirit dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. For if there intervened not, in some short interval of time, a diversity, and succession of motions, the Coagulation could not soder it self to the circumambient planks of the vessel, as is there affused by liquefaction; but would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, if it were coagulated at the instant of dissolution, sink down to the lowest region, in the form of a simple coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not cement it self to the walls of the hogshead. But on the other side, in the bottom, the peculiar region of the Lees, there is never found any Tartar. Here also accurs to our serious consideration, a second and more weighty verity: <note place="margin">10.</note> that the Analogy, or resemblance, which the vulgarity of


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47802:88"/>
Physicians conceives, betwixt the <hi>Tartar</hi> in Wine, and those preter-natural <hi>Coagulations</hi> in the <hi>body of man,</hi> is erroneous, vain, and altogether impertinent; and therefore the name, history, manner and end of Coagulation of Tartar in Wine, are foolishly and unfitly accommodated to the causes of diseases. All which I shall demonstrate to ample satisfaction, when I come to discover that grand and popular delusion of the <hi>Existence of Tartar in our meat and drink.</hi> Allowing to Wine onely a fertility of <hi>Tartar.</hi> For that we acknowledg to be no Alien, no son of an exotick mother, from the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of forein principles, intruded into Wine, having its production contrary to, or besides the ordinary and simple nature of Wines: neither owing its original to the adjuncts of the primitive <hi>Malediction</hi> delivered in Paradise, by divine providence, for the expiation of those Crimes committed by man, in the heat and distraction of Wine. Again, neither is the Tartar of Wine ever coagulated by any originary activity, or power of coagulation, proper to its own nature (though <hi>Paracelsus</hi> dreamt so:) but then undergoes Coagmentation, when the circumferential Acidity of the Wine, hath newly exhausted much of its Energy, and wasted it self, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse operation on the dregs. That is, the <hi>Active</hi> being swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <note place="margin">11.</note> up in the embraces of the <hi>Passive:</hi> the <hi>Acide</hi> spirit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed, and subdued to obedience, by the freshly dissolved <hi>Faeces;</hi> then, and not till then, contrives and sets about the act of <hi>Coagulation,</hi> not with design or power to make a real, true stone, but a counterfeit, such as afterwards may be again dissolved in hot water, as an <hi>Acide salt</hi> in liquor, which for that reason, the vulgar call <hi>Cremor Tartari.</hi> All which do very ill correspond with those preter-natural Coagulations in the bodies of men: and yet they are, in a drunken fiction of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> by an imaginary analogy of essence and identity with <hi>Tartar,</hi> in all meat and drink, grosly obtruded on the faith of vulgar Physicians, wholly over-run by that epidemick, lazy, evil, subscription. Here also we are fallen on a third <hi>Magnale</hi> or <hi>Violentum.</hi> That <hi>Tartar is not an excrement of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">12.</note> 
               <hi>Wine,</hi> unless on one part, which is the dregs dissolved: which truly <hi>Paracelsus</hi> was not ignorant of, who does very


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47802:89"/>
frequently extol the Medicinal faculties of <hi>Tartar,</hi> far above those of Wine it self, as inheriting many more and nobler en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. Wherefore he very absurdly refers Tartar of Wine, by an identity of essence, and formation, to the same <note place="margin">13.</note> Classis of <hi>Entities,</hi> with those solid Concretions in diseased bodies; which yet, in many other places, himself concludes to be a meer excrement, yea, the sorrowful fruit of that curse of the Earth, pronounced by God, in Paradise, <hi>Bryers and thorns shalt thou bring forth,</hi> and calls, <hi>Ens Cacedonium, in puro saphyrico ente rerum.</hi> The Tartar of Wine therefore, and that which is erected in the Schools, for the material cause, and foundation of most Chronick diseases, if any such were in reality of Entity, can keep no concord in their Original Forms, even according to the doctrine of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> himself, if we accept the former, as a preternatural production, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, by the destiny of its being, to the generating diseases, as to its proper end. And thus also, hath he most impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and at best, but by the favor of a Metaphor, reduced the <note place="margin">14.</note> causes of diseases to Tartar: Since they no way agree, either in their matter, efficient, manner, or cause of Coagulation, in the term of the Coagulatum, Object, or Originals. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gravel, nor the stone is capable of dissolution in boiling water; as the Tartar of Wine is. This usurpation therefore, of name and propriety, is wholly metaphorical, rash, and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous; and an assertion tacitely injurious to <hi>divine wisdom</hi> and <hi>providence,</hi> by polluting the purity of all sublunary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <note place="margin">15.</note> with the bold imputation of a Curse, as if in the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of their natures, they were nothing but Compositions, amassed out of the seeds of Tartar. And to so high a pitch of impudence hath this error flown, that men dare imagine Tartar in the very marrow of Animals; which yet they allow incoagulable, nor did ever <hi>Paracelsus</hi> finde any where, but in his own wilde imagination. And so the result of all is, that he falls upon a manifest contradiction, making Tartar to be no Tartar, that is uncapable of Coagulation: so that, not onely every coagulable and solid body, but also every liquid substance, that is every created nature, subject to the influence of the lower orbs, would be nothing but Tartar, by

               <hi>divine Vengeance,</hi> destined to the punishment of the first sin. No sooner hath the <hi>Must</hi> suffered <hi>Fermentation,</hi> parted with its former sweetness, and assumed the perfection and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Wine, but the whole Mass of Terrenity, the Lees, falls to the bottom of the vessel; and then begins the new made Acidity of the Wine, in the circumference, to execute its power dissolutive, on the earthly residence in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p>For the more essential portion of the Wine, the spiritual Nectar, by a gentle and gradual concentration, crowding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle, forsakes the protection of the superficial round of the Liquor: This done, and the extremity of the Wine thus destitute of Vitality and radical heat, soon grows acide, and not meeting with any fit object neer it, whereon to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge its activity, but onely the dregs in the lowest region of the Wine, immediately assaults them, and by degrees dissolves them: And thus the Acidity is both confirmed and inlarged.</p>
            <p>But since every Acidum, by reason of its corroding Energy, doth operate in a perpetual Ebullition: hence is it, that that Acidity, which had dived to the bottom, when it hath opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Lees, doth reascend from thence, and fix it self in a higher mansion, the circumstance of the vessel. And for this <note place="margin">16.</note> cause, is the generation <hi>of Tartar done, by successive, gradual, and slow motions.</hi> For the same reason also cannot Tartar be concreted and affixed to the bottom; hindered by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, and tumultuation of perpetual Ebullition. Hence is it, that rich and generous Wines, being not easily subject to <note place="margin">17.</note> this destitution of spirits, unless on an assault of intense cold, do not soon grow acide, nor yeeld any considerable quantity of Tartar.</p>
            <p>But old Rhenish Wines easily pall, grow sick, and loose their grateful and vigorous taste; in regard their activity of eagerness is, for the most part, devoured by their Lees; and yet they continue wholsom and friendly to the stomach, in that their spirits are not exhausted to an equal proportion of their dregs and acidity. But red French Wines, unless nourisht by their Lees, (which for this effect, Vintners call, the


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47802:91"/>
               <hi>Mother,</hi> or <hi>Nurse</hi> of <hi>Claret)</hi> dissolve their own Tincture, continually preying on it by their subtilty and eagerness. And this is the cause, why Claret Wines, if not very rich, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently vigorous, at the age of two yeers grow pale and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured. For the Tincture of Wines, is a substance fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly subject to separation. But strong, generous, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual red Wines, in that they more slowly grow acide, hold good to the age of many yeers. On the contrary, small White Wines, if not sequestred from their Lees, in short time, grow flat and cadaverous. For their Lees drawn off, their Acidity wanting a proportionate matter, to imploy its corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive faculty upon, the Wine continues good, sprightful, firm, and in its primitive integrity. From these experiments, we <note place="margin">18.</note> naturally collect, <hi>That Tartar,</hi> in the acception of its entire nature, <hi>is no longer either Wine, or the dregs of Wine; but a Neutral, or third Nature, resulting from the conjunction, and coëfficiency of both.</hi> That this is thus, is demonstrable from the Mechanick experiment, that a greater quantity of <hi>Tartar</hi> may be dissolved in ten ounces of Rain water, then in two hundred of Wine, though never so much stirred in boyling. The reason belongs to the Acidity of Wine to which the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar ows its Coagulation.</p>
            <p>To conclude; six ounces of the salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve seven ounces of crude <hi>Tartar;</hi> because the Lixivium, or <note place="margin">19.</note> Lee of that Salt imbibes and sucks up the Acidity of <hi>Tartar.</hi> That <hi>Tartar</hi> consists of the Lees of Wine, and not Wine one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we need no other eviction, but that experiment of Printers, <note place="margin">20.</note> who indifferently use <hi>Tartar</hi> or the <hi>Lees</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> for the Master ingredient in their Composition of Ink: the same effect arising from either, on good reason, preventing the election of either, and confessing a plain consanguinity, if not an identity of the Causes. Again, in distillation, they both belch up one and the same Acide Odor, and yeeld one and the same Oyl. Onely Tartar is not dissolved in cold water: because the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aeulent and earthy substance of the dregs does so closly environ and shroud the Salt, that the cold water is not of force sufficient, to transfix that counterscarfe, or penetrate the atomical parts of the Concretion, and by consequence, not to dissolve it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47802:91"/>
Now since <hi>Tartar</hi> hath its originary principles and nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">21.</note> no where but in Wines, grown lightly Acide, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of spirits, flying from circumstant cold, to the Centrals of the Liquor: Hence let the so much illuminated (that is infatuated) Disciples of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> be instructed, how ill the speculation of <hi>Tartar</hi> does quadrate, even with those diseases, for whose sake chiefly it was first invented and embraced. For plain it is, the stone concreted in the body of man, can never be dissolved in boyling water; as <hi>Tartar</hi> commonly is. For which consideration, <hi>Tartar</hi> is more justly to be listed in <note place="margin">22.</note> the number of Salts, or Juices coagulated by Salt, then of Stones: <hi>è diametro,</hi> contrary to the doctrine of <hi>Paracelsus.</hi>

The intellection of the minde, intellectual. 6. The intimate integrity of the minde suffereth from caduce faculties, without the passion of extinction. 7. The action of the minde scarce perceptible in us. 8. Atheists of the first Classis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the image of God, in man. 9. Atheists of the second Classis, have lately sprung up. 10. The Atheistical ignorance of such is manifested. 11. A variety of vital Lights. 12. How the minde dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from Angels. 13. An intellectual vision of the Authors. 14. All optation vain, without God. 15. The misery of the Author. 16. A vision of the soul, separate from the body. 17. That the minde hath a figure. 18. The minde an immortal substance, representing the figure of God. 19. A vulgar error, concerning the Image of God. 20. The error of such, who conceive the Image of God to be seated in the ternary of faculties. 21. The doctrine of <hi>Taulerus</hi> opposed. 22. The Image of God never yet discovered, nor positively descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, because incomprehensible. 23. The minde subject to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, onely by accident. 24. After death, is no more Memory, or Reminiscence. 25. The will was superadded to the minde, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, after its Creation. 26. In Heaven, the Will is useless and frustraneous. 27. In Heaven the Will appears no power, or Faculty: but a substantial and intellectual essence. 28. If the Minde be the Image of God, this was anciently known to <hi>Plato.</hi> 29. The definition of the Minde. 30. Reason not the Image of God. 31. The Authors opinion. 32.

That triplicity, or ternary of diverse Faculties in the


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47802:93"/>
Minde, is expressed also in every systeme, or composition of the world. 37. A more noble and exact similitude, then that of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Faculties, requisite to make out the Image of God in man. 38. The description of the Minde, rehearsed. 39. How the Minde may survey it self. 40. The original of the Imagination, constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. 41. The Minde understandeth far otherwise. 42.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Isdom</hi> begins at the Fear of God; and the <hi>Fear of God</hi> begins at the meditation of <hi>death,</hi> and eternal life. But the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> many conceive, with <note place="margin">1.</note> the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> to be the knowledg of a mans self; but I account the ultimate end of wisdom, and the Crown of the whole course of our life, <hi>Charity,</hi> which alone will faithfully accompany us, when all other things shall have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted us. And although self-cognition, in our opinion, be onely a <hi>medium</hi> to the <hi>fear of God;</hi> yet from that, must our Tractate concerning long life, assume its beginning; in this relation, that the <hi>cognition</hi> of <hi>life</hi> presupposeth the <hi>cognition</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> since the life and soul (which we have more then once intimated) are Synonymaes. Tis of Faith, that <hi>man</hi> was created, of nothing, after the Image of God, into a <note place="margin">2.</note> living Creature; and that his minde shall never perish; while, in the mean time, the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Bruits</hi> suffer annihilation, so soon as they cease to live. The weighty reasons of which difference I have declared, in my discourse of the <hi>Original of Forms.</hi> But hitherto is it not manifested, beyond dispute, wherein that similitude of Man with God, our Archtype, or prime exemplar, doth consist. For in the Soul alone, many determine this majestick Pourtraicture. I shall deliver what I conceive; yet under an humble protestation and subjection


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47802:93"/>
to the censure of the <hi>Church.</hi> Thus it is. The <hi>Original of Forms</hi> being, in some degree of comprehension, already known; it is just we make a grand enquiry concerning the <hi>Minde of Man.</hi> But, seriously, no cognition is more weighty then that, whereby the soul comprehends her self: Yea, and hardly is any more <hi>profitable;</hi> in this interest, that <hi>Faith</hi> doth establish her foundation upon the unperishable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible substance of the <hi>Soul.</hi> I have found, indeed, many demonstrations, concerning this verity, divulged in Books: but none at all <hi>propter quid,</hi> touching the Cardinal <hi>Quiddity,</hi> in relation to <hi>Atheists,</hi> denying one single, and from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity constant, Deity. <hi>Plato,</hi> insooth, hath decreed three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Atheists.</hi> (1.) <hi>A first,</hi> which beleeveth no gods at all. (2.) <hi>A second,</hi> which indeed doth admit of gods; but such as <note place="margin">3.</note> are incurious of our condition here below, and idle contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the trifling affairs of Mortals. (3.) <hi>A third,</hi> which although it beleeve, that there are gods, and such as are both knowing and observant of the smallest occurences in the World; yet imagineth them so exceeding merciful, that they are flexile, by the finger of the weakest prayer. And this kinde is most frequent among Christians, and even such, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves the most perfect in our days: and on this presumption, they dare any thing, and beleeve <hi>Religion</hi> to be no more but an engine of mature policy, to coerce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the terror of <hi>Laws,</hi> the obligation of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the penalty of Hell. For these impose heavy burthens on the shoulders of others, which themselves touch not with one of their fingers; drain the purses of their disciples, prostitute Heaven for money to dying men, and continually intrude themselves into secular affairs, in regard they opinion, that <hi>Religion</hi> cannot subsist without <hi>State-policy.</hi> My highest wish should be, that they had once, though but in a moment, tasted what it is to understand <hi>intellectually;</hi> that so they might perceive sensibly, as it were by the touch, the immortality of <note place="margin">4.</note> the Minde. I confess, I have not invented rules or a method, whereby I might be able to illustrate the intellect of another man. I protest therefore justly, that such who ever study, making disquisitions concerning truth, but can never attain


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47802:94"/>
the knowledg of it, in respect, being puffed up with Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have no <hi>Charity,</hi> do foster secret Atheism. But this one mystery I have learned, That the <hi>minde</hi> doth not at <note place="margin">5.</note> all understand by the mediation of the <hi>Phansie,</hi> nor by figures and images; unless the miserable, and afflicting discourse of Reason be annexed; but when the <hi>Soul</hi> comprehends her own nature, Reason falls off from her, and the image of her self fails her, by which she might represent her self to her self: therefore the <hi>Soul</hi> can, by no means, apprehend her self by the discourse of Reason, nor by Images. For after that I had known, that the verity of an <hi>Essence,</hi> and the verity of the <hi>Intellect</hi> were one and the same: I certainly knew that the <hi>intellect</hi> was a certain <hi>immortal Entity,</hi> far removed from all frail and perishable things. The Soul, indeed, is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; yet we firmly beleeve her to dwell within us, not to be idle, not to be weary, nor afflicted with diseases. Therefore <hi>sleep, madness,</hi> and <hi>ebriety,</hi> are not symptomes of the <hi>immortal</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>soul</hi> suffering exorbitancy; but the attendants of <hi>life</hi> and onely passions of the <hi>sensitive Faculty;</hi> since bruits also fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently endure the same passions. For just it is that the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Being</hi> owe these disturbances to her adligement to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and mortal things. For as the <hi>minde</hi> inhabiteth within us, and yet is not perceived by us: So neither are her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and uninterrupted operations subject to sensation; because if they were sensible, verily they could not have been spiritual and meerly abstracted. And although it appear to us, that we understand nothing by the total sequestration and abstraction of discourses from all things corporeal, which can fall under the comprehension of our sense, minde, and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; and that in the very beginnings of our Contemplations: yet really, the <hi>Soul</hi> doth, all that while, act by her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible way, and by an <hi>efficacy</hi> wholly <hi>spiritual:</hi> which I thus understood. The <hi>penitentiary</hi> very often doth not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perceive the effects of his contrition, and with groans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploreth <note place="margin">7.</note> that his insensility: yet being asked whether he would willingly commit a sin, would perchance answer, that he had much rather die. Insensible therefore is the operation of the soul in <hi>penitence</hi> and confession, being the supernatural


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47802:94"/>
effect of <hi>Faith:</hi> because the intellectual actions are derived from a higher principle, and are clients of a more noble and indesinent Magistracy. And on this ground <hi>Mystical Divines</hi> lay their Doctrine, That the soul doth more effectually ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and in her operations more benefit her self, in <hi>faith</hi> alone, without discourse and cogitation; then he who pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a multitude of words, and by tedious discourses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth compunction in himself. But happy he, who hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that excellent endowment, to perceive these insensile operations of the soul, and by secret emanation to reflect them upon the operations and powers of the <hi>sensitive Soul;</hi> since such frequently leave their impresses upon the whole after life, and excite the <hi>memory,</hi> in <hi>faith</hi> operating together with <hi>grace,</hi> for the future.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Libertines</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> of the first <note place="margin">8.</note> 
               <hi>Classis</hi> deride this Article of our Creed, as if the Image of God, in us were onely imaginary, and it a meer traditional fiction that man was fashioned after the similitude of the <hi>Deity.</hi> But other Atheists of the second and third sort beleeve, not onely that we are created in the Image of God; but feign also that in our nature there is an <hi>identity</hi> with the essence of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, <note place="margin">9.</note> uncreated Divinity; and that man doth differ from God in substance no otherwise, then a <hi>part</hi> doth from the <hi>whole,</hi> or that which had <hi>beginning</hi> from that which is non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principiate; but not at all in point of Essence, or internal propriety. Which besides the Blasphemy, doth comprehend very many and gross <hi>absurdities.</hi> Since whatever once <hi>began</hi> is in that very notion a Creature; and it doth tacitely involve <note place="margin">10.</note> an imperfection in God, to be able to create <hi>extra se,</hi> without the limits of his own nature, any thing in substance equal to himself: Since truly from Philosophy it is evident beyond doubt, that all <hi>the parts of an infinite are infinite,</hi> of necessity. The Creature therefore cannot be in <hi>substance</hi> more infinite, then it hath been in <hi>duration</hi> equal to its eternal principle: and much less is the Soul of man a part of the <hi>Divine</hi> substance, or essentially like unto it; which in power, magnitude, dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, glory, wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in her self, and of her self, is a meer nothing. If therefore she was not made out of God,


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47802:95"/>
much less out of her self; but out of nothing. Infinitely therefore do they wander from truth, who beleeve a <hi>quiddity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Image</hi> implanted in the <hi>Soul,</hi> by an <hi>identity of substance:</hi> when they are distinguished each from other by infinite disparity; yea, the soul would at length, of her own accord, be again resolved into that nothing, from whence she began, unless she were constantly conserved in being, by the <hi>Divine goodness.</hi> Seriously, the damned souls might wish to be resolved into their primitive nothing, which the Divine Justice doth conserve in Being. The <hi>Soul,</hi> indeed, from the minute of her creation forwards to the future, hath an eternal <hi>permanence;</hi> not from her own essence, but from her native eternity, freely conferred upon her by the <hi>bounty,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly conserved by the <hi>providence</hi> of her Maker.</p>
            <p>Suffice it therefore, that the <hi>Soul</hi> be a <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>vital substance;</hi> and a luminous Creature. And since there are many <note place="margin">11.</note> kindes and species of <hi>vital lights,</hi> this light of the minde dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from all other vital lights, in this, that it is a <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>immortal substance;</hi> but all other vital lights are not <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances Formal,</hi> though they be Forms substantial; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the Chymistry of Death, they are reduced into their ancient nothing, no otherwise then is the flame of a Tapor extinct. But the <hi>Minde</hi> differs from <hi>Angels;</hi> in respect it is framed in the similitude and representative figure of the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> 
               <note place="margin">12.</note> 
               <hi>God,</hi> for the soul hath that light and luminous substance from the gift of her Creation, since she her self is that vital light: but an <hi>Angel</hi> is not that <hi>substantial light,</hi> nor hath he any light genial and inherent to his essence, but is onely a <hi>mirror of the increated light;</hi> and so in this particular falls short of the excellence and perfection of the <hi>Divine Image.</hi> Otherwise an Angel, since he is an incorporeal spirit, were he luminous from the right of his own essence, would express the Image of God more perfectly then man. Moreover, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God doth bestow more love upon, that is more noble: but he hath loved man, much more then the Angels; for not to the redemption of the Angelical nature did he assume the figure of a <hi>Cacodaemon,</hi> as the thrice glorious <hi>Lamb</hi> of God, the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world, assumed the nature of a <hi>Servant.</hi>

Nor can this Doctrine be staggered by the opposition of that, <hi>The meanest in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater then</hi> John <hi>the Baptist:</hi> For the <hi>Son of Man</hi> is not inferior, in <hi>dignity of essence,</hi> to the <hi>Angels,</hi> though he was pleased to become a little lower then the Angels; for in the calamitous condition of his life, he was made a little lower then the Angels, as also was <hi>John</hi> the Baptist. And for this reason, an Angel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly called a <hi>ministring Spirit:</hi> but is no where read a friend of God, the Son of the Father, the delight of the Son of Man, or the Temple of the Holy Spirit, wherein the thrice glorious <hi>Trinity</hi> takes up his Mansion. For that is the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick prerogative of the <hi>Divine Image,</hi> which the <hi>Light Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> doth impress upon every man that comes into this world.</p>
            <p>In the year 1610, after a long weariness of contemplation, <note place="margin">13.</note> that I might acquire some gradual knowledg of my own <hi>minde,</hi> since I was then of opinion, that <hi>self-cognition</hi> was the complement of <hi>wisdom,</hi> faln by chance into a calm sleep, and rapt beyond the limits of reason, I seemed to be in a Hall sufficiently obscure. On my left hand was a table, and on it a fair large Vial, wherein was a small quantity of Liquor: and a voice from that Liquor spake unto me: <hi>Wilt thou Honor and Riches?</hi> At this unwonted voice, I became surprized with extream amazement. I walked up and down, seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering with my self, what this should design. By and by, on my right hand, appeared a chink in the wall, through which a light invaded my eyes with unwonted splendor: which made me wholly forgetful of the Liquor, voice, and former counsel. Then pensively returning to the Vial, I took it away with me; and attempted to taste the Liquor, but with tedious labor I opened the Vial, and assaulted with extream horror I awakened. But my ancient intense desire of knowing the nature of my soul, in which I had panted uncessantly for thirteen whole yeers together, constantly remained with me. At length, amidst the anxious afflictions of various for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, when yet I hoped a Sabbath of tranquillity from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of an innocent life transacted, in a vision I had the sight of my soul. <hi>It was a transcendent light, in the figure of a man,


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47802:96"/>
whose whole was homogeneous, actively discerning, a substance spiritual, Crystalline, and lucent by its own native splendor.</hi> But enshrined it was in a second nubilous part, as the husk or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior <hi>cortex</hi> of it self, which whether it did emit any splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from it self, I could hardly distinguish, by reason of the superlative fulgor of the <hi>Crystalline spirit</hi> inshrowded within it. Yet this I could easily discern, that there was no sexual <hi>impress,</hi> but onely in the cortex or shrine. But the mark of the Crystal was <hi>light ineffable,</hi> so reflexed, that the Crystal Image it self became incomprehensible: and that not by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or privation (since these are terms onely accommodate to our imbecillity) otherwise then this, that it presented a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestick <hi>Ens,</hi> which cannot be expressed by words; yet so fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that you could not have comprehended the quiddity of the thing beheld. And then was it revealed unto me, that this light was the same, which I had a glimpse of twenty three yeers before. And these things I saw by an <hi>intellectual vision;</hi> in my minde; for had the eye of my body once beheld this resplendent excessive object, it would for ever after have ceased from vision, and consta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ly have celebrated a blinde mans holy day. And thus my dream discovered unto me, that the beauty of the humane Soul doth far transcend all conception of thought. At that instant I comprehended thus much, that my long desire of seeing my soul was vain and fruitless; and thereupon I did acquiesce. For however beautiful the <hi>Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline</hi> 
               <note place="margin">14.</note> 
               <hi>spirit</hi> did appear; yet my soul retained nothing of perfection from that vision, as at other times she was wont to do after an intellectual vision. And so I came to be instructed, that my minde, in this somnial vision, had as it were acted the part of a third person; nor was the discovery sufficiently satisfactory to compensate so earnest and insatiate a desire of exploration.</p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>Image of God impressed upon the Soul;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my slender capacity, I confess, I could never conceive <note place="margin">15.</note> any thing, whether a <hi>body,</hi> or <hi>spirit,</hi> whether in my <hi>phansie,</hi> or the most pure, and abstracted speculation of my <hi>intellect,</hi> which in the same act of meditation, did not represent some certain <hi>figure,</hi> under which it stood objected to my concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47802:96"/>
For whether I apprehended it by imagining an <hi>Idea</hi> probably correspondent to its essence, or whether by concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the <hi>intellect</hi> did transmute it self into the <hi>object</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood; still it occurred unto my thought invested in some <hi>figure.</hi> For although I could familiarly understand the minde under the notion of an incorporeal and immortal substance: yet could I not, while I meditated upon the individual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of it, consider the same devoid of all figure; yea, nor so, truly, but it would respond to the figure of a man. Since when ever the soul being sequestred doth see another <hi>Soul,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">16.</note> 
               <hi>Angel,</hi> or <hi>Cacodaemon,</hi> requisite it must be, that she perfectly know, that these are presented to her, to the end she may distinguish a <hi>Soul</hi> from an <hi>Angel,</hi> and the Soul of <hi>Peter</hi> from the Soul of <hi>Judas.</hi> Which distinction cannot be made by the sense of tasting, smelling, hearing, touching; but onely by the proper <hi>vision</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> which vision necessarily impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an <hi>alterity</hi> or difference of <hi>figure.</hi> Since an <hi>Angel</hi> is so far restrained to <hi>locality,</hi> that at once he cannot possess two different places: in that also there is included as well a <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> as a <hi>local</hi> circumscription. Thence I considered the minde of man figurated after this manner.</p>
            <p>The body of man, accepted under that distinct notion, <note place="margin">17.</note> cannot give to itself the figure of a man; and therefore hath need of an external <hi>Sculptor</hi> or <hi>Delineator,</hi> which should be secretly ambuscadoed in the material mass of the seed, and descend upon it from above. Yet this, in so much as it is of a material condition, and far below the fineness of a spiritual nature, cannot derive the plastick or conformative virtue no more from it self, then from the gross mass of the body: necessary it is therefore, that there be some precedent or elder principle, which must be wholly and purely immaterial, yet real, and operative, to which may be justly attributed the power of figuration or delineation, by a sigillary impression upon the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or Regent Spirit of the <hi>Seed.</hi> The Soul of the <hi>Genitor,</hi> therefore, when it descends to visit and relieve the inferior faculties, and makes a progress to survey the Seed, in a paroxysm of carnality, doth upon the mass of seed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave and adumbrate the impress and <hi>figure of it self,</hi> (which;


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47802:97"/>
in sober truth, is the onely cause of the foecundity of seeds) and thence is that comely and magnificent structure of the Infant. Otherwise if the Soul were not figurated, but the figure of the body did arise spontaneously: a father maimed in any one member could not beget a son but maimed in the same member; in regard the body of the <hi>Generant</hi> hath lost its primitive integrity, and is become imperfect, at least in the <hi>implantate spirit</hi> of that member. If therefore the figure be impressed upon the seed; undoubtedly it must receive that image or model from some other <hi>more vital and elder principle,</hi> alien to it self. But if the soul impress that figure upon the seed, she will not counterfeit an exotick, or strange image; but accurately pourtray the similitude of her self. For by this means also Beasts, by the souls modelling of her own picture, constantly maintain their species. And although the <hi>minde</hi> of man, if we relate to its original, far transcend the Laws of <hi>Nature;</hi> yet by the same method or way, whereby it first entred the portal of Nature, was incorporated and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated to her, it is constrained to progress in traduction, and is constantly adliged to the observance of her rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions; in this respect, <hi>That the progress and end of vital generations is always univocal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor otherwise could it want many and gross absurdities, that so excellent an operation, as is the generation of man, should be performed without the consent and cooperation of the Soul. Which if it be thus, it is also of inevitable necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the foecundity be given to the seed by the Soul, by the communication of its figure, and other vital determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requisite to specification. Which verily doth not come to pass otherwise, then by the sigillation or engravement of the Soul upon the seed, whereby the matter of the seed doth obtain a requisite maturity and adumbrated figure: that at length it may acquire from the <hi>Creator</hi> the <hi>formal light</hi> of life, or soul of its species, whose similitude is expressed in the figure.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we apprehend it as matter of Faith, that our soul is a spiritual substance, that shall never know annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <note place="margin">18.</note> the fabrication of which substance out of nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47802:97"/>
to the Almighty God alone. Who since he hath vouchsafed to adopt onely the soul of man to the Image of himself: it appears also a genuine consequence, that the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense and ineffable God is also of humane figure;</hi> and that by an argument drawn <hi>à posteriori,</hi> if arguments be of any vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in this incomprehensible subject. Since the body is like wax, whereupon the impression of the image of the Soul is imprinted: but the Soul hath her image and essential per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from him, whose stamp or similitude she wears. But on consideration that the body of man doth frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">19.</note> subject to mutilation and monstrosity; hence have most Divines conceived that the glorious <hi>Image of the Deity</hi> is wholly consistent in the <hi>Rational Faculty:</hi> not at all consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the representative Divinity of man doth in a more perfect and proxime relation consist in the Soul, and so in the Body formed after the exemplary character of the Soul; nor perpending, that the <hi>Rational Faculty</hi> is but <hi>Handmaid</hi> and subservient to the <hi>Intellect,</hi> no part at all of its essence, nor adliged to it by the inseparability of union, or identity: which we have to satisfaction demonstrated in our Treatise, of the <hi>Venation of Sciences.</hi> Now if any error be in the <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the body, in the womb of the Conceptrix: that error is not adscriptive to any imperfection of the <hi>Image of God;</hi> but to the incapacity of the material principles, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal causes, invading the <hi>Plastick virtue</hi> of the seed, and perverting its exact <hi>delineation</hi> of the parts. But the more Learned number of Christians doth hold it of Faith, that the Soul doth proximly express the Image of the <hi>Trin-une God,</hi> in the <hi>univocal simplicity of her substance,</hi> and the Trinity of her Faculties, namely, the <hi>Intellect, Will,</hi> and <hi>Memory.</hi> Which analogy ever sounded, in the ears of my reason, so ridiculous <note place="margin">20.</note> and empty as an old wives dream; and improper to make good the proxime, singular, and excellent reflex of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in the Soul: since the term, <hi>Image,</hi> doth include a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> and not onely a bare parity of <hi>numbers.</hi> Again, if the Soul, in her <hi>substance,</hi> represent the thrice sacred <hi>Deity;</hi> but the <hi>Intellect, Will,</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect the <hi>Trinity of Persons:</hi> necessary it is that these three


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47802:98"/>
               <hi>faculties</hi> are not <hi>proprieties,</hi> or <hi>accidents</hi> of the Soul; but the very <hi>univocal substance</hi> of the <hi>minde;</hi> or else, that the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracture doth ill quadrate and respond to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> or prime exemplar, whose image it is beleeved to be. I consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moreover, that not onely the minde of man, but even the whole man was framed after the Image of God; and that it was a bloody absurdity to compare the persons of the <hi>Trinity</hi> to the <hi>Memory,</hi> or <hi>Will:</hi> since no <hi>person</hi> of the most <hi>Holy Godhead,</hi> can in any latitude of resemblance, represent the <hi>Will,</hi> nor the <hi>Will</hi> the <hi>Person,</hi> none the <hi>Memory,</hi> or the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> none; as also that no one, separated from the other two, can hold any analogy to the <hi>Intellect.</hi> And then, that the three faculties of the Soul are ever accepted under the notion of <hi>Accidents:</hi> but, insooth, <hi>Accidents</hi> fall short of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Image, in any neerer relation, then the naked <hi>Ternary of Qualifications,</hi> heaped together upon the substance of the Soul. In which sense, the Soul doth express the <hi>Image of God</hi> far less, then any the smallest piece of <hi>wood:</hi> which by retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade <hi>Analysis</hi> or resolution of it self into its primitive En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, holdeth forth, <hi>Sal, Sulphure,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> and not onely (as the Minde in the forementioned similitude, credited by the vulgar) three diverse <hi>proprieties,</hi> or a naked Ternary of accidents. For every Wood hath three several substances, comprised under the unity of the concretion, distinct in the supposed Essences of their principles; but concurring in the composition of the whole, they make onely the single sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Wood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taulerus</hi> hath divided the Soul, not into three faculties, but two distinct <hi>parts, viz.</hi> the <hi>inferior</hi> or <hi>outward,</hi> which by <note place="margin">21.</note> peculiarity of appellation he denominates the Soul; and the <hi>Superior</hi> or <hi>inward,</hi> which he entitleth the profundity of the Soul, or Spirit; in which he affirmeth the Image of God to be comprehended, since therein is seated the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and therefore the Devil can obtain no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess unto it. And to each of these parts he hath assigned several <hi>acts</hi> and <hi>proprieties</hi> mutually distinct each from other. But alas! this holy man expungeth <hi>that simple homogeneity</hi> of the Soul, wherein she ought principally to express the


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47802:98"/>
similitude of the <hi>Deity:</hi> or at least hath hitherto denied the Image of God to be propagated and diffused through, not onely the <hi>whole man,</hi> but even through the <hi>whole Soul.</hi> Verily, the ears of my Faith are not easily open to this Doctrine of the <hi>Duality</hi> of the immortal Soul; nor the alterity of those two parts: especially when in her essence, the Soul ought to resemble the Image of the most simple <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> I should much rather assent, that the minde of man doth carry the resemblance of the most immense Godhead, in the most simple unity, and indivisible <hi>Homogeneity of spirit, under the symbol of immortality, of indissolution, and identity, beyond all connexion or alterity.</hi> Wherefore my assertion is, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <note place="margin">22.</note> 
               <hi>Image of God</hi> is neither separate, nor separable from the Soul; but the very <hi>minde</hi> is the very <hi>Image of God,</hi> fully so intimate to the Soul, as the Soul is to her self, that is, the <hi>Image of God is the Soul of the Souls essence:</hi> and for that reason, that no sober head can conceive or express any the least analogy essential betwixt the supream increated <hi>Ens,</hi> and the soul of man; since the nature of <hi>Divinity</hi> is wholly incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and the most subtile thought can never finde any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of identity and unity with God, impressed upon the minde, whereon the similitude should be founded. Sufficient it is, that the minde is a spirit, dearly beloved of God, homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous, simple, immortal, created after the Image of the immense Deity, a single <hi>Ens,</hi> to which death can adde, and from which Death can detract nothing that is proper and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial unto it in the essence of its simplicity. And in regard the <note place="margin">23.</note> Soul, in the primitive constitution and destination of its es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is participant of <hi>beatitude:</hi> therefore is <hi>damnation</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervenient to it by accident, besides the originary decree of Creation, by reason of a succeeding defection.</p>
            <p>This Semideity, the Soul, thus nobly enriched with science, <note place="margin">24.</note> when once enfranchized from her prison, the body, doth then for ever suspend all use of <hi>memory,</hi> and no longer makes use of the tedious induction of <hi>Reminiscence,</hi> intuition of <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>duration;</hi> but being single, in that homogeneal simplicity comprehendeth all things. For which reason, should any <hi>Memory</hi> remain to the Soul, after her flight from Earth, it


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47802:99"/>
would of necessity be not onely frustraneous and useless, but burdensom: when it must eclipse her transcendent actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection. And from <hi>Reminiscence</hi> must arise the same incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; since that can never be invited into act, but by the circumambages and complex discourse of <hi>Reason;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it possesseth no room in Eternity; where in the full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of verity, without being subject to declination, defati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or defect, the soul standeth exalted far above the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Recognition.</hi> The inference is, that the Soul must be constituted in beatitude (understand, in her primitive destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) without the conjunction of the forementioned <hi>Ternary of Faculties;</hi> and so in that analogy cannot resemble the Image of the incomprehensible <hi>Deity,</hi> for the sole representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof she was created. Yea, upon a more intimate scrutiny, I do not finde the Memory to be any singular and distinct power of the Soul: but onely the bare manner of recognition. For such, who have shallow memories, to relieve this infirmity do, by the help of the <hi>imagination</hi> (Vicegerent to the <hi>intellect)</hi> contrive for themselves an artificial memory, and that far more retentive then otherwise their natural me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory could have been.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the <hi>Will</hi> also taketh an eternal farewel of the Soul in death: why, because it is not <hi>essential,</hi> but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally <note place="margin">25.</note> 
               <hi>advenient</hi> to the <hi>Soul.</hi> Since <hi>God,</hi> so soon as he had finished his Creation of man, constituted him in the absolute power of his own <hi>Free Will;</hi> which in sober truth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my apprehension, doth plainly import, that the <hi>Will</hi> is not, by any peculiar manner, <hi>essential to the Soul,</hi> from the first of her Creation: but onely annexed to her, by way of <hi>concession,</hi> or <hi>trust,</hi> as a talent to the hand of a servant; to this end, that man might have free power to choose what path best liked him, to unravel his life in. Otherwise I deny not, but in the whole scene of things, there can be no one more pernicious then a free and unregulated will, as being that onely, which introduceth all variance and discord betwixt God and man. This <hi>faculty,</hi> therefore, must be for ever exiled from the beatitude of <hi>Eternity:</hi> for the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>willing</hi> being taken away, the <hi>will</hi> it self doth also of necessity perish;


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47802:99"/>
and of what use can the power of <hi>Volition</hi> be, when there is no longer remaining any occasion to <hi>will?</hi> And on this basis the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> found their doctrine, that in Heaven the <hi>will is confirmed,</hi> or rather wholly <hi>evacuated</hi> by death: that is, the beatified Souls in Paradise, have no <hi>power</hi> to <hi>will,</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> to <hi>will,</hi> but what is conform to the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>highest;</hi> and those who are compleat in <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> retain no power of willing any thing which is not of <hi>Charity.</hi> The Will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expires, when the liberty of Volition is dissolved; and by sequel, the Will can be no <hi>essential,</hi> but <hi>temporary and caduce</hi> power of the Soul; since it cannot be of use or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to that Soul, which in the consummation of beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and highest fruition, hath suffered an utter evacuation of desire and hope: when it can no more be deduced into act, but must be a bare <hi>optation,</hi> which cannot be admitted in the <note place="margin">26.</note> state of bliss, where is a full satiety and abundant possession of all desiderable good. Sufficient let it be for us; by the power of Volition in this life, to thesaurize, or make provision for the life to come.</p>
            <p>Now after this transitory power of <hi>Volition</hi> is abolished, <note place="margin">27.</note> in the next life there springeth up, and manifesteth it self, a <hi>substantial Will,</hi> in no respect an alien to the <hi>intellect</hi> and essence of the <hi>minde;</hi> and therefore having a being absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinct from the <hi>accidental</hi> and variable <hi>Will.</hi> For as the <hi>Imagination</hi> is aliened in Phrensies, distracted in perturbations of the Animal Faculty, and eternally suspended at the disunion of the Soul and body: even so is the power of <hi>Free Will</hi> for ever abrogated by death. And thus I came to beleeve, that the Image of God in man is seated in the spiritual substance of the Soul; and not in the ternary of its Faculties. In a word, the Analogy stands thus. <hi>God is an Ens increate, single, incomprehensible, eternal, infinite, omnipotent, good, a supersub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Light and Spirit.</hi> But the <hi>Soul is a Creature, single, indivisible, dependent, immortal, simple, and from the date of her creation eternal, a substance spiritual and lucid.</hi> Finally, in <hi>God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">28.</note> there can be no <hi>accidents:</hi> but all and every one of his <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> are the very indistinct and most simple essence of the <hi>Divine Spirit:</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> his <hi>Parmenides</hi> in some measure


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47802:100"/>
understood. And so the Soul, since she is the representative of God, doth also admit no <hi>accident</hi> in her nature: but her whole substance must be a simple light, and the very intellect. For as smoak ascending from flame, is in figure and matter the same thing with flame: even so <hi>the Soul is the naked, pure, and simple intellect, and the luminous shadow of the increated light.</hi> So that as the eye doth behold nothing more truly, and more <note place="margin">29.</note> neerly then the Sun, and all other objects by the Sun: even so the beatified Soul understandeth nothing more neerly then that <hi>light,</hi> by whose eradiation she is illuminated, and upon which she doth totally and immediately depend. And as the eye of our body cannot endure to gaze upon the excessive lustre of the Sun: so cannot the Soul by intellection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the glorious <hi>Essence of God,</hi> much less while, in this vale of ignorance, she stands obliged to the obscure mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her transitory <hi>Faculties.</hi> Otherwise the intellect, eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated from the thraldom of flesh, doth by the act of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection acquire the <hi>figure</hi> of the object understood; in so much as it transformeth it self, by commigration, to that <hi>unity of Light,</hi> which penetrateth, and by penetrating invigorateth it with beatitude. And thus the Soul doth principally and primarily contemplate the immense Nature of God, in the act of <hi>intellection;</hi> and for this end was she created the true and real representative of the <hi>Divine Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who opinion the <hi>Image of God</hi> to be seated in the <hi>rational faculty</hi> of man, depend upon this Argument. The <note place="margin">30.</note> 
               <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Image of God;</hi> but this Law is engraven upon our Souls, by Reason: therefore, is the <hi>Soul the Image of God,</hi> as she is onely <hi>rational.</hi> But such consider not, that according to the intent of this Sophism, the Soul, indeed, would contain the Image of God; but yet the Soul her self would be the Law it self essentially. Which absurdity is too palpable to escape the observation of any, who shall but perpend, how much the Law and the Soul differ in the suppositionality of Essence: and that the constitution and engravement of the Law succeeded the Creation of the Soul. Verily, I abhor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical locutions in serious and abstruse subjects. As if these words, <hi>God created man in his own likeness,</hi> would


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47802:100"/>
naturally bear this onely interpretation, that <hi>God gave man the use of reason:</hi> and that such who enter this scene of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, with native <hi>idiotism,</hi> or a durable infatuation of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, about them, have forfeited their plea to this grand prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of mankinde, the <hi>Image of the immense Deity.</hi> Again, to impute the Image of God to Reason, is to prophane and blaspheme the Sacred Majesty of God, as I have amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in my discourse of the <hi>Venation of Sciences:</hi> When there is no adequation of <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> no comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a transitory and uncertain <hi>faculty,</hi> and an eternal omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient substance. But omitting the opinions of other men, I shall presume the liberty to declare my own.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Intellect</hi> hath a <hi>Will</hi> coequal, and substantially united to itself; not such as may be accounted a <hi>power</hi> or <hi>accident:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">31.</note> but the very <hi>light intellectual,</hi> a <hi>substance spiritual,</hi> an <hi>essence spiritual</hi> and <hi>indivisible,</hi> onely distinguished from the <hi>intellect</hi> by <hi>suppositionality,</hi> not <hi>reality</hi> of <hi>essence.</hi> Beside these, I finde also in the Soul a third native propriety, which in defect of a more proper appellation, I name <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>constant Desire;</hi> not of acquisition, possession, or fruition: but of <hi>Complacency:</hi> which is equally essential to the Soul with the other two, the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and the intellectual <hi>Will,</hi> and equally simple in unity of substance. Which Ternary of proprieties meet in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and indivisible substance of the Soul, and make one perfect unity. But this <hi>Love</hi> is no <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> singly; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the <hi>intellect</hi> and <hi>substantial will</hi> together, as a distinct and glorious act: for even in this life, we may love those things, which our understanding concludeth not to be amiable, and which our will adviseth us not to love: and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we love objects, that transcend the comprehension of the understanding, and will, as in an Ecstasie both the <hi>intellect,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> are suspended, and consopited, during the abstraction of the minde, for so long have they resigned their scepter to <hi>Love.</hi> Nor is this <hi>Love</hi> a <hi>passion:</hi> but an <hi>Essence</hi> dominant, and an <hi>Act</hi> glorificant. The <hi>Will</hi> therefore, and <hi>Love,</hi> of this <note place="margin">32.</note> place, hold no community at all with the sensual and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory will of man, or of flesh and blood: in regard they are essential titles, by which (in our great poverty of words) we


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47802:101"/>
endevour to demonstrate, wherein the minde of man doth represent the Image of God: forasmuch as the intellect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchised from the body doth intuitively <hi>understand, intend,</hi> and from the abyss of the minde, <hi>love God,</hi> in one entire and never-discontinued act of love, or desire of complacency, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the simplicity of her substance. But so long as we sojourn in walls of flesh, we come not so neer beatitude, as once to use our <hi>substantial</hi> and purely <hi>Intellectual intellect;</hi> but most of our obscure cognition of any Entity is derived from the information of <hi>Phansie,</hi> which, as Viceroy, usurpeth the throne of the <hi>intellect.</hi> For (as before) in an ecstatical rapture, the <hi>intellect, will,</hi> and <hi>memory</hi> keep holiday, and are as it were lost in a somnolent inactivity; the ardent act of <hi>Love</hi> onely remaining vigorous and operative: yet so distinct from the three former, that it cannot subsist without the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect,</hi> and <hi>substantial will;</hi> since, when the Soul is totally homogeneous in her substance, she would plainly lose that her absolute simplicity, if any one of the three could subsist without essential dependance on the other. <hi>Love</hi> therefore, while the other two proprieties continue bound up in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical slumber, doth as it were ascend to the superficies: or rather, in terms of neerer similitude, the other two are as it were imbibed and overwhelmed in Love. While we sojourn in the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> in this vale of misery, <hi>Love</hi> is elder then <hi>Desire;</hi> because it is a passion of the Amatory Faculty, which proceedeth from that suppositionality of the Soul (which is true love indeed) and representeth the <hi>idea</hi> or resemblance of the <hi>corporeal Faculty:</hi> and hence is it, that all the affections are, by invincible propensity, rapt on to irregularity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. But in the Citizens of <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> this Love knows no priority, or distinction from Desire: neither is it a <hi>Faculty,</hi> nor <hi>Habit,</hi> nor <hi>Act</hi> of willing, nor subsisteth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Intellect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Intellect is a formal Light, and the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Soul, whose Cognition is perfect by intuition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> 
               <note place="margin">34.</note> 
               <hi>the help of eyes, which discerneth, willeth, and desireth, in the unity of it self, whatever it comprehendeth within it self, and judgeth by volition.</hi> Nor doth it then any longer remember by


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47802:101"/>
a repetition of the species, or in age of the object once known; nor is it any more induced to the cognition of an Essence, by circumstances: but then becometh the onely and exact cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of all intelligible objects, and the intuitive aspect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it self. Yet so, that it knows one object more presentially then another, while the Intellect reflecteth it self upon the objects understood, in the distinct Unity of Verity: even as it frequently happens in the artifical Memory, where that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordative memory is no distinct act from the inductive judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the intellect. And will this not be more genial and proper to the minde, when once delivered from the tedious, turbulent, and complex way of understanding by the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Nor can the stability of these our assertions be shaken by this objection, that frequently in exorbitances of <note place="margin">35.</note> the Brain, the <hi>Memory</hi> doth perish, and yet the <hi>Judgment</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firm and sound; and on the contrary, the <hi>Judgment</hi> doth suffer impairment and desolation, and yet the <hi>Memory</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve its integrity and tenor, as many Drunkards perfectly remember all passages as well before, as in and after their Wine: in regard these are <hi>Heterogeneal Faculties of the sensitive Soul,</hi> seated in distinct provinces of the body, and subject to intension and remission according to the exact and irregular temperament of the Organs. And to <hi>inanimate Creatures</hi> also, according to our observation, there undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <note place="margin">36.</note> belongeth a kinde of imperfect and obscure cognition of their particular objects: as also a blinde sense and dull affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the most convenient and adaequate; which Creatures have, for this determinate election of their determinate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, lately acquired the name of <hi>Sympathetical:</hi> and this dark perception of the most accommodate objects, serveth them in stead of the sense of Vision, and faculty of reason. Besides this, there is also implanted in these <hi>inanimate sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Creatures</hi> a certain Virtue, or Vital endowment, of infallible valor, and energy; as to those ends ordained by the Creator. There is also a third power conferred upon Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this qualification, resulting from the conspiracy, and coefficiency of the two former: which sitteth as a silent Counsellor, and dispenseth commands to them, either to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

               </gap>eneficial, or retreat from the offensive and harmful object. In which the most blear-ey'd reason cannot but behold a certain <hi>natural sensation,</hi> or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of determinate objects: yea, and what is more, a <hi>dislike and aversation.</hi> Which <hi>Climax,</hi> or threefold degree of <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intellectual cognition,</hi> is more manifest in the most stupid sorts of <hi>Insects,</hi> as also in Fools and Mad men; who are no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the prudent scepter of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> but subordinate to the doller advisoes of <hi>sense,</hi> and conform to the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of onely <hi>visual light.</hi> And yet in these there is moreover a second power, or act of their virtues specifical and functions vital: for the onely exercise whereof they were ordained. And thirdly, there is comprehended in them a far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous act of <hi>Address</hi> or <hi>Application,</hi> and <hi>Aversation</hi> or <hi>Avoidance:</hi> which ariseth from the instinct of their Forms. All which natural proprieties do yet more powerfully declare themselves in <hi>sensitive Creatures:</hi> for to these belongeth a certain sensitive <hi>Imagination,</hi> with a gradual discourse of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure reason, which supplieth their defect of an <hi>Intellect,</hi> and is more or less resplendent and conspicuous in every single species: so that <hi>sagacity, voluntary election,</hi> and <hi>memory</hi> in such fall under the apprehension of a <hi>comparative intellect:</hi> their objects being yet changed, according to the variety of matter, propense to variations, distinctions, and singularities. Moreover, in such there is an emanative or effluxive power collaterally annexed to their virtues; whereby their Souls are more or less propense to the exercises of their element, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, and wholsom, or wilde and destructive endowments, or qualities essential. And finally, they are enriched with a native desire of <hi>complacency,</hi> of <hi>abhorrence</hi> or dislike, and of <hi>concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,</hi> immediately ensuing upon their consideration of the good or evil of the object: which power or propensity is so firmly counited to the <hi>sensitive soul,</hi> that it seems almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to observation, that any man should at once see two strange persons together, and not instantly become more affected to one then the other. And these things, which are sufficiently operative even in meerly <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>inanimate</hi> natures, of confessed efficacy in <hi>sensitive,</hi> and in both admit


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47802:102"/>
of more or less acuteness, according to the obedient or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractary predisposition of the <hi>recipient:</hi> cannot but be, for the same reason, of more clarified and sublime energy in <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, it is not the sense of our thoughts, that the <hi>Image of God</hi> in man should fall under such gross disparagement, as <note place="margin">37.</note> to be considered as dependent on any <hi>Ternary of Faculties;</hi> which naturally belongeth also to other inferior natures in this scene of the world. Because the dignity of the Image of the most glorious <hi>Jehovah</hi> is not, in any the largest latitude of Analogy, participated by any other Creature whatever: since the <hi>Divine Image</hi> is peculiarly radicated in the humane Soul, and equally proper to it with its very essence: but all other proprieties of the Soul are not of the essence of the Minde; but productions and subsequent acts. Nor can it stand with the Majesty of the <hi>Divine Image,</hi> to be desumed from so poor an original as <hi>qualities;</hi> for the proprieties and excellencies of all other created forms concur, and are as it were colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated or melted together into the essence of the Soul, by virtue of the <hi>Divine Image.</hi> But if these be accounted as <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi> and <hi>productions:</hi> that must be charged upon the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner, and customary abuse of understanding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity of the Vulgar. For in equitable truth, <note place="margin">38.</note> the minde is one single act, pure, simple, formal, homogeneous, and indivisible; in which the Image of God doth subsist proximely and essentially. So that in this Image, all faculties do not onely lay aside the nature of <hi>Attributes:</hi> but also col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and binde up their suppositionalities into an unity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct. Why, because the Soul is a certain substantial light within her self; or a substance so lucid, that in suppositiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of essence, it cannot be distinguished from the very light: and her intellect is so the light of the Minde, that the very Minde is the meer lucid intellect. And in this self-light the <note place="margin">39.</note> Minde, once uncaptived from the opacity of flesh and blood, doth wholly and intimately survey it self, and understand its own nature: and therefore hath no need either of brain or heart; in which material Organs, the substance of the Minde doth seem to stoop unto the assumption of the progeny or stock of <hi>proprieties;</hi> that is, the Soul is diffused or emissively


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47802:103"/>
expansed into several <hi>transitory Faculties.</hi> To speak more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; in the body, when the Intellect is abstracted in speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it makes use of corporeal Organs, to which it is obliged: and assumes a certain <hi>Virtue qualitative,</hi> called <hi>Imagination;</hi> which from the conjunction or society of the power <hi>phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,</hi> and concurrent splendor of the <hi>intellect,</hi> suffering some <note place="margin">40.</note> degradation in the Organs, springeth up, by a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, into the forementioned <hi>qualitative Faculty.</hi> And hence comes it to pass, that this <hi>Faculty</hi> groweth weary by long and intense Imagination, seemeth wholly vanquished by difficult, knotty, and abstruse meditation, and frequently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to dementation or madness: nay, as the observation of Physicians telleth us, with one nights pensive study, and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of thought, the hair of young heads hath put on the silver Livery of old age. But the minde, once emancipated from the pedantism of flesh and blood, is never weary with continued intellection. Moreover, the Imagination in this life is not onely subject to lassation: but from the magazine of it self hath not any <hi>intellective species,</hi> which it hath not drawn in from sensible objects. And therefore the <hi>Intellective Faculty,</hi> which concurreth and cooperateth with the <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical</hi> function of the <hi>Sensitive Soul,</hi> followeth the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or temperamental disposition of the <hi>Organ,</hi> and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary dictates of the <hi>Sensitive Life:</hi> no otherwise then in Naturals the effect followeth the weaker part of their Causes. But the Soul, whatsoever is requisite for Cognition, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, or Volition, either for one single act, or many, <note place="margin">41.</note> hath wholly from it self, and borroweth it from no other forein Causality concurrent. For the good substantial Will of a Soul advanced to beatitude, ariseth not from the object understood: but from the radical goodness of her own <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> love, which is, indeed, no proper passion of the soul, no habit, no propension, nor any quality; but a substantial act of goodness, by which the blessed Soul is <hi>substantially,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally, and homogeneally, not <hi>qualitatively</hi> good. And this prerogative it enjoyeth, because it is the <hi>Typical Image of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">42.</note> But bodies, of their own accord, perpetually fall into the attributes of forms, heterogeneity, vicissitudes, and at


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47802:103"/>
length into dissolution. Therefore <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Desire</hi> of the Minde, is no function of the <hi>Appetitive faculty:</hi> but is a part <note place="margin">43.</note> of the substantial Minde, or rather the very Minde it self, flowing from the <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> Which three are, by the hand of the Creator, married indissolubly into an eternal unity, in the purest and most absolute identity and simplicity of substance. Yet in Mortals they are separate and distinct, as well in respect of the necessity of <hi>Organs,</hi> and disparity of <hi>functions;</hi> as the collateral society and conjunctive operation of the <hi>Sensitive Soul:</hi> Since now we frequently desire those things, which the <hi>Intellect</hi> judgeth not desiderable, and the <note place="margin">44.</note> 
               <hi>Will</hi> would wish never to enjoy. But necessary it is that such things, whose operations are different, should be also different in the root of their Beings, by a manner of distinction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by each single nature is separated from others: in the <hi>Minde</hi> truly by a <hi>Suppositionality relative:</hi> in the <hi>Sensitive Soul,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>corporeal</hi> and <hi>qualitative nature.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that amorous desire of the Minde, is the radical essence <note place="margin">45.</note> of the Soul, consubstantial and coaevous to it. So though in Heaven be a satiety and perpetual fruition of all desiderable good: yet doth not this <hi>desire</hi> of the Soul therefore cease, which is a constant study of <hi>Complacency:</hi> nor doth it more infer a passion into the Minde, then <hi>Charity</hi> it self; since <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are in the Soul radically one and the same thing. Otherwise should this <hi>desire</hi> cease, and the ardor of <hi>Love</hi> suffer extinction, either a <hi>satiety</hi> or <hi>insensility</hi> of fruition would instantly spring up; which cannot consist with a state of full beatitude, and would infer discord upon the calm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant harmony of a Soul once admitted into the <hi>Chorus</hi> of Saints triumphant. And thus this <hi>Desire</hi> is the incendiary that doth both kindle and maintain the flames of interminable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation, <note place="margin">46.</note> and joyes insatiate and inextinguishible; in which consideration the Soul wears the resemblance of the <hi>Holy Ghost the Comforter.</hi> Now manifest it is, that in the Minde, the <hi>Intellect, Will,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are substantially counited: but in the sensitive Soul, their operations are distinguished, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the determinate alterity of Faculties and their Organs; when we understanding many objects, we do not


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47802:104"/>
desire, and desire many we hardly understand, and such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as our will, if let to the swinge of its own native pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity, would decline the enjoyment of; as in example, we will what we desire not, when we willingly submit to the <note place="margin">47.</note> stroke of the Executioner: and desire what our will abhors, when we call for the dismembring sawe of the Chirurgeon, and gladly embrace the horror of amputation. Whence it comes to pass, that sometimes the Will giveth laws to the desire; and on the contrary, frequently the desire usurpeth the scepter and commands the Will: So that these two Lords mutually vanquish and succeed each the other, by vicissitudes. Which Civil War must so long continue in these our walls of flesh, as the sensitive Soul draweth and engageth the Intellect, and the body draweth and engageth the sensitive Soul, into a multiplex and various ataxy or irregularity of division. And from this intestine Duello arise those absurd desires of objects impossible to be obtained, and wishes of things in the <hi>present tense,</hi> which the unalterable Grammar of <hi>Time</hi> hath made in the <hi>preterperfect,</hi> and excepted from ever being declined in the <hi>future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Desire,</hi> enshrined in the substance of the Soul, must be of the essence of the Minde: Otherwise he could not commit a sin, who looked upon a woman to lust after her, before the plenary consent of the <hi>Will.</hi> Our desires therefore are elemented and coyned in the mint of mortal and caduce faculties; which seated in the <hi>Sensitive Soul,</hi> rival the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the immortal and rational: whose objects are many times rejected by the <hi>Will</hi> as inconvenient and ungrateful. As to the manner also, the <hi>desire,</hi> in this life, operateth one way, and the <hi>Will</hi> another: and in the narrow circle of a day, sometimes the <hi>desire</hi> precedeth the <hi>Will,</hi> and anon again the <hi>Will</hi> getteth the start of the <hi>Desire,</hi> and one subdueth the other successively, that the victor may restrain and coerce something distinct from it self: and this wholly in the transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory faculties; because each ariseth from the concupiscence of the <hi>Sensitive Soul.</hi> But in the glorious denizens of Paradise, <note place="margin">48.</note> this excellent <hi>Love,</hi> or amorous <hi>Desire,</hi> feeleth a resurrection and brighter ascension, as being the luminous substance of


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47802:104"/>
the Soul: for there is nothing desired, which is not also the full object of the Will: and that is collected into an unity, as well in regard of the <hi>act,</hi> as of the <hi>substance:</hi> although <hi>Volition</hi> and <hi>Optation</hi> seem two diverse branches expansed from one root; which far transcendeth the manner and method of intellection in those, who have not yet confessed their dust.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in man is situate the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> that is the very <hi>Deity</hi> it self, by whose perpetual splendor all things are collected into the unity of verity. The <hi>Image of God</hi> therefore is primarily in the minde of man, whose very essence is no other then the very <hi>Image of God.</hi> Which Image falleth not under the comprehension of the most subtile thought, nor can be expressed by any the most significant words, in this vale of ignorance: in regard it is the mirror of the incomprehensible <hi>Divinity;</hi> and hence also is it, that the soul while immured in this cloyster of flesh, cannot reach the knowledg of her own nature, but must remain a stranger to it self.</p>
            <p>But in the Cortex or shrine of the Minde, the <hi>sensitive</hi> and <hi>vital Form,</hi> this Image of Divinity is visible by reflexion, as <note place="margin">49.</note> being relucent in the Faculties: yet suffering a great allay of splendor from the opacity of the body; because obumbrated by the cloud of brutal generation, and infected with morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and pollution by the inquination of our nature faln from its primitive purity: by reason whereof the body hath not received the Image, but at second hand borrowed onely the Figure of the Deity. But alas! the miserable Minde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved into outward darkness, as it hath divorced it self from <note place="margin">50.</note> an unity with the <hi>Light uncreate,</hi> and infringed the originary energy of this Image of Divinity: so also hath it lost the primitive light of that Image, by the bold appropriation of it as justly proper to it self by the title of merit; so that ever since the fall it can <hi>understand, will,</hi> or <hi>love</hi> no object besides it self, and in order to it self. For the damned shall arise from the dead unchanged: because their bodies, in the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shall receive their determinations from their souls, which since they appear with all their depraved affections, reflected onely on themselves, after a corporeal manner; they shall not, in the resurrection, represent the <hi>Image of God,</hi> being


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47802:105"/>
as it were suffocated within them, unless in that corporeal similitude derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> the Protoplast, by the means of generation; that is, they shall have no more of the <hi>Image of God,</hi> then what is weakly and darkly reflected in the <hi>figure</hi> of the body. Lastly, the Soul (understand onely such, as is excluded the <hi>New Jerusalem)</hi> being once faln, by the horrid Cataract of death, upon the privation of those assistant Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the Imagination, Memory, and Will; doth for ever after understand, will, and love all objects, by a blinde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, addicted onely to it self. For it knoweth its own immortality, becometh sensible of its damnation, and with secret murmurs complaineth of it, as an act of high injustice done upon it. Because all the bent and scope of its love is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to defend its excuses for sins, secretly to recriminate upon the hand of Justice, by palliating the guilt of Crimes, as if committed in the days of ignorance and innocence, with great fragility of nature, many crafty wiles and treacherous invitements of our three Adversaries, the World, Flesh, and Devil, and the defect of Grace sufficient to encounter such forcible temptations: and that an eternal punishment (as far beyond all patience to endure, as all flux of time to end) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not according to the laws of Justice be due for a momentany transgression. And at this it burneth with blasphemous rage and furious hatred against God: chiefly because it is too well ascertained, that the judgment can never be reversed by any replea of error, nor the arrest taken off by any reprieve, till the impossible period of eternity; all hopes of evading the uncessant scourge of Gods wrath being for ever cut off in despair. Thus the impossibility either of evasion or cessation being as long lived as Eternity, the Caitiff soul, plunged in a deluge of desperation that shall never know an ebbe, from the first minute of her disunion from the body, passeth into an abyss of horror; where shall be no piety, no compassion, no consolation, no relaxation, and no redemption or revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To which sad truth we may adde, that since the <hi>intellect</hi> doth naturally transform it self into the idea of the object understood (which the ancient <hi>Ethnick Philosophers</hi> well knew, and elegantly blended under the parabolical fiction of


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47802:105"/>
               <hi>Proteus)</hi> that is, into the full similitude of those cursed Devils and Spirits created for revenge, that are ever objected unto it: Hence is the Soul contiually possessed with an high hatred of God, and his blessed Army of Saints and Angels; together with desperation, malediction, damnation, and the vindictive tortures of those infernal executioners. O may the <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> upon the sole motive of his own infinite <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>clemency,</hi> vouchsafe to break those snares laid in all the paths of our life, to precipitate us into this misery, that must finde neither remedy, release, nor end.</p>
