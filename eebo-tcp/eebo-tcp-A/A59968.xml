            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY</hi> Lord Marquess of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> Earl of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> Viscount <hi>Newark,</hi> Lord <hi>Pierrepont</hi> and <hi>Manvers,</hi> and one of the Lords of his Majesties most Honourable Privy Counsel, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WIsdome is attain'd by an exact disquisition after Truth: which seem'd once so difficult an attempt, that in <hi>Greece</hi> (the then knowing part of the World) seven only were accounted to deserve the name of Wise. Such commendable researches gain'd 'em that prae-eminence; and this made them prescribe to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. They declar'd Truth (like precious Oar) bury'd in a Pit, not to be got thence, but by a long deduction of Reason; nor this Reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without Study and Learning. Now Learning is only the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating of Parts and Wit, 'till we arrive at a thorough improvement of thoughts upon things and Men.</p>
            <p>My Lord, all this being consider'd, who can lay a juster claim to this Iewel, than your Lordship? Whose mind, being animated by generous spirits, always addresses it self unto noble ends? Your inward sight (sharper than that of Eagles) can gaze upon the splendeur where Truth'sits thron'd, and discern all the finesses of Policy and Prudence. Ablessing not to be attain'd without a sagacity able to pierce into the deepest resorts of Nature, and to extricate hidden forms from the Wombs of their Causes. But these Perfections (like th' Elixir of the Phylosophers) are impossible, or very difficult to be obtain'd, without such a prosperous success as your Lordships, that has run through the round of all Sciences, with a perspica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city even to admiration. You, my Lord, (like the Eye of the World) have not only visited, but inlighten'd each Orb in the Heaven of Learning.
<pb facs="tcp:50782:3"/>
And those who hence forward shall pretend to knowledge must owe it to your Influence. Wherever you past, you left such tracks of light, as may direct the inquisitive World into the most private recesses of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Besides, 'tis as wonderful how your Lordship could arrive to this height, to these miraculous improvements! How could you break through those intangling blandishments of Fortune? Those cumbersome imployments of Honour and State? Those tediousnesses of Address, that wait on and add to the tumults of Grandeur? For Greatmen (as th' incomparable <hi>Verulam</hi> observes) have little freedome either in their times, their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or themselves. Insomuch, as prae-eminence would afford no Aitraits, nor any pretences authorize the thirstings after Greatness, unless a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do good. By such revelations of your merits and vertue, you have added lustre to your <hi>Coronet,</hi> and ennobled even <hi>Nobility</hi> it self. Vulgar Fame applauds Majesty in such choices and that <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stream</hi> runs here into the <hi>Fountain of Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our Age had been unfortunate in wanting you, as that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had been happy in injoying you, <hi>Cicero</hi> might have spar'd his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation (as he smartly worded it to <hi>Caesar</hi>) <hi>
                  <q>Quae miremur habemus, quae laudemus expectamus.</q>
               </hi> In our late Deluge of Ignorance and Rebellion, you stood up like one of <hi>Seth's Pillars,</hi> and preserv'd Letters and Loyalty to this happy Age. You were tost indeed, but not discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with the humrous successes of Fortune. You steer'd your Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and kept a steady soul amidst those storms that shipwrackt three Kingdomes. In that fatal <hi>41th.</hi> when those false <hi>Representatives of our Liberties</hi> (like Robbers) pretended to direct us into the right way, and then intrapt us into streights, to cut our Purses and our Throats: when by a horrid Conspiracy (like that of <hi>Corah</hi>) they rebell'd both against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> when (like the ingrateful <hi>Hebrews</hi>) they wanten'd after <hi>impure Loves,</hi> and worshipt false <hi>Gods</hi> of their own making; Then you, my Lord, indeavour'd with all your might to rescue us from inhumanity and rapine, and divert Iudgments from the People, like <hi>Cicero</hi> in the Conspiracy of <hi>Catiline;</hi> (and with equal <hi>Eloquence</hi>) you labour'd to save both <hi>Capitol and Common-wealth</hi> from ruin. In testimony whereof, those two incomparable Speeches of your Lordships, to the <hi>House of Peers,</hi> in Defence of the Hierarchy, will be recorded in the Temple of Fame, till Time shall be no more.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all, for tho these great Truths must eternize your Name, and advantage the next Age with glorious examples; yet to come nearer
<pb facs="tcp:50782:3"/>
home, my Lord, the present time is as much oblig'd. Your <hi>Hospitality</hi> and <hi>way of living</hi> is such, as may instruct those of your Lordships rank to restore and uphold their ancient int'rest and grandeur, too much and too long neglected. Here is Plenty without Luxury and Intemperance, Greatness without Noise and Disorder: Entertainments are here be stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both upon Mind and Body, and 'tis doubtful to which our Repasts are most oblig'd.</p>
            <p>But I'm fall'n upon a <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> where I intended a <hi>Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and in both alike presumptuous; yet it may be the more excusable in that I have sacrific'd to Duty and Truth, in acknowledging your Lordships favours and my great obligations, and in yielding a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the merits of so eminent a Person. And after my Reader is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd of all these great qualities, and hears how your Lordships pleas'd to countenance this <hi>Tragaedy;</hi> I need not fear his acceptation. You, my Lord, alone are a sufficient <hi>Theater,</hi> and your single praise more to be valu'd than the loudest <hi>Plaudite.</hi> I humbly beg, that your Lordship will vouchsafe to pardon all its falours, and accept of that devotion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I offer it, which will be an infinite honour to,</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Since this <hi>Tragedy</hi> has gain'd your approbation; I ought to shew the care I took in't. I alter'd not the <hi>Story,</hi> nor made the <hi>Guises</hi> speak, or act worse than really they did. I branded not that <hi>damn'd League</hi> with such characters as I might have done, and they deserv'd. I fited the <hi>Parts</hi> to the <hi>Persons,</hi> and kept'em as like themselves as the <hi>Story</hi> would let me. I made both the <hi>Kings Amorous, Generous and Valiant,</hi> and so indeed they were; and endeavour'd they should not suffer upon a particular <hi>Stage,</hi> when they had triumpht upon that of the World. If <hi>Grillon</hi> seem'd overbold and rough sometimes in some places, I do but keep my self to that character which <hi>Mounsieur Girard,</hi> and <hi>D'Avila</hi> (with others) have bestow'd upon him. Nay his frequent <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> was not my <note place="inline">Espernon's Life, Book <hi>4.</hi> p. 190.</note> fancy neither; For there's a <hi>Story</hi> in the Life of <hi>Espernon,</hi> enough to justifie me, and fright our <hi>Gallants</hi> from that profane humour. As for the rest, it was my aim they should not speak above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and I suited (as well as I could) their <hi>Parts</hi> to their <hi>Callings.</hi> Yet after all this, I am not ignorant that I lie open to the <hi>Critick's</hi> in transferring the main <hi>Scene</hi> from <hi>Blois</hi> to St. <hi>Clou.</hi> But had I confin'd the <hi>Story</hi> to either of those Places alone, the death of the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Guise</hi> might have been left out contrary to my original design. After all this, Sir, I crave leave to reflect a little, upon the very <hi>Rhime</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50782:4"/>All Subjects of weight, or such as most int'rest the Passions, ought (as I take it) to be exprest with a gravity and in few words. Thus the <hi>Greek and Latine Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> nay and <hi>Philosophers</hi> too, accustomed themselves to short Periods. But their <hi>Measures</hi> necessarily being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, therefore to make 'em suitable to several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>AEschilus,</hi> and next after him <hi>Sophocles,</hi> when they brought the <hi>Stage</hi> to represent the <hi>Story</hi> more naturally, by introducing <hi>Actors and Scenes,</hi> they bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of a reformation, and dispos'd their Speeches into lines of more certain <hi>Measures</hi> to make them more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>Audience.</hi> Let any man suppose a <hi>representation</hi> of some considerable length, to be perform'd in short sentences, and of unequal cadences, one cannot fancy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to be more wearisome. But when it runs in equal <hi>Measures,</hi> neither so at length to stretch the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of <hi>Discourse</hi> and Fancy, as upon a Rack, nor so short as to cramp 'em; but sizable both to the speaker and hearer, it must needs advance the satisfaction of both Parties, together with the reputation of the Poet. The <hi>Greek</hi> then and the <hi>Latine Tragedians</hi> (for I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say to those of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>) mostly wrote in measur'd Verse. For <hi>Rhime</hi> never reacht them, 'till in a barbarous Monkish Age, which became soon weary of it, as unnatural to the Ideom, and destructive of their native Elegance. But, from the earli'st dawnings of knowledge, our Bards and Druids had their <hi>Genealogies</hi> and <hi>Songs of Victory</hi> in <hi>Rhime,</hi> as not only natural, but quickning the spirit of their Language; and we have continu'd it with competent success. For I refer it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:50782:5"/>
ingenious rational person, that can write or Iudge, what briskness is infused into any fit Subject by a well ordered and an unforc'd <hi>Rhime.</hi> It is true, that one mans <hi>Prose</hi> exceeds another mans <hi>Verse;</hi> but suppose both those <hi>Talents</hi> to be equal in one and the same person, I dare say his <hi>Verse,</hi> as to sweetness and charms, will be much more agreeable than his <hi>Prose. I</hi> speak all this as to the content of the <hi>Ear and Fancy</hi> upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> I am not to answer here for bald <hi>Rhimes,</hi> that serve only to make bad sense worse, I speak of easie smooth <hi>Rhime</hi> in <hi>Verse,</hi> such as exalts <hi>Sense</hi> and makes it <hi>Rapture,</hi> nay I'm perswaded <hi>Oratory</hi> as well as <hi>Poetry,</hi> has a greater force upon our affections, when the periods contain a certain <hi>Measure,</hi> or at least when two or three of the closes have some affinity of sound. I never had it try'd (but may be 'tis worth the while to do it) whether those <hi>Orators</hi> that most please, make it not their Care to come off with a grateful Harmony in the Close. These are the Charms like those of <hi>natural Magick,</hi> that work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known either to the <hi>Speaker</hi> or <hi>Hearer,</hi> yet gain far more attention to one man than to another. This is only to offer at some proof that a <hi>Paper of verses</hi> in <hi>Rhime,</hi> where the <hi>Conceit is new,</hi> the <hi>humour Surprizing,</hi> and the <hi>Penning Elegant,</hi> must needs take more in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition then any studied <hi>Prose.</hi> And a <hi>Speech</hi> on the <hi>Stage</hi> (be its Concerns what it will) must be far more harmonious and pleasing in <hi>Rhime,</hi> and more congenial to the <hi>Soul, Miltons Paradice</hi> is a work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, strong and fanciful, but had his humour of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction soften'd it into his own sweet <hi>Rhime,</hi> what a

            <head>THE PROLOGUE Intended, and Part spoken by Mr. <hi>Hart.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>YOu're not t'expect to day the modists sport,</l>
            <l>Affronting either City, or the Court.</l>
            <l>Our Poet's mannerly and cautious too,</l>
            <l>And neither will abuse himself or you.</l>
            <l>Faith both are needless; since they're done each day,</l>
            <l>By you who judge, and he who writes a Play.</l>
            <l>The sacred thirst for Bayes and Fame is gone,</l>
            <l>And Poetry now turns Extortion.</l>
            <l>Nay worse, Stage-Poetry seduces more</l>
            <l>Than Wine, or Women ever did before.</l>
            <l>Gain'd by its Charms, hither the Wits resort;</l>
            <l>The Stage robs both the Pulpit and the Court.</l>
            <l>The other Sex too are stark rhiming mad,</l>
            <l>Ev'n from the Lady to the Chamber Maid.</l>
            <l>Nor do these Charms in the North Country fail,</l>
            <l>But took our Poet both from Hounds and Ale.</l>
            <l>His Scenes, such as they are, in <hi>France</hi> are laid;</l>
            <l>Where you may see the ancient <hi>English</hi> Trade;</l>
            <l>Either in beating <hi>France,</hi> or giving aid.</l>
            <l>Such vertue reign'd then in our Smiles or frowns,</l>
            <l>Those did defend, as these could conquer Crowns.</l>
            <l>These Miracles were in <hi>Eliza's</hi> reign</l>
            <l>Whose left hand <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> did sustain,</l>
            <l>And whose right hand both baffled <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whilst <hi>England</hi> only could the World subdue;</l>
            <l>Nay found a new one out, and reign'd there too;</l>
            <l>Iudge then what now <hi>Great Britanny</hi> may do!</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:50782:6"/>Since now her Helm a greater Prince does guide;</l>
            <l>Who has th' advantage of his Sex beside.</l>
            <l>Tho here our Poet rather would make known</l>
            <l>His country's reputation, than his own:</l>
            <l>Yet he may chance by Criticks to be hist,</l>
            <l>As he intrencht upon the Casuist.</l>
            <l>But he no Controversies sets on foot;</l>
            <l>And thinks't were better if none else would do't.</l>
            <l>Nor tells you which Religion he is on;</l>
            <l>May be (like some of you) he is of none.</l>
            <l>If this prove true — He must the Statesman move:</l>
            <l>Then for the Ladies he has Scenes of Love.</l>
            <l>And here, Gallants are fighting Scenes for you:</l>
            <l>Nay here is Huffing for you Hectors too.</l>
            <l>What the Pox, Gentlemen, would you have more?</l>
            <l>Y'are cloy'd sure with the Atheist and the Whore.</l>

                     <l>Thrice fifty years ago, one <hi>Gyles-de-Raiz.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>(<hi>Marshal of France</hi>) my great Grand-father was.</l>
                     <l>'T was he who first, with Necromantick art,</l>
                     <l>Taught <hi>Ioan of Orleans</hi> to act her Part.</l>

                     <l>No mortal force else could have made 'em yield.</l>
                     <l>'T was he (as by my bloody Roll appears)</l>
                     <l>Who hir'd two Spirits for two Hundred years.</l>
                     <l>One is an <hi>Astral Spirit</hi> mild and fair,</l>
                     <l>Imbody'd in our shape with thicken'd air.</l>
                     <l>His vesture cut out of a morning Cloud,</l>
                     <l>When with the peeping Sun-beams first it glow'd.</l>
                     <l>He only good foretels, and prosp'rous things,</l>
                     <l>The fate of Heroes and renowned Kings.</l>

                     <l>Deep in the Center; yet my call does know;</l>
                     <l>Then rises like a Damp, till th' Air it meet.</l>
                     <l>Which to a gloomy form condenses it.</l>
                     <l>This only blood foretels, and wicked things,</l>
                     <l>The fate of Rebels and unprosp'rous Kings.</l>
                     <l>But what I can do, You shall quickly try</l>
                     <l>— What ever you espy —</l>
                     <l>Stir not, nor speak, nor fear, whilst I am by.</l>
                     <stage>He muses and mutters.</stage>
                     <l>Last night I did my thoughts intentive keep</l>
                     <l>'Till midnight; when Heav'ns Eyes were all asleep.</l>
                     <l>The World was husht in slumbers: In deep Caves</l>
                     <l>No breath of Winds, nor murmur from the Waves.</l>
                     <l>Iust then when Ghosts their dismal haunt pursue,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Oberon</hi> invites his <hi>Fairy Crew,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>(Like <hi>Cleopatra</hi>) to sip Pearls in Dew.</l>
                     <l>I at that time Musick aloft did hear,</l>
                     <l>Which made me know my Astral Spirit near.</l>
                     <l>It in few minutes at my Call appear'd;</l>
                     <l>And soon as my Commands were heard—</l>

                     <l>Shot down to search the Caverns of the Deep.</l>

                     <l>AFter I had your Orders last night,</l>

            <head>THE EPILOGUE. Intended to be spoken by a Woman.</head>
            <l>TIs very hard, whilst <hi>Fortune</hi> was our Foe,</l>
            <l>You should dissert us for her being so.</l>
            <l>We were your <hi>Fav'rites;</hi> and none before</l>
            <l>Lost that preferment, by their own being <hi>poor.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Small cause, that you should with that <hi>Whore</hi> conspire,</l>
            <l>To send us <hi>Famine,</hi> 'cause she sent us <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>Scenes,</hi> compos'd of Oyl and porous Firr,</l>
            <l>Added to th' ruine of the <hi>Theater.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And 'twas a judgement in the Poets Phrase,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Plays and Play-house</hi> perisht by a blaze</l>
            <l>Caus'd by those <hi>gaudy Scenes,</hi> that spoil <hi>good Plays.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But why for this should we forsaken be?</l>
            <l>It was our House, alas, was <hi>burnt;</hi> not we.</l>
            <l>And yet from hence might some suspition come,</l>
            <l>Since it first kindled in our <hi>lowest Room;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The <hi>Fire</hi> did seize on all both <hi>Brick and Wood;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But we more lucky were in <hi>Flesh and Blood.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>If we be poor, what then! We're honest tho;</l>
            <l>And that's the thing, we fear, that loses you.</l>
            <l>'Tis not our faults, if our Estates be low,</l>
            <l>But 'twill be yours, if we continue so.</l>
            <l>— Faith, let us both amend —</l>
