         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BOOKSELLER
TO THE
Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have had theſe few Sheets
ſo long by me, that the Author
(who is a Gentleman of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
and Worth) has ev'n almoſt
forgot them, and left it to me to
recommend them to the publick;
though indeed they may very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a welcome from you, without
the compliment of an uſhering Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104349:3"/>
Upon the Credit of the Author,
and ſome ingenious Perſons who
have viewed this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> I dare
be bold to ſay, That he who is
willing to be improved by Reading,
ſhall find ſo much contracted in this
little <hi>Manual,</hi> as by ordinary
Reflection and Application, may
be extended to the ſeveral Uſes and
Qualities of his Life, if he intend to
ſpend it in Vertue, and expects Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
from his Actions; and to
ſuch onely Counſel is to be given and
Reward propoſed. <hi>Prudence</hi> (in
general) I am told, like Truth,
conſiſts in a ſingle and individual
point (and that is in doing always
what is beſt to be done) though the
kinds of it may be various, according
as the matter to which it is applied
<pb facs="tcp:104349:3"/>
is diverſified by the circumſtances of
Times, Places and Perſons; for there
are indeed, many who would be
thought prudent, that often take very
different Methods in purſuing one
and the ſame Deſign; becauſe reaſon,
which ought to be their Guide, either
out of Weakneſs miſtakes the way,
or by Prejudice, Intereſt, or other
deluding Conſiderations, is diverted
into By-Paths: And therefore it is
neceſſary that <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>
do carry the Light, elſe <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
it ſelf may err and miſlead
Men in the dark; as being often
ſwayed by prevailing Paſſions, and
forced forward by Pride, Whimſey,
Prejudice, and all the Regards that
influence the Frailties of Man: Nay
Knavery and Cunning paſs ſometime
<pb facs="tcp:104349:4"/>
for Prudence, and true Wiſdom for
Sillineſs and Simplicity; but the
Succeſs does in ſome Mens minds,
determine the Nature of an Action;
yet he that Acts with moſt Sincerity
and Uprightneſs, according to the
beſt meaſures he can attain to, if he
be not the moſt prudent in the eſteem
of the World, he is certainly the
honeſteſt Man; and Honeſty is the
greateſt Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>It's upon this Principle alone,
that the Author has founded the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Sections, and diſcourſed of
many things (for no man can
treat of every thing) ſo ſuccinctly,
and with ſo much ſententious perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,
that he who carries this little
book about him in his Pocket, and
being willing to learn, opens it at a
<pb facs="tcp:104349:4"/>
venture, when he has nothing elſe
to do; ſhall I dare affirm ſhut it
again with ſatisfaction, and if he
meet not with ſomething in it at a
ſuperficial glance, which may give
him hints as to his Conduct; yet he
will certainly find that his patience
hath not been baited with tedious
and magiſterial Documents.</p>
            <p>For thoſe who are Vertuously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
but think themſelves wiſe
enough already (as there are many
who do ſo) this little Treatiſe, if it
do them no good, it will certainly do
them no harm, nevertheleſs it is no
preſumption to adviſe ſuch not too
haſtily to leave off Trade; ſeeing,
though their Stock may at preſent
ſeem ſufficient, yet many Caſualties
of Loſſes and Times, may bring them
<pb facs="tcp:104349:5"/>
to want a new ſupply; and let them
think on the ſaying of the old Poet.</p>
            <p>—Semper tibi pendeat hamus,
Quo minime modis gurgite,
piſcis erit.</p>
            <p>For ſuch as are of an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and humble mind, this little
Book (as I have ſaid) cannot miſs
of being an uſeful <hi>Vade-Mecum,</hi>
becauſe it gives pertinent tho general
Directions for the conduct of moſt
part of any Mans Life, the Actions
of whom are not onely the ſubject of
the <hi>Manual,</hi> but of all the Ethicks
and large Volumns of Morality that
have been written ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

And believe it, a good

Theatre: The leſs the occaſion of
Sin, the greater is the Nature
of it: And to juſtifie a Fault is a
greater Sin than to fall into it:

Wiſe Husbandmen, who when
they ſow their ground, do not
throw all their Seed in one place,
but ſcatter it; and believe me,
ſmall and common courteſies do
more oblige than great favours:
And whereas others are made poor

they will leave to love.</p>
               <p>Love is built upon the Union of
Minds, not the Bribery of Gifts;
and the more you give, the fewer

               <p>IN Buſineſs be active and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious,

Diligence alone is a fair For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

                  <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fiſher could catch no
Fiſh by his playing upon his Flute,
but was neceſſitated, to preſerve
his being, to caſt his Nets and his
Tackling into the River.</p>
               <p>And you may obſerve, That in
Heaven, the Moving Planets are of
much greater Conſideration than
thoſe that are fixt and do not ſtir
at all.</p>
               <p>If Succeſs of Buſineſs doth not
at firſt anſwer your expectation,
let no Fumes of Melancholy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
you; uſe other Expedients and
Addreſſes: For he that conſtantly
makes head againſt the Aſſaults of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104349:37"/>
Fortune, ſhall be ſure to be Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and attain his Ends.</p>
               <p>Every Thing hath two Handles,
if the one proves hot and not to
be touched, you may take the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is more temperate.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, in doing Buſineſs
apply your Thoughts and Mind
ſeriouſly to it, but be not too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor paſſionately ingage your
Affections in it; nor promiſe your
ſelf Succeſs: By this means you
will have your Underſtanding
clear, and not be diſturbed if you
miſcarry; which you muſt make
account will often happen to you.</p>
               <p>When a Buſineſs may turn to
diſadvantage, it will be your
Wiſdom to temporize and delay,
and get what time you can by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring;
becauſe time may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſome accident which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the danger.</p>
               <p>But if it be for your advantage,
Delays are dangerous, and you
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104349:38"/>
muſt act with ſecrecy and celerity,
which are the two Wheels, upon
which all great Actions move.</p>
               <p>The Nobleſt Deſigns are like a
Myne, if diſcovered, prove ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
               <p>And to ſpend that time in a grave
gaze on Buſineſs, which might
ſerve for a ſpeedy Diſpatch of it, is
to imitate that Muſician, who ſpent
ſo much time in the Tuning his
Inſtrument, that he had none left
to exerciſe his Muſick.</p>
               <p>If the Matter you undertake be
doubtful, warrant your own Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
but keep no Office of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
to warrant the Succeſs:
Remember the Italian makes it part
of the Character of an Engliſhman,
when he is to undertake any thing,
preſently he ſaith <hi>I'll warrant you,</hi> but
when he miſſeth of his Undertaking,
he ſaith, <hi>Who would have thought it?</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:104349:38"/>
However uſe Circumſpection in
all your Actions, for he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
what he doth is moſt likely
to do what he intends: Half doing
in any thing, is worſe than no doing;
and a middle courſe in caſe of Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
of all is the worſt.</p>
               <p>It was Excellent Advice of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Caeſar, Non omittere caput rerum,
neque te in caſum dare:</hi> Follow ſafe
Courſes by Reaſon rather than
happy by Chance.</p>
               <p>Yet ſome things muſt be ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and many things which exceed
the Prudence of Man, are often by
Fortune diſpoſed to the beſt.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, That he who will
commit nothing to Fortune, nor
undertake any Enterprize, whoſe
Event appeareth not Infallible, may
eſcape many Dangers by his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Conduct, but will fail of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Succeſſes by his unactive Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104349:39"/>
All that a Wiſe Man therefore
can do, is to attempt with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

ſupport intervening Accidents with
Patience.</p>

               <p>IT will be great Prudence in

Hopes, any thing that is future ſeems
beſt.</p>
               <p>In management of Affairs ſtand
not upon niceties and punctilioes
of Honour, but by fair Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
gain your ends: Heat and

Keep Formality above Board,
but Prudence and Wiſdom under
Deck; for nothing will give a
greater ſtop or remora to your
Affairs, than to be eſteemed Wiſe
by them with whom you are to
Deal; it will beget Jealouſies in
them, and your Wiſdom will be
but as an Alarm to them never
to come unprovided, when they
have any concern with you.</p>
               <p>If you are to negotiate a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with any Perſons, obſerve their
Temper, and (as far as Prudence
and Diſcretion will give leave)
comply with their Humour; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to ſpeak their Pleaſure
freely, rather than interrupt them;
provoke them to ſpeak, for they
will out of Ignorance or Inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
let fall ſomething which may
be for your advantage.</p>
               <p>Give fair Words, and make large
Promiſes, for they are the moſt
powerful Engines to work your
Ends.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104349:40"/>
Converſe with all Men as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
but if you have to do with
any Stranger, look upon him as
one that may be unjuſt (it's ſevere
but it will be your own ſafety) if
he proves otherwiſe, he doth but
fail your expectation; for believe
me (and I have found it to my coſt)
nothing will undo you more than
to rely too much upon the Honeſty
of other men.</p>
               <p>And if poſſible order your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
ſo, that he with whom you
are to deal, perform firſt, when
that is done, if you be deceived,
you may thank your ſelf.</p>
               <p>If at any time you ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

be careful, Fraud and Deceit are
always in haſte: Diffidence is the

               </p>
               <p>In all great Actions take many

When you have a preſent good

Advantage, decline it not by the
importunity of others, if you do,

               <p>If you meet with a Perſon that

he hath ſome deſign upon you; and
he either hath or doth intend to

               <p>Never put your ſelf into the

You muſt know that Honours
and Preferments are rarely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Vertue, but the Iſſue of
Pleaſure or Intereſt: Is it not
ſtrange to obſerve a Perſon raiſed
to the Dignity of a Conſtable of
<hi>France,</hi> for having taught Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
to fly at Sparrows.</p>
               <p>To what Grandeur do you think
ſuch another Perſon as <hi>Domitian,</hi> if
he had lived in that Princes time,
would have advanced himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
who was ſo excellent at catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Flies? But let Honour be
your Merit, not your Expectation;
and attain to Preferment, not by
Winding Stairs but by the Scale
of your own Vertues: If you miſs
of it, you muſt be content; there
is a Reward for all things but for
Vertue.</p>
               <p>And it's ſometimes a greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to fail of the Reward of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
than to receive it; the glory

and Vertue out of it ſelf, can find
no Retribution worthy of her.</p>

               <p>I can eaſily believe, That <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocleſian</hi>

the Trade of a Gardiner in

of <hi>Rome;</hi> for when <hi>Maximianus
Herculius</hi> went to him to reſume
the Empire (which he had with
much felicity governed for twenty
years) he returned this Anſwer,
<hi>That if he would come unto</hi> Salona,
<hi>and obſerve the rare Productions of
Nature, and ſee how well the Coleworts
which he had planted with his own

never trouble his Head with Crowns,

               </p>

This made <hi>Scipio,</hi> after he had

               <p>Thoſe who have been bad, their

been their ruin.</p>
               <p>If they have been fortunate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
they have been undone at

               <p>But if it be your Fortune to riſe
and become a Favourite to a great
Perſon, as you may have ſome
hopes in <hi>Eutopia;</hi> for I have heard
Men are advanced there for their

               <p>You muſt underſtand there are
many Doors which open to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,

               <p>Therefore be ſure to ſtudy well

               <p>For Great Perſons accompt them

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104349:50"/>
and to deal truly with you, the
life of thoſe who wait upon great
Perſons is nothing but the Art of
Fencing. He that on the right or
left hit their Humour, win and
partake of their Bounty, but not
he that uſeth much Skill.</p>
               <p>Therefore as Princes have Arts
to govern Kingdoms, ſo Favourites
muſt have Arts by which they muſt
govern their Prince.</p>
               <p>Deſire not to monopolize his
Ear, for his Miſadventures will

well done, will be aſcribed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Too great Services will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights

Merit to which Reward may eaſily
reach, doth ever beſt.</p>
               <p>To ſtudy the Humour of a Prince
may for the preſent advance, but
to underſtand the Intereſt of his

            <head>Sententiae Stellares,
OR
Maximes of Prudence
To be obſerved by
ARTISONS of STATE.</head>
            <p>1. THat Government is beſt
tempered, where a few
drams of fear are blended
with the Peoples love.</p>
            <p>2. It is the intereſt of Princes
to make Acts of Grace, peculiarly
their own; becauſe they which
have commonly the Art to pleaſe
the People, have commonly the
power to raiſe them.</p>
            <p>3. He who putteth off his Hat to
the People, giveth his Head to the
Prince; for the immoderate Favour
of the Multitude, as it can do a
Man no good, ſo it will undo ſo
many as ſhall truſt to it. It was
ſaid of the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> that he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104349:61"/>
was grown ſo popular, that he was
too dangerous for the times, and the
times for him.</p>
            <p>4. He that gives a Prince Counſel
by his deſires, ſets Intereſt which
cannot err, by Paſſions which may.</p>
            <p>5. It may ſometimes be the Intereſt
of a Prince, not only to remove
Grievances, by doing what is deſired,
but even Jealouſies by doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is not expected: For
when a Prince does more than his
People looks for, he gives them
reaſon to believe that he is not
ſorry for doing that they deſired.</p>
            <p>6. In popular Tumults many
times nothing is more ſafe than ſpeed,
and greater advantages accrew by
Expedition than Delays; for while
ſome are in fear, ſome in doubt,
others ignorant, all may be reduced
to the limits of Obedience; and Fury
when the firſt blaſt is ſpent, turns
commonly to Fear; and thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which are the Heads of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104349:62"/>
whom the People honour and
admire at firſt, are at laſt plentifully
repayed with ſcorn and contempt.</p>
            <p>7. When a Prince ſeeks the love
of his Subjects, he ſhall find in them
enough of fear; but where he ſeeks
their fear he loſes their love.</p>
            <p>8. Denial from Princes muſt be
ſupplied with gratious uſage, that
though they cure not the Sore, yet
they may abate the Senſe of it;
but beſt it is that all Favours come
directly from themſelves, Denials
and things of bitterneſs from their
Miniſters. Therefore if a Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
not to anſwer a Requeſt, the
leaſt offenſive way is, not to uſe
direct Denial, but by delays prolong
the time; and ſo in place of effect,
afford good expectation. <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth of <hi>France</hi> was ſo courteous,
that when he would not anſwer a
Petitioner, he always ſo obliged him
with ſome good word, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
went away ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:104349:62"/>
9. The more a Prince weakneth
himſelf by giving, the poorer he
is of Friends.</p>
            <p>10. Equal Authority with the
ſame power, is ever fatal to all
great Actions; and therefore one
wiſe General having but a thouſand
Men, is more to be feared than
twenty of equal Authority; for they
are commonly of divers Humours,
and judging diverſly, do rarely what
is to be done: And loſe time before
Reſolutions can be taken.</p>
            <p>11. Reward and Puniſhment
juſtly laid, do ballance Government,
but it much concerns a Prince, the
hand to be equal that holds the Scale;
therefore if any Subject doth deſerve
never ſo highly of his Prince, if he
becomes afterwards a Malefactor,
he muſt be made an example of
Juſtice, without regard of his former
Merit. <hi>Manlius Capitolinus,</hi> though
by Valour he had delivered the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol
of <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> who
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104349:63"/>
beleaguered it; yet afterwards
growing ſeditious, was thrown
down from the Capitol, which by
his great Renown he had formerly
delivered.</p>
            <p>12. That Prince which ſcrues up
the Pins of Power too high, will
break the Strings of the Common-wealth.
Wiſe Princes make uſe of
their Prerogative, as God Almighty
doth of his Omipotency, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
occaſions.</p>
            <p>13. The Prince is the Pilot of the
Common-wealth, the Laws are his
Compaſs.</p>
            <p>14. Reverſionary Grants of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Profit and Houour by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
are the bane and ruin of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry;
but acts of Grace and
Bounty are the golden Spur to
Vertuous and Generous Spirits.</p>
            <p>15. In Holy things he that ſtrikes
upon the Anvil of his own Brain,
is in danger to have the ſparks flie
in his face.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:104349:63"/>
16. A Kingdom is like a Ship at
Sea, whoſe Ballaſt ſhould be the
Princes Coffers; which if they be
light and empty, ſhe doth nought
but tumble up and down, nor can be
made to run a direct and ſteady
Courſe: Therefore it's the intereſt
of Princes to have a good Treaſure
againſt all Extremities; for Empty
Coffers give an ill ſound.</p>
            <p>17. That Prince, who upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Commotion of the Subject,
ruſheth preſently into Open War;
is like him who ſets his own Houſe
a fire to roſt his Eggs.</p>
            <p>18. That State which goeth out
of the Liſts of Mediocrity, paſſeth
alſo the Limits of Safety; while
<hi>Sparta</hi> kept her ſelf within thoſe
boundaries that <hi>Licurgus</hi> preſented
unto her, ſhe was both ſafe and
flouriſhing; but attempting to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
her Territories by new acquiſts
of other Cities in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi>
ſhe every day declined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:104349:64"/>
19. Rather than the leaſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſhall fall upon the State, it's
prudence, ſometimes to preſerve
the Honour of the Publique, to caſt
the Male Adminiſtration upon ſome
Favorite or Councellor, and offer
him a Sacrifice to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth laid the loſs
and diſhonour he received in the
invaſion of <hi>France,</hi> by way of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi>
to <hi>Anthony de Leva.</hi> The
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> to cover the Diſhonour
they received in their attempt againſt
<hi>England</hi> in Eighty Eight, caſt it
upon the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in his not
joyning with them in convenient
time. So did <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth of
<hi>France,</hi> upon the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> in
his Deſign of Invading <hi>England,</hi> as
many Wiſe Princes and States had
formerly done.</p>
            <p>21. Reputation abroad, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
at home, are the Pillars of
Safety and Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>22. Taxes which the Soveraign
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104349:64"/>
Levies from the Subject, are as
Vapors which the Sun exhales from
the Earth, and doth return them
again in fruitful Showers.</p>
            <p>23. Too great a City in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is like a bad Spleen in the Body
Natural, which ſwells ſo big as
makes all other parts of the Body
lean; therefore ſome ſober perſons
have conceived that it's more Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to have three Cities of equal
Power, that in Caſe one ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
the other too might Ballance
or give Law to the Third. A great
City is the fitteſt Engine to turn an
Old Monarchy, into a New
Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>24. That State which doth not
Subſiſt in Fidelity, can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long in Potency.</p>
            <p>25. Wiſe Princes muſt ſometimes
deal with Mutinous Subjects, as the
Sun did to take away the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
Cloak, not as the ruffling
Winds, to blow him down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104349:65"/>
26. There is nothing which doth
more impoveriſh a Prince, than Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſts
of Mony at great uſance, for
thereby a Prince is brought to one of
theſe two Extremities, either to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
his Dominions and Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whereof the <hi>French</hi> Kings are
Examples, or elſe to play Bankrupt,
and pay none, as King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>
hath done to the Merchants of <hi>Genoa,
Florence, Ausburgh,</hi> and almoſt to all
the Banks in Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>27. Tumults may be raiſed by
Men of little Courage, but muſt be
maintained by Hazard, and ended
with the Loſs of the moſt Valiant.</p>
            <p>28. In Popular Tumults it's ſafer
for a Prince with ſome yielding, to
condeſcend to Peace, than by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon high Points of Honour,
to Hazard the Iſſue of a Battle,
wherein the King cannot win with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his weakning, nor loſe without
danger of his undoing. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.
of <hi>France</hi> was a ſad and mournful
inſtance hereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:104349:65"/>
29. When any miſchief grows
in a State, and becomes formidable,
it's many times more Prudence to
temporize with it, than by force
to attempt the redreſs of it: For
they who go about to quench it,
kindle it the more, and ſuddenly
plucks down that miſchief upon
their Heads, which was then but
feared from them: By Courting or
diſſembling the miſchief, if it doth
not remove the evil, at leaſt it's put
off for a longer time.</p>
            <p>30. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth (even he
who was Surnamed the Wiſe) of
<hi>France,</hi> at ſuch time as he was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in <hi>France,</hi> his Father at that
time being a Priſoner in <hi>England,</hi>
by evil Counſel of ſome, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in matters of State, at once
ſuſpended all the Officers of <hi>France,</hi>
of whom he ſuppreſſed the greateſt
part, appointing Fifty Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for the hearing ſuch Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as ſhould be laid againſt them
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104349:66"/>
for Extortation and Bribery by them
committed; whereupon all <hi>France</hi>
was in ſuch a Tumult (by reaſon
of the great number of ſuch as were
Male-contents) as that ſhortly after,
for Remedy thereof, he by Decree
in the High Court of Parliament in
<hi>Paris,</hi> was forced to abrogate the
former Law.</p>
            <p>31. It's a noble Ambition, and
abſolutely neceſſary for a Prince, to
believe none of his Subjects more
worthy than himſelf, nor more fit
to govern; when he hath not this
good opinion of himſelf, he ſuffers
himſelf to be governed by others,
whom he believes more fit than
himſelf: and by this means falls
into many infelicities. This was
the unhappineſs of <hi>Philip</hi> the
Third of <hi>Spain,</hi> though a Prince of
eminent parts, yet ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be governed by the Duke
of <hi>Lerma,</hi> he became of ſo little
eſteem with his People, and had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104349:66"/>
no ways to free himſelf from thoſe
Indignities which were caſt upon
him, but by becoming a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and a Cardinal.</p>
            <p>32. A Wiſe Prince, when he is
obliged to make War, ought to
make it powerful and ſhort; and
at firſt to aſtoniſh his Enemies
with formidable Preparations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by this means it returns to
good Husbandry; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
made through fear of
Arms, reacheth farther than thoſe
made by the Arms themſelves.</p>
            <p>33. Puniſhment and Reward are
the two Pillars where on all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
are built; the former ſerves
for reſtraining of vile Spirits, the
latter for the encouragement of the
generous: The one ſerves inſtead of
a Bridle the other of a Spur.</p>
            <p>34. The love of the Subject is
the moſt ſure Baſis of the Princes
Greatneſs; and Princes are more
ſecure and better defended by the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104349:67"/>
love of the People, than by many
Troops and Legions. Every Wiſe
Prince muſt ſuppoſe that times of
Trouble may come, and then will
be neceſſitated to uſe the ſervice of
Men diverſly qualified; therefore
his care and ſtudy muſt be in the
mean time ſo to entertain them,
that when thoſe ſtorms ariſe, he
may reſt aſſured to command them:
For whoſoever perſwades himſelf
by preſent Benefits to gain the good
will of Men, when Perils are at
hand, ſhall be deceived.</p>
            <p>35. It's not ſafe for a Prince to
commit his Secrets to his greateſt
Favourite, for if he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
will give, the Prince is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
betrayed.</p>
            <p>36. It concerns a Prince to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his beſt Friends within a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and convenient Greatneſs, as
to weaken and depreſs his greateſt
Enemies.</p>
            <p>37. Forreign Succours are moſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104349:67"/>
dangerous, and therefore it muſt be
the laſt reſolve of every wiſe State;
for they are ſeldom gotten out but
by the undoing that State which
received them; or elſe, as moſt
commonly it happens out, they
make themſelves Maſters of it.</p>
            <p>38. In all Diſtempers in a State,
<hi>Pilae Aureae,</hi> are the beſt Phyſick;
for they ever work ſafely.</p>
            <p>39. Thoſe People which by
Arms do endeavour to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from Oppreſſion, do many
times change the Tyrant, but not
the Tyranny; and after a Rebellion
is ſuppreſſed, the King is more
King, and the Subject more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>40. The chief Wiſdom and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of a Prince, is to know well
to enjoy the Soveraignty of his
Power, with the Liberty of his
Subjects: Love, Fear, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
are the three Ligaments
which tie the Hearts of the Subjects
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104349:68"/>
to their Soveraign: Let the Prince
have the firſt in height, the ſecond
in good meaſure: And of the laſt ſo
much as he can.</p>
            <p>41. That State which doth affect
Grandeur, or the Preſervation of
its Intereſt, muſt be bold and
daring; in the mean there is no
ſafety: And thoſe attempts which
begin with danger, for the moſt
part are crowned with Glory, and
end in Honour.</p>
            <p>42. That State which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it ſelf in Puiſſance, muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Diviſions, to which States are
ſubject; and where People are
Factious and apt to Diviſions, it's
Prudence to ſoften them with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
for where they are ſubtile
and proud, they muſt be made
voluptuous, ſo their Wit and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
will hurt the leſs. It's ſome
ſecurity that a Faction is deboſhed,
for it's not ſafe to ſuffer ſober Men
to come to undo the Common-wealth.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104349:68"/>
As in a Tempeſt each
Wave ſtriving to be higheſt, rides
upon the Neck of that which haſted
to the Shore before it, and is it
ſelf ſuppreſſed by a following: So
it happens in a Civil Tempeſt of
the Common-wealth, each Party
ſtrive to ſuppreſs the other, till a
third undiſcerned aſſaults and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the Conqueror.</p>
            <p>43. When a Nation is at War
within it ſelf, it's not ſafe for any
State or Prince to attempt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion
of it, for it will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
them.</p>
            <p>44. Whatſoever a Prince doth,
it's to be preſumed that it was done
with great Reaſon: If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
any thing, every one is
bound to believe that he hath
good reaſon to command the ſame;
his Actions are manifeſt, but his
Thoughts are ſecret. It's our Duty
to tollerate the one, and not to
murmur againſt the other; for the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104349:69"/>
Books of Kings are written in dark
Characters, which few can unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;
and their Actions like deep
Rivers, whereof we ſee the courſe
of the ſtream, but know not the
ſource of it.</p>
            <p>45. When a State is jealous of
the Obedience and Loyalty of the
Metropolis, or Chief City in its
Dominions; the only means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
its Obedience, is to borrow
great ſums of Money of them; for
by that means they will not eaſily
break out into any Action or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Attempts, for fear of loſing
their Money. <hi>Edward</hi> the Second
of <hi>England,</hi> being deprived by his
own Subjects of his Royal Diadem,
had never been reſtored, if he had
not been indebted to the Citizens of
<hi>London,</hi> who upon his coming up to
<hi>London,</hi> purchaſed him the Favour
and Friendſhip of the greateſt part
of the City; of which being
Maſter, his Power encreaſed, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104349:69"/>
thereby became ſo ſtrong, that he
ſubdued moſt of his Enemies, and
thereby recovered his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>46. <hi>Eumenes</hi> underſtanding that
divers Noble Men ſought occaſions
to kill him, to prevent their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
againſt him, pretended that
he had need of great ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which he borrowed of them
who hated him moſt, to the end they
might give over the ſeeking of his
Death, whereby they were aſſured
to loſe all their Money.</p>
            <p>47. He who groweth great on the
ſudden, ſeldom governeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the change: Extraordinary
Favour to Men of weak or bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
doth breed Inſolency in them,
and Diſcontentment in others; two
dangerous Humours in a Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>48. Great Perſons muſt not at all
be touched, but if they be, they
muſt be made ſure from taking Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
and there is nothing more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104349:70"/>
dangerous than to bring a great
Courage to the place of Execution,
and then grant him his Pardon; for
he will always remember the Affront
and forget the Pardon.</p>
            <p>49. Sudden Reſolutions are always
dangerous, and no leſs Peril enſueth
of ſlow and doubtful delays.</p>
            <p>50. It's the Intereſt of Princes,
that their Servants fortunes ſhould
be above Temptation; for many
times new Officers to Princes, are
like freſh Flies, bite deeper than thoſe
which were chaſed away before
them.</p>
            <p>51. Princes ſtrike their Enemies
more ſmartly with the Head than
with the Hand, and are as much to
be feared for their Prudence, as for
their Valour.</p>
            <p>52. A good Magiſtrate muſt be
like the Statue of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which
had a Lance in one hand, and a
Harp in the other, that is, Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to awe on the one ſide, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104349:70"/>
Sweetneſs to oblige on the other.</p>
            <p>53. A Prince hath more reaſon to
fear Money that is ſpent, than that
which is hoarded up; becauſe it's
eaſier for Subjects to oppoſe a Prince
by Popularity, than by Arms.</p>
            <p>54. Outward Eſteem to a Great
Perſon, is a Skin to Fruit; which
though a thin Cover, yet preſerves it.</p>
            <p>55. No Man can be Merry, that
hath more than one Woman in
his Bed, more than one Faith in his
Heart.</p>
            <p>56. What wants a Soveraign
(ſays a flattering Courtier?) Truth,
ſaid a ſerious King.</p>
            <p>57. A ſound Faith is the beſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
a good Conſcience the beſt
Law, and Temperance the beſt
Phyſick.</p>
            <p>58. A good Magiſtrate muſt be
made up of <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Hepheſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
who muſt love the Kings Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
and his Perſon: For he that loves
not his Intereſt, hath no kindneſs
for his Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:104349:71"/>
59. He that entertains a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Deſign, puts his Head into a
Halter, and the Halter into his
Hands to whom he firſt diſcovers it.</p>
            <p>60. The diſ-eſteem of Religious
Ceremonies, argues the decay of
the Civil Government. Pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have firſt kept their People Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and thereby made them
Vertuous and United.</p>
            <p>61. Hereſies and Errors in the
Church, are rather to be ſuppreſſed
by Diſcipline, than increaſed by
Diſputations; for in many Caſes
it's Impiety to doubt, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to diſpute.</p>
            <p>62. The Riches of the People
are the Princes Safety, but their
Poverty his Calamity; for they
being Rich will not eaſily attempt
againſt the Government, For fear
of loſs; whereas being poor and
beggerly, will upon every diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
be apt to break out into Action;
for ſuch will think being poor,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104349:71"/>
that they cannot be worſe, but by
bold Attempts they may be better.</p>
            <p>63. Great Men are the firſt that
find their own Grief, and the laſt
that find their own Faults.</p>
            <p>64. Diſcontent is the greateſt weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a generous Soul, which is
always ſo intent upon its unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
that it forgets its remedies.</p>
            <p>65. There is a time when you
may ſay nothing, and a time when
you may ſay ſomething, but never
a time when you ſhould ſay all.</p>
            <p>66. Emulation amongſt Favori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
is the ſecurity of Princes.</p>
            <p>67. The Lord Chancellor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
ſaid, That he would not have
his Servants gain by his Livings or
Decrees, becauſe the firſt were
Gods, the ſecond the Kings: To
honeſt Men your places, ſaid he,
are enough, to Knaves too much.</p>
            <p>68. <hi>When a Couſin of Juſtice Sir</hi>
John Fitz-James, <hi>urged him for a
kindneſs,</hi> Come to my Houſe <hi>(ſaith the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104349:72"/>
Judg)</hi> I will deny you nothing; come to
the Kings Court and I muſt do you Juſtice.</p>
            <p>69. The two main Principles
which guide Humane Nature, are
<hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Law;</hi> by the former
we are obliged in reference to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, by the latter in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to this.</p>
            <p>70. Two things break Treaties,
Jealouſie when Princes are ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Fear when they are unfortunate.</p>
            <p>71. Inconveniences which happen
to Government, are ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
for; therefore a Prince muſt
be provided in <hi>Omnem Eventum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>72. It's ſafer for a State by Death
to extinguiſh the Power, or by
Pardon to alter the Wills of great
Offenders, than to put them to
Exile or Abjuration; therefore
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> being
adviſed to baniſh Marſhal <hi>Byron,</hi>
he ſaid, <hi>That a burning Fire-brand
caſts more Flame and Smoke out of a
Chimney, than in it.</hi>
