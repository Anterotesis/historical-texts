         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Dwelling
received a Sroke on her Back by an inviſible Hand,
which ſtruck her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at on the Ground; ſhe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up as for Dead, but after ſome time, a <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi>
being ſent for who blooded her, ſhe came
in ſome meaſure to her ſelf again, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut the greater
part of one ſide of her Body was all benumm'd,
or in a manner Dead; which occaſioned a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bending in at the Waſt, and a Lameneſs, tho'
before ſhe was very ſtraight and went very well,
and the next Day ſhe was taken with moſt ſtrange
and unaccountable Fits, occaſioned (as we then
thought) by the Fright ſhe might receive by
the Stroke on the Back. Theſe Fits ſhe had by
Intervals ſeveral Weeks, in which ſpace of Time
many Doctors (as well as my ſelf) came to ſee her,
and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve her Comfortable things to take; but at
the ſame time declared they never were with any
Patient that had ſuch Fits before. After this, <hi>viz.</hi>
at the end of the 6 Weeks, and about 9 Weeks
ſince, this Maiden, as ſhe was riſing in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and out of her wonted Fits, ſhe was taken
Speechleſs, only ſhe could make an odd ſort of
a Noiſe, and her Tongue, which always in her
Fits uſed to hang out of her Mouth, like a Calf
below her Chin, was now contracted and drawn
almoſt into her Throat: I perſwaded her Aunt to
let me put my Hand into her Mouth, which ſhe
permitted, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndeavoured to move her Tongue,
but it was ſo fixed, that I could not: A pretty
while before this, ſhe being at a Neighbours
Houſe, rocking a Child in the Cradle, while the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38304:3"/>
good Woman was gone a little way, (as ſhe after
declared when ſhe came to her Speech) a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
all in Black opened the Door and came in, and
after ſpeaking many kind Words to her, threw
down a Bag of Gold and Silver, as ſhe thought,
and pour'd the Mony about the Room, and told
her ſhe ſhould have that, and fine Suits of Head-Cloths,
and very high Top-knots if ſhe would
be his, and let him take ſome Blood out of her
Arm; after which, ſhe ſtanding all in Amaze, the
black Gentleman took down a Knife from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-tree
in order, as ſhe thought, to cut her Arm,
upon which ſhe made all the Cry and Noiſe that
poſſible ſhe could, upon which the Miſtriſs of
the Houſe and ſome other of the Neighbours
came in, but upon their appearance the black Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
or Devil immediately Vaniſhed, and ſhe
made to them all the Signs and Tokens ſhe could
at that time of the occaſion of her Cry, which
they then thought was, that ſome Rogue had
attempted to Rob the Houſe; ſhe continued thus
Speechleſs untill the <hi>Thurſday</hi> after the <hi>Laſt-Faſt,</hi>
on which day about Ten in the Morning her Speech
came to her again and ſhe then ſeemed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſenſible of her former and preſent
Condition, relating as before about the Gentleman
in black, and moreover ſhe related how that he had
ſort of broad Feet like a Cow, and further, that
ſomething appear'd to her in the ſhape of an Angel
with Wings in a flaming Light, which ſhe calls the
Man of God, charging her to fear and put her truſt
in God, and not yield to that Man, who was Satan,
the Devil that thus Tempted her, for he ſought
her Soul; after which ſhe further declared many
ſtrange Things, (and yet ſeem'd very well in her
Senſes,) as it appear'd to the Men, Women, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38304:3"/>
Neighbours then preſent, who were near a Room
full, alſo her Aunt, who declares, That ſince her
Speech had been taken from her, ſhe had ſeen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtrange Viſions, and been both in Heaven and
Hell, that ſhe paſt through Hell to Heaven, and
was like to have been ſtop'd in the former, but that
a good Angel that guarded her, brought her out
of it to Heaven, that in Heaven ſhe thought her
Happineſs ſo great, that ſhe would have continued
there, but her Angel told her that ſhe could not
then, but that ſhe ſhould ſhortly really die, and
be brought thither; after which ſhe declared theſe
Words in the preſence of many, <hi>That if the People
of</hi> London, <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>did not ſpeedily repent from
their Sins, eſpecially that of Pride in Apparrel, and turn
from the Evil of their Ways, God Almighty would give
them up as a Prey to their Enemies,</hi> and this ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the Man of God gave her in charge to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
after which ſhe uttered many godly ſavory
Speeches and Expreſſions to the Perſons then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
exhorting them to Repentance, ſhe then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
that her <hi>Speech would be ſpeedily taken from
her, and that it would not be reſtored to her again till
St.</hi> Thomas<hi>'s-Day, at</hi> Chriſtmas; at which time
ſhe having her <hi>Speech,</hi> ſhould declare many more
Things; and further, <hi>That at Two a Clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
ſhe muſt go and meet the Black Man that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to her in the Neighbours Houſe afore-mentioned,
but that before that time her Speech would leave her,</hi> this
being about the Hour of Twelve, about One her
<hi>Speech</hi> left her, and then ſhe began to throttle in
her Mouth as formerly, and ſoon after, a Bible
lying near her, ſhe took it up, and opened it in the
preſence of the Company, who obſerving what
place it was ſhe opened at, they found it to be the
<hi>17th.</hi> Chapter of the Goſpel according to St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:38304:4"/>
this Chapter ſhe ſeemed to read over to her
ſelf with a buzzing Noiſe, pointing to every Verſe
and Line with her Finger; ſoon after this, Two
a Clock being come, with great Strength and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
ſhe found her ſelf or was forced out of the
Room from her Company, and went into the Yard,
as ſhe had before declared, where ſhe was ſoon
thrown to the Ground in a ſtrange manner, and her
Fits came upon her in a worſe manner than ever,
yet at the ſame time, though all the Company
went into the Yard after her, there was no Form
or Shape viſible to them, that could occaſion her
Fall. 'Tis very obſervable, and has often remarked
by the Perſons preſent, that though the Evil Spirit
in her Fits permits her to be ſomewhat quiet juſt
before any Divine comes into the Room where ſhe
is, yet as ſoon as ever they come, ſhe begins (or
the Spirit in her rather) to be troubleſome, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
falling out a Laughing, other times making
Faces at them, and when ever they go to Prayers,
or name the Name of God or Chriſt, the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
will bark in her like a Dog, or make other moſt
hedious Noiſe, and ſeem to ſpit in their Faces,
though the Maids Lips do not move, ſometimes
the Spirit will throw her from one end of the Bed
to the other, and make her tear her Shift and Bed-Cloaths
with great force and violence, that ſcarce
ſix Men can hold her in, yet ſhe has many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vales
from theſe Fits, and is at other times very
quiet: At this Inſtant of Writing, this poor
Creature continues a ſad Spectacle of humane Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
being daily viſited with great Numbers of
People, ſometimes ſhe hath lowed like a Bull,
roared like a Lion, making other ſtrange kind of
Noiſes, the Devil preſenting before her the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
Shape of a Monſtrous Fiery Dragon, other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38304:4"/>
whiles a Lyon; the Man of God pulling one way,
and the Devil another.</p>
