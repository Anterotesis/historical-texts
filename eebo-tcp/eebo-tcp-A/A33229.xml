            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And whereas, there hath been an Originallity of Power in the People, much preached up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, and your Kingdom to be Elective, whereby to uſher in, and hide from vulgar view that worſt of Acts; Wee ask you one queſtion: What Lord of a Mannor among you gives his ſervants leave to chuſe him a Steward, or to meddle with his accounts? much leſſe gives he them leave to kill his Steward, or take his place themſelves; yet thoſe two veiles have been hither unto ſufficient mask, to keep from your ſight, thoſe ugly ſins of blood and <hi>Uſurpation:</hi> You might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider you be, or ſhould be Gods Husband-men; and that he (as you) is both worthy, and will chuſe his own Deputy, that ſhall command you in your ſeverall places, and will have you

to be underlings and obey, not preach it up above, and queſtion, much leſſe kill him, or take his place: We preach a little to you, and in plaineſt language; becauſe wee ſee the fruits of your boaſted Reformation, that ſtupid blindneſſe you have contracted from the erroneous Doctrine of Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed Wolves, that have rent in ſunder your Shepheard, and will (if let alone) devour you alſo. Conſider, when your Soveraign is murthered at his own doors, for his place and fortuns, and his children turned out; how think you yours ſhall bee ſecure unto you and yours? they'l (as they have done hitherto) be ſtill ſending for part, by way of Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and borrowing the reſt by force, till you have nothing left: Do you now get a penny before-hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they do not ſtreightway ſend their Plunder maſters for? while you ſtuck unto your King, what wanted you? was your Trade ſo bad as now? were your Taxes ſo heavie? was Ship money, and a few Impoſts, equivalent to ſixty Millions, cheated and ſpent you in this ſevenyears Warre by your good Publicans? or to ninty thouſand pounds a Moneth, with Exciſe, Cuſtoms, Free quarter; ſix hundred thouſand pounds now charged upon your Kings Lands, and ſixſcore thouſand pounds upon Loan, now demanded from your City, and likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated year by year, till the King bee ſetled? Were your late Kings Offices ſo corrupt, as theſe amongſt you? yet ſay the Traytors, what need of a King, that Government is uſeleſs and chargeable: We wiſh you to take your own welfares into more ſerious conſideration: You have been oft, and long enough deluded by them to learn wit now at laſt, if God have not deſigned you for utter ruine; how often have you been promiſed a ſettlement of your Religion, and your Laws, and a preſervation of your (ſince ſlaughtred) Kings Perſon? which now (we hope) you ſee were but devices to draw you into the blood of your Kings faithfuls, and into a coldneſſe of

And by their putting the <hi>Turkiſh ALKARON</hi> to the Preſſe to be your future Common-prayer Book; a trimme Liturgy for Chriſtians: they have made you forſake your King, and now leaſt you ſhould receive his Sonne, you muſt forſake Chriſt too: And what Lawes you ſhall have we leave you to aske the Levellers who have often mett to that purpoſe, though without this Summers victory, that deſigne muſt be yet ſmothered: as ſtiffely was that againſt the King and his Crown denyed a year agoe, and a fained treaty invented to fobbe the people; yet upon the ſucceſſe of the ſecond War, ſuddenly acted: We remember you of theſe things becauſe we will let you know, that when we come we will expect from you the duty which God requires towards his deputy, appointed by a long ſeries of lawfull line to Raigne over you, which where we ſhall find ſhall not goe without reward, nor where tis wanting without due puniſhment: We will not (out of tenderneſs of the honeſt among you) becauſe of your growing ſcarcities invade your Countrey at firſt with more then a conſiderable hoſt to ballance the field Armies of the
