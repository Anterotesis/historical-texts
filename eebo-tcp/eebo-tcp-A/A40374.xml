            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LET it not divett any from a serious Perusal of what is here offered to your Grave Consideration, that you know not the Author; For here, if ever, you are called to mind what is said, not who says it: Yet I shall tell you, That I own none for my Master but Christ, none for King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> but King <hi>VVilliam:</hi> I have no Share in the Stock of <hi>Caledonia,</hi> nor probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will ever have, so that it is no worldly Interest prompts me up to make this Address, nor any Disaffection to the King or Court, but pure Conscience, if I know my own Heart.</p>
            <p>There is none who love Our Lord Jesus Christ, but must with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure Remark, how the outmost ends of the Earth are become the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Zion's</hi> King, and poor <hi>Scotland</hi> among the rest. This is Ground of Rejoycing unto Us who sat in Heathenish Darkness, that Light hath sprung up, and the day Star from on High hath visited Us! So that we may well say, few Nations have been so signally owned of God as we, with respect to a Pure and Glorious Dispensation of the Gospel: Yea of all the Churches reformed from Popery, we had attained to the greatest Hight of Conformity to the Scriptures of God, not only in Doctrin, but in Worship, Disciplin, and Government; Yea, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the various Essays of our Enemies, and false pretended Friends to enslave us, and the Faintness and Dispondencies of our weak but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Well-wishers in a dark and evil Day, yet we are alive, and have our God to Magnifie, who hath never suffered our Haters to gain the day, but gave us occasion to set up our <hi>Ebenezer:</hi> hitherto hath the Lord helped us, and to remark some places as<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.

But among the wonderful Providences of God for our Good, the late Revolution is indeed surprizing, and calls for our constant Acknowledgments: Instead of Impendent Slavery and Popery, we by it enjoy Calmness and Freedom in Church and State,

            <p>In this time of Quietness, wherein Truth and Peace met together, did several of our most Knowing Nobility and Gent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hese two evil Diseases amongst us, of <hi>Beggary</hi> and <hi>Idleness.</hi> And all who had a Love to the propogating of the Gospel, looked upon this as a most probable and hopeful Mean of Enlarging the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Accordingly the Project goes on; and maugre all the Opposition it met with at <hi>London, Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburg,</hi> Five Ships were sent out<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and Two worthy Ministers with them; who at length land in <hi>Darien,</hi> a Place inhabited by a Free People, the Circumstances and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of which, are well known, as being set out by others. Here our Countrey Men meet with good Reception, and seemed for a time to Prosper; till want of Correspondence from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it may be some hired Traitors among themselves, and Proclamations of a strange Nature, put forth in the <hi>West Indies</hi> against them, do quite Dishearten them, and force them (except a ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And whatever Sentiments some may have concerning this sad providential Stroke, yet certainly the Land is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but few are afflicted with it as becomes.

            <p>That I may the better manage this my Errand unto you.</p>
            <p>I. I shall shew you that we are all called to seek the spreading of the Gospel, and the enlargement of Christs Kingdom.</p>
            <p>II. That our Settlement at <hi>Caledonia,</hi> would be a likely mean for that end.</p>

            <p>VI. What is now our Duty and Work with respect to this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>VII. Lastly, I would earnestly plead with all to cry mightily unto God, and to use suitable Endeavours for retrieving our loss; and so shall this my well meant Address, under which no bad design is hid, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Gods Blessing.</p>
            <p>I. That we should all pray earnestly for the Enlargement of Christs Kingdom, can be doubted by none, who own the Lords Prayer to be part of the Holy Scriptures. <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> is a Petition repeated by many, but understood by few. To think that the Gospel shall be still confined to a little corner of the World as it is now, is to forget the Promises of Increa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>e and Prosperity that are made to <hi>Zion</hi> in the Old and New Testament, and which shall doubtless be accomplished in the Latter-days. We cannot mistake, in expecting the down fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, the ruine of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire, the National Conversion of the Jewes, and the fulness of the Nations; and what a Glorious time will it be, when all these things shall be fulfilled; then Holiness shall abound,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103645:4"/>
and be the Motto engraven on our smallest Enjoyments; War shall Cease throw all the Earth, Kings shall no more contend about Clods of Clay, but shall be employed in bringing their Glory to the New <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and they shall be indeed nursing Fathers to a Church. I hope these days are not far off, tho' some have too boldly pretended to know the Times and Seasons which the Father hath put in his own Power, and keept up from us, that we may pray the more Ardently; yet he who hath promised to come, will come<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and will not tarry. Christians therefore are not only called to keep up Communion with God as to their own Souls, but they ought with great Vigour to mind the case of <hi>Zion:</hi> And it is certain, That one Reason why many have ground to complain of their Souls Leanness, is, because the Churches Condition is not more minded by them, and their present Case at home, makes them forget the Afflictions of <hi>
                  <unclear>Joseph</unclear>

                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>d; Nor are they duely melted to think of the Blindness of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Delusions, and the Heathenish Idolatry. It is not said that we pray no more to have the Mountains removed which stand in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels way? Is not God the hearer of Prayer? And how many precious returns might we have at the Throne of Grace, if we were <hi>Jacob</hi>-like, wrestling the break of the Day? How did <hi>Daniel</hi> Fast and Pray, when the time drew near of the long looked for Liberty? The Promise put Life into his Prayers, and the assurance of being heard made him the more Fervent. O that God would pour out a Spirit of Prayer on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that they may set a part, Days of Humiliation and crying unto God, both for themselves and for the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were once a peculiar Treasure, but are now called, <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> that they may be Conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A new Colony of professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians might be planted there, who would own God, to be the God of that Land, and so become a Covenanted People, and would proclaim the News of Christ and set up his Worship. 2. It's hopeful, that Colony should be among the best in all the World, were once a Pious praying People sent thither. For, <hi>1st.</hi> Our Doctrine is most agreeable to the Scriptures. 2.

               <hi>3ly,</hi> This great Enterprise is now, alas! sadly born down, and seems for the present, to be almost crushed. For, 1. Our People who went thither first, are scattered, some are in Bondage among c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>West India</hi> Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against us, have disheartned our Friends, and strengthned the hands of our Ill-wishers, both upon a Religious and Civil account, especially those of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> who have shewed much Unfriendliness and Hatred. I think it is a needless Debate, whether our own Mis-managements at Home and Abroad, have been the Cause of our Disaster and Distress, or those Proclamations: I think it is very evident, that Both have concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red toward it; and that neither of the two (morally speaking) could have done it alone, tho' where the Effects of such strange, and unexpected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations might have terminated, were the Management never so exact, is what I confess few can tell. But it is evident, that both these are of the Lord, and that we ought to consider them as Reproofs for, and Punishments our Sins; and that by these Proclamations, which in some Places have been renewed again in <hi>September</hi> last, we are brought under a most heavy and discouraging Blow, since none must relieve our People, more than if they were abominable Pirates, tho they acted under the Protection, and according to the Terms of an Act of Parliament, and have not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited it: And so long as these continue in Force, what can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but the total over-throw of our Colony, since <hi>Scotland</hi> can never be able to furnish them Supplies till they get Sustentation of there own, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in such years of Scarcity as we have felt of late, wherein many at home wanted Bread. 4. As the Pope and his followers were mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed with this intended Colony; so they now no less rejoice at its present Distress; and how much Power our deadly Enemies have, is evident, and that they will employ it as far as they get Permission, and and vent their Rage and Hatred against the Reformation as much as they can.

            </p>
            <p>5. Let us then consider a little theseSins which we ought to look upon as the procuring Causes of the said Stroke we have already metwith, and which may prove yet more Afflicting, if Mercy prevent not. We ought to deal Impartially, and not spare our Sins; when God's hand is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon us, we are called to search them out narrowly, and to hide none from the Lord. 1. This Nation hath never yet been duely humbled and exercised with Sorrow and Mourning for the Sins of the Land, which have been of a deep Dye, we have been still mincing our Iniquity for fear of offending of some late Actors, without minding how God is offended with us. We have not to this day made a full and free Confession of our National Sins; amongst which, our Covenant-breaking seems to me to cry loudest, and stare us in the Face; for whatever may be said of the Politick and sinister Ends of some, in contriving and carrying on the Covenant, of their mingling and thrusting some things into it to serve a Turn of its being Calculated for these Times and Circumstances; and so in its Complex form, not so proper for the present State of things of its being a League with other two Nations who have thrown it off as such, and the like. Yet, it cannot be denyed, that in the Main, it was (as well as the National Covenant that went before it throw the Land) a most serious and awful Engagement of the Nation to Christianity and Godliness, with uplifted hands to the most High God, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most solemn piece of Reformation that ever this Church and Kingdom attained unto, and performed by the bulk of the People, with the greatest Moral Seriousness. And how can our resiling from, and shameful Breach of these awful Vows, but draw upon us dreadful Guilt and Iniquity, not to be forgotten till it be bitterly Mourned for. How much Innocent Blood hath been shed? what horrid Aversion to Purity and Holiness, and fearful Blackslidings have been found amongst us, in which our Kings, our Priests and People have been deeply involved; and yet to mention these things, renders a Man suspected of Schism: But how can we Thrive, till we be more explicite and full in Confessing, and bitterly bewailing these and all our National Sins before the Lord. 2. We are guilty of black Ingratitude to God for the late happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, for the Singularity, as well as the Greatness of that Deliverance, when we were upon the Brink of being swallowed up; nor did we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it as we ought to have done. 3. Gospel Ordinances and publick
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103645:8"/>
Worship are more dispised amongst us than any where: All People in the World do attend more reverently upon their several ways of Worship than we do upon ours. <hi>Heathans</hi> and <hi>Jews, <unclear>Mahometans</unclear>
               </hi> and <hi>Papists, Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> are at much more pains in their erronious Courses, than the professing People in <hi>Scotland</hi> are generaly upon the Service of the living and true God. Any Triffle, meer Laziness, Prejudice, Contempt Hatred, keep many of our great Ones from Gospel Ordinances: How then can God prosper us in our Undertakings? 4. Gross Injustice and Oppression, Envy, Malice, Back-biting, Self-seeking,, narrowness of Spirit, Worldly-mindedness, Lying, and Treachery, Uncharitableness and want of Brotherly Love, are our Epedemick Distempers? How then shall we think to be Blessed in our Designs, especially since all these Sins are aggravated in us, by their being against Light &amp; daily Warnings. 5. We did not seek the Lord, and plead for his Favour in a due manner, in the beginning of this great Enterprise, with serious Resolutions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Hearts and Lives. Time was, when the People of God upon such a weighty occasion, and when the Nation was setting about so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Work, would have been fervent in putting up their Suites to Heaven, and had remarkable Returns of Prayer. It was very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to see what impression and frame some Reverend Ministers of the Commission were under in Summer last, when Mr. <hi>Sheild</hi> was engaged in this Service, with what Affection, Warmness and Weight, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served how our Forefathers would have embraced and improven so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal an Opportunity of Spreading the Gospel, of bringing Honour to God, and to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and doing Good to Souls, if it had been in their offer: And what an edge was upon the Spirits of all in their Meeting at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and the solemn Day of Prayer held there, upon the account of our dear Brethren and that Interest. And it is no less discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging to observe, how far that Zeal and Fervour that then appeared, is now abated; that we have not hitherto set apart a Day of Humiliation, upon account of this sad Distress, and of Prayer for these who were sent out with so publick and solemn a Blessing from this Church; that we are now turn'd so slack and remiss, and that we began no sooner, is more formidable and threatning than all the Opposition of the Devil, the Pope, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or any other Enemy, and ought to be heartily bewailed by us, with admiration of the Goodness and Patience of God, that we are not yet worse smitten for our ill-deservings. 6. Our vain
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103645:9"/>
pride and Confidence at the beginning of this Affair, our Carnal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from it, our trusting not in God, but in an Arm of Flesh: If we had succeeded without Rubs in our way, we had burnt Incense to our own Drag, we had waxed fat, and kicked against the Lord, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness and Riches thereof, and forgotten what weak silly Creatures we are without him. 7. There may be many Sins both of Omission and Commission to be confessed and mourned for, in the management of our Expeditions, both with respect to persons imploied, and Methods followed, which I cannot undertake to condescend upon; but these ought to be searched out, acknowledged and amended. Tho ill Men may have outward success for a time; vet the Favour of God cannot be towards them. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103645:9"/>
continue in so defiled and unreformed a State, there can ever proceed from us any pure Stream, any happy Colony, or any Undertaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God?</p>
            <p>6. What is now to be done to retrieve our Loss? What is the Duty that both Ministers and People are called unto, with reference to this great Concern? I shall not here speak of Addresses to the King or Parliament; that belongs to others; no effectual Legal Course ought to be omitted. But my work is the Religious part, and our Addressing to the King of Heaven in a due manner. I think we should cry both to our King and our God: If some Men got their Will, we should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to cry unto neither: But that which I would humbly propose, is what no Christian can oppose, unless he be under a dreadful Infatuation<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 1. Let Church and State solemnly Renew their Covenant with God, to be his, and to Serve him, in opposition to the Devil, the World, and the Flesh: Whatever may be Mens various Sentiments about speculative or disputed Points; yet none can deny but it is our Duty, to embrace from our Souls, and consent unto God's Covenant of free Grace, not only as it offers to us Salvation throw Christ; but as it contains our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, regulated in his Word. Now if we are by our Baptism en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into this Covenant, and must renew it after Backsliding, or else turn Apostates and perish: Why should not the Nation do that which <hi>Israel</hi> did of old, when the Lord convinced them of their Folly and Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> I know the mixing of things Civil and Religious in Covenants, and pressing them on people, and treating the Refusers as Enemies, hath been much disliked by the Godly who were free of Faction, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our Baptismal Covenant Nationally, is what no Christian can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim. And I think all should be content to joyn in this till we be more unite in our Sentiments as to Government. I am apt to think, that a blessed change would follow upon the right and solemn managing of this most necessary and singularly useful Duty. The General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may with due deliberation draw a plain Formula, which being Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that People may gravely ponder it; a day of Fasting and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be appointed throw the Kingdom, for confessing our iniquities and lying low before the Lord in the sense of our Provocations: And the Lords day thereafter, People having been instructed by their Pastors in the nature of this Duty of yeilding themselves in a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>petual Covenant never to be forgotten, then at the close might Minister and People
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103645:10"/>
avouch the Lord to be their God with uplifted hands. If this were conscientiously gone about, I am hopeful there should be a loosing of Bonds, and somewhat of Heavenly influences Communicated to this poor withered Church and Nation, and that our Covenanted God would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse us a Token of Good. It were also desireable, that each Presbitry would keep a Day by themselves, and each Family apart (and no doubt each serious Person would follow the Example) for confessing Sin, and wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a blessing upon this Noble, but long slighted Duty, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it by the whole Nation. 2. There is great need of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day of pleading with God for his favour to the great National undertaking of settling our <hi>American</hi> Colony: I wonder how any that wish the Enlargement of Christs Kingdom, or have any Knowledge or Impression of the importance of this Design, can oppose it. Some have look't with a Squint Eye upon this Duty. And I shall touch their Objections against it. 1. They say it is a Monopoly, a few only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and why should the Nation be called to Fast and Pray upon its account. I Answer, 1. The Parliament in their Address to the King declared it their own and the whole Nation's Concern, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is; and the General Assembly had no narrow thought of it, when by their Act they appointed all the Ministers of this Church to pray for its Success: And we cannot imagine, that ever they would have refused a Solemn Fast for its distress. 2. Neither had the Commission so mean thoughts of it the last Summer, when they came to <hi>Glasgow</hi> upon its service, as doth appear from what they did there, and by the Letter they wrote to the Colony. And I heartily wish, that the leading Members of that Commission, and all others influenced by them, may think of time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and suitable Measures to prevent, or rather wipe off, the unbecoming Imputation of being Time servers, by having shewed so Universal a Zeal for the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Interest, during its seeming Prosperity; and changing their Note so meanly when they see it in Distress, and frown'd upon by the Favourers of a Foreign Interest for selfish Ends. 3. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in <hi>December</hi> last, tho they refused a Fast, for which they have their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to make to the Assembly, yet acknowledged the importance of <hi>Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> by their Letter to all the Presbyteries of this Church. And tho' they should happen to escape Censure here for a time, yet how can Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel of Christ (which is all Truth) answer before His Tribunal; for Trimming and Juggling thus, in a Case of so great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Interest is to both the Religious and Civil Concerns
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103645:10"/>
of this Nation? To refuse a Fast, to gratify the Unaccountable Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness of one Party; and to tell the other Party, who Addressed for a Fast, that tho' they did not appoint a Nominal Fast, yet they appointed a Real One, by Recommending Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is this that plain Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Singleness of Heart, which we pretend to, and preach to others?

A small part of the Kingdom in distress, will obtain a Collection from the whole, how much more should we Sympathize in this concern. 5. The gain of any one Person by bringing Wealth into the Nation, or the loss of any one by the perishing of what is exported out of the Kingdom, is the gain or loss of the Nation; much more that of so eminent a Society, must affect the whole. But, 6. Nothing but brutish Ignorance or Malice, can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain mean and diminishing Thoughts of this Noble Enterprize, which is beyond all debate, the Greatest and Worthiest that ever this Nation did attempt, and upon the Success or Miscarriage of which, so much depends, as I have already hinted, and shall not here repeat. So that this Objection deserves to be exploded, and can be made by none who have a drop of <hi>Scottish</hi> or Christian Blood. 2. Some say this would be a Fasting for Strife and Debate. But it is a grievous perverting of Scripture, thus to apply it. Shall our keeping a Fast for our Brethren in <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and to plead with the Lord for a Blessing on our Trade, and for making his Gospel more known in the World, be compared with the private Contests and Oppressions of the Quarrelsom <hi>Israelites.</hi>â? We know the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> will be offended, we cannot help that; but we are for Peace. And if the Objectors can secure themselves from

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, if there should be any Debate, or appearance of Division in this Matter, it is all upon the Objectors side, who have departed from us, and from these very Principles and Practises, which themselves but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately owned. 3. But Persons disaffected to the Government are pressing for a Fast, therefore we should not gratify them; and it is for some bad design they seek it, and not from Love to Religion. To this I answer, 1. I am far from vindicating any who have opposed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, either in Church or State. I believe there are very many bad Men both for, and against the Government, at this day: But this I would say, Let none heighten Jealousie, and invent false Stories; for God will punish even our Lying against the Wicked. 2. It is plain, these Men whom they intend, are not Fools, but Men who understand their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interest, as well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thing, because perhaps some bad Men in other respects may joyn with them in that Good. 3. Bad Men love to cry to God when their Lives or Interest are in hazard: Did not the Heathen Mariners pray when <hi>Jonah</hi> was a Sleep, and had even the Prophet himself to awaken? Why may not quick sighted Men with a Natural Conscience be Sensible of the need of Prayer? Yea, are there not Zealous and honest Ministers and Godly People, pressing for a Fast as much as they. 4. What ill Design can be under the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a Fast? Is it to overturn the Government? How then shall <hi>Caledonia</hi> stand? which is an Interest all over contrary to that which is called Jacobite or <hi>French</hi> Interest; yea, it is plainly the Interest of <hi>France</hi> to have <hi>Caledonia</hi> broken; and I know nothing more likely or proper to Unite our Interests at home, and chain them to the Government, then

               </gap> pretendedly Zealous for it, that they may carry on their bad Designs? Then I would ask, shall we give up with <hi>Caledonia</hi> altogether? No, says the Objectors, by no Means. Is not this strange? that we may still carry on this D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard to the Government, but if we pray for it, then the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in Danger. Is not this to assert, that prayerless Purposes are safest, and thrive best? But surely, if there were any ill Design in hand, one would think, that honest Men have the more need to Pray for the discovering, and the defeating of it. 5. But, if there be no bad Design, if from the very Nature of the Thing it appears there can be none; Then, are not they greatly to blame (and by their Practice bring a reproach u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Religion) who accuse Men of what they are innocent of, or surely, must be so to them, till they can give Documents of their Guilt. Truth needs no Lie to defend it, and Calumny is very inconsistent with a Gospel Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ought not we then to set about our necessary and unquestionable Duty, without siding with Factions, or amusing our selves with the Whispers and Insinuations of either Sycophantry or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: 7. The Humour of some who have opposed this Fast, seems strange, one day they Plead, we must not renew our Covenant, because the disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected will not join with us, and our Ancestors were too rash in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harshly with the Nobility and Gentry, we must be more Calm and Sober, and wait till they comply. But then they call to us to Fast and Pray for <hi>Caledonia;</hi> O, no, say these Objectors, Tho we know we should do it, yet we will not do it, because you design no Good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. How shall the Persons objected against, ever come over to the Government with us, since we will not go to God with them? It may be some will tell us, The <hi>Jews</hi> would not sing a Song of <hi>Zion</hi> when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> but they required it to sport at: He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They are highly injurious to His Majesty, who make so undutiful and false a Suggestion<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> For, 1. The King required our Prayers for himself when engaged in foreign War. 2. He hath testi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>or what the King Declares himself sory, without offending His Majesty, is to talk at a very insolent rate. 3. Wherein hath the King shewed any dis-like against us? By the <hi>West-India</hi> Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, say they. But, 1. How know they that these Proclamations were emitted by His Majesty's positive Command. 2. Do these Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations discharge us to carry on the Design of <hi>Caledonia?</hi> by no means. Since then all agree, that without reflecting on these Proclamations, we may continue our Trade: May we not also pray to God for its Help? 3. Would <hi>Darius</hi> have been ofsended at any for crying to God for <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was drawn by his Courtiers to sign that severe Decree against him, since he himself was much greived for it all Night. Then, sure our King will not be Angry with us for seeking to God, since we have the greatest reason to believe that the King bears us fatherly Afsection; and that these Proclamations were not the effect of his Inclination. 5. Some will tell us, there is a Ferment in the Nation, and we must not Fast till that be allayed. But, doth not the present Necessity, and our Brethrens distress call for it as a present and necessary Duty? Hath it not been sadly and shamefully delayed? Doth not this delay encrease the Ferment, which is not like to be removed without Fasting and Prayer? And if all shall be lost, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And how must it amaze our Brethren abroad? and discourage others from ever engaging in the like Services, that we would not Compassionat their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorou, Condition. If it be found, that a Foreign Interest, and Man-pleasing, and Pensions prevail against this Duty more than all other Objections. To this indeed I cannot answer essectually (for Silver and Gold have I none) unless we could be perswaded to take the Lord's Word for an esfectual Answer; <hi>only deal couragiously, and the Lord shall be with the Good.</hi> 3.

Let every one of us mind the Duties of our Station, and not stand accusing this or that Mistake, Error, or Miscarriage in others, as the Cause of this Distress, lest all be found to have had a hand in drawing it on. Let Ministers mind their special Work of praying and wrestling for <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and sending it Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Supplies; and let Nobility and Gentry do what is proper sor them in their Civil Stations, and not standing Idle blaming one another. 5.

Now by Good Men, I do not mean of such or such a Denomination amongst us: For tho I am as much in my Judgment for a Nationally Covenanted work of Reformation as any; yet truely I love a Good Man who differs from me in Speculations, before him who is Impious, be his Principles what they will. Yea, the better a Man's Principles be, if the Man be Bad, he is the worse Man. And sure, if due pains were taken, with a single eye to the prosperity of the Colony, good Men might be had. We all know what services <hi>Angus<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>s</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment did at <hi>Dunkel,</hi> and none denyed them to be at that time the best Regiment in <hi>Britain,</hi> perhaps in the World, for Religion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety.

            <p>7. I come in the last place, to press all to be concerned, and to act vigorously for <hi>Caledonia</hi> in Prayer, and by all other lawful Methods. You are not to expect Rheto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103645:13"/>
this must be the work of others, whose Accomplishments and Zeal are equal. It is enough for me, who can attain no more, plainly to point out a few of these Things, that may invigorat, and stir up the Nation to a due Sense of their present Duty. And, 1. To get our Coasts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by Praver, as <hi>Jabesh</hi> did, is to attain to Honour in a more eminent degree than hitherto. Let <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> the Monarchies of old, or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of late, and other modern Ravages of the Earth, enlarge their Conquests by Blood and Treachery, by Pillaging and Devastation their Names shall be Infamous for ever; but for us to get a <hi>Rehoboth</hi> by Prayer and fervent Supplica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let us then be stirred up to plead fervently for a Blessing to this great Work from Heaven's King. 2. Go on resolutely in this Affair; for the Lord hath much encouraged you in the way of his Providence to proceed. You have lawful Authority on your side, King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have given you Commission, and are bound to Protect you, as we hope they will against all Opposers. You have the Generality of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all true hearted <hi>Scots</hi> Men to stand by you, none can oppose you wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hout being Enemies to the Good of their native Countrey. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may pretend, they serve a foreign Interest: You have been born up under many Difficulties and Discouragements already; The Lord wonderfully directed and preserved the first Adventurers, and brought them safe to their desired Port, few of them, all things conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, dying by the way. They came into a Commodious place, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in many Advantages, and were asfectionatly welcomed by a Kind, Harmless, and Obliging People. In all which we see, how favourably the Lord treated us, and made plain paths before us: And it deserves a grave Remark, That whatever Distress hath since come upon our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men; yet the Lord hath hitherto kept possession for us; the Place hath never been totally abandoned, tho others would gladly have seised it for themselves. And as our just Right cannot be taken away, and the place is so impregnable, that if we were but willing, we may keep it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the World; so the Lord now invites us back, and hath kept it for us, by hindering any of our Enemies to settle there. It may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be encouraging, that however distant we are in some things from one another; yet this Interest seems to be the Center wherein we will all agree, and if followed closely, may prove a blessed Mean to remove
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103645:13"/>
different Sentiments, and unite us to God, and to one another in the way of Unity and Love. 3. All our Chastisements in this Matter are such, that we are the more to be excited by them, and not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the Lord who is trying us, to cause us trust in himself the Living God, more than in all Human Wisdom, Power, or Wealth, and drive us near to himself, by Humiliation and Reformation by searching and trying our ways, that we may turn again unto the Lord. The Removal of the two worthy Ministers was grievous, but their Names shall be precious to posterity, when others who withstand this design shall leave no good savour; their Death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The news of the Colonys Dissipation did grieve, but not overwhelm those most nearly concerned: Activity hath appeared in speedy supply and application to proper means Greater for remedy. Now when all our Troubles and Difficulties have not hitherto totally defeated us. Let us not despond, but come with penitent sorrow for our Povocations, and cry unto God for his Help and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, who can make crooked things straight, and the Mountains a plain before his People; who knows but that yet he may cause us to sing that Song <hi>Psal</hi> 66. from <hi>Ver.</hi> 8 to the close. 4. Let us be quickened to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

What have our Troubles been in comparison of what some have met with, and overcome in doing great things for their Religion and Countrey; were not our first Reformers surrounded with other sort of Dissiculties, which they Mastered by Ardent Prayers and Restless Endeavours.

Some of these suspected have shewed no great Friendship to Godliness, and therefore it is no great wonder that bad Impressions of them, do the more easily take.

The Pit they may be thinking to dig for others, under specious Pretexts, may be filled with their own Carcases; and tho he is no honest Man who shall refuse to assist and concur with them in that which is Just and Good, yet if they turn aside to perverse Ways, all honest Men will relinquish them, and they shall be Contemned in the Earth.

Causes of Fasting are heaped upon us, by Burnings at <hi>New-Edinburgh,</hi> and Burnings in <hi>Old-Edinburgh,</hi> one Judgment on the back of another, which seems to say, That it is more than high time, to lay aside our Mistakes and Jealousies, and Carnal Politicks, and take Shame to our selves, and redeem former Neglects, by doubling our Diligence in called for Duties, lest the Lord be provoked to consume us, by yet more Astonishing and Confounding Blows. And 'tis hoped, the Venerable Assembly, to whom this Dreadful Conflagration, as Trys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with their first Meeting, and Day of Prayer, hath a very Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Language, will make a Grave Remark upon it, and a Wise Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, by paying the Debt they owe to God and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Exciting the whole Kingdom to Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, First, Upon the Account of the said Rebuke given to the Land, in their Noble and Christian Undertaking Abroad: And then, Upon Account of the other Moving and Afflicting Providences we Groan under at Home.</p>
