            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Vindication of the Autority of the Civil Power in Depriving a Bishop for Political Crimes,</hi> I reserve for a particular Treatise. My Business at present is to manage the last Proposition, that advanced by the <hi>Baroccian Treatise.</hi> In Reply to these several <hi>Answers,</hi> I here present our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries with an <hi>Impartial History of the Church's Behaviour (throughout all Ages) under Bishops put into the Places of others Deposed by a Lay, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Invalid, Sentence.</hi> I grant at present, that all <hi>Lay-Deprivations</hi> are <hi>invalid.</hi> I suppose the worst in all Cases. Suppose the Deprivation was not onely <hi>uncanonical,</hi> but also <hi>unjust:</hi> Suppose the Depriver not onely
<pb facs="tcp:62950:3"/>
a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> but <hi>doubly</hi> unqualified by being likewise a <hi>Heretisk:</hi> Suppose besides, that the ejected Bishop was deprived for adhering to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and for opposing <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Heresy:</hi> Notwithstanding all this, I assert, That if he was deprived by a Power <hi>irresistible,</hi> a Submission to the present Possessor (if otherwise unexceptionable) is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and warranted by the general Practice of the <hi>Antients.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not my Design to detain my <hi>Reader</hi> long in a <hi>Preface.</hi> Onely one or two things I desire of him.</p>
                  <p>If any thing here in this Treatise seem <hi>long</hi> and <hi>tedious</hi> to him, I desire he would be pleas'd to consider, that my Design was to make this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course as perfect as I could, that so, if possible, it might put an End to this <hi>Controversie.</hi> And if our Adversaries shall be pleas'd to publish a <hi>Reply</hi> to what is here written, I desire he would seriously compare and weigh one Treatise with the other, consider if the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi> Parts of this Treatise are answer'd, then judge for himself, and not expect that of Course there must be another Reply. As I am not so vain as to think my self clear from Error, so neither am I conscious to my self of having been so <hi>Careless</hi> and <hi>Indiligent</hi> as to think I am often mistaken, I mean in things <hi>material.</hi> I hate everlasting <hi>Wrangle.</hi> And an Adversary that <hi>Cavils,</hi> and excepts against things <hi>not material,</hi> I shall think deserves a <hi>Reply</hi> as little as one that <hi>Rails.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twill be hard, I know, to perswade our Adversaries, that the <hi>History</hi> I here present 'em, is (what I call it) <hi>Impartial.</hi> But this Assurance I give 'em: <hi>I have written nothing but what I myself believe.</hi> That may be; perhaps they will say: But you have not written <hi>all</hi> that you believe: You have not told all you know. Why truly, as to that, I know not what to answer. Since the Judgments of Men are so extremely different, as that some have <hi>fansy'd</hi> that the <hi>Canons</hi> I omitted, when I publish'd the <hi>Buroccian Treatise,</hi> are really a Part of that <hi>Treatise,</hi> and ought to have been publish'd with it; there is nothing so <hi>Impertinent</hi> but what some or other may fansie I ought to have mention'd. I cannot promise but that there may be more <hi>Canons.</hi> But least it should be suspected, that tho' I have produced many Instances for the Cause I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to defend, there are others, as good, and as many, that make against us, which I have designedly conceal'd; I shall here make this solemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration: That if any of our Adversaries (I speak to all in general, but my Eye is particularly upon the learned <hi>Vindicator</hi>) can produce me any one single Instance from the time of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the first <hi>High-priest</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> to this very day, of a <hi>High priest disown'd</hi> by the <hi>Iews,</hi> or a <hi>Bishop disown'd by the Generality of the Catholick Church for this Reason, because put into the place of another deposed by the Civil Autority:</hi> If they
<pb facs="tcp:62950:4"/>
can shew me, I say, any one single Instance, I shall own my self obliged for the Instruction. I assure my <hi>Reader,</hi> that after a <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>very</hi> Search I know not one.</p>
                  <p>Should our Adversaries be able to produce such an Example (as I think they will never be able) 'twill advantage their Cause but little, especially if it be one of the later Ages, since it is not agreeable to the Practice of the Church in general. But if they are not able to produce so much as one single Example, how rashly have they acted, who have separated themselves from the Church on such an account!</p>
                  <p>I conclude in the Words of <hi>Drusius,</hi> which I here make my own: <hi>Scripsi haec animo juvandi, non laedendi. Si laesi quempiam, jam me poenitet. Si offendi pias aures, monitus lubenter mutabo. Si erravi uspiam, monstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur mihi error, non ero pertinax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>☞ <hi>Pag. 5. lin.</hi> 40. Whatsoever is <hi>notoriously</hi> repugnant to the Church's Interest, so as to be <hi>necessarily</hi> productive of very great Evils, is so far from being obliging, that it would be a Sin to act according to it.— Least that Proposition should be misunderstood; after the words, <hi>of very great Evils:</hi> add (I speak of Oaths of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Obedience).</p>

                        <hi>The Reasonableness of submitting to the present Possessor, if otherwise unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, tho' the Predecessor was unjustly or invalidly deposed by the Secular Power, demonstrated. Objections answer'd. No obligation to the contrary by the Oath of Canonical Obedience. The Authority of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> unreasonably alleg'd by our Adversaries. The <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Notion of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy</hi> not at all to his Purpose.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Doctrine maintain'd by the Author of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> Treatise, is this; <hi>That supposing a Bishop depriv'd without any Synod by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power, is unjustly depriv'd; yet neither He himself, nor the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought to separate from the Communion of his Successor, provided that Successor is not a Heretick.</hi> In answer to that Treatise, it is alleg'd by some of our Adversaries, That not onely <hi>Heresy,</hi> but <hi>Schism</hi> likewise, and <hi>Excommunication</hi> make a Person uncapable of being receiv'd as a Bishop. <hi>It is manifest,</hi> says one of our<note n="*" rend="inter">An Answer to a Treatise out of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. History,</hi> &amp;c. in the Preface.</note> Answerers, <hi>that the Principles advanced by the Author of the</hi> Baroccian <hi>Treatise, make all Church-Censures ineffectual, and expose the Church to all the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of</hi> Erastianism. <hi>For if a Prince should preferr an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Person to the See of the Bishop, by whom he stands excommunicated, supposing onely that he was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for Heresy, this Person, tho' never so justly excommunicated, must be own'd and obey'd instead of the Bishop who excommunicated him; which lodges all Church-Power in the Prince, and makes all Ecclesiastical Censures of no effect for the Benefit and Preservation of the Church, whenever he pleases.</hi> All this He very well knew was nothing at all to his Purpose, and nothing against either ours, or our Author's Cause: But he likewise knew, it would have been less to his Purpose to have told his Reader so. To avoid all impertinent Cavil, that we may not run off from the Scope and Design of our Writing, I shall take leave to alter the last Clause of the Proposition thus: <hi>Provided that Successor be in all other Respects such whose Communion no good Catholick can justly refuse.</hi>

                        <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62950:9"/>§. 2. Having laid down fairly our Proposition, and secured it (if that may be possible) from all Cavil, We will now proceed to demonstrate the Truth of it. And this we shall do, first, from the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it; and, 2dly. from the <hi>Autority and Practice of the Antients</hi>; by which the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it will more certainly and evidently appear.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. First from the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it: And that is grounded on this certain and self-evident Maxim, That <hi>whatsoever is necessary for the present Peace and Tranquillity of the Church, that ought to be made use of, provided it is not in it self sinfull, and the ill Consequences, which may possibly attend it, are either not so mischievous to the Church, or at least not so likely to happen as the Evils we endeavour to avoid.</hi> That this was a <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> We shall easily find, if we please but to cast our eyes back upon their Times, and consider those Methods, which were wont to be made use of in the Church. We shall find, that in all manner of Cases, They always preferr'd the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of the Church to all other Things, the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Religion excepted. There was no <hi>Custom</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> of the Church so sacred and inviolable, but what they readily sacrificed, whensoever Necessity requir'd, to the Peace and Tranquillity of it. If the exact Observation of the receiv'd Customs and Canons of the Church was not like to conduce to the present Peace and Tranquillity of it, they were readily superseded, and <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Convenience</hi> became the onely <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> To preferr a <hi>Rule</hi> of the Church to the <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> of it, and to stand to the <hi>Saying</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> in Opposition to a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Necessity,</hi> is a sort of <hi>Theological Pedantry,</hi> which They were not guilty of. They were wont to consider like truly Wise men, the <hi>Circumstances</hi> and the <hi>Exigencies</hi> of the Times; and they knew that those Customs and Canons of the Church, which were proper in the Times of Peace, could never indispensably oblige in Times of a different <hi>Complexion.</hi> To prevent, or to heal the Diseases of the Church, they acted like <hi>Philosophers,</hi> not like <hi>Empericks</hi>; consider'd what <hi>ought</hi> to be done in this and that particular Case; what was truly <hi>expedient,</hi> not what had been <hi>prescrib'd</hi> when the <hi>Symptoms</hi> were not the same. Tho' of all the <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> there was none so rever'd as the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>; and tho' among all the <hi>Canons</hi> of that Council there was none so Religiously and so Universally observ'd, as that which makes it unlawfull for any one City to have <hi>two</hi> Bishops; and altho' that had always been a<note n="*" rend="inter">S.

                     <p n="5">§. 5. First, It is not in it self <hi>Sinfull:</hi> For if it is so, it must be so for one, or more, of these following Reasons: Either, first, because it is forbidden by some express Law of God; Or, 2dly. because it makes us <hi>Accomplices</hi> in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>; Or, 3dly. because of the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi> which the inferior Clergy have taken to their Bishop, and the inferior Bishops to their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop; Or, lastly, because, as one of our Adversaries, the learned <hi>Vindicator,</hi> contends, such a Bishop as is placed in the room of one Deposed by the Civil Autority, is in reality <hi>no Bishop.</hi> These Objections I shall consider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
                     <p n="6">§. 6. First, It is not against any Law of God. For as to our <hi>Case,</hi> the Scripture is altogether silent. 'Tis true, it Commands us to be obedient to our Governors, and that Command reaches as well to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> as to the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral:</hi> But when there are <hi>two</hi> that stand Competitors, and both claim our Obedience; to which of those <hi>two</hi> our Obedience ought to be paid, it leaves to our Wisdom to determine.</p>
                     <p n="7">§. 7. Neither, 2dly. does it make us <hi>Accomplices</hi> in the <hi>Injustice.</hi> For if a <hi>Landlord</hi> be <hi>unjustly</hi> and <hi>invalidly</hi> dispossess'd of his <hi>Estate</hi> by an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority, Who thinks the <hi>Tenant</hi> an <hi>Accomplice in the Injustice,</hi> because he pays his <hi>Rent</hi> to the present Possessor? Should the Clergy refuse to submit to the Bishops in possession, it could onely serve to draw down Ruin upon themselves?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62950:10"/>
It cannot restore those whom the State has deposed. It is not our Submitting to the present Possessors, that ejects the former; for they are already irretrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Depos'd, since the Supreme Power is peremptory against 'em. That has publickly declar'd, that, whoever are our Bishops, the old ones shall govern us no longer. If we think the Proceeding <hi>unjust,</hi> 'tis enough that we remonstrate against it, and express our dissatisfaction. If that will not doe, the Good of the Publick obliges us to be quiet.</p>
                     <p n="8">§. 8. Neither, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> is it <hi>sinfull</hi> on the account of the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience.</hi> For that is taken not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>unconditionally,</hi> but with this Supposition, That the Bishop, to whom we take it, has <hi>power</hi> to govern us. If I take an Oath, to be faithfull or obedient to a Governour, whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> I engage my self to him as a <hi>Governour,</hi> that is, as one that <hi>can govern:</hi> If therefore he <hi>can no longer govern,</hi> whatsoever the Impediment is, my Obedience is no longer engag'd. As it is in the State, so it is in the Church: The Oath that is taken to a Bishop, as he is the Governour of a Church, is not taken for the sake of the Bishop, but for the Peace and good Order of the Church. 'Tis this was the <hi>Design</hi> of the Church when she order'd such an Oath to be taken. When therefore the Oath tends no longer to the Good of the Church, but <hi>notoriously</hi> to Schism, Disorder, and Confusion, it cannot any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger oblige: but is void of it self, by virtue of the Church's Intent and Design in the first Institution of it.</p>
                     <p>It is further to be consider'd, that particularly here in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience</hi> is always taken with this Supposition, That the <hi>Civil</hi> Power, as well as the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> do allow the Bishop to govern.</p>
                     <p>But let us suppose even that which in reason we ought not to suppose: Let us suppose, that the Bishop intended that the Oath should always oblige. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was the Intent of the Bishop; <hi>That</hi> was not the Intent of the <hi>Church.</hi> And it is the Intent of the <hi>Church,</hi> not the <hi>private</hi> Intent of the Bishop, that gives an Obligation to the Oath. I add, That should it be both the Intent of the Bishop, and likewise the Intent of the Person who takes the Oath, that it should always oblige; should it run in these express words; <hi>I will always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to you, if Depos'd by the Civil Autority, in opposition to him, whosoever he be, that shall be put into your place:</hi> Should any one, I say, take such an Oath as that, yet he cannot be oblig'd by it. The Oath is in it self unlawfull; 'tis a <hi>Sin</hi> against the Publick, repugnant to the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> It would be in effect to swear thus: <hi>I will for your sake oppose the Welfare of the Publick, and break the Vnion of the Church; I will leave the Communion of the Church, and adhere to you, tho' I have not any Reason to do so besides this bare Oath.</hi> To conclude; Whatsoever is <hi>notoriously</hi> repugnant to the Church's interest, so as to be <hi>necessarily</hi> productive of <hi>very great</hi> Evils, is so far from being obliging, that it would be a <hi>Sin</hi> to act according to it.</p>
                     <p>It is granted by our Adversaries, that the Obligation of an Oath of Canonical Obedience ceases, if a Bishop is depriv'd, tho' never so <hi>unjustly</hi> by a <hi>Synod:</hi> Now what is the Reason of that? 'Tis because to adhere to a Bishop, when a <hi>Synod</hi> has fully deposed him, and placed another in his See, must occasion a <hi>Division</hi> in the Church, and disturb the <hi>Publick.</hi> If that is the Reason, as no one can assign any other, (at least there can be none but what is grounded on that,) then the Reason is the same in both Cases: and consequently in both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62950:11"/>
Cases the Oath will be equally void. 'Tis in vain to allege, That in the Case of a <hi>Synod</hi> we cease to be obliged by our Oath, because every Bishop is suppos'd to have obliged himself to submit to the Determination of a Synod, whether <hi>just</hi> or <hi>unjust</hi>; and therefore when a <hi>Synod</hi> has Deposed him, tho' by an unjust sentence, his Place is truly void by virtue of his supposed <hi>Consent:</hi> For suppose a Bishop should have always declar'd, that he never would give his Consent, that a Synod should have Power to Depose him by an <hi>unjust</hi> Sentence: ought we not however to submit to the new Constituted Bishop? Our Adversaries will tell us, that we ought. But why? 'Tis because the Necessity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Peace of the Church requires it. Well then; it is certain, that it is not the Bishop's <hi>Consent,</hi> but <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>the Good of the Publick</hi> that makes our <hi>Oath</hi> void.</p>
                     <p>Tho' in some Respects there is a great deal of Difference between what is done by a <hi>competent</hi> or a <hi>lawfull</hi> Autority, and what is done by an <hi>incompetent</hi> or an <hi>unlawfull</hi> Autority: yet, as to our Acquiescence, in a Case of Necessity, such as is here supposed, I can see no Difference at all. The <hi>Obligation to acquiesce</hi> is the same in both Cases, when in both Cases the <hi>Necessity</hi> is the same. If a <hi>Lord</hi> be dispossess'd of his <hi>Mannor</hi> by an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority that cannot be resisted, (a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> suppose, or an <hi>unlawfull Court</hi>) Who thinks the Tenant <hi>forsworn</hi> for submitting to the new Possessor? Who makes any difference there between a <hi>Competent</hi> and an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority? And why is the <hi>Tenant</hi> in such a Case not <hi>forsworn?</hi> If he cannot (or ought not to) oppose the Intruder, yet ought he not at least to give up his <hi>Estate,</hi> rather than submit and do <hi>Homage</hi> to the wrong Lord? 'Twill be granted, I presume, by our Adversaries, that he is neither obliged to oppose the <hi>Intruder,</hi> nor yet to give up his <hi>Estate.</hi> But why does the Oath, which he took to the <hi>rightfull</hi> Lord, cease to oblige him? 'Tis because when he took the Oath, he took it onely on this Supposition, That the Lord was <hi>Possess</hi>'d of the Mannor. The Peace and Tranquillity of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the Good of <hi>Tenants</hi> in general give that <hi>Restriction</hi> to the Oath.</p>
                     <p>If the Bishop of a <hi>Frontier Town</hi> will not own the Autority of a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and is therefore Deposed by that Conqueror, I desire to know of our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whether the Clergy of that Town are perjur'd if they own that Bishop whom the Conqueror thinks fit to set over 'em? If a Bishop should by the <hi>Civil Power</hi> be condemn'd to <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>close</hi> Imprisonment, or be banish'd <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> from his Country, so as that it is impossible for him to perform the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Bishop: or should he be carried away Captive we know not where, or from whence we cannot redeem him: What then?

I seek not yours, but you,</hi> will readily forego his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest for the Welfare and Prosperity of his Flock: And since our ejected Bishops, who are (I am fully perswaded) very worthy and good Men, and real Lovers of their People, have never by any <hi>publick</hi> signification of their Will, laid claim to the Obedience of their People, and do not now exercise their Episcopal Power as before; in reason we ought to presume that they give their Consent that their Successors should be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. But, 2dly. let it be supposed, that the outed Governor does expresly assure his Inferiors, that he <hi>does not</hi> give his Consent, but still lays Claim to their Obedience. Suppose the <hi>conquer'd,</hi> the <hi>banish'd,</hi> the <hi>imprison'd,</hi> or the <hi>captive</hi> Bishop should charge his People expresly upon their Oath never to accept of any other Bishop as long as by the common Course of Nature he himself may be supposed to be living, or till they be assur'd he is dead: Let this I say be supposed, (and easy it is to be supposed,) What must be done in such Cases? Is the Church <hi>perjur'd</hi> if she accepts of another? Will our Adversaries say that she is? <hi>A hard Saying! Who can bear it?</hi> This <hi>Presumption</hi> of the ejected Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's <hi>Consent</hi> is (I know) what is commonly alleg'd by some very learned and otherwise judicious Men, as the true and the onely foundation of Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence when the lawfull Governor is unjustly Depos'd by a Power <hi>incompetent:</hi> But that that is not the true and the <hi>onely</hi> foundation, these Difficulties which I have alleg'd do (me-thinks) abundantly demonstrate. Other Men I must leave to their own ways of <hi>Thinking.</hi> For my part, I cannot imagine, that the <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> does depend upon so <hi>ticklish</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi> a Point as that of an ejected Governor's Consent: That, if he refuses to give his Consent, all the <hi>Church</hi> or the <hi>Nation</hi> must be made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to him. It is easy to discover, upon how false a <hi>Principle</hi> that Notion is built. It is grounded on this, That the Oath that is taken to the Governor, is taken <hi>onely</hi> for <hi>his</hi> sake; when if the true End and Design of Government were duely and impartially consider'd, it would be found (as above I observ'd) that the Oath that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Governor, is taken not <hi>onely</hi> for <hi>his</hi> Good, but <hi>chiefly</hi> for the Good of the <hi>Publick</hi>; and that any Oath taken to a Governor that is <hi>notoriously</hi> and in a <hi>high degree</hi> repugnant to the Good and Prosperity of the <hi>Publick,</hi> so as to be <hi>necessarily</hi> productive of <hi>intolerable</hi> Evils, is in its own Nature void; because by the <hi>Publick</hi> it was never design'd that in such a Case it should oblige.</p>
                     <p>By the Author of a Treatise entitled; <hi>Vnity of Priesthood necessary to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Communion,</hi> there are two Examples produced, to shew how observant the Antients were of their Oath of Canonical Obedience; which the Author calls <hi>eminent Instances,</hi> and proposes 'em to the Consideration of the Bishops of our Church, and <hi>wishes they would seriously apply 'em.</hi> The first is that of <hi>Ivo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chartres</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who flourish'd about 600 years ago. He being one of the <hi>Suffragans</hi> of the Archbishop of <hi>Sens,</hi> was desired by the Bishop of

                        <hi>Lyons,</hi> who was likewise the Pope's Legate, to assist him at the Consecration of the Bishop of <hi>Nivers:</hi> but the Bishop of <hi>Nivers</hi> being a <hi>Suffragan</hi> to the said Archbishop of <hi>Sens</hi>; and that Archbishop having<note n="*" rend="inter">In those days the Pope's power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Bishops in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother District, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Consent of the Metropolitan, was not own'd by the Western Church.</note> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given his Consent that the Bishop of <hi>Lyons</hi> should Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a Bishop of his District, <hi>Ivo</hi> refuses to assist at the Consecration: And this is the reason he gives for it; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if he should engage in such an undertaking, he should be unfaithfull to his own <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and betray the Privileges allow'd that Church by the Canons as a Metropolitical Church, which by Oath he was oblig'd to maintain; <hi>Reus sieret violatae sponsionis quam Sedi Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanae secerat.</hi> If the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> had pretended to Constitute a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> without the Consent of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and a <hi>Suffragan</hi> of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had assisted in that Ordination, our Bishops would then have been able to <hi>apply</hi> this <hi>eminent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> But as the Case stands, they know not, I believe, how to do it: And the Author is desired, that he himself, if he can, would be pleas'd to <hi>apply</hi> it. The other Instance is that of the Bishops of our own Country in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> II. There arising a great Difference between the King and <hi>Anselm</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> about acknowledging the Pope, Whether the Archbishop could lawfully do it without the King's Consent?

This indeed is the Difference between our <hi>Civil</hi> and our <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Governors. The former are purely <hi>Governors,</hi> and nothing more is required in them but to be capable of <hi>Governing</hi>; The latter are not onely <hi>Governors,</hi> but are likewise the Administrators of Sacraments, and the sole Ordainers of the Clergy. It is therefore necessary, not onely that the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Governor should be duly qualified for Government, but that he should be likewise endued by God Almighty with the Power of Ordaining, and of administring the holy Sacraments. Thus much must be granted: Let us now see what Argument the <hi>Vindicator</hi> can produce to degrade our present Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and to prove 'em <hi>no Bishops.</hi> It is nothing but a Saying of S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> that is nothing at all to his Purpose.

                        <hi>Antonianus,</hi> concerning him. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> says he, <hi>being possess'd of the See according to the Will of God, and confirm'd in it by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of us all; whoever would now be a Bishop of that See, must needs be out of the Church; neither can he have any Ecclesiastical Orders, who does not continue in Vnity with the Church.

in possession; whosoever is made Bishop after another, who ought to be alone, he is not a second, but none.</hi> This is the place out of which the learned <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi> is pleas'd to draw his Argument; with how <hi>Logical</hi> an Inference the judicious Reader may see. 'Tis strange that That excellent Person should be so much blinded with Prejudice, as not to be able to discover how vast a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between the Case of our Present Bishops, and that of which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> discourses. Had <hi>Cornelius</hi> been deposed by the Emperor for refusing to acknowledge his Autority, we have all the reason in the world to believe, That his Deprivation would have been lookt upon by S. <hi>Cyrrian</hi> as very <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> and <hi>just.</hi> But let us still grant, as we first supposed in our Question, That he ought not to have been deprived by the Emperor himself, but by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: Yet if he had been deprived for refusing to acknowledge the Emperor's Autority; or if he had been upon any other account so deprived by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Autority, as that it would have been impossible for him to exercise his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal jurisdiction; Is it possible for any wise and unprejudiced Man to imagine, That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would have thought so ill of <hi>Novatian</hi> and his Adherents, as he did? If an Enemy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, suppose the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> should in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time have taken a <hi>Frontier</hi> City, and the Bishop of that City should have been deposed by him for refusing to submit to his Autority, Who can believe that That great and wise Man S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> would have declared a new Bishop <hi>no Bishop,</hi> and all his Adherents <hi>Schismatical?</hi> That a <hi>second,</hi> that is, a <hi>Schismatical</hi> Bishop, an <hi>Invader</hi> of a See already <hi>fill'd</hi> and <hi>possess'd,</hi> is no Bishop, is confess'd to be S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Doctrine: But that our Bishops are, in the Sence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the <hi>Invaders of a See already fill'd and possess'd,</hi> that they are <hi>secundi</hi> in his Sence, is what we utterly deny. Not a Word, not a Hint in S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> from whence such a thing can be inferr'd. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> may be pleas'd to consider, that our present Possessors did not set up themselves in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to such as were <hi>possess'd</hi> of their Sees; but before they pretended to be Bishops, their Predecessors were made by the Supreme Civil Power <hi>uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Governing,</hi> i. e. were Depos'd. Again, he ought to consider that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Possessors were so far from <hi>ambitiously invading,</hi> like <hi>Novatian,</hi> the Sees of others, that they were all <hi>chose by their respective Churches according to the usual manner; viz.</hi> in the same manner that their Predecessors themselves had been. Let us hold up the <hi>Picture,</hi> which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has been pleas'd to <hi>draw,</hi> to a <hi>true Light</hi>; and then we shall the better see what a strange <hi>Figure</hi> it is. The <hi>Vindicator's Enthymeme</hi> is this:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> says, that he is no <hi>Bishop,</hi> but a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> who ambitiously invades a See which another is fully possess'd of. <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought, that he is no Bishop, but a Schismatick, who is chosen by the Church, according to the usual manner, into the place of another, whom the Civil Power will not suffer to govern any longer, because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to own its Autority.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>I add, That if a Bishop be a <hi>Secundus,</hi> and <hi>no Bishop,</hi> who is put into the place of one unjustly depos'd by the Civil Autority; then it likewise must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he is a <hi>secundus,</hi> and <hi>no Bishop,</hi> who is put into the place of another
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62950:13"/>
whom a <hi>Synod</hi> has <hi>unjustly</hi> depos'd. But this the learned <hi>Vindicator</hi> will neither himself grant; neither does he, I suppose, believe that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought so. I say that must follow, if we seriously consider the Matter: For the onely good Reason assignable, why in the former Case, the <hi>Successor</hi> is a <hi>secundus,</hi> and <hi>no Bishop,</hi> is this; Because the <hi>Predecessor</hi> has still a <hi>Right</hi> to the Bishoprick. Now 'tis certain, that the Reason is the same in the latter Case: For a Bishop, whom a <hi>Synod</hi> has <hi>unjustly</hi> depriv'd, has still as much <hi>Right</hi> to his Bishoprick, as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>invalidly</hi> depos'd by the Civil Autority. For to me 'tis absurd, that any <hi>unjust</hi> Sentence should take away the <hi>Right:</hi> tho', the Nature of Government requiring it, it is oftentimes necessary that we should submit to such a Sentence. And this (if I am not mistaken) is the common Sence of Mankind. When a Bishop is <hi>unjustly</hi> depriv'd by a <hi>Synod,</hi> we submit to his Successor; not because we imagine, that the other has no longer a <hi>Right,</hi> but onely for <hi>Peace sake.</hi> That a Bishop <hi>unjustly</hi> depriv'd by a <hi>Synod,</hi> has still a <hi>Right</hi> to that Bishoprick, as well as a Bishop deposed by an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority, may be clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from this, That after he is deprived, he may be again restor'd, and his Successor be deposed by Appeal to another <hi>Synod:</hi> (and yet the ejected Successor is accounted a true Bishop:) Now is that done justly or not? There is no one will say it is not: And yet it is impossible that the Successor should be <hi>justly</hi> deprived, if the other had <hi>no Right.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude: That a Bishop, who is put into the place of another, unjustly deprived by the Secular Power, is a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Bishop, will by and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Opinion and the Practice of the Antients in general. Let us now proceed to demonstrate, that, as the submitting to a Bishop, whose Predecessor was unjustly deposed by the Civil Autority, is not in it self a <hi>Sin</hi>; so <hi>the ill Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to which it may be liable, are either not so mischievous to the Church, or not so likely to happen as the Evils we endeavour to avoid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">§. 10. The Evils we endeavour to avoid are a <hi>Schism</hi> and a <hi>persecution</hi>; two Evils as <hi>great</hi> as can possibly befall the Church. And that those two very great Evils must needs be the <hi>certain</hi> and the <hi>immediate</hi> Consequences of a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>submission,</hi> is too evident to any Considering Man to need any Proof. If the ill Consequences, to which a <hi>submission</hi> may be liable, are so <hi>great</hi> as those two Evils, but not so <hi>certain</hi>; or if they are so <hi>certain,</hi> but not so <hi>great,</hi> it must then be granted that, with respect to Consequences, a <hi>Submission</hi> is more <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> than a <hi>Non-submission.</hi> Now if we consider those evil Consequences which may justly be charg'd upon the <hi>Submission,</hi> we shall find that they are so far from being <hi>both</hi> so <hi>great</hi> and so <hi>certain,</hi> that they are <hi>neither</hi> so <hi>great</hi> nor so <hi>certain,</hi> as those two Evils, which, by a <hi>Non-submission,</hi> must unavoidably be brought upon the Church.</p>
                     <p>So far indeed is the <hi>Principle,</hi> which we maintain, from being <hi>necessarily</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any <hi>very</hi> ill Consequence, that it is not easy to foresee any Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence at all that is <hi>Evil.</hi> As it is for the Good, the Peace, and Prosperity of the Church, that we think our selves obliged to comply, upon occasion, with the Necessity of Times: So if ever the Civil Power (which to fear in this Reign would be very unjust and unreasonable) should pretend to break in upon the <hi>Essentials</hi> of the Church, we should then be obliged not to yield to such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> the <hi>evil Day</hi> must needs come, (which God forbid!) we will keep it off as long as we can. When it necessarily comes, as now we shew our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62950:14"/>
                        <hi>Prudence,</hi> so we'll prove our <hi>Fortitude.</hi> Not to endeavour to escape from <hi>Damascus</hi> when a <hi>Basket</hi> is fairly offer'd, would be Folly in an <hi>Apostle</hi>: And to run on to <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> when it <hi>honestly</hi> may be avoided, is, according to the <hi>Sanctions</hi> of the Primitive Christians, a <hi>Sin.</hi> Should a Person <hi>absolutely unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> be imposed upon us for a Bishop, we are not then to accept him. If a Roman <hi>Decius</hi> would depose all our Bishops, and not permit us to constitute others in their places, that so he may destroy our Religion, we are not then to regard either what he does or commands. As the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Fabian,</hi> tho', to avoid the Fury of a Persecution,<note n="*" rend="inter">The <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy for that reason deferr'd the Election of <hi>Cornelius</hi> (above 16 Months) as they tell S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in a Letter; but as soon as the Emperor had left <hi>Rome,</hi> they chose <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</note> 
                        <hi>Propter rerum &amp; temporum dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultates,</hi> we might possibly deferr the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet as soon as we thought it convenient, we would choose a <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Tyrant's Decrees. If an <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> King <hi>Frazamund</hi> should command us not to Ordain any Bishops, that so the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion may of Course be rooted out, and his <hi>Heresy</hi> onely prevail, we would then no more value that Command than the <hi>Catholicks</hi> heretofore did; but in spite of his Edict, would get as many Bishops ordain'd as we thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the Church. But how can our Case be compared with either of these? Here is no forbidding Elections, no deposing all Bishops in general, no impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>unqualified</hi> Persons, no destroying of Religion, no advancing of Heresy. The onely Question here is, Whether <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos</hi> may be <hi>follow'd,</hi> when <hi>Cephas</hi> is in <hi>Prison,</hi> and is render'd uncapable of acting as an <hi>Apostle?</hi> Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are resolv'd to have <hi>Cephas</hi>; If they cannot have him, they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have <hi>Christ.</hi> To us 'tis altogether indifferent, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> as long as we have <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is onely one Inconvenience that I can possibly foresee, which can justly be charg'd on this Principle which we advance; and that is this: That by a Submission to the present Possessor, the Civil Governor is like to be encouraged to tyrannize over the Church, and to turn out such Bishops as he does not like, whensoever he pleases, tho' never so unjustly. If that be the Objection of our Adversaries; I answer, First, That the same Inconvenience is in all manner of Government: By submitting to a Bishop who is put into the place of another, whom a <hi>Synod</hi> has unjustly depos'd, that <hi>Synod</hi> may be possibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to turn out others unjustly, as many as it does not like, tho' never so worthy. Secondly, That here in <hi>England</hi> it is not the Will of the Prince that can turn out a Bishop. He has all the same Securities that another Subject can have, and he cannot be deprived of his Bishoprick without a due Course of Law. If they mean that the King and the <hi>Parliament</hi> may by that be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to Depose our Bishops at pleasure, that Supposition will be wild and extravagant. For who can imagine, that they can ever concurr for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of a Bishop, but upon a very extraordinary Occasion? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more manifest, than that this Inconvenience is not <hi>so likely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen as those Evil's we endeavour to avoid.</hi> These are certain and present, That only <hi>possible.</hi> But, Thirdly, should we grant (what in reason cannot be granted) that it is as likely to happen: yet how great is the Difference? Should the State here, or in other Countries one single absolute Governor, be supposed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62950:14"/>
to be so very dissolute, as to turn out frequently the Bishops of the Church without any just Cause; yet who can look upon that Mischief to be comparable to that of a <hi>Schism</hi> and a <hi>Persecution?</hi> What can the suffering of a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men be, when compared to the Peace and Tranquility of the whole Church besides? Our Adversaries may be pleas'd to consider, That it was not for the Bishops that the Church was establish'd; but the Bishops were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the sake of the Church. It is not therefore the Welfare of the Bishops, as the Bishops are these or those Men, much less of some <hi>few</hi> particular Bishops, but the Welfare of the whole Church in general that is chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                     <p n="11">§. 11. And thus, I hope, I have sufficiently made out what I proposed to prove, That the submitting to a Bishop, who is put into the place of another unjustly deposed by the Civil Autority, is neither in it self a <hi>Sin,</hi> nor liable to ill Consequences so likely to happen as the Evils we endeavour to avoid; or, if so likely to happen, not so great and pernicious to the Church as those are. From whence it necessarily follows, That such a Submission is in it self highly <hi>reasonable.</hi> Which was the first Proposition we proposed to be demonstrated. I come now to the Second General proposed to be made out, That such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is agreeable to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Antients.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">§. 12. But before I put an end to this Chapter, and proceed to the Proof of this last Proposition, there remains yet one thing more to be consider'd, and that is the Imputation of <hi>Heresy,</hi> which the learned <hi>Vindicator</hi> is pleas'd to fix upon us. Any Opinion, says the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> on account of which Men separate from their Ecclesiastical Governors, is <hi>Heretical,</hi> tho' it be not in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so: And such an Opinion is not <hi>Heretical onely, when Men designedly sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from others on that very account, because they are not of that Opinion; but also when they venture on such Practices on account of that Opinion, wherein others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate with 'em; for that very reason, because they cannot join with 'em in that Opinion. Then plainly the differing in such Opinions, makes a difference of Communion unavoidable; and therefore the Opinions themselves, in such a Case as this is, are Signals of different Communions, which will come under the Charge of Heresy.</hi> His meaning is, that We, maintaining this Opinion, That the Civil Power has Autority to depose a Bishop for a <hi>Political</hi> Crime; or, if it has no such Autority, when once it has deposed a Bishop, it is lawfull to acknowledge the Successor; and in consequence of that Opinion, submitting now to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Possessors, are therefore <hi>Hereticks,</hi> because He and his Party cannot join with us in that Practice, as being of the contrary Opinion. Here it comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind, what S. <hi>Ierom</hi> somewhere says, That he that can with <hi>Patience</hi> hear himself call'd <hi>Heretick,</hi> is no <hi>good Christian.</hi> This is true of those Heresies which were so in the Opinion of the Antients: But in this Case we <hi>dare</hi> to be <hi>patient. Ego tibi Haereticus tu mihi:</hi> That's all the Return we shall make. The <hi>Vindicator,</hi> in consequence of his Opinion, that the Civil Autority has no power to depose a Bishop; and that if a Bishop is so deposed; his Successor ought to be rejected, tho' otherwise never so worthy, adheres to the Bishops deprived, and disowns those that are put into their places. In this Practice of the <hi>Vindicator</hi> we cannot join with him; and for that very reason, because we cannot join with him in his Opinion. And what now follows from our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Notion of <hi>Heresy,</hi> but that he himself is a <hi>Heretick?</hi> It is nothing at all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62950:15"/>
to our Purpose: But for his own sake I shall here take upon me to add, (with a <hi>pace maximi Viri</hi>) That this Notion of <hi>Heresy</hi> is a <hi>groundless</hi> and a <hi>fancyfull</hi> Notion. That he may be properly call'd a <hi>Heretick,</hi> who separates from the Church, because the Church is not of his Opinion, tho' the Opinion is not at all in its own nature Heretical, I grant: For there is a sort of <hi>Heresy</hi> which is not sinfull on the account of the Opinion maintain'd, but onely because it is a <hi>separation</hi> from the Church. But this I assert in opposition to what is laid down by the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> That to all <hi>Heresy</hi> (as the word is strictly taken to denote a <hi>Sin</hi> contradistinct to <hi>Schism</hi>) it is necessary that there be an <hi>Opinion</hi> maintain'd; which either the <hi>Church</hi> condemns, or for which the Person that maintains it, does of himself separate from the Church. If it be not for any <hi>Opinion</hi> that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is divided from the Church, but onely for what is <hi>done</hi> by the Church, he cannot be call'd, in a strict sence, a <hi>Heretick,</hi> but only a <hi>Schismatick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">§. 13. But to wave this Dispute, as not at all material, and to suffer the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> if he pleases, to enjoy his Notion; What now is the Life he would make of it? What is his Design in advancing it? The Life he makes of it is this: He alleges the aforesaid <hi>Heresy</hi> as a Reason for their Separation. He tells us, That we being guilty of <hi>Heresy,</hi> they ought by our own Concessions to keep off from our Communion, because we our selves acknowlege that <hi>Heresy</hi> is a just cause of Separation. <hi>Tho' we should admit,</hi> says he, <hi>that the Author of the</hi> Baroccian <hi>Treatise had been successfull in all that he has attempted: we may yet justify our adherence to the deprived Bishops, and our Separation from our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries opposite Altars, and justify it too by the Doctrine of their own Author: for even he permits a Separation where Orthodoxy is concern'd, and expressly excepts this Case from the Number of those which he pretends to confute. An Heretical Bishop he calls a false Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis strange that the worthy and learned <hi>Vindicator</hi> should be so much out in his <hi>Logick,</hi> as not to see the Inconsistency of what he alleges, and to offer this as a <hi>reason</hi> for their <hi>not communicating</hi> with us! If it is their <hi>not communicating with us</hi> that makes our Opinion <hi>Heretical,</hi> and us <hi>Hereticks</hi>; how do they <hi>refuse to communicate with us</hi> for this reason, <hi>because we are Hereticks?</hi> We could not be <hi>Hereticks</hi> according to the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>'s own Notion, 'till they <hi>had refused to communicate with us.</hi> So dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing it is, First to do a thing rashly, and then to <hi>hunt</hi> for a <hi>Reason!</hi> If this Plea of our Author is good, I would very fain know how any <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> can be proved to be unlawfull. Let our Author stand out a little, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with our old <hi>Dissenters.</hi> He asks a Dissenter, why he separates from the Church? The Dissenter tells him 'tis, because the Church is <hi>Heretical.</hi> But why Heretical? Because she thinks it lawfull to oblige her Members to the use of Ceremonies, and pursuant to that Opinion she actually imposes the use of 'em. In the use of these Ceremonies (says the Dissenter) we cannot join with you; and for that very reason, because we cannot join with you in this Opinion, That the Church has power to impose upon its Members the use of Ceremonies: And because we cannot join with the Church in this Opinion and Practice, upon that very account the Church is <hi>Heretical.</hi> Thus according to our Author's own Plea: but the Plea would be vain and <hi>Illogical.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62950:15"/>§. 14. But this is not all: We are not onely <hi>Hereticks</hi> upon that account, but, as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> contends, we are <hi>Hereticks</hi> likewise (as <hi>Heresy</hi> signifies an <hi>erring</hi>) even in <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> He affirms, that our Opinion is a <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Error,</hi> because (as he says) it is utterly destructive of the Church, as the Church is a <hi>Society</hi> distinct from the <hi>State.</hi> To maintain this Opinion, That for <hi>Political Crimes</hi> a Bishop may be lawfully Depriv'd by the Civil Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Or this, That supposing he cannot be lawfully so depriv'd; yet if he is deprived, it is lawfull for Peace-sake to submit to his Successor: How that is destructive of the Church, as the Church is a <hi>Society,</hi> I, for my part, cannot perceive. To me 'tis much more apparent, that to advance this Opinion, That a Bishop cannot be deprived by the Civil Autority <hi>for any Crime whatsoever,</hi> is destructive of all <hi>Civil</hi> Government, which, as well as the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> is of God's Institution. He therefore that advances that Notion, advances a very dangerous Notion. But it is not my Business at present to engage in these Disquisitions. I shall onely make bold to ask the <hi>Vindicator</hi> a few Questions. If he thinks that Opinion, concerning the Power of the Magistrate, a <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Heresy,</hi> and enough to justify the present <hi>Separation,</hi> how came it to pass that he did not leave the Communion of those, whom he knew to be the Maintainers of that Opinion, before this time? I will ask him one Question more: If the late Bishops should be again restor'd, would he then refuse to communicate with those who advance that Opinion? If he would not; then it is certain, that he does not think that enough to justify the present <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> One more, and then I have done. I desire to know, if our Author knows none of his own Communion, who themselves acknowledge the Power of the Supreme Civil Governor to depose a Bishop for <hi>Political Crimes?</hi> 'Tis strange if he should be ignorant of what every body knows: And it is to be believ'd, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves of his own Communion, at least some of 'em, agree with us in this Opinion, which the <hi>Church of England</hi> has all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this time accounted <hi>Orthodox,</hi> tho' the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is pleas'd to declare it a <hi>Heresy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But enough, and too much, of these Matters. We will leave our much honour'd Adversary to invent some other new Notion more consistent, and more usefull for his Cause: And will now proceed to enquire how <hi>Heretical</hi> our Forefathers were in thinking it lawfull to adhere to the <hi>present</hi> Possessor, and in acting accordingly.</p>

                     <q>That the Iewish High-priests, who were put into the places of others (unjustly) Deposed by the Civil Autority, were all along own'd and receiv'd as true High-priests. An Account of all those High-priests, from the Reign of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The Instance of <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> and <hi>Zadok</hi> nicely examin'd. The Practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and God's Approbation of such High-priests a sufficient Warrant to us.</q>
                     <p>TO make it appear, that the general Practice of the <hi>Antients,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages, was agreeable to ours; I shall <hi>first</hi> shew, That the same was the Practice of the <hi>Iews</hi> throughout all Ages in reference to their <hi>High-priests:</hi> whom S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and others of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> are wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to our <hi>Bishops. Secondly,</hi> I shall shew, That our Saviour himself, and his Apostles, acknowledged and communicated with the High-priests of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as true High-priests, tho' put into the places of others unjustly turn'd out by their Governors. By which they seem to instruct us, what we ought to doe in relation to our <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>High-priests.</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall shew, That the same has been all along the <hi>general</hi> Practice of the <hi>antient Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. I begin with the <hi>Iews:</hi> But before I proceed to Examples, I think it convenient to prevent an Objection that may possibly be made. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be the Plea of our Adversaries, in answer to the Examples of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish <hi>High-priests,</hi> That the Office of a <hi>Bishop</hi> amongst us is of a nature much more <hi>Spiritual,</hi> than the Office of those <hi>High-priests.</hi> To that Plea I answer; That he that considers the true and full Import of the Question now before us, will find it to be no other than this: Whether a Person duly invested with an Ecclesiastical Office of <hi>God's own Institution and Ordinance,</hi> being Deposed by the Lay-power, any other can lawfully succeed in that Office? Now as to <hi>God's particular Institution and Appointment,</hi> whatsoever otherwise the Difference may be, (which 'tis needless for us to contend about,) it is certain that the Jewish <hi>High-priests</hi> were rather superior than inferior to our Bishops. 'Twas by God himself, and that too in a very extraordinary manner, that the Office of the <hi>High-priest</hi> was instituted; and it was from God alone that he receiv'd his Autority. If therefore a Person was accepted of by God as a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> High-priest, tho' put into the room of another Deposed by the Civil Autority, then a <hi>Bishop</hi> likewise may be <hi>truly</hi> a Bishop, and accordingly ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, tho' put into the place of a Bishop deposed by that Power.</p>
                     <p>To this I add, That the Annual Expiation for the Sins of the whole People was to be perform'd by the High-priest. This was the chief of the federal Rites of that Religion, and that to which our Saviour's offering himself up a Sacrifice is particularly compared in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And this they did <hi>ex opere operato</hi>; so that it was of the greatest Consequence to the <hi>Iews</hi> to have this Divine Institution perform'd by one appointed to it by God. And tho' no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62950:16"/>
provision was made for Cases of Necessity, yet Necessity was understood to be a provision for itself. And it is certain these Annual Expiations were accepted of God till our Saviour's days; for that is a certain Consequence of their being still in Covenant with God, since these Expiations were the yearly renewing of that Covenant. Nor can any of the Performances of the Christian Priesthood be compared to this, unless we believe the Power of <hi>Transubstantiating.</hi> These Examples of the Jewish High-priests alone, were there no other to be alleged, would sufficiently warrant our Submission to our present Possessors. Let us now see what Examples those are.</p>
                     <p n="3">§. 3. Our first Example is that of the first <hi>High-priest</hi> that ever we know to have been deposed, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Abiathar.</hi> He was<note n="(a)" rend="inter">After he had been High-priest 40 years, <hi>viz.</hi> during all the Reign of King <hi>David.</hi>
                        </note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the <hi>bare</hi> Autority of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> for having adhered to <hi>Adonijah</hi> his elder Brother, (as small a fault as could be of that nature) tho' afterwards he had submitted, and acknowledged King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Autority as soon as ever he was made King. Tho' <hi>Abiathar</hi> was thus deposed, yet <hi>Zadok</hi> being by the<note n="(b)" rend="inter">And the King pur <hi>Benaiah</hi> in the room of <hi>Ioab</hi> over the Host, and <hi>Zadok</hi> the Priest did the King put in the room of <hi>Abiathar,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.35.</note> same Autority placed in his room, all the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> both <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to him, and own him as <hi>High-priest.</hi> Even the Sons of the deposed <hi>Abiathar, Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> act as Priests under <hi>Zadok. Iosephus</hi> in his <hi>Iewish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> has observ'd, that this was the first Instance of a High-priest deposed. <hi>From the beginning,</hi> says he,<note n="(c)" rend="inter">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 8. He does not speak thus in express Terms, but to a considering Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that knows the Story of <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s being deposed by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> it will plainly appear to be his meaning.</note> 
                        <hi>for</hi> 13 <hi>Successions there was no High-priest put into the room of another, unless deceased; after that some began to be consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted whilst their Predecessors were living.</hi> What is said by some of the <hi>Rabbies</hi> concerning the Deprivation of <hi>Phineas,</hi> the Grandson of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was altogether unknown<note n="*" rend="inter">Tho' <hi>Phineas</hi>'s Posterity were put by when <hi>Ithamar</hi>'s obtain'd the High-priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, yet we ought not to conclude from thence, as the <hi>Rabbies</hi> usually do, That <hi>Phineas</hi> himself was deposed: For it might be done after his death.</note> to <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>; neither does it concern the Subject of this Treatise; he being depriv'd, if at all, by God's immediate Act.</p>
                     <p>It's alleged by<note n="(d)" rend="inter">Unity of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 34, 35. The Crime being Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and the High-priest the Criminal, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That before <hi>Solomon</hi> thrust him from the Priesthood, the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had previously judg'd &amp; pass'd their Sentence upon him.</note> one of our Adversaries, that <hi>Abiathar</hi> was not deposed by the Autority of the King, but by that of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or great Council: And this he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to evince from these two Considerations. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said by the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> that in <hi>Capital</hi> Causes it was lawfull onely for the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to judge the <hi>High-priest.</hi> 2. Because <hi>Iosephus,</hi> the Historian, says of <hi>Ioab,</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King sent <hi>Benaiah</hi> to fall upon him, he first sent him to fetch him from the Altar, in order to bring him <gap reason="foreign">

And if this Formality,</hi> says our Author, <hi>was used towards</hi> Joab <hi>before ever the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was given, to have him slain; it's probable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>the King's Brother, before he was slain: and the like also to</hi> Abiathar <hi>before he was thrust from the Priesthood.</hi> At present it is not my Business to assert the Autority of the <hi>Civil</hi> Power in depriving a <hi>Bishop,</hi> or to shew that the Kings of <hi>Iudea</hi> had Autority to deprive a <hi>High-priest:</hi> I suppose at present, That the Deprivation of <hi>Abiathar</hi> by King <hi>Solomon</hi> was irregular and <hi>unlawfull</hi>; and am onely to demonstrate, That, <hi>de facto,</hi> he was deposed by the <hi>bare</hi> Autority of the King. Now a thousand such little <hi>Nothings,</hi> as our Author's <hi>Presumptions</hi> and <hi>Conjectures,</hi> from what is related by <hi>Iosephus</hi> concerning <hi>Ioab,</hi> I shall fully and unanswerably confute by producing the Words of the Scripture<note n="*" rend="inter">1 Kings 11.26.</note>. <hi>Now therefore as the Lord liveth,</hi> says King <hi>Solomon, which hath established me, and set me on the Throne of David my Father, and who hath made me a house as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. And King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the Son of Iehoiada, and he fell upon him that he died. And unto Abiathar the Priest said the King, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own Fields, for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the Ark of the Lord God before David my Father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my Father was afflicted. So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being Priest unto the Lord.</hi> So likewise <hi>Iosephus</hi>:<note n="†" rend="inter">

And it was told King So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, that Ioab was fled unto the Tabernacle of the Lord, and behold he is by the Altar: Then Solomon sent Benaiah, the Son of Iehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him, Thus saith the King, Come forth. And he said, Nay, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the King word again, saying, Thus said Ioab, and thus he answered me. And the King said unto him, Doe as he said, and fall upon him.</hi> It is said expressly that the King sent <hi>Benaiah</hi> (not <hi>to cite him to the Tribunal,</hi> but immediately) <hi>to fall upon him.</hi> These Words <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who oftentimes mistakes the true Sence of the Scripture by trusting too much to his Memory, had forgot: And because he remember'd that <hi>Ioab</hi> was commanded to <hi>come forth,</hi> he therefore rashly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that he was commanded to come to the <hi>Tribunal:</hi> When the Reason why he was commanded to <hi>come forth,</hi> was onely this, Because it was thought not<note n="(c)" rend="inter">See <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.14.</note> proper to shed his bloud at the <hi>Altar.</hi>

                           <hi>King</hi> Solomon (says he) <hi>did not properly and judicially deprive</hi> Abiathar <hi>of the High-priesthood, but onely commanded or required him to quit it on pain of death.

And Sadok and Abiathar were Priests.</hi> This Conjecture of <hi>Nihusius,</hi> were it granted to be true, would not make at all for his Cause, nor yet against ours. For still it is certain, that <hi>Abiathar</hi> was turn'd out at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Zadok</hi> was made High-priest in his stead, and by all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as the true <hi>Aaronick</hi> High-priest.

He raised a Sedition for the <hi>Dignity of the High-priesthood,</hi> says <hi>Eusebius</hi>; and <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, that the greater part of the People join'd with him, to that degree, that <hi>Menelaus,</hi> with the Chief of his Adherents, was forc'd to flee away to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> tho' he soon return'd and enjoy'd the High-priesthood.

and beloved of God, who had formerly, in the time of a Drought, obtained Rain by his pious Prayers, and hid himself, as perceiving a Civil War coming on: Him the</hi> Jews <hi>brought into their Camp, and required him, That as he had heretofore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a Famine, so he would now draw down a Curse upon</hi> Aristobulus, <hi>and all those that adhered to him. When he had long refused to do it, and at last was threatned by the Multitude, he stood in the midst of 'em, and prayed thus:</hi> O God, the King of all the World, since these, who stand here with me, are thy People, and they that are besieged are thy Priests, I beseech thee not to hearken to the Prayers of either Party against the other. <hi>After he had made this Prayer, there encompassed him round about certain Villainous</hi> Jews, <hi>and they overwhelmed him with Stones. Which cruelty God immediately revenged after this manner. Whilst</hi> Aristobulus <hi>was thus besieged, the Passover comes on; in which Feast our Custom is to honour God with many Sacrifices: Now the Besieged being destitute of Sacrifices, entreated their Countrymen without, that for Money, as much as they would desire, they would supply 'em with Victims. They demand a thousand Drachms for each Victim; which</hi> Aristobulus <hi>and the Priests agree to, and let down the Money from the Wall. But they, when they had got the Money, refused to supply 'em with Victims; and proceeded so far in Impiety, as both to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Faith with Men, and likewise to defraud God of the Honours due unto him. The Priests therefore, who had been wronged, prayed to God that he would punish their Countrymen: And immediately it was done. For a vehement Storm so destroyed the Fruits of the whole Country, that a Measure of Wheat was sold for</hi> 15 <hi>Drachms.</hi>

                     <p>Perhaps it may be said, that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was accepted as a <hi>true</hi> High-priest; not because he was the Possessor, but because <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> (tho' by force and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion) had solemnly and fully resigned to him. If this be alleged, then it follows, that <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> had no Right to the High-priesthood: yet he, after he was restored by the <hi>bare</hi> Autority of the Heathen <hi>Pompey,</hi> (tho' <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was depos'd<note n="*" rend="inter">After he had been High-priest 3 years and as many months.</note> by onely the same Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Conquerour) was owned again, and received as a true High-priest by all the <hi>Iews</hi>: and so he continued for the space of<note n="†" rend="inter">

                     <p>True it is, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> raised a War against <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> It is likewise true, that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> himself, having made his escape from <hi>Rome,</hi> raised another small Army, and endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obtain the Pontificate. But we are not to imagine, that they that joined thus with <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and endeavoured to restore him, did therefore do so, because they thought the present High-priest <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> not <hi>truly</hi> such. It was in this Case as usually it is in other Kingdoms: where Love, hope of Gain, and a longing after Innovation, engages turbulent Spirits against the present Establishment. <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> assures us, that they that joined with <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> were induced thereunto <hi>by the glory of his Name, the desire of Innovation,</hi>

This, I say, is on this account very observable; because from thence it appears, That both <hi>Matthias</hi> himself, who accepted of the High-priesthood, which in justice belonged to <hi>Iesus the Son of Phabes,</hi> and the great Men among the <hi>Iews,</hi> who owned him as <hi>true</hi> High-priest, were very Religious Persons, and nice Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of all <hi>necessary</hi> Laws.

This is the Account which <hi>Iosephus</hi> has delivered down to us, of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Revolutions in the Jewish Pontificate, from the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Herod.</hi> As he himself does not give us the least Hint, That he thought that they who succeeded upon an unjust or a lay-deprivation was no <hi>true</hi> High-priest; but speaks of 'em always as as true and real High-priests as any other: so it plainly appears from him, That that was likewise the Sense of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Iews.</hi> How arbitrarily or unjustly soever the Predecessor was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, both the Priests and the People submitted to the present Possessor. And He who had been unjustly deposed, tho' he came himself regularly to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (which some few of 'em did,) yet raised no disturbance on the account of his Ejectment; but remained at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a Member of the Church, and peaceably <hi>communicated</hi> with his Successor in the Offices of the Temple, and the Sacrifices made to God. <hi>Iesus the son of Damneus</hi> was the onely High-priest that expressed his <hi>Resentments</hi> with any thing of undecency. Of him 'tis rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that when he was deposed, his Resentment was such that it caused a great Animosity between him and his Successor, to that degree, that both going guarded by a company of audacious young men, they themselves not onely proceeded to publick <hi>Revilings,</hi> but their Attendants likewise threw Stones at one another. This <hi>Iesus</hi> did, as is manifest, not for any thing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but purely through Ambition and Regret: for he himself had been promoted to the High-priesthood when another had been as unjustly deposed.</p>

But the other Priests, who saw afar off the Law ridiculed, could not refrain from Tears, and grievously lamented for the Dissolution of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Priest-hood. The People could not bear with so daring an Action, but attempted forthwith to dissolve the Tyranny,</hi> &amp;c. It is worthy our observation, that <hi>Iosephus,</hi> neither in the words which he lays down as his own, nor yet in that Speech which he makes the famous Patriot <hi>Ananus</hi> speak to the People upon this occasion to excite 'em to the Vindication of their Laws, mentions any thing at all of <hi>Matthias:</hi> he does not insist on the Injury done to him; he onely complains, that a <hi>very unworthy</hi> Person was constituted High-priest, and that by such as had no autority to make any High-priest, a tumultuous Part of the Rabble. I observe moreover from this Example of Resentment, that the <hi>Iews,</hi> if they had been of Opinion, That a High-priest was no <hi>true High-priest,</hi> because put into the place of another deposed by the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power, would not have failed to express their dislike of one so constituted: since here, in this Case, they express their Abhorrence with so much Zeal and Concern. From thence, I say, it appears, That they thought they ought to submit to a worthy Person put into the High-priesthood by the <hi>Prince,</hi> altho' the Predecessor was unjustly deposed and still living; tho' they thought they ought not to submit to a Person <hi>unworthy,</hi> whom a part of the <hi>Rabble</hi> should advance. Hear <hi>Ananus</hi> (or <hi>Iosephus</hi> again, in his Name) expressing his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the violation of the Laws in this latter Case, in his Speech to the People. The People, says <hi>Iosephus,</hi> being backward in their endeavour to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Seditious, because they lookt upon 'em to be impregnable, <hi>Ananus stood in the midst of 'em, and looking often towards the Temple, with his eyes full of Tears, he thus spoke: Indeed,</hi> says he, <hi>'tis my duty rather to dye, than to see the House of God so extremely prophaned by the feet of flagitious Villains: But yet I live arrayed with the Sacerdotal Vestment, and called by the most holy and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of all Names. I seem to be desirous of Life, and do not preferr a glorious Death. If I must be alone, and you leave me, I alone will give up my Soul for the Cause of God.</hi>

Which <hi>Practice</hi> of theirs is a <hi>Rule</hi> to us. <hi>First</hi> of all, I observe, That tho' <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> who enjoyed the High-priesthood all the time of our Saviour's Preaching, was advanced upon the unjust Deprivation of another; and altho' for many Successions there was no High-priest but what had been so promoted; and the <hi>Iews,</hi> both the Priests and the People, had all along acknowleged their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority and the Validity of their Sacrifices, yet our Saviour never gave the least Hint concerning the Illegality of those High-priests. If he had not thought those High-priests as <hi>true</hi> High-priests as the rest, he would doubtless have took some occasion to express his dislike of so great a <hi>prophanation</hi>; especially since he knew what an Influence this Example and Practice of the <hi>Iews</hi> must of course have upon his own Followers in future Ages in relation to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Had our Saviour intended, that a Bishop in those Circumstances should not be acknowleged by his Followers; it is highly probable, that he would have given us an Instruction to the contrary, by expressing some dislike of so great a Prophanation of the High-priesthood. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe, That our Saviour does not onely not reprove the <hi>Iews</hi> for their owning those High-priests; but, he himself likewise communicated all along with 'em, and <hi>expressly</hi> owns their Autority. When he was before the High-priest <note n="(a)" rend="inter">S <hi>Iohn</hi> c. 18. v. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and was struck by an Officer for answering the High-priest in a manner that seemed not agreeable, and was ask'd how he <hi>dar'd to answer the High-priest so</hi>; tho' that was a very fair occasion, yet he does not deny his Autority, but expressly owns it by this Reply: <hi>If I have spoken Evil, bear witness of the Evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? Thirdly,</hi> I observe, That tho' <hi>Ananias</hi> the High-priest had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in the same manner with <hi>Caiaphas; viz.</hi> in the room of another whom the Civil Governour had arbitrarily deposed; yet S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apostle, expressly owns his Autority, and acknowleges he was <hi>God's High-priest.</hi> When through

                        <hi>I wist not, Brethren, that it was the High-priest: For it is written, Thou shalt not speak Evil of the Ruler of thy People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">§. 2. It may possibly be alleg'd in reply to what has been urg'd, That our Saviour and S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not own the Autority of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> as <hi>High-priests</hi> properly so call'd, but onely as they were <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> at that time of their great Council the <hi>Sanedrin.</hi> And it is indeed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of our famous and learned Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> that in all places of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, where there is mention made of the <hi>High-priest,</hi> we are not to understand the <hi>High-priest,</hi> properly so call'd, but the chief Governour of the <hi>Sanedrin</hi>; and where there is mention of two <hi>High-priests</hi> together, we ought to understand the two chief Rulers of the <hi>Sanedrin</hi>; viz. the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> as they were wont to be called. The full of his Conjecture is this; That in those times when the <hi>Iews</hi> were govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Roman</hi> Prefects, the <hi>High-priest,</hi> properly so called, had not, as <hi>High-priest,</hi> any Power or Autority in <hi>Iudicial</hi> Matters: That, if he had any, 'twas onely by virtue of his Office in the <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> as <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Father</hi> of that Council. And hence, says he, it was, that tho' <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was the onely High-priest, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called, when our Saviour began to preach his Gospel; yet 'tis said in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>Annas and Caiaphas were then the High-priests. Annas,</hi> says Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> is there mentioned <hi>first,</hi> because he was at that time the <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> onely the <hi>Father.</hi> After that, at the time of our Saviour's Passion, <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Annas</hi> onely the <hi>Father:</hi> And therefore when our Saviour was first led to <hi>Annas</hi>; he sent him away to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> as his Superiour. And on this account likewise it is said in the Gospel of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that <hi>Caiaphas was the High-priest that same year.</hi> After that again, <hi>Annas</hi> was the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> onely the <hi>Father:</hi> And hence it is said in the <hi>Acts; And Annas the High-priest, and Caiaphas, and Iohn, and Alexander,</hi> tho' <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> was at that time in the proper and original sence the (onely) High-priest.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer; First, That if we granted Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Conjecture to be true, tho' we could not conclude <hi>by the words</hi> above mentioned, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our owned <hi>Caiaphas</hi> as a <hi>true</hi> High-priest, properly so called; yet still our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation would hold good, That our Saviour himself communicated with the High-priest of that Age, and does not any where hint, That they that in his time Officiated in the Temple as <hi>High-priests,</hi> were not <hi>truly</hi> High-priests. And it would however appear, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowleged the <hi>reality</hi> of the then High-priests, so call'd in the proper and original Sence; since he owned himself in an Errour, as soon as he was told, that the Person whom he had reviled was <hi>GOD's High-priest.</hi> For by the Title of <hi>GOD's High-priest</hi> the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Office was pointed out to him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I deny Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Conjecture to be true. And against it I offer these following Considerations. First, Neither <hi>Iosephus,</hi> nor any other Jewish Writer, does any where tell us, that the High-priests, properly so called, were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62950:25"/>
deprived by the <hi>Romans</hi> of their Power and Autority in<note n="*" rend="inter">Excepting Capital Causes; which were prohibited by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> not onely to the High-priest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so call'd, but likewise to the <hi>Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi> it self. For <hi>it was not lawfull for the Iews,</hi> when under the Government of the Romans, <hi>to put any man to death.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Iudicial</hi> Matters, and confined to the Offices of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> does not pretend to the Autority of any Writer. And <hi>Iosephus,</hi> had there been any such thing, would scarce have fall'd to have mention'd it; especially since he mentions, that in such and such Parts of <hi>Iudea</hi> there were <hi>Courts of Iudicature</hi> erected by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Iosephus</hi> is so far from warranting any such Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that, on the contrary, he speaks throughout his whole <hi>History</hi> of the High-priests, properly so called, as of Persons of great Power and Autority in Civil Affairs. What he says of <hi>Ananus</hi> the younger is very express. Having said that the King had deprived <hi>Iosephus Cabei</hi> of the High-priesthood, and substituted in his place <hi>Ananus the Son of Ananus</hi>; he immediately adds,<note n="†" rend="inter">
                           <hi>Antiq. l.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note>
                        <hi>The younger</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>who was constituted, as we said, High-priest, was a man of a rigid and severe Temper, by Sect a</hi> Sadducee; <hi>which sort of men is the most severe of all</hi> Jews <hi>in</hi> Judicial <hi>Matters. Being of that disposition, he took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, after</hi> Festus (the Governour's) <hi>death, before</hi> (his Successour) Albinus <hi>was arrived in</hi> Judea, <hi>to call a Council of the Iudges, and commanding</hi> James, <hi>the Brother of Iesus, to be brought before him, he condemned him, together with some others, and delivered 'em to the People to be stoned to death. This thing extremely displeased all those of the City that were well disposed and zealous for the Laws; and they privately sent Messengers to the King to entreat him to lay his Commands upon</hi> Ananus <hi>not to do the like for the future, it being a thing that he ought not to have done. Some moreover went to meet</hi> Albinus <hi>as he came from</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and suggested to him, That it was not lawfull for</hi> Ananus, <hi>without his Consent, to call a Council,</hi> (That it was not lawfull for the <hi>Iews,</hi> without the particular Consent of the Governour, to sit Judges in a Capital Cause.) <hi>Hereupon</hi> Albinus <hi>wrote angrily to the High-priest, and threatned him for what he had done. And after three months King</hi> Agrippa <hi>deprived him for that Fact of the High-priesthood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed the Dignity on</hi> Jesus <hi>the Son of</hi> Damnaeus. Here seems to be a plain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, that the High-priest, as such, had autority in Civil Affairs; tho' nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor any other of the <hi>Iews,</hi> might, without the Consent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, sit Judge in a <hi>Capital</hi> Cause. Thirdly, It is likewise confirmed by that frequent and continual Changing of the High-priest under the <hi>Romans.</hi> For if the High-priests, properly so call'd, were, as such, concerned about the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces onely, not at all in Matters of Government, how could they so frequently come under the Displeasure of the supreme Civil Governour? Why so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn'd out of their Places? Fourthly, When S. <hi>Paul</hi> was told that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whom he had revil'd, was <hi>God's High-priest</hi>; that is, High-priest properly so call'd; he strait inferrs, That then he was <hi>the Ruler of the People.</hi> Fifthly, Those difficult places of Scripture, on which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Conjecture is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd, may well admit of another Explication.</p>
                     <p>I am so far from denying that the two chief Rulers, the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> might commonly be honour'd with the Title of <hi>High-priests,</hi> that I almost perswade my self, that in those later Times that Title was common to all those of the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> Order who were Members of the <hi>Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin.</hi>

But on this I do not rely. I have one thing more to offer, to account for those <hi>many High-priests</hi> which are mentioned as flourishing at the same time. Which is this: That the 24<note n="*" rend="inter">With this Notion agrees very well that Relation in <hi>Iosephus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the High-priests in the time of King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Antiq. l. 20. c. 6. <hi>Et ipsi summi Pontifices dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere caeperunt à Sacerdotibus &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matibus Hierosolymitanorum Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um — In tantum autem exarsit summorum Pontificum impudentia, ut anderent servos suos in areas mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere, qui auferrent debitas Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus decimas, aliquótque pauperiores è sacerdotum ordine alimentorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiâ fame deficerent.</hi>

                        <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphas was High-priest for that year.</hi> Tho' he knew, that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had enjoyed the High-priesthood both for some years before, and likewise for many years after; yet he chuses to conform his Expression to the common Mode. I might offer likewise this Conjecture, That tho' <hi>Caiaphas</hi> held the High-priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood much more than a year, yet his Power and Autority was onely <hi>annual,</hi> and renew'd to him every year. This Conjecture may receive a Confirmation from that Tradition of the antient <hi>Rabbies</hi> in their<note n="†" rend="inter">Quoted by <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den de Succes. in Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</hi> p. 168.</note>

                     <p n="4">§. 4. I shall here, for the close of all, take notice of an Answer which some of our Adversaries have been pleased to make, when urg'd with these Examples of the <hi>Iews,</hi> our Saviour, and his Apostles. Upon this account, say they, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Iews,</hi> our Saviour, and his Apostles, submitted to the present Possessor tho' put into the place of another unjustly deposed by the Secular Autority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Temple being in the power of the Secular Magistrate, they could not perform the more Solemn Acts of their Religion, unless they accepted of that High-priest whom the Secular Magistrate had set over the Temple. To this I answer, That if they had look'd upon the present Possessor to be no <hi>true</hi> High-priest, their being confined to the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> could not have been any inducement to 'em to submit themselves to him, and to communicate with him in the Sacrifices which he offered. If the Secular Magistrate would shut up their Temple, they were not oblig'd to have any Sacrifices, or any High-priest at all: And, because they have now no Temple, they have therefore no Priests or Sacrifices. So, if they had not been permitted to offer up their Sacrifices by a High-priest <hi>duly</hi> qualified, they would not have thought themselves obliged to offer any Sacrifices at all, any more than they would, if he that was their Governour, should have kept all lawful Sacrifices from 'em, and allow'd 'em only <hi>Swine.</hi> And how can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that, if God had not look'd upon those High-priests to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> High-priests, he would ever have accepted of the Sacrifices which they offer'd, or have sent down upon 'em, as <hi>High-Priests,</hi> his Spirit of Prophecy? If a <hi>Swine</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62950:28"/>
had been offer'd, would God have accepted that Sacrifice because the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would permit no other to be offer'd?</p>

                     <p>That the Ancient Christians submitted all along to such Bishops (if account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Orthodox) as were put into the places of others deposed by the Secular Power, tho never so unjustly. No Examples, either for or against us, in the three first Centuries, all the Emperors being then Heathens.

                     </p>
                     <p>WHAT was the Practice of the <hi>Iews,</hi> our Saviour, and the Apostles in relation to the High-priests, who were put into the places of others, unjustly deposed by the Civil Autority, that they all along own'd 'em as true High-priests, and that God himself approved of 'em, we have shewn in the two foregoing Chapters. I come now to shew, in the third place, That the same was the Practice of the Antient Christians throughout all Ages; (I mean, the <hi>generality</hi> of 'em in every particular Age) with respect to their Bishops, provided only, that they thought 'em upon no other account justly exceptionable.</p>
                     <p>For the three first Ages the Emperors were all <hi>Heathens,</hi> and if they deposed any Bishops, they did it to destroy Christianity, and all Bishops in general: It is not therefore to be expected, that the three first Ages should afford us any Examples. But as they afford <hi>us</hi> no Examples, so neither can our Adversaries produce any one single Example of those Ages, that makes for their Cause. <hi>We can say</hi> (says our Adversary, the Learned <hi>Vindicator) that even in the Age of St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>it is very notorious, that they then own'd no such Power of the</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Magistrate to deprive Bishops of their purely</hi> Spiritual <hi>Power; and that the</hi> Church, <hi>as a</hi> Society <hi>distinct from the</hi> State, <hi>subsisted on their not owning it, even as to a deprivation of their particular</hi> Districts <hi>and</hi> Jurisdictions. <hi>It is notorious, and as notorious as any one Tradition of the</hi> Catholick Church <hi>in those Ages, (not excepting that of the Canon of the</hi> New Testament <hi>it self) that</hi> Christians <hi>then, and not only then, but in all the</hi> former <hi>Persecutions that had been from the times of the</hi> Apostles <hi>to that very Age, did own themselves bound to adhere to their</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>when it was notorious withal, that those Bishops were set up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62950:28"/>
against the consent of the</hi> Civil <hi>Magistrate. It is as notorious also, that this Adherence of theirs was not onely matter of</hi> Fact <hi>(which is all our Adversaries pretend here) but a</hi> Duty <hi>own'd by them as</hi> obliging <hi>in Conscience, and as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of</hi> Principles. Again, says the <hi>Vindicator: Till our Adversaries can disarm us of the</hi> Advantage <hi>we have from the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>signified on occasion of these</hi> earliest <hi>Instances of</hi> Schism, <hi>in S.</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s Age, their</hi> Author's Collection <hi>of</hi> later <hi>Instances, were it never so</hi> pertinent <hi>to their purpose, can do them no Service.</hi> Should a Person, unacquainted with the Histories and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of those Times, read what the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has here so positively asserted, he could not but conclude, that the three first Ages were <hi>full</hi> of Examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. But they that are not utterly Strangers to the Practice and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of those Ages, know very well, that all that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> lays down, is unworthy of so learned a Man; either utterly <hi>untrue,</hi> or not in the least to his Purpose. That the <hi>Christians</hi> of those Ages did not own any Power in the <hi>Secular</hi> Magistrate to deprive Bishops of their <hi>purely Spiritual</hi> Power, is what we never denied. That they ever <hi>disown'd</hi> the Power of the <hi>Secular</hi> Magistrate to deprive a Bishop of his particular District, if he should refuse to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Autority of that Magistrate; or if upon any other <hi>Civil</hi> account he deserv'd to be depriv'd, our Adversaries cannot demonstrate. But it is not now our Business to inquire concerning that. We are onely at present to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether ever they refus'd to submit to the present Possessor, because his Predecessor was <hi>unjustly</hi> depos'd by the <hi>Secular</hi> Power. That they were wont to adhere to their Bishops, tho' set up and maintain'd against the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate, we acknowlege. But what is that to our Adversaries Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? If they still adher'd to their Bishops, when the persecuting Emperors endeavour'd to root out Christianity by driving away the Bishops, what is that to the Case now before us? Should our Magistrates, like the Persecutors of those Ages, endeavour to <hi>destroy Christianity,</hi> by depriving us of our Bishops, and by suffering none to be substituted in their places; then those Bishops would be our onely Bishops, and as such we should still adhere to 'em. If in those Ages the Emperours had onely deposed such Bishops as would not own their Autority, or as otherwise deserved to be depriv'd, and had suffer'd other Persons, as <hi>worthy,</hi> to be put into their Places, who can doubt but that the <hi>Christians</hi> of those Ages would have done as we now do, as was done in the very next Age, and as the <hi>Iews</hi> had all along done? I shall answer all that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has said, or ever will be able to say, concerning the Practice of those Ages, with this <hi>Challenge,</hi>

                        <hi>That he shew me any one single Instance of a Bishop disown'd by the Church in those three first Centuries, for being put into the place of another depos'd by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Autority.</hi> If he cannot do that: I shall onely desire him to produce the Autority of <hi>any one single Writer</hi> of those Ages, that directly makes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, That a Bishop so constituted ought not, <hi>upon that account,</hi> to be own'd.

                        <hi>Code,</hi> directed by the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> to Pope <hi>Felix.</hi> From these Relations of S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and the Presbyters <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus,</hi> there are three Things to be observ'd. 1. That the <hi>Clergy</hi> oblig'd themselves by an <hi>Oath</hi> not to accept of any other Bishop whilst <hi>Liberius</hi> was living. Now what need had they to enter into such an engagement, if, in their Opinions, and according to the Principles of those Times, Whosoever should be put into <hi>Liberius</hi>'s place whilst alive, would on that account be <hi>no Bishop?</hi> They knew of no such Doctrine. 2. That tho' they had took an Oath, and tho' <hi>Felix</hi> was Ordain'd by the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and tho' their Aflection for <hi>Liberius</hi> was great, tho' all these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to oblige 'em not to receive <hi>Felix</hi> for their Bishop; yet because they knew him to be truly <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and no promoter of the <hi>Arian</hi> Interest, as they expected he would be whom the <hi>Arians</hi> should Ordain in <hi>Liberius</hi>'s place, they thought themselves oblig'd to act contrary to the Oath they had taken, and to acknowlege him as their Bishop. 'Twas <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> they had regard to, not by whom he was Ordain'd, or in whose place he was substituted. Their Love for <hi>Liberius</hi> was inferiour to their Love of the <hi>Church.</hi> And as for their <hi>Oath</hi>; when they took it, they did it for the security of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Faith: When they saw that such a one was Ordain'd, as they did not expect, one whom they well knew to be no promoter of the <hi>Arian</hi> Belief, they thought it no longer oblig'd 'em. 'Tis observable, in the Third place, That as almost all the <hi>Clergy</hi> submitted to <hi>Felix,</hi> as their Bishop; so after he was expell'd, they still adher'd to him in opposition to <hi>Liberius.</hi> This is clear not onely by the Testimony of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> who says they were ejected together with <hi>Felix</hi>; but likewise by the more express words of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus.</hi> Here possibly it may be objected: If the Clergy thought themselves in Conscience oblig'd to submit to the present Possessor, because he was <hi>Orthodox,</hi> Why did they not leave <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> and return again to <hi>Liberius,</hi> when he was again the <hi>Possessor?</hi> The Reason is plain. 'Twas because <hi>Liberius,</hi> in the time of his Banishment, had subscrib'd to the <hi>Arians</hi>; and they look'd upon him as no longer an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Bishop. That <hi>Liberius</hi> did so, is certain: For tho' some of the Greek Writers, as <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> do not seem to have known any thing of it; and tho' others amongst the <hi>Latins,</hi> as <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> and <hi>Phaebadius,</hi> make no mention of it; yet 'tis positively asserted by S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in the Words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited, and<note n="(a)" rend="inter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62950:31"/>
is above said, was promoted in the room of <hi>Liberius,</hi> in the Year 355. and was again turn'd out upon the Restauration of <hi>Liberius,</hi> somewhat less than two Years after: Eight Years (as has been already observ'd) he liv'd after that, and died on the 10th. of the Kalends of <hi>December,</hi> when <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls, i. e.</hi> in the Year 365. <hi>Liberius</hi> surviv'd <hi>Felix</hi> but about 10 Months, for he died on the 8th. of the Kalends of <hi>October,</hi> in the Consulship of <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galaiphus, i. e.</hi> the Year following. This is plain from the express Words of the Presbyters <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus.</hi> I need not add any thing, to consute that <hi>Story,</hi> which we find in two <hi>fabulous</hi> Lives of Pope <hi>Damasus,</hi> That when Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> was banish'd, he constituted our <hi>Damasus</hi> his <hi>Vicar</hi> to supply his place in his absence; and that he accordingly did so, till <hi>Liberius</hi> was restor'd. If that be true, then he did not adhere to Pope <hi>Felix:</hi> But it needs but very little Judgment, were there no good Autority for what we have here laid down, to discover the falseness of that <hi>Monkish</hi> Story; and 'tis easie to shew how little the Writers of it knew, relating to <hi>Liberius</hi>'s Banishment. I shall take it for granted, that there is no one so <hi>Injudicious</hi> as to hearken to it.</p>
                     <p>I must here add, That tho' our Authors, when they speak of the People's Aversion to <hi>Felix,</hi> are wont to make use of <hi>general</hi> Terms; and tell us, that <hi>all</hi> the People refus'd to communicate with him; yet I do not believe, that they ought to be understood strictly, but onely of the much greater Part. That <hi>Felix</hi> had a very considerable Party, not onely amongst the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but likewise amongst the <hi>Laity,</hi> seems to me very probable from hence, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Year after <hi>Felix</hi>'s Death, when <hi>Vrsinus</hi> (or <hi>Vrsicinus</hi>) was chose Pope by the <hi>Liberians,</hi> and <hi>Damasus</hi> by the <hi>Felicians,</hi> there arose a great Contention, not onely among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but likewise among the <hi>Laity</hi>; and <hi>Damasus</hi> then had the greatest part of the <hi>People</hi> on his side, and many of 'em were so zealous and violent for him, as that much bloud was spilt. This Schism and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention seems to have proceeded partly from some former Heats and <hi>Sidings</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> I know, that the Presbyters <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus</hi> say, that <hi>Damasus</hi> had brib'd the People with a great Summ of Money: But that is onely a malicious Suggestion, such as might be expected from Persons so much his Enemies. I shall not take notice, that in the <hi>Pontifical</hi> it is said, That, when <hi>Felix</hi> was <hi>Martyr'd,</hi> there suffer'd with him <hi>multi Clerici &amp; Fideles</hi>; not onely many of the Clergy, but likewise many <hi>others</hi> of the <hi>Faithfull</hi>: The Story of his being put to Death is too uncertain, much more the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. Yet at least this appears from that Story, that amongst the <hi>Antients</hi> 'twas believ'd, that many of the <hi>Laity,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> adher'd to him.</p>
                     <p>Having thus shewn, what Reception Pope <hi>Felix</hi> met with at <hi>Rome,</hi> I shall shew in the next place, that, tho' he was made Bishop in the room of the <hi>unjustly</hi> deposed <hi>Liberius,</hi> yet, <hi>first,</hi> the Catholick Bishops of his own district communicated with him, and receiv'd him as their <hi>Metropolitan. Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Ordinations</hi> were receiv'd and allow'd of as <hi>valid,</hi> by even his Adversary <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. Thirdly,</hi> The whole <hi>Western</hi> Church has all along own'd him as one of the <hi>true</hi> Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62950:32"/>
they had had a Succession of Bishops from the Times of the Apostles. Since therefore <hi>Liberius</hi> was again restor'd, and so was the immediate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor of <hi>Damasus,</hi> as he was the Successor of <hi>Iulius,</hi> it was not at all for their purpose to make any mention of <hi>Felix. It is not the business of Optatus,</hi> says a learned Annotator, <hi>to give us the Names of all the Popes, but onely the Successions. And it would have been ridiculous in him to have mention'd</hi> Felix <hi>as the Successor of</hi> Liberius, <hi>since</hi> Liberius <hi>not onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd</hi> Felix, <hi>but likewise enjoy'd the Pontificate after his death. Vpon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count likewise, S.</hi> Augustine <hi>in his</hi> 165<hi>th. Epistle, where, upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, he reckons up the Successions of the Bishops of</hi> Rome, <hi>makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Felix. Thus the learned <hi>Meric Casaubon,</hi> tho' he was not at all concern'd whether <hi>Felix</hi> were own'd as a true Pope or no. 'Tis observ'd by <hi>Anastasius,</hi> in his Edition of the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> that the Time of <hi>Felix</hi>'s Government is usually comprehended in that of <hi>Liberius.</hi> Thus it is in the <hi>Catalogues</hi> of Kings; if a King has Reign'd twice, the Name of that King who Reign'd, in the Time of the others Expulsion, is very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted. And this was the reason why <hi>Felix</hi> is omitted by <hi>Theodoret</hi> in that Catalogue of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> which he has subjoin'd at the end of his History.</p>
                     <p>These things I thought fit to premise, to prevent Mistakes, and to cut off all Objections before-hand. We will now proceed to the Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be prov'd.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Catholick Bishops of his District acknowleg'd him as their <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and that others likewise, as many as had an occasion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with him, may be prov'd by many Arguments: First, From the three <hi>Epistles</hi> which are extant in <hi>Isidorus Mercator,</hi> one from S. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> and the <hi>Synod of Alexandria</hi> to him, in which he is own'd as true Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and address'd to as such; another from him and a <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in answer to that of S. <hi>Athanasius</hi>; and a third from him and a <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to the <hi>Church-Catholick.</hi> For tho' it be certain, that all those Epistles are altogether fictitious; yet from them it is manifest, that at that time in which they were written, <hi>viz.</hi> about 900 Years ago, it was taken for granted, that <hi>Felix</hi> was generally own'd by all Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. 2dly, From the Autority of the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> in which it is said, that he call'd a Synod of 48 Bishops, and condemn'd the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> and the <hi>Arians.</hi> And this is affirm'd not onely in the Vulgar <hi>Pontifical</hi> ascrib'd to <hi>Anastasius,</hi> but likewise in that which was publish'd in the time of the Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Elder, above 1150 Years ago; <hi>viz.</hi> about the Year 534. If it be doubted whether there were really such a Synod call'd by Pope <hi>Felix,</hi> as the <hi>Pontifical</hi> affirms; yet at least thus much must be granted, that near 1200 Years ago there was an undoubted Tradition in the Church, that the Bishops of the District of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowleg'd him for their <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> But 3dly. It appears from the <hi>Inscription</hi> which was found on his Body, when that was took up at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. that there was such a <hi>Synod</hi> call'd by him.

Tho' there's no one more apt than my self to suspect the Integrity of <hi>Romanists</hi> in things of this Nature; and tho' the time in which this Body was found is enough to make one suspect at first thought, that the Inscription of that Body which was found, was onely a <hi>pia fraus</hi> of the Cardinal <hi>Sanctorius</hi>'s Party: Yet if we feriously consider, 'twill be hard to think it an Imposture, since all the great Men of <hi>Rome</hi> saw the Body, amongst them <hi>Baronius,</hi> who owns himself <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by it. 'Tis true, I do not believe that the being a <hi>second</hi> time bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd was that for which <hi>Constantius</hi> was condemn'd by that Synod: But that is not said in the Inscription; and 'twas onely the mistake of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Pontifical.</hi> Neither do I believe that that Synod was call'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pope <hi>Felix</hi> was ejected: I rather think that 'twas after he was eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that it consisted of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That our <hi>Felix</hi> Ordain'd many Bishops and others, is apparent, not only from the express Testimony of the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from Reason it self, since he govern'd, as I but now said, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the space of a Year, and <hi>Liberius</hi> was in Banishment above <hi>two</hi> Years: Now that all those whom <hi>Felix</hi> had ordain'd, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and approv'd of by <hi>Liberius</hi> when he was agen restor'd, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this, That there is not a word in any Author of so much as a Question rais'd against 'em And of this <hi>Baronius</hi> himself, tho' no great Friend of <hi>Felix</hi>'s, does not at all doubt.</p>
                     <p>I here observe farther, <hi>First,</hi> That the Schismatical Presbyters, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus,</hi> and the Writer of <hi>Onuphrius</hi>'s Register, who likewise liv'd in those days, tho' they were all <hi>Vrsinians,</hi> and hated all those that adher'd to <hi>Felix,</hi> yet giving an account what became of the <hi>Clergy</hi> that adher'd to <hi>Felix,</hi> they onely say, that after the death of <hi>Felix</hi> they<note n="*" rend="inter">

the <hi>true Popes.</hi> And here agen I must repeat what has been already observ'd, That so great was the Honour which the Church had for him in the time of Pope <hi>Damasus,</hi> that 'tis said by the <hi>Vrsinian</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus,</hi> that <hi>Damasus</hi> was chose, not into the room of <hi>Liberius,</hi> but in <hi>Felix</hi>'s place. Tho' that cannot be true, since, as those Presbyters themselves attest, those of the Clergy who chose Pope <hi>Damasus,</hi> had after <hi>Felix</hi>'s death, been reconcil'd to <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and they did not pretend to chuse <hi>Damasus</hi> till after the <hi>decease</hi> of <hi>Liberius:</hi> Yet (I say) it is manifest from that Insinuation, that all <hi>Damasus</hi>'s Party, that is, the Church, at least the Clergy of the Church, had still a great honour for <hi>Felix,</hi> and still lookt upon him as one of their <hi>true</hi> Popes.</p>
                     <p>As he is own'd for a <hi>true</hi> Pope by the whole <hi>Western</hi> Church, so likewise in the <hi>Eastern</hi> by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who flourish'd in the Year 806. and that too, tho' <hi>Nicephorus</hi>

In <hi>his</hi> Chronology, as <hi>Liberius</hi> is reckon'd the 35th. Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> so our <hi>Felix</hi> is call'd the 36th.</p>
                     <p>To all this I add, That among all the antient Writers, who have mention'd our <hi>Felix</hi> his succeeding <hi>Liberius,</hi> there is not so much as one, that either says expressly, or gives any Hint, that <hi>upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> it was not lawfull for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to submit to him: or that <hi>upon that account</hi> he could not be a <hi>true Bishop.</hi> The Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Presbyters, <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus,</hi> are the <hi>onely</hi> Writers that have any thing <hi>looking</hi> that way. They say, that the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> accepted of Pope <hi>Felix contra fas quod minimè decebat cum sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo perjurii scelere.</hi> But it does not <hi>appear</hi> from these words, that they thought it was a <hi>Sin</hi> to receive a Bishop when the other had been unjustly depos'd: They onely seem to reflect upon their being <hi>forsworn</hi>; so they afterwards say that <hi>Liberius</hi> pardon'd their <hi>Perjury,</hi> and do not take notice of any other <hi>Sin</hi> pardon'd. If they meant any more, it is not at all to be wonder'd at, in regard that <hi>Felix</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by the <hi>Arians,</hi> and 'tis certain that the said Presbyters were great Admirers of <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus,</hi> and did not allow of a Bishop ordain'd by the <hi>Arians.</hi> I add, That whatsoever their Opinion might be, it deserves not at all to be regarded, since what they write is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against Pope <hi>Damasus,</hi> who was one of that Party: And since when they wrote, they were <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and had never any regard to the Peace and Tranquillity of the Church.

                           <hi>Sozomen</hi> had heard that <hi>Felix</hi> was still own'd by one part of the Clergy; and thence he inferr'd, that he and <hi>Liberius</hi> were Bishops together in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </note> not altogether true as to matter of fact, yet from what he says it is easy to discover that this was his opinion, That <hi>Felix</hi> was a <hi>true Bishop,</hi> and that it was lawfull to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege him as such. Yet no one more tender of the Church's Honour than he: as appears from these same Words.</p>
                     <p>Tho' we have been a long while in the Company of Pope <hi>Felix,</hi> and the Reader (I presume) begins to grow weary of it: Yet before we <hi>shake hands</hi> there must one thing more be clear'd. 'Tis said in the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> that when <hi>Liberius</hi> was depos'd, 'twas by his own <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> that <hi>Felix</hi> was made Bishop in his room. In this the <hi>Pontifical</hi> is follow'd by several of the Moderns; in particular by <hi>Antoninus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Florence,</hi> who<note n="*" rend="inter">
                           <hi>Chron. parte</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> tells us, That <hi>either</hi> Liberius <hi>resign'd, and so, together with others, chose</hi> Felix <hi>for his Successor, or else he made him his Vicar-General to supply his place in his absence.</hi> If any thing of this be true, then all that we have hitherto said makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for our purpose: It therefore highly concerns us to lay open the falseness of that <hi>Story.</hi> We shall do it with a great deal of ease; and that from these Considerations. <hi>First,</hi> That the Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Liberius</hi> was about to leave the City, engag'd themselves to him by an Oath not to accept of any other Bishop whilst he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and that when they did accept of <hi>Felix,</hi> they were lookt upon as <hi>perjur'd.</hi> This is expressly attested by S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> the Presbyters <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus,</hi> and the Writer of the <hi>Register</hi> quoted by <hi>Onuphrius</hi> who all liv'd at that time. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the same S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and likewise <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> and S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself, expressly affirm, and others plainly intimate, that <hi>Felix</hi> was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62950:35"/>
                        <hi>Liberius</hi>'s Place by the <hi>Arians. Thirdly,</hi> That, <hi>Liberius</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen restor'd, <hi>Felix,</hi> with all those of the <hi>Clergy</hi> that had submitted to him, were with <hi>violence</hi> expell'd, and <hi>Liberius enter'd</hi> Rome <hi>as a Conquerour.</hi> So S. <hi>Ierome</hi> affirms, and with him agree the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical</hi> it self, <hi>Theodoret, Socrates, Onuphrius</hi>'s Register, and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus.</hi> To conclude; That Story of the <hi>Pontifical</hi> that <hi>Liberius consented</hi> to the making of <hi>Felix</hi> Pope, is by <hi>Baronius</hi> himself rejected as not in the least to be hearken'd to. The falseness of it seems to have been discover'd by <hi>Platina</hi> himself, and, long before him, by the Author of the Book <hi>De Vitis Pontificum</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd to <hi>Luitprandus:</hi> who, tho' in other things they follow the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,</hi> and say, as that does, that the <hi>Sacerdotes</hi> call'd a <hi>Synod,</hi> and made <hi>Felix</hi> Bishop; yet they leave out those words, <hi>Cum Consilio Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berii.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall onely add, That if <hi>Liberius</hi> gave his Consent to the Election of <hi>Felix,</hi> then <hi>Felix</hi> was the <hi>rightfull</hi> and the <hi>onely</hi> Bishop. Since therefore <hi>Liberius</hi> was again receiv'd and own'd by the Catholick Church, when <hi>Felix</hi> was depos'd by the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s bare Autority, we should (if we granted that Story to be true) onely <hi>change</hi> one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for another, not <hi>lose</hi> one.</p>
                     <p>And thus have we done with the famous Example of <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius.</hi> An Example which our Adversaries (as I found after this was written) are so unhappy as to allege for <hi>their</hi> Cause.

                        <hi>know all. To confirm our Assertion,</hi> (says the Author first quoted) that the Antients thought it unlawfull to submit to the present Possessor, when the Predecessor was deposed by the Emperour, <hi>you may command a great many Instances from the Churches of</hi> France, Italy, Asia, Egypt, <hi>and the like; at present I shall onely produce that of</hi> Felix <hi>and</hi> Liberius. I am sorry those <hi>many Instances of</hi> France, Italy, Asia, Egypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were conceal'd by our Author. What sort of Instances they are, we may guess by that of P. <hi>Felix,</hi> which, as one of his best, he thinks fit to produce. When he shall be pleas'd to draw out the rest of his <hi>Artillery,</hi> I dare engage, they will either appear to be nothing at all but <hi>Wood,</hi> or may easily be <hi>turn'd</hi> against him. I expect the former, in regard that to prove his Assertion, he produces the Example of S. <hi>Hilary</hi> Bishop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> who, says he, was banish'd by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Constantius,</hi> yet was still own'd as Bishop of that See: And that he proves from those words of his, in his Book which he wrote to the Emperour; <hi>Licet in exilio permanens, &amp; Ecclesiae adhuc per Presbyteros meos Communionem distribuens.</hi> If S. <hi>Hilary</hi> continu'd still Bishop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> what is that to the Cause now before us, since there was not any <hi>Orthodox</hi> Person made Bishop in his stead? So far was he from having an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Person for his Successor, that (while he was in Banishment) he had not any <hi>Successor</hi> at all.

They were Men, says he, of <hi>no Principles,</hi> turn'd frequently <hi>Apostates</hi> to the <hi>Eutychian Hereticks,</hi> very <hi>frequently and easily-varied from the Principles which they themselves profess'd and own'd for Principles.

Why should we then wonder if they had corresponded with Schismaticks, even such as themselves took for such?</hi> Much more of the same Nature he very <hi>Vnworthily</hi> throws at 'em.

                     <p n="1">1.

They still continued to Communicate with <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> but to their dying day did never Subscribe to the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> From hence it is manifest, that they receiv'd <hi>Timotheus</hi> into Communion, not because they dar'd not hazard their Places, but because they thought they might Lawfully do it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is utterly untrue that they <hi>knew Timotheus</hi> to be a <hi>Heretick.</hi> Had our Author judged Candidly as he ought to have done, he would easily have judged of himself, that the Synodical Letters, which <hi>Timotheus</hi> sent to <hi>Flavia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> contained in 'em nothing <hi>Heretical,</hi> since such Men as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd 'em. And had he look'd nicely into the Histories and Concerns of those Times, he would have found, that <hi>Timotheus</hi> did not presently <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> to be a <hi>Heretick.</hi> They that knew him very well, or were nicely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd concerning him, did believe that he was so, and accordingly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from his Communion: But certain it is, that to the <hi>Catholicks</hi> who did not well know him he pretended to be one of their Party.

                        <hi>Liberatus Diaconus,</hi> who flourish'd at that time. He tells us, <q>That Pope <hi>Agapetus</hi> being dead, and <hi>Silverius</hi> being chosen by the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in his stead, the Empress perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Vigilius, Agapetus</hi>'s Deacon, who was at that time at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a secret Engagement, That if he should be made Pope, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and communicate with <hi>(the Hereticks) Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Anthimus,</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> and confirm their belief by an Epistle. He having engaged himself to do so, she writes a Letter by him to <hi>Belisarius,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to depose <hi>Silverius</hi> and to make <hi>Vigilius</hi> Bishop in his room. <hi>Belisarius</hi> to fulfill the Empress's Will, and for the lucre of a summ of Money which <hi>Vigilius</hi> had offer'd him, gets <hi>Silverius</hi> to be accused as having written to the <hi>Goths</hi> and engaged to deliver up the City into their hands. And 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (saies <hi>Liberatus</hi>) that one <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and one <hi>Iulianus</hi> forged Letters in his name to that purpose. Now <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarius</hi> and his Wife had privately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <hi>Silverius</hi> to do the same thing which the Empress had engaged <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to do, but he refused, and betakes himself to a Church. <hi>Belisarius</hi> sends a messenger to him to invite him again to the Palace; he accordingly goes relying upon an Oath which was made him that he should have leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. He returns again to the Church, and again is commanded by <hi>Belisarius</hi> to come to the Palace; but he would not go out of the Church, well knowing that some evil was design'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62950:54"/>
him. At last he yielded to go, and commending himself and his cause to God by Prayer, he went thither: He enter'd in alone, and was afterwards never seen by those that attended him. Another day <hi>Belisarius</hi> call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Presbyters, and the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and all the rest of the Clergy, and commanded them to choose ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pope. Which when they scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to do, and some laugh'd at the command, <hi>Vigilius</hi> was by his order or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd Pope. Now <hi>Silverius</hi> being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd to <hi>Patara</hi> a City of <hi>Lycia,</hi> the Bishop of that City addressed himself to the Emperor, and reason'd with him concerning the Expulsion of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius,</hi> telling him that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kings in the World, but but one Pope, the Head of the Church of the whole World.</q> (<hi>This the Popes at that time had pretended to be, and their Flatterers humour'd them in it.</hi>) <q>By this the Emperor was induced to recall <hi>Silverius,</hi> and gave order that those Letters which were produced against him should be enquired into,</q> 
                        <hi>That if it could be proved that he wrote them, he should be banish'd to any City they should think fit</hi>; <q>but if they appear'd to be false, he should be restored to his See. This news being carried to the Empress, she endeavoured to prevent <hi>Silverius</hi>'s return to <hi>Rome</hi>; but she could not prevail, and <hi>Silverius</hi> was brought back to <hi>Italy</hi> by the Emperor's command. Now <hi>Vigilius</hi> being terrified at his coming, least he should lose his See, required <hi>Belisarius,</hi> to deliver him up into his hands, telling him, that if he did not do so, he should not be able to pay him that fumm of Money which he had promis'd him.

                           <hi>Belisarius</hi> gave him up into the hands of <hi>Vigilius</hi>'s Servants, who carried him into the Isle <hi>Palmaria,</hi> where in their custody he died of want.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the account which <hi>Liberatus</hi> has given us, and the same account, as to the main we have in the <hi>Pontifical.</hi> It appears from hence, That <hi>Silverius</hi> was not onely deposed without any <hi>Synod,</hi> but likewise by an inferior Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not by the order of the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi>; that (besides that) he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed very unjustly and tyrannically without any formal <hi>Tryal</hi>; and lastly, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was made Pope without any <hi>Election,</hi> expresly against the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the bare Arbitrary Power of <hi>Belisarius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though such were the Circumstances of <hi>Silverius</hi>'s deprivation, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deprivation he never gave up his right, and though <hi>Vigilius</hi> was (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that) so <hi>uncanonically</hi> constituted, yet because he <hi>appear'd</hi> to be Orthodox,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62950:54"/>
he was own'd and acknowleged by all; by the People of <hi>Rome</hi> even though they very much hated him for his Cruelty to his Predecessor and for other ill Actions, and by all the Catholick Church, particularly by the 5<hi>th. General Council.</hi> He govern'd as long as he liv'd, near 18 years, and to this day is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd by all as one of the true Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> I need not produce the Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of any of the Antients to prove that he was <hi>generally</hi> acknowleged, it being a truth so <hi>notorious.</hi> But there are four things which I must not omit taking notice of.</p>

                        <hi>Labbée</hi> in his Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Councils.</hi> It does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appear that there was ever any the least <hi>Schism</hi> on the account of <hi>Silverius,</hi> though the Cricumstances of his Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of <hi>Vigilius</hi>'s Promotion were so extraordinary. Such indeed were the circumstances both of the Ejectment of the former, and likewise of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the latter, so very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and provoking, that it is to be admired that there was none; and the Forger of those Epistles above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, had reason enough from the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of the circumstances (tho' not from Tradition or History) to believe there might have been some <hi>Schism,</hi> and accordingly to make <hi>Silverius</hi> and four other Bishops excommunicate <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his Adherents. I here observe, by the bye, that he that forged those Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, does not make <hi>Silverius</hi> complain of his being deposed without a <hi>Synod,</hi> he does not make him excommunicate his deposers and <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, for that; for he takes no notice at all of it: but he makes him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate his Deposers because they deposed him by <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi>; and he makes him excommunicate <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his Adherents, because he had usurp'd his See by <hi>Simony.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Baronius,</hi> and out of him <hi>Binius</hi> (who is every where the Transcriber of <hi>Baronius</hi>) are willing to perswade the World, that after the death of <hi>Silverius, Vigilius</hi> resign'd the Popedom that so he might be <hi>new Chosen,</hi> and that being <hi>new Chosen</hi> he was made a <hi>true Pope</hi> by virtue of his <hi>last</hi> Consecration, not by virtue of his first. A strange and prodigious Fancy! Let us see what ground they have for it. Their only Argument is this, That in the <hi>Pontifical</hi> it is said, that <hi>after the death of</hi> Silverius <hi>there was a five days vacancy in the See.</hi> Now, say they, since <hi>Vigilius</hi> was made Pope before <hi>Silverius</hi>'s death, how there should be <hi>a Five days Vacancy after</hi> Silverius'<hi>s death,</hi> unless it was because <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> resign'd upon his death and was <hi>again</hi> chosen Pope after <hi>a Five days Vacancy,</hi> we cannot imagine. To this I answer, 1. That had there been such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, it must have been look'd upon as so extraordinary a thing, as that some one or other would have mention'd it: But <hi>Liberatus Diaconus</hi> who lived at that time, and gives a particular account of the Deprivation and death of <hi>Silverius,</hi> and of the Promotion of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> makes no mention of any such thing. So far is he from doing so, that the contrary may easily be gather'd from what he says. Having told his Reader, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> to make good his Promise to the Empress, had sent his Communicatory Letters to the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks <hi>Theodosius, Anthimus</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> and confirm'd their Belief; he subjoins, <hi>Et haec Vigilius scribens Haereticis occultè, permansit sedens. And so he was continued in his See.</hi> 2. It does not appear that the Author of the <hi>Pontifical</hi> meant, that there
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62950:55"/>
was a Vacancy in the See of Five days <hi>after the death of</hi> Silverius: He might only mean that there was a Vacancy of Five days between the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of <hi>Silverius</hi> and the Promotion of <hi>Vigilius.</hi> 3. It is certain that the Author of the <hi>Pontifical</hi> writes very <hi>fabulously</hi> concerning <hi>Silverius</hi> and <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and plainly discovers, that he knew very little of the matter. As for his <hi>cessavit Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dies</hi> 5. he had so much used his Pen to, <hi>cessavit Episcopatus,</hi> at the end of every <hi>Life,</hi> that that comes in always of Course, even then when ('tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) there never was any <hi>Vacancy.</hi> Witness the <hi>cessavit episcopatus dies</hi> 7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the death of <hi>Liberius</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> II. and the <hi>cessavit episcopatus diebus</hi> 39. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the same <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Damasus.</hi> Than which there can be nothing more false: For <hi>Damasus</hi> did not succeed <hi>Felix</hi> but <hi>Liberius</hi>; and <hi>Felix</hi> being put into <hi>Liberius</hi>'s place, was again turn'd out upon <hi>Liberius</hi>'s Restauration, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of <hi>Vacancy.</hi> So, rather than a <hi>cessavit episcopatus</hi> should be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he adds in the Life of <hi>S. Fabian. Et cessavit Episcopatus dies septem:</hi> when we very well know, that between the Martyrdom of <hi>S. Fabian</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of his Successor <hi>S. Cornelius</hi> there was a Vacancy of no less than a <hi>Year, Four Months and Four Days.</hi> Our Author knew nothing of the Business; but a <hi>cessavit Episcopatus</hi> he would not be without.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That <hi>Vigilius</hi> was own'd and acknowleged as a true Pope, not only after the death of <hi>Silverius,</hi> but likewise before, appears 1. from hence, That there is no mention in any credible Author of his being by any rejected on the Account of <hi>Silverius</hi>; so far was he from being <hi>generally</hi> rejected. 2.

I take no notice of what is said by the Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the <hi>Councils,</hi> that the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Epistles of <hi>Eutherius</hi> and K. <hi>Theodebert</hi> were written not to <hi>Vigilius</hi> but <hi>Silverius,</hi> and that being brought to <hi>Rome</hi> after the Expulsion of <hi>Silverius, Vigilius</hi> took upon him to <hi>answer</hi> 'em. That is onely an <hi>Evasion:</hi> and 'tis plain from <hi>Vigilius</hi>'s Words, that those Epistles were written, not to <hi>Silveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> but directly to him. And certain it is moreover, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> writes, both in his Epistle to <hi>Eutherius,</hi> and likewise in that to the Archbishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> as a Pope universally acknowleged.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It may possibly be alleged, That <hi>Vigilius</hi> when he was made Pope, sent his <hi>Communicatory</hi> Letters to the <hi>Hereticks, Theodosius, Anthimus,</hi> and <hi>Severus,</hi> and confirm'd their <hi>Heretical</hi> Doctrines; that therefore they who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with him, and own'd him as true Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> were men of <hi>no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> since they own'd a <hi>Heretick</hi> to be a true Pope. To this I answer, That all that was done by <hi>Vigilius</hi> in reference to the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> was done <hi>secretly,</hi> and was <hi>not known</hi> to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> who communicated with him till after he had utterly <hi>forsook</hi> the <hi>Hereticks.</hi> This appears 1<hi>st</hi> from the Testimony of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratus Diaconus,</hi> who speaking of the engagement between <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the Empress, says that it was a <hi>secret</hi>; that she <hi>secretly</hi> perswaded him to promise to communicate with those Hereticks: and speaking afterwards of his Communicatory Letters to the Hereticks, and of his subscribing to their Heresy, he adds, that this he did <hi>occulté.</hi> 2.

He actually lays claim to the See, despises the Sentence of his Iudges as null and invalid, because they proceeded unjustly and uncanonically against him, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates them. Notwithstanding all this, his Successor, because he prov'd Orthodox, was receiv'd and own'd by all the Church as a true Patriarch: He continu'd in the See near <hi>13</hi> years; near <hi>12</hi> years under <hi>Justin</hi> the <hi>Younger</hi> an <hi>Orthodox Emp.</hi> He is own'd by the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> tho' at the same time <hi>Eutychius</hi> was exceedingly belov'd. <hi>John</hi> an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is consecrated by him. For what reason <hi>Anastasius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> reprov'd the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for being ordain'd by him. <hi>Anastasus</hi> did not refuse to communicate with him. He is Honour'd by the Patriarch <hi>Photius</hi> with the Title of <hi>Saint.</hi> Tho' <hi>Eutychius</hi> lookt upon his Deprivation as absolutely <hi>invalid,</hi> and tho' he never resign'd but accounted himself still the <hi>rightful</hi> Patriarch, yet he liv'd quietly, and never endeavour'd to make a Division in the Church. Dr. <hi>Crakanthorp</hi>'s Opinion, that <hi>Eutychius</hi> was deposed for being a <hi>Heretick,</hi> confuted. The Authority of the <hi>Life of Eutychius,</hi> often quoted in this Chapter, vindicated against the same Author.</p>
                     <p>IN the Year 565, <hi>Eutychius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whom I mention'd in the foregoing Chapter, was deposed by the Emp. <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly an <hi>Advocate,</hi> afterwards a Presbyter of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whom resided at that time at <hi>Constantinople</hi> as <hi>Apocrisiarius</hi> for the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> (the same with him whose Collection of Canons is extant in the <hi>Bibliotheca Iuris Canonici</hi>) was advanced to the See. This Instance the Author of our <hi>Baroccian Treatise</hi> takes notice of. <hi>In the Reign</hi> (says he) <hi>of the Emp.</hi> Justinian, Eutychius <hi>of</hi> Amasia <hi>being constituted Patriarch of</hi> Constantinople, <hi>a Man holy and belov'd of God, was unjustly deposed, and expell'd the City, and</hi> John <hi>was preferr'd to the See. But</hi> Eutychius <hi>did not upon that account separate himself from the Communion of</hi> John, <hi>and both therefore were receiv'd by the Church.</hi>

When the Patriarch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that they had broken into his Palace and carried away and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd some of his Servants, after he had made an end of Divine Service and had administer'd the Sacrament, he staid in the Chancel; for he was told by some, that if he went out of the Church it might cost him his Life, there being some arm'd Men that expected his coming forth.

sent according to the prescription of the Canons, a second and a third Citation to him.

                        <hi>Valesius,</hi> and after him some other Learned Men are of Opinion, that therefore those two Patriarchs were reprov'd by <hi>Anastasius,</hi> because the one was put into <hi>Eutychius</hi>'s place, and the other therefore ought not to have been ordain'd by him. This none of our Adversaries have observ'd: but I observe it for 'em; for it is not my design to <hi>shuffle,</hi> conceal, and prevaricate, but to present the <hi>Reader</hi> with a fair and impartial account of the Practice of the Antients. Now to this I answer, 1. That if <hi>Anastasius</hi> had absolutely refused to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> yet it cannot be prov'd that he did so because <hi>Iohn</hi> was put into the place of the <hi>unjustly</hi> deposed <hi>Eutychius:</hi> For the reason of his refusing to own him as Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> might have been onely because he thought him not <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Since <hi>Eutychius</hi> was turn'd out because he would not subscribe to the Doctrine of the <hi>Aph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartodocetae,</hi> it might reasonably be thought, that <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was put into his place, did actually subscribe.

                        <hi>Eustratius,</hi> who assures us, that therefore they deposed <hi>Eutychius,</hi> that they might put in one who would comply with 'em; and he plainly enough intimates, that <hi>Iohn</hi> did so. No wonder therefore if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastasius,</hi> who was the great Defender of the contrary Doctrine, and had been himself condemned by <hi>Iustinian</hi> to be deposed on that account, was so much prejudiced against <hi>Iohn,</hi> as not to like that the Patriarch of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> should be ordain'd by his hands. This (I say) might have been <hi>Anastasius</hi>'s Opinion and Prejudice. Yet it is not certain, that <hi>Iohn</hi> did actually subscribe. <hi>Eustratius</hi> was his very great Enemy, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Synodicon,</hi> might speak onely by Conjecture.

                        <hi>Photius</hi> mentions a <hi>Catechetical Oration,</hi> which our Patriarch spoke and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished on the First <hi>Indiction, i. e.</hi> three Years after the beginning of <hi>Iustin</hi>'s Reign, in which he laid down matters of Faith <hi>Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as <hi>Photius</hi> says, concerning the <hi>Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and against which <hi>Ioannes Philoponus</hi> the <hi>Heretick</hi> wrote a Treatise. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we suppose, according to <hi>Valesius</hi>'s Conjecture, that the reason why <hi>Anastasius</hi> reprehended the two Patriarchs, was, because the <hi>Ordainer</hi> succeeded the unjustly deposed <hi>Eutychius</hi>; yet from the words of <hi>Theophanes,</hi> it cannot be inferr'd, that he refus'd to <hi>communicate</hi> either with him or with the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> whom he had ordain'd. On the contrary, it may be gather'd from <hi>Theophanes</hi>'s words, that he did not refuse their <hi>Communion.</hi> For if he had refus'd their Communion, <hi>Theophanes</hi> would have said so; he would not have said <hi>onely,</hi> that <hi>he reprehended 'em.</hi> Besides, if <hi>Anastasius</hi> was deposed for reprehending <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause put into <hi>Eutychius</hi>'s place, from thence it may be concluded, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, which was near Five Years after the Expulsion of <hi>Eutychius,</hi> he all along communicated with him: For if the Emperor did so highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his reproving <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> on that account, he would doubtless have been deposed before that time, if he had refused on that account to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It does not appear that was the Reason for which <hi>Anastasius</hi> reprov'd the two Patriarchs of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi> It does not, I say, appear, that it was, as <hi>Valesius</hi> conjectures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by whom He of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was ordain'd, was put into <hi>Eutychius</hi>'s place. There may be another Reason assign'd, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable than that. 'Tis expressly enacted by the General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> That all <hi>Metropolitans</hi> should be Consecrated by the Bishops of their own <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>: The Ordination of a Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> was directly against that <hi>Canon,</hi> and 'twas lookt upon by the other Patriarchs as a great Presumption in the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to pretend to ordain another Patriarch. This seems to be the thing which <hi>Anastasius,</hi> who was a nice observer of all Rules, so much disliked. He reproved the one for taking so much upon him, and the other for being ordain'd in a manner not agreeable to the <hi>Canons.</hi> In the same manner before those times, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> had reprov'd <hi>Acacius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to Consecrate <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Calendion,</hi> Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch.</hi> That this was the true Reason, <hi>Theophanes</hi> himself seems to imitate, if we duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62950:64"/>
his Words. It is to be supposed, that what was done as to that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was done by the Emperor's Order: And thence it came to pass, that the Emperor so highly resented the words of <hi>Anastasius</hi>'s Letter, as reflecting no less upon himself, than upon the two Patriarchs, the <hi>Ordainer</hi> and the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> To this may be added, That it is not probable, that the Emperor <hi>Iustin</hi> should be so much displeas'd with <hi>Anastasius</hi> for reflecting on the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for his being put into <hi>Eutychius</hi>'s place, since it was not himself, but <hi>Iustinian</hi> that deposed <hi>Eutychius,</hi> and since, as <hi>Eustratius</hi> affirms, he had still a great Honour for <hi>Eutychius,</hi> tho' he did not think fit to restore him as long as <hi>Iohn</hi> lived.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Anastasius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> did not refuse to communicate with <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> may be further confirm'd from this Consideration, That <hi>Eustratius</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Eutychius,</hi> tho he<note n="(a)" rend="inter">§. 41. <gap reason="foreign">

him. The Doctor in his<note n="(a)" rend="inter">Part of his Book concerning the Fifth general Council.</note> Treatise concerning the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Iustinian,</hi> in which he endeavours to clear that Emperor from the Imputation of <hi>Heresie</hi> against Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Baronius,</hi> would needs perswade us, That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Eutychius</hi> was not deposed by <hi>Iustinian</hi> because he refused to subscribe to the Doctrine of the <hi>Aphthartodocetae,</hi> but for being an <hi>Origenian</hi> Heretick. That <hi>Eutychius</hi> had written a Book concerning the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> in which he contended, that our Bodies after the Resurrection will not be properly <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> but <hi>Aereal</hi> and <hi>Impalpable,</hi> the Doctor proves from the Testimony of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who says, That he himself disputed against him.</p>
                     <p>If this were the reason of <hi>Eutychius</hi>'s being expell'd, then all that we have alleged concerning the Church's acknowleging his Successor <hi>Iohn,</hi> will be of no force, because <hi>Eutychius</hi> was a <hi>Heretick,</hi> and consequently his Expulsion just, whatsoever that Authority was by which he was expell'd: I am therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to confute this pretended Reason. And, 1. I answer, That the Book which <hi>Eutychius</hi> publish'd concerning the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> was so far from being publish'd before the time of his Expulsion, that it was not publish'd till after his Restauration. This plainly appears from what Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> says. He tells us, that when he resided at <hi>Constantinople</hi> (as Legate from Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi>) he had a great Dispute with the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Eutychius</hi> about that Subject, and<note n="(b)" rend="inter">

                        <hi>Tiberius</hi> having heard the Arguments of both sides, was about to condemn the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch's Book to be burnt. Which had been done, says he, had not the Patriarch died. If <hi>Eutychius</hi> had been expell'd by <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> for that Opinion which he then main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, it cannot be suppos'd but that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> would have given an account of it. 2. That <hi>Eutychius</hi> was deposed by <hi>Iustinian</hi> because he refused to subscribe to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Aphthartodocetae,</hi> is unanimously asserted by all the Greek Authors who have mention'd the Reason of his Deprivation, by the Author of the <hi>Synodicon, Glycas, Zona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Theophanes, Ioel, Nicephorus Callisti,</hi> and <hi>Eustratius</hi> the Writer of his Life. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be supposed, that <hi>Eustratius</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd a false Reason that so he might salve his Reputation, and conceal his Opinions concerning the Resurrection; for had he beed deposed for maintaining any <hi>Heretical</hi> Opinion, there was no one but must have known it, and <hi>Eustratius</hi> would never have been so impudent as to give a false Reason before that great Congregation to whom he spoke his Oration. Neither does he conceal
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62950:66"/>
the Imputation which was by some fixt upon him concerning the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:</hi> After an account given of his Death, he<note n="(a)" rend="inter">§. 88, 89, 90.</note> takes an accasion to speak of that Imputation, and he says it was occasion'd by his being not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. To this I add, That it plainly appears from <hi>Evagrius,</hi> who liv'd and flourish'd at that time, that the Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> did just before his death endeavour to advance the Doctrine of the <hi>Aphthartodocetae,</hi> and publish'd a Decree concerning it, requiring the Bishops to subscribe to it; who general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer'd, as he tells us, that they would follow the Example of <hi>Anastasius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who (says he) could never be perswaded to subscribe, and had therefore been deposed, if the Emperor had not suddenly died. 'Tis a weak and injudicious Plea that of <hi>Crakanthorp,</hi> that <hi>Evagrius</hi> is guilty of several Errors: For let it be granted that he is (and what Historian is not?) yet how could he erre in a thing of that nature? Since he flourish'd at that time, and was within a few years after <hi>Assessor</hi> to <hi>Anastasius</hi>'s Successor, since he flourish'd at <hi>Antioch</hi> when <hi>Anastasius</hi> himself was Patriarch: How could he be mistaken in such a thing as that? He intimates, that he had read the Speech which <hi>Anastasius</hi> had composed and spoken to the People of <hi>Antioch</hi> when he understood that the Emperor design'd to banish him: And he tells us, that <hi>Anastasius</hi> wrote Epistles concerning the Emperors Doctrine to the <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> who had desired to know his Judgment. Among many other things that may be added, I shall onely mention that (as has been already observ'd in the foregoing Chapter) there is extant in the <hi>Tomes</hi>

                        <hi>Nicetius</hi> mentions, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had for the Advance of his Erroneous Doctrine ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd certain Bishops, alluding plainly to the Patriarch <hi>Eutychius</hi>'s Expulsion.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Crakanthorp</hi> finding that the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Eutychius</hi> made directly against his <hi>Opinion</hi> concerning the Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> his never falling into Heresie, endeavours to prove, that that <hi>Life</hi> was not written by one that liv'd at that time, but <hi>forged</hi> by some late Monk: and of this Opinion is one of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerers</hi> of the <hi>Baroccian Treatise,</hi> he whose words I but now produced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by <hi>Crakanthorp</hi>'s Arguments. I need not oppose this Opinion, that so it may be proved, that <hi>Iustinian</hi> fell into <hi>Heresie,</hi> and that <hi>Eutychius</hi> was deposed for refusing to subscribe to that Heresie; for these things I have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonstrated from the concurrent Testimonies of other Writers. But because I have produced the Authority of that <hi>Life</hi> for several other things which cannot be proved from other Authors, I am therefore obliged to clear the Authority of it from the Objections alleged against it. The chief Argument brought against it by <hi>Crakanthorp</hi> is its making <hi>Eutychius</hi> to continue above 12 Years in Banishment, whereas it appears (says he) from <hi>Paulus Diaconus,</hi> that he was restored just after <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s death, and that he <hi>crown'd</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Iustin</hi>; and from the Patriarch <hi>Nicephorus's Chronology,</hi> that he was in Banishment onely two Years and Seven Months. This Argument I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62950:66"/>
ready confuted. A Second Argument proposed by <hi>Crakanthorp,</hi> is this: It. is said in the <hi>Life; That after the Fifth General Council was summon'd,</hi> Eutychius <hi>was sent to</hi> Constantinople <hi>by the Bishop of</hi> Amasea, <hi>who was then sick, to supply his place in that Council; that a little after he came to</hi> Constantinople Mennas <hi>the Patriarch died, and so he was made Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch in his stead.</hi> This Relation, says <hi>Crakanthorp,</hi> is so untrue, <hi>that there are not so many Words as Lyes therein</hi>: For the Fifth General Council, says he, was not summon'd till the Six and Twentieth Year of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and it appears from the Testimony of the Pope's <hi>Legates</hi> in the Third <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Sixth General Council,</hi> that the Patriarch <hi>Mennas</hi> died in the One and Twentieth Year of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> To this I answer, That though it be true, that the Pope's <hi>Legates</hi> in the <hi>Sixth General Council</hi> affirm, That <hi>Mennas</hi> the Patriarch died on the One and Twentieth of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> yet, either they were extremely mistaken, or at least the Reading is Erroneous, and for <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>S. <hi>Anastasius,</hi> Senior, Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> being deposed without any Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod by the Emperor <hi>Justin,</hi> Iunior, tho' he never resign'd, yet his Successor <hi>Gregory</hi> is own'd by all the Church. He continued Patriarch till his Death, for the space of <hi>23</hi> Years, the old Patriarch <hi>Anastasius</hi> being all the while living. Four <hi>Saints</hi> among those that lived at that time and communicated freely with him: S. <hi>Symeon Stylites,</hi> Iunior, Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the Great,</hi> S. <hi>Eulogius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> S. <hi>John Nesteu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> communicates with him as Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> tho' at the same time he declares <hi>Anastasius's</hi> Deprivation to be <hi>invalid,</hi> and looks upon <hi>Anastasius</hi> to be the <hi>rightfull</hi> Patriarch. S. <hi>Anastasius,</hi> tho' deposed by the Lay-power, and tho' he had never given up his Right, yet never left the Communion of the Church.</p>
                     <p>I Have mention'd in the foregoing Chapter that <hi>Anastasius,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was deposed by the Emperour <hi>Iustin</hi> the Younger. It was done in the fifth Year of <hi>Iustin</hi>'s Reign, in the Year of Christ 570. And that it was done barely by the Emperour's Autority, without any <hi>Synod,</hi> may easily be gather'd from the account which <hi>Evagrius</hi> gives of it.<note n="(a)" rend="inter">L. 5. c. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Iustin</hi> (says he) <hi>turn'd</hi> Anastasius <hi>out of the See of</hi> Antioch, <hi>objecting against him that he had profusely squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd away the sacred Money upon things not necessary, and that he had likewise spoken reproachfully of him; that being ask'd why he was so profuse of the sacred Money, he answer'd down-right, That therefore he had done it, that it might not be took away by</hi> Justin, <hi>that common Plague. Now it was said, that therefore</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin <hi>had a spite against</hi> Anastasius; <hi>because when he demanded a summ of Money of him, when promoted to the Bishoprick, he refused to give it him. There were, besides the above-mention'd, some other things objected against him, by some that were willing, as we may suppose, to gratifie the Emperour in his design.</hi> The same may be gather'd from the account we have in<note n="(b)" rend="inter">Vide locum cap. praeced.</note> 
                        <hi>Theophanes.</hi> That <hi>he was thrust out of his See through the Emperor</hi> Justin<hi>'s displeasure, because he had spoken sharply against</hi> John, <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Constantinople, <hi>who had ordain'd</hi> John <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and likewise against</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Alexandria <hi>himself.</hi> Agreeably to this,<note n="(c)" rend="inter">Vita Gregorii M. l. 4. c. 25.</note>

                     <p n="2">2.

It appears from <hi>Evagrius,</hi> that <hi>Gregory,</hi> who accepted of his See, was a Person of extraordinary Worth: And from thence it appears, That the greatest and the worthiest Men did not think it unlawfull, or a disparagement, to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> of the See of a Bishop deposed by the Lay-power.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                        <hi>Paul,</hi> (himself likewise a <hi>Monothelite,</hi>) being ordain'd in his stead, was receiv'd as a true Patriarch by all the <hi>Monothelites:</hi> But tho' it is generally said, that the Patriarch <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was <hi>deposed,</hi> yet I find upon strict enquiry, that he was not actually deposed; but that being sure that he should be deposed, to avoid greater Mischiefs, he himself resign'd his Dignity. This Instance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pass by.</p>
                     <p>In the Year 654, S. <hi>Martin,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently deposed by the Emperor<note n="(b)" rend="inter">Not <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Pogonatus,</hi> as the <hi>Synodicon</hi> c.132. calls him.</note>

Let us hear what he himself says of the Circumstances of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, in his Epistle to <hi>Theodorus Spudeus,</hi> who had sent to him, then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> about it.

There is extant in the <hi>Anonymous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> an Epistle which he wrote from <hi>Cherso</hi> to a Friend at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> on the Month of <hi>September:</hi> But however it is probable, that he died on that same <hi>September,</hi> a few days after he had written that Epistle. And my Reason is, Because the <hi>Anonymous Author,</hi> who produces two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, which he wrote from <hi>Cherso,</hi> within about four Months after his arrival there, says nothing more of him, but onely concerning his Death. Had he lived a <hi>Year</hi> longer, it is very likely that his Friends at <hi>Constantinople</hi> would have heard agen from him, and our Author would have had more to write concerning him. And that he died very soon after his arrival, appears yet more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from his weak and sickly condition, and from the great Complaints which he makes concerning his misery and the want of subsistence at <hi>Cherso.</hi> From these Considerations I inferr, That he was carried away from <hi>Rome</hi> the 19th. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 654, and lived after that two Years and three Months; That he was tried and condemn'd at <hi>Constantinople</hi>

                        <hi>Callinicus</hi> being thus deposed and banished, the new Patriarch <hi>Cyrus</hi> was readily own'd as a true Patriarch by all. Concerning any disturbance in the Church occasion'd by <hi>Callinicus</hi>'s Lay-Deprivation, not a single word in any Author. This Instance the Author of the <hi>Baroccian Treatise</hi> takes notice of, who observes, not only that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was receiv'd by the Church, but likewise that <hi>Callinicus</hi> never separated from the Church's, and <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Communion; by which he means, That there was not any <hi>Schism</hi> headed by <hi>Callinicus</hi> as an <hi>Anti-patriarch.</hi> And the silence of all Authors in general, does sufficiently confirm what he says. <hi>The Emperor</hi> Justinian (says he) <hi>Sir-nam'd</hi> Rhinotme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, <hi>coming the second time to the Throne, deposed and banish'd unjustly the most holy Patriarch</hi> Callinicus <hi>and placed</hi> Cyrus <hi>a Recluse of</hi> Amastris <hi>in the See. Now observe, That</hi> Callinicus <hi>did not separate himself from the Church and from</hi> Cyrus, <hi>upon the account of his unjust Deprivation; and that</hi> Cyrus, <hi>together with those he had ordain'd, were receiv'd by the Church.</hi> 'Tis a vain thing for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to allege, that therefore, probably <hi>Callinicus</hi> did not think fit to insist upon his Right, because, by being guilty of Treason he had forfeited his Life: For whether <hi>Callinicus</hi> did insist upon his Right or not, the <hi>Church</hi> did not care. As soon as he was banish'd, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was constituted in his place, they <hi>immediately</hi> submitted to the present Possessor.

                     <p>An Account of the Schism between <hi>Photius</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Patriarchs of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople. Photius</hi> who was put into <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s place when deposed by the Emperor, no such Person as his Enemies report him. By how great a Party he was receiv'd. The reason why some refused to acknowlege him was not so much, because he was so constituted, as because he was a <hi>Neophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and was besides ordain'd by a Bishop Excommunicated, and (in their Iudgments) stood himself Excommunicated at that time. <hi>Ignatius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, that if <hi>Photius</hi> had been one <hi>of the Church,</hi> i. e. if he had not been an <hi>Excommunicated</hi> Person at the time of his Consecration, <hi>he would willingly have yielded to him. Ignatius</hi> values the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that condemn'd him no more than he did the <hi>Lay power.</hi> The <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> in an Error concerning that Matter. His Errors concerning the Council call'd the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second.</hi> A <hi>New</hi> account of the reason of that Title. His Error concerning the Greatness of the Synod of <hi>Rome,</hi> call'd by <hi>P. Nicholas</hi> against <hi>Photius. Photius</hi> after he was receiv'd by the Church, and confirmed by a general Council, is deposed by the bare Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Emperor <hi>Leo;</hi> yet his Successor <hi>Stephen</hi> is receiv'd by the Church.</p>
                     <p>IT appears from what has been said in the foregoing Chapters, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which we maintain, is grounded on the <hi>earliest</hi> Antiquity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Practice of the Church, in the first 400 Years after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors became <hi>Christian. We are now fallen into the Dregs of time</hi> (says one of our<note n="*" rend="inter">Further account of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> MS. <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note>

But this is confess'd by them themselves, that the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of these lower Ages, that do not agree with the Practice of the former, <hi>are not fit Examples for us to follow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Year 858. there broke out a Schism at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> between <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> deposed, and <hi>Photius,</hi> who was constituted in his place. That the Reader may have a full and perfect view of all this Concern; I will first present him
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62950:78"/>
with a short <hi>Historical,</hi> and <hi>Chronological</hi> Account of the chief Transactions. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will shew what manner of Man <hi>Photius</hi> was, who accepted of <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s See, that he was a vertuous and pious Man. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will shew by how great and numerous a Party he was receiv'd. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That they that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from him, did not look upon him to <hi>be otherwise unexceptionable,</hi> but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him for several Reasons. From whence it appears that the Case is quite different from ours, and no Example for our Adversaries.</p>
                     <p>In the Year but now mention'd, <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> Son to a former Emperor, <hi>Michael Rangabe,</hi> was deposed by the Emperor <hi>Michael,</hi> Sirnam'd the <hi>Drunkard,</hi> because he refused to take the Emperors <hi>Sisters</hi> and his <hi>Mother,</hi> and make 'em <hi>Nuns</hi> by force, as the Emperor had commanded him. This was the immediate Reason: but he that excited the Emperor against him was <hi>Bardas</hi> the Emperor's Uncle, whom the Patriarch had a little before Ex-communicated for living incestuously with his own Son's Wife. <hi>Ignatius</hi> being thus deposed<note n="(a)" rend="inter">

The whole Truth is this: When <hi>Ignatius</hi> began to be persecuted, then <hi>some</hi> of the Bishops and others, excited by Compassion towards their old Patriarch, began to fall off from him. So <hi>Anastasius Bibliothecarius</hi> expressly tells us.

But for those who are not <hi>weary</hi> of this Entertainment, I shall add these following Remarks.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I observe, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Adherents did no more regard the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of <hi>Synods,</hi> than they did the <hi>Imperial</hi> Autority. <hi>When the Suffrages of a Council were once gain'd</hi> (says<note n="(d)" rend="inter">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 79.</note> the worthy and learned <hi>Vindicator</hi>) <hi>what Arts soever those were that were used to gain 'em,</hi> Photius <hi>had then some appearance of Right, till</hi> Ignatius <hi>could relieve himself by another, and a</hi> greater <hi>Council. That was a lawful way of recovering it by the very</hi> Canons. <hi>However,</hi> Photius <hi>could in the mean time plead the Canons of his own Council,</hi> (which condemned <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and forbad the Clergy and Bishops to separate from their present Patriarch) <hi>that none ought to separate from himself, thus</hi> Synodically <hi>setled, nor to joyn with</hi> Ignatius, <hi>thus</hi> Synodically <hi>condemned, till himself were condemned, and</hi> Ignatius <hi>resetled by a greater and a more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Synod.</hi>— <hi>Till P.</hi> Nicholas (says the <hi>Vindicator</hi> a little after) <hi>had restored</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:62950:89"/>
Ignatius <hi>by a greater Synod than that was, that condemned him, how good soever his Tible was, yet the Guilt of</hi> Schism <hi>had been imputable to</hi> Ignatius, <hi>if he had made a Separation, or intruded himself into his own Throne, before a Synod had restored him. Nay by the</hi> Antiochian Canon, <hi>he had forfeited all Pretensions of having the merit of his Cause consider'd, if he had challenged any Duty from his Clergy and People before a Synod had restor'd him.</hi> He adds, that by the Canons of the Church, a <hi>Provincial</hi> Synod of <hi>Rome,</hi> could not condemn or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store a Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; and therefore the Synod called at <hi>Rome</hi> by P. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> how numerous soever it might be, could not have any Autority to depose <hi>Photius,</hi> and restore <hi>Ignatius</hi>: that <hi>Photius</hi> therefore was the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> till he was deposed by a <hi>Synod</hi> called at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> that was greater than that which deposed <hi>Ignatius. The Synod</hi> (says he) <hi>by which</hi> Ignatius <hi>was to be relieved, was to be another, and that a</hi> greater <hi>Synod in the same</hi> Constantinople, <hi>and till he could get such a Synod on his side, himself had been responsible for the</hi> Schism, <hi>that must have followed on his claiming his Right.</hi> Thus much the <hi>Vindicator</hi>: And thus (tho' he does not know it) he perfectly condemns <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and all his Adherents, as men not regarding the <hi>Rules</hi> of Ecclesiastical Government, but hurried away by their own Passions to <hi>Schismatical</hi> Proceedings. We do not <hi>find</hi> (says he) <hi>that</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius <hi>made any stir</hi> after he was deposed by a Synod of <hi>Constantinople, till he was restored Conciliarly in the same place, where he had been deprived.</hi> No? Then sure he never could find, that he made any stir at all. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more notorious than that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> never paid any deference to the Autority of those Synods that condemned him. That he lookt upon himself as <hi>Patriarch,</hi> as well after he was condemned by <hi>Synods,</hi> as before; appears, First from hence, That after he had been condemned by a <hi>Provincial</hi> Synod, when he was summoned to appear before the <hi>General Council,</hi> called <hi>First and Second,</hi> he asked those, that summoned him, under what Character they would have him appear, as a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as a <hi>Priest,</hi> or as a <hi>Monk?</hi> And when it was told him, that he might appear as himself in his own <hi>Conscience</hi> thought fit, he put on his <hi>Patriarchial</hi> Robes, and was going to the Council in 'em, till Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers from the Emperor met him, and commanded him to put 'em off, or it should cost him his Life.</p>
                     <p>This Account we have in his <hi>Life.</hi> 2. When he made his appearance before that Council, he declared against their Autority, and positively told 'em that <hi>they could not be his Iudges,</hi> except they first deposed <hi>Photius.</hi> This his Legate <hi>Theognostus</hi> attests in his Case presented to Pope <hi>Nicholas.</hi> 3. After he was condemned by this great Council, he still continued to suffer the same Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Torments as before; and why was he still tormented and persecuted, but because he was still the same Man? A Description of what he suffered, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was deposed by that Council, you may see at large in his <hi>Life. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnostus</hi> likewise speaks of 'em. So P. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s Synod al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in its<note n="(a)" rend="inter">

As soon as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Basilius</hi> had deposed <hi>Photius,</hi> tho' <hi>Photius</hi> as yet had never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a Council call'd at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> nor yet by any called any where
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62950:90"/>
else, that was greater than that which had confirmed him, <hi>Ignatius</hi> readily accepts of the See, and not only so, but condemns and<note n="(a)" rend="inter">
                           <hi>Nicetas V. Ign. p.</hi> 1232.</note> rejects both <hi>Photius,</hi> and all those whom he had Ordained, as <hi>no Bishops?</hi> 5. So far were the <hi>Ignatians</hi> from regarding the Autority of Synods, that even after <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Death, tho' <hi>Photius</hi> had been again confirmed by a <hi>General Council</hi> of no less than 373 Bishops, yet they<note n="(b)" rend="inter">
                           <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 1256.</note> still continued their Schism, and refused to Communicate. Nay, even after <hi>Photius</hi> was a Second time deposed, and even after his Death, some of 'em still refused to receive those whom <hi>Photius</hi> had Ordain'd. And the Schism does not seem to have been perfectly ended, till the <hi>Tomus Vnio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> or <hi>Synodicon</hi> was published in the Year 920. by which there was an end likewise put to several other Divisions in the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and all his Party were great betrayers of the Privileges of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> See. That he might regain his See, he cared not for the Honour of it, but Acted very unworthily of a truly great Man, and<note n="(c)" rend="inter">

                     <p>

Since he thought fit to quote so bad an Author as <hi>Eutychius,</hi> one that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self perfectly contemns, how came it to pass that he did not think fit to tell his Reader what the Authentick <hi>Greek</hi> Authors say?

                     <p>The Examples of these Patriarchs of the present <hi>Greek</hi> Church, I do not here mention, as if I thought they deserved for their <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Wisdom</hi> to be <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Patterns</hi> to the Bishops of <hi>England:</hi> But this is the use I would make of it. I would fain know of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> Whether they think an ejected Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> would do well, if, after he was deposed, he should separate from the Communion of his Successor, and make a Division in the Church? I can hardly believe but that such a <hi>Separation</hi> would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62950:95"/>
by even our <hi>Adversaries</hi> themselves. And how then can they justifie their own Separation, they who refuse to communicate with their Successors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they themselves are deposed by the <hi>Secular Power?</hi> There is one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion more, to which I desire a <hi>positive</hi> Answer: It is certain, that when the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> is deposed by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> the Church submits imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the Successor, without asking the Old Patriarch's leave: Whether he will give his Consent or not, she is not at all concern'd. Now this is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion I would ask: <hi>Is the Greek Church therefore Schismatical?</hi> If the ejected Patriarch should actually lay claim to his See, <hi>would the Church be Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical for adhering to the present Possessor?</hi> If, they say, it would not: Why then are We <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in adhering to our present Possessors? Will they say that the <hi>Greeks</hi> lie under a greater <hi>Necessity?</hi> So one of our Adversaries seems to intimate. <hi>I cannot see</hi> (says<note n="*" rend="inter">Unity of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> he) <hi>that either the Case of the</hi> Jews <hi>in our Saviour's time, or the Case of the present Greek Church runs parallel to ours; for the</hi> Jews <hi>for many years before had been under the</hi> Roman <hi>Yoke, and so have the</hi> Greeks <hi>for many Centuries of years under the</hi> Turks; <hi>both despoil'd of their Rights and Customs, and so far at Mercy, that it was well for the</hi> Jew <hi>that he could have any Priest, and for the</hi> Greeks <hi>that they have any Christianity.</hi> But our Author does not consider, that the Question may be ask'd as well concerning those <hi>Iews</hi> who first submitted to a <hi>High-priest</hi> put in by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and concerning those <hi>Greeks</hi> who first submitted to a Patriarch, ordain'd in the place of another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the <hi>Turk,</hi> as concerning the <hi>Iews</hi> in our Saviour's time, or the <hi>Greeks</hi> of these times. Neither does he consider, that the <hi>lastingness</hi> of an Oppression adds nothing at all to the strength of a <hi>present</hi> Necessity: If <hi>Necessity</hi> will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse an Action a hundred Years after the beginning of an Oppression, 'twould as well excuse in the very beginning of it. 'Tis as strong in the beginning as afterwards. But the <hi>Iews</hi> (says our Author) <hi>were at the Mercy of the Romans,</hi> and the present <hi>Greeks are at the Mercy of the Turks.</hi> We grant it: and that's the <hi>Necessity</hi> we plead. How does that make our <hi>Case</hi> not to be <hi>parallel?</hi> Is not the <hi>Church of England</hi> as much <hi>at the Mercy</hi> of <hi>the King and Parliament</hi> here, as the <hi>Iews</hi> were <hi>at the Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or as the <hi>Greeks</hi> are <hi>at the Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Turk?</hi> Is not the <hi>King and Parliament</hi> as powerfull here, as the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> or the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> at <hi>Constantinople?</hi> If <hi>Necessity</hi> will excuse them; our <hi>Necessity</hi> is the same, and that will justifie us.</p>

                     <p>The Sentence of an <hi>Uncanonical</hi> Synod, esteemed by the Antients invalid.

                     </p>
                     <p>I Have now concluded my <hi>History of the Church's Submission to Bishops put into the places of others deposed by the Secular Power.</hi> I have brought it down from the first <hi>High-priest</hi> that ever was deposed by the <hi>Secular</hi> Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the Reign of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> to these very times, and have shewed, That the Behaviour of the <hi>Iews</hi> under their <hi>High-priests,</hi> and of the Antient <hi>Christians</hi> under their <hi>Bishops,</hi> was agreeable to the present Practice
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62950:96"/>
of our Church. To make this History the more complete, I shall now shew, That the same was the general Practice of the Antients in respect to Bishops put into the places of others <hi>unjustly</hi> and <hi>uncanonically</hi> deposed by <hi>Synods,</hi> where the <hi>Secular Power</hi> concurr'd as executing the Sentence of the Bishops. I say, <hi>where the Secular Power concurred in executing the Sentence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>; for whatever the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and others, are pleas'd to tell us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Synodical</hi> Deprivations, it is easie to shew, That the Antients never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Sentence</hi> of an <hi>Vncanonical Synod,</hi> if the <hi>Civil</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did not <hi>force</hi> 'em to submit by taking upon him to excuse the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not every <hi>Synod</hi> that has power by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church to depose a Bishop, and the Sentence of an <hi>Vncanonical Synod,</hi> is by the <hi>Canons</hi> as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid</hi> as if it were no <hi>Synod</hi> at all. In the Fifth <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> there is a plain Intimation that the Affairs of every <hi>Province,</hi> ought to be managed by the Bishops of the respective <hi>Provinces:</hi> and by the Second <hi>Can.</hi> of the <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> 'tis expressly ordain'd, That <hi>no Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan should go out of his own District to concern himself in the Affairs of another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict</hi> (except in a <hi>General Council.</hi>) So when <hi>Theophilus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was accused to the Emperor <hi>Arcadius</hi> of certain great Crimes, and the Emperor commanded him to make his Appearance at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to be tryed there by S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he sent S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> a Letter, in which he alleged, That he could not be <hi>Iudge</hi> of his Cause, that<note n="(a)" rend="inter">

                     <p>Such were the Circumstances of that great Man's Deprivation.

'Tis as clear, I think, as the Sun from that single Word, that he did not then <hi>certainly</hi> expect to be put to Death. And it likewise appears from that Word, that the Advice he gives the <hi>Deaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> concerning their submitting to his Successor, was intended as well for his own <hi>Life-time,</hi> as otherwise. Since he plainly intimates, that he thought it doubtful, whether they should ever see him again, or not; if he had only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that they should submit to a Successor <hi>after his Death,</hi> he would have plainly told 'em so: As he takes care to tell 'em, that the Bishop they ought

                        <hi>Answerers,</hi> that <hi>there are so many Accidents, which may make any Authors Style different, at different times, especially in his familiar Letters, and those written in Banishment, and perhaps under the Disorders of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Dangers, which S.</hi> Chrysostom <hi>so often complains of, that this censure from the Style must be the less certain, especially since</hi> Photius <hi>did not discern it.</hi> We grant that S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> did not give up his Right to <hi>Arsacius</hi>: there is no need therefore, that our Author should defend that Epistle. But if he will needs have it, let him have it: It will make more against his Cause than for it. Only this I shall say, that it is from the Style of those very Epistles, which S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> wrote in his <hi>Banishment,</hi> in the very same Circumstances, and about the same Concerns, that I am fully convinced, that that to <hi>Cyriacus</hi> is not Genuine. <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> are hardly more different. And among all S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Epistles, there is not one that <hi>resembles</hi> it. If <hi>Photius</hi> did not discern it, 'twas because he did not consider it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is to be observed, that they that adher'd to S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and refused to Communicate, with his Successors, <hi>Arsacius</hi> and <hi>Atticus,</hi> were rather carried away by their <hi>Passions,</hi> than governed by <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Principles.</hi> This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from hence, that tho' <hi>Atticus</hi> was constituted against S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Will, and tho' they themselves had separated from him, and continu'd in their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration long after S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Death, yet when <hi>Atticus</hi> had restor'd S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>'s Name to the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of the Church, then almost all were well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and Communicated with <hi>Atticus</hi> as a true Bishop.

his taking upon him, to depose a Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was a great Presumption, and a Derogation from the Grandeur of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope therefore was obliged to oppose him. And hence it came to pass, that he only desired, that S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Name should be restored to the <hi>Diptychs</hi>: For by that the Patriarch <hi>Atticus</hi> own'd, that S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was not <hi>justly,</hi> or <hi>validly</hi> deprived.

                     <p>THat the Deprivation of a Bishop by an <hi>Heretical Synod</hi> is absolutely <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid,</hi> is a certain <hi>Maxim</hi> in the Law of the Church.

S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Epistle <hi>ad Solitarios,</hi> where he tells us that the Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> sent to <hi>Liberius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to perswade him to subscribe to his (<hi>Athanasius</hi>'s) Condemnation, whom a <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Arians</hi> had deposed, makes <hi>Liberius</hi> speak to the Messenger after this manner. <hi>Let there be</hi> (says he) <hi>an Ecclesiastical Synod call'd, and let the Hereticks</hi>

D.</hi> 370. which was long after <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was made Patriarch, that he had been recall'd from Banishment by the Emp. <hi>Iovian,</hi> that he was on that Year at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he Ordain'd <hi>Evagrius</hi> the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to <hi>Demophilus</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> and was agen banish'd by the Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> to <hi>Bizua</hi> in <hi>Thrace</hi>; I observ'd that the Arguments produced by <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Valesius,</hi> to shew that <hi>Eustathius</hi> died before <hi>Valesius</hi> was made Patriarch, and that <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> mistook <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> for <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastia,</hi> are not of so great <hi>weight</hi> as to be laid in the <hi>Balance</hi> against so express and particular an account as those Authors give us. To this, says one of our <hi>Answerers:</hi> 
                        <q>I must confess that <hi>Eustathius</hi> (as the <hi>Editor</hi> observes against <hi>Valesius</hi>) might have lived to the third Consulship of <hi>Valentinianus</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> for then he had not been above 90 Years of Age. But is this the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Baronius,</hi> or doth <hi>Valesius</hi> produce no other? Had he lookt into the <hi>Annals,</hi> An. 370. he would have found that <hi>Baronius</hi> thought it absurd to imagin that the Orthodox Bishops, and Catholick People of <hi>Antioch,</hi> would have suffer'd <hi>Meletius</hi> or <hi>Paulinus</hi> to have sate in that Chair, had <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius</hi> been alive: That 'tis incredible he should not repair to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and appear in the <hi>Catholick Synod</hi> at that time; and folly to fansie that <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> would not have given place to him, and to put an end to the Schism in that Church. And <hi>Valesius</hi> proves from S. <hi>Ierom</hi> that <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> was buried at <hi>Trajanople</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> to which place he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd (by <hi>Constantine</hi>) and therefore could not be that <hi>Eustathius</hi> who was banish'd by <hi>Valens</hi> to <hi>Bizna</hi> in <hi>Thrace.</hi> But these are Arguments not very favourable to the <hi>Editor</hi>'s Designs, and therefore must be <hi>shuffled over</hi> and conceal'd: So that we have a full Testimony of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who wrote his History to supply the Defects and correct the Mistakes of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and says that <hi>Eustathius was dead before</hi> Meletius <hi>was made Patriarch</hi>; and likewise the Autority of S. <hi>Ierom</hi> against a senseless surmise of one single <hi>Socrates,</hi>

I have already said, that it is not every one whom a <hi>small</hi> tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Party shall get to be ordain'd, that ought to be received as a Bishop; but that which we maintain is this, That where the lawful Bishop is deposed by an <hi>Irresistable</hi> Party, there the Successor may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged. Here I cannot but take notice, that before <hi>Majorinus,</hi> the Head of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> by that Party, <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> who was first possessed of the See, was deposed by a <hi>Synod</hi> of no less than Seventy Bishops; yet was owned by the Catholick Church, to have been all along the rightful Bishop even before he was confirmed by the Synods of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Arles</hi>; and the other Party was accounted <hi>Schismatical</hi> from the very beginning.

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. The Conclusion.</head>
                     <p>Bishops deposed by the Civil Autority obliged even in common Charity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce. But whether they acquiesce or not, the Church is to submit to the present Possessor.</p>
                     <p>I Have now done. And from what has been said, I think we may very well draw this Conclusion: That <hi>supposing a Bishop deprived by the Secular Power is unjustly and invalidly deprived; supposing likewise that he does not acquiesce, but still lays claim to his Bishoprick; yet the Church may lawfully, and ought for peace sake, to receive the present Possessor, if otherwise unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall here take my leave of those Readers to whom I have hitherto direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Discourse, and address my self, with all due Reverence and Respect, to those reverend and worthy Persons, whose Dissatisfactions have occasion'd the writing of this Treatise.</p>
                     <p>If the Church is not obliged to adhere to an ejected Bishop who refuses to acquiesce, then 'tis certain that That Bishop, if he makes a <hi>Separation,</hi> is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self guilty of a <hi>Schism.</hi> We will now proceed to consider, in short, the Duty of an ejected Bishop; upon this Supposition, That there are some of our late Bishops that still lay Claim to the Obedience of their People, which, as has been observ'd in the Beginning of this Treatise, does not as yet <hi>sufficiently</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. And (for their sakes I speak it) may it never appear! We will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if they please, that the Church ought not to submit to the present Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, unless the ejected Bishop gives his Consent. Let that be supposed. Yet if the Church, to avoid a Persecution, has actually done it, what then ought a <hi>good</hi> Bishop to do? Let us consider a little what the consequences of a <hi>Schism</hi> may be. To be engaged in a <hi>Schism,</hi> is, according to S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and our Adversaries themselves, to be out of the Church of Christ, and to be in a State of <hi>Damnation.</hi> And how can a <hi>good</hi> Bishop, one that ought <hi>to lay down even his Life for his Flock,</hi> see his People in a <hi>State of Damnation,</hi> when by onely his communicating with his Successor, they may be redeem'd? This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be seriously consider'd.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the Advice of S. <hi>Clement,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to some turbulent Persons of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who disturbed the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church, that they should, if they could not agree, rather leave that place than disturb the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 'em in the Discharge of their Duty. This place of S. <hi>Clement</hi> I formerly understood, as if he had given that advice to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> themselves, that they should rather withdraw than be the occasion of Schisms and Divisions; and so easie it is to mistake it, that it's acknowleged by even some of my

                     <p>That the <hi>Clergy</hi> ought not to be unjustly disturbed, is a thing we all agree in: It is likewise certain, that if they have <hi>Injury</hi> done 'em, they ought to have Amends made 'em. But the Question now is, Whether if the State has unjustly deposed 'em, and is resolv'd not to restore 'em, and the Church for Peace-sake has thought fit to submit, they that are injured ought not so to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce, as that all People may be united, and the much greater Part retriev'd from the Spiritual Danger to which they are obnoxious? I have produced in my <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Baroccian Treatise</hi> some Examples to shew how tender good Bishops have always been of their Flock and the Church's Peace. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be here also mention'd. When S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> was Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and great Disturbances were rais'd in the Church on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he freely surrender'd up his Right, and in the <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> thus address'd himself to the Bishops: <hi>'Tis a base and unworthy thing, my Collegues and Co-pastors of the Flock of Christ, for you who teach others Peace, to stir up among your selves an intestine War. For how shall you be able to reduce others to Concord, who differ and disagree among your selves? By the Trinity it self I beseech you, to concert your Affairs peaceably and as becomes you. And if on my account there be any Dissentions, I am not better than the Prophet</hi> Jonas: <hi>Throw me into the Sea, and so shall you cease to be toss'd by the tempest of Tumults. Whatsoever you shall think fit, tho' I am not guilty of any thing, I will willingly endure it, if by that means there may be Concord preserv'd. Depose me from my Throne. Cast me out of the City. This onely I desire, that (to speak in the words of</hi> Zacharias) <hi>you would love Truth and Peace.</hi> When <hi>Nectarius</hi> was ordain'd, and fate as his Successor, he address'd himself to him, and desired him to take care against Hereticks. <hi>As for my own private Troubles</hi> (says he) <hi>I do not so much as reckon 'em among Evils: I regard onely the Afflictions of the Church.</hi> When the <hi>African</hi> Church was broken in pieces by the Schism of the <hi>Donatist's,</hi> all the Catholick Bishops of that Church, to the number of near 300, made the <hi>Donatists</hi> this Offer, That, if they pleas'd, all the Bishops of both Parties should resign their Bishopricks, and new ones, whom both Parties should acknowlege, should be chosen in their places: This Offer they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly make in the <hi>first Conference of Carthage</hi> in their Epistle to <hi>Marcellinus</hi>

                        <hi>Austin. It is far more glorious</hi> (says S. <hi>Austin</hi> on that occasion) <hi>to give up ones Bishoprick, for the securing the Church from Dangers, than to take it upon one. For he who does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily defend the Honour he received, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews, that he would have been worthy of it, if the Church's Peace would have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to keep it. — May</hi> Maximianus <hi>be repaid with that everlasting Peace, which is promised the Church, because he esteemed that, not expedient for him, which was not expedient for the Church.</hi> Those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Examples of a peaceable Acquiescence, which we have produced in the foregoing Discourse, I shall not here repeat. I shall not mention the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of S. <hi>Elias</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> nor that of <hi>Eutychius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> nor that of S. <hi>Anastasius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> nor those of S. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius,</hi> and <hi>Euphemius.</hi> I shall not mention that <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> declared, that if <hi>Photius</hi> had been <hi>otherwise unexceptionable,</hi> he would have <hi>yielded to him</hi>: Neither shall I mention, that S. <hi>Martin,</hi> when in Banishment, <hi>prayed</hi> for his Successor. These and many more Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a peaceful and pious Acquiescence, I leave to the serious Consideration of those that are concerned.</p>
                     <p>It's alleged by the Author of a late <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> Entituled, <hi>Of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to be kept on in the Vnity of Christ's Church,</hi> that the ejected Bishops are not obliged to acquiesce, but rather to Act still as Bishops; because it is the Duty of all Bishops and Clergymen to stand to, and preach up, all good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: but (says he) if they should resign, there are some good Doctrines, which in these times will not be defended. This is the Summ of all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us. In answer to which, I shall only desire the Author to consider, that according to that Notion there is no <hi>Separation,</hi> but what may easily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. What Dissenter is there amongst us, that can't make the same Plea?</p>
                     <p>I desire to be pardon'd, for presuming to offer my Advice. I can truly say of those reverend Men, what S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does of <hi>Maximus</hi> and his Associates, who were ere-while <hi>Confessors,</hi> and afterwards engaged in a <hi>Schism.</hi>

                  <p>THere are <hi>two</hi> things which they that separate from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church on the account of Bishops deposed by the <hi>Civil</hi> Autority, are obliged to make out, to justifie themselves from the Charge of <hi>Schism:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Civil Power has no Autority in any Case whatever to deprive a Bishop of his See.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That no Bishop that is put into the place of another deposed by an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Autority ought to be own'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they cannot make out <hi>both</hi> these Propositions, they do nothing at all. For if we may <hi>lawfully</hi> submit to a Bishop put into the place of another deprived by the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> tho' the <hi>Civil Power</hi> had no Autority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive, it must thence follow that They are guilty of <hi>Schism</hi> who separate from the Church on such an account, because there is nothing can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church, when we may <hi>lawfully</hi> communicate with it.</p>
                  <p>But on the other Side, the Case is quite different. They that own the present Possessor in opposition to one deposed by the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> are, to justifie their Adherence to him, obliged to make out but onely <hi>one</hi> thing: Either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Civil Power may lawfully deprive a Bishop of his See for Crimes (or reputed Crimes) purely Political:</hi> Such as are here supposed: or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That if it cannot lawfully do so, yet if it has actually done it, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unexceptionable on all other accounts, is establish'd in the See, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for Peace-sake, to own the Possessor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Advantage We have of our Adversaries. The <hi>Baroccian Treatise,</hi> which I lately publish'd, is a Proof of the last Proposition.

                     <hi>The Vindication of the Autority of the Civil Power in Depriving a Bishop for Political Crimes,</hi> I reserve for a particular Treatise. My Business at present is to manage the last Proposition, that advanced by the <hi>Baroccian Treatise.</hi> In Reply to these several <hi>Answers,</hi> I here present our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries with an <hi>Impartial History of the Church's Behaviour (throughout all Ages) under Bishops put into the Places of others Deposed by a Lay, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Invalid, Sentence.</hi> I grant at present, that all <hi>Lay-Deprivations</hi> are <hi>invalid.</hi> I suppose the worst in all Cases. Suppose the Deprivation was not onely <hi>uncanonical,</hi> but also <hi>unjust:</hi> Suppose the Depriver not onely
<pb facs="tcp:62950:112"/>
a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> but <hi>doubly</hi> unqualified by being likewise a <hi>Heretick:</hi> Suppose besides, that the ejected Bishop was deprived for adhering to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and for opposing <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Heresy:</hi> Notwithstanding all this, I assert, That if he was deprived by a Power <hi>irresistible,</hi> a Submission to the present Possessor (if otherwise unexceptionable) is <hi>lawfull,</hi> and warranted by the general Practice of the <hi>Antients.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not my Design to detain my <hi>Reader</hi> long in a <hi>Preface.</hi> Onely one or two things I desire of him.</p>
                  <p>If any thing here in this Treatise seem <hi>long</hi> and <hi>tedious</hi> to him, I desire he would be pleas'd to consider, that my Design was to make this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course as perfect as I could, that so, if possible, it might put an End to this <hi>Controversie.</hi> And if our Adversaries shall be pleas'd to publish a <hi>Reply</hi> to what is here written, I desire he would seriously compare and weigh one Treatise with the other, consider if the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi> Parts of this Treatise are answer'd, then judge for himself, and not expect that of Course there must be another Reply. As I am not so vain as to think my self clear from Error, so neither am I conscious to my self of having been so <hi>Careless</hi> and <hi>Indiligent</hi> as to think I am often mistaken, I mean in things <hi>material.</hi> I hate everlasting <hi>Wrangle.</hi> And an Adversary that <hi>Cavils,</hi> and excepts against things <hi>not material,</hi> I shall think deserves a <hi>Reply</hi> as little as one that <hi>Rails.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twill be hard, I know, to perswade our Adversaries, that the <hi>History</hi> I here present 'em, is (what I call it) <hi>Impartial.</hi> But this Assurance I give 'em: <hi>I have written nothing but what I myself believe.</hi> That may be; perhaps they will say: But you have not written <hi>all</hi> that you believe: You have not told all you know. Why truly, as to that, I know not what to answer. Since the Judgments of Men are so extremely different, as that some have <hi>fansy'd</hi> that the <hi>Canons</hi> I omitted, when I publish'd the <hi>Baroccian Treatise,</hi> are really a Part of that <hi>Treatise,</hi> and ought to have been publish'd with it; there is nothing so <hi>Impertinent</hi> but what some or other may fansie I ought to have mention'd. I cannot promise but that there may be more <hi>Canons.</hi> But least it should be suspected, that tho' I have produced many Instances for the Cause I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to defend, there are others, as good, and as many, that make against us, which I have designedly conceal'd; I shall here make this solemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration: That if any of our Adversaries (I speak to all in general, but my Eye is particularly upon the learned <hi>Vindicator</hi>) can produce me any one single Instance from the time of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the first <hi>High-priest</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> to this very day, of a <hi>High priest disown'd</hi> by the <hi>Iews,</hi> or a <hi>Bishop disown'd by the Generality of the Catholick Church for this Reason, because put into the place of another deposed by the Civil Autority:</hi> If they
<pb facs="tcp:62950:113"/>
can shew me, I say, any one single Instance, I shall own my self obliged for the Instruction. I assure my <hi>Reader,</hi> that after a <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Search I know not one.</p>
                  <p>Should our Adversaries be able to produce such an Example (as I think they will never be able) 'twill advantage their Cause but little, especially if it be one of the later Ages, since it is not agreeable to the Practice of the Church in general. But if they are not able to produce so much as one single Example, how rashly have they acted, who have separated themselves from the Church on such an account!</p>
                  <p>I conclude in the Words of <hi>Drusius,</hi> which I here make my own: <hi>Scripsi haec animo juvandi, non laedendi. Si laesi quempiam, jam me poenitet. Si offendi pias aures, monitus lubenter mutabo. Si erravi uspiam, monstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur mihi error, non ero pertinax.</hi>

He actually lays claim to the See, despises the Sentence of his Iudges as null and invalid, because they proceeded unjustly and uncanonically against him, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates them. Notwithstanding all this, his Successor, because he prov'd Orthodox, was receiv'd and own'd by all the Church as a true Patriarch: He continu'd in the See near <hi>13</hi> years; near <hi>12</hi> years under <hi>Justin</hi> the <hi>Younger</hi> an <hi>Orthodox Emp.</hi> He is own'd by the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> tho' at the same time <hi>Eutychius</hi> was exceedingly belov'd. <hi>John</hi> an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is consecrated by him. For what reason <hi>Anastasius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> reprov'd the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> for being ordain'd by him. <hi>Anastasius</hi> did not refuse to communicate with him.

Tho' <hi>Eutychius</hi> lookt upon his Deprivation as absolutely <hi>invalid,</hi> and tho' he never resign'd but accounted himself still the <hi>rightful</hi> Patriarch, yet he liv'd quietly, and never endeavour'd to make a Division in the Church.

                     <q>The Reasonableness of submitting to the present Possessor, if otherwise unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, tho' the Predecessor was unjustly or invalidly deposed by the Secular Power, demonstrated. Objections answer'd. No obligation to the contrary by the Oath of Canonical Obedience. The Autority of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> unreasonably alleg'd by our Adversaries. The <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Notion of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy</hi> not at all to his Purpose.</q>
                     <p>THE Doctrine maintain'd by the Author of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> Treatise, is this; <hi>That supposing a Bishop depriv'd without any Synod by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power, is unjustly depriv'd; yet neither He himself, nor the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought to separate from the Communion of his Successor, provided that Successor is not a Heretick.</hi> In answer to that Treatise, it is alleg'd by some of our Adversaries, That not onely <hi>Heresy,</hi> but <hi>Schism</hi> likewise, and <hi>Excommunication</hi> make a Person uncapable of being receiv'd as a Bishop. <hi>It is manifest,</hi> says one of our<note n="*" rend="inter">An Answer to a Treatise out of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. History,</hi> &amp;c. in the Preface.</note> Answerers, <hi>that the Principles advanced by the Author of the</hi> Baroccian <hi>Treatise, make all Church-Censures ineffectual, and expose the Church to all the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of</hi> Erastianism. <hi>For if a Prince should preferr an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Person to the See of the Bishop, by whom he stands excommunicated, supposing onely that he was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for Heresy, this Person, tho' never so justly excommunicated, must be own'd and obey'd instead of the Bishop who excommunicated him; which lodges all Church-Power in the Prince, and makes all Ecclesiastical Censures of no effect for the Benefit and Preservation of the Church, whenever he pleases.</hi> All this He very well knew was nothing at all to his Purpose, and nothing against either ours, or our Author's Cause: But he likewise knew, it would have been less to his Purpose to have told his Reader so. To avoid all impertinent Cavil, that we may not run off from the Scope and Design of our Writing, I shall take leave to alter the last Clause of the Proposition thus: <hi>Provided that Successor be in all other Respects such whose Communion no good Catholick can justly refuse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 2. Having laid down fairly our Proposition, and secured it (if that may be possible) from all Cavil, We will now proceed to demonstrate the Truth of it. And this we shall do, first, from the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it; and, 2dly. from the <hi>Autority and Practice of the Antients</hi>; by which the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it will more certainly and evidently appear.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. First from the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it: And that is grounded on this certain and self-evident Maxim, That <hi>whatsoever is necessary for the present Peace and Tranquillity of the Church, that ought to be made use of, provided it is not in it self sinfull, and the ill Consequences, which may possibly attend it, are either not so mischievous to the Church, or at least not so likely to happen as the Evils we endeavour to avoid.</hi> That this was a <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> We shall easily find, if we please but to cast our eyes back upon their Times, and consider those Methods, which were wont to be made use of in the Church. We shall find, that in all manner of Cases, They always preferr'd the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of the Church to all other Things, the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Religion excepted. There was no <hi>Custom</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> of the Church so sacred and inviolable, but what they readily sacrificed, whensoever Necessity requir'd, to the Peace and Tranquillity of it. If the exact Observation of the receiv'd Customs and Canons of the Church was not like to conduce to the present Peace and Tranquillity of it, they were readily superseded, and <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Convenience</hi> became the onely <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> To preferr a <hi>Rule</hi> of the Church to the <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> of it, and to stand to the <hi>Saying</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> in Opposition to a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Necessity,</hi> is a sort of <hi>Theological Pedantry,</hi> which They were not guilty of. They were wont to consider like truly Wise men, the <hi>Circumstances</hi> and the <hi>Exigencies</hi> of the Times; and they knew that those Customs and Canons of the Church, which were proper in the Times of Peace, could never indispensably oblige in Times of a different <hi>Complexion.</hi> To prevent, or to heal the Diseases of the Church, they acted like <hi>Philosophers,</hi> not like <hi>Empericks</hi>; consider'd what <hi>ought</hi> to be done in this and that particular Case; what was truly <hi>expedient,</hi> not what had been <hi>prescrib'd</hi> when the <hi>Symptoms</hi> were not the same. Tho' of all the <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> there was none so rever'd as the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>; and tho' among all the <hi>Canons</hi> of that Council there was none so Religiously and so Universally observ'd, as that which makes it unlawfull for any one City to have <hi>two</hi> Bishops; and altho' that had always been a<note n="*" rend="inter">S.

That the same was their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in reference to our particular Case, We shall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shew in its due Place.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. Our Proposition being thus establish'd on that sure Maxim, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd (as has been shewn) by the Antients; <hi>That whatsoever is necessary for the Peace and Tranquillity of the Church, that ought to be made use of, provided that it is not in it self Sinfull; and that the ill Consequences, which may possibly attend it, are either not so mischievous to the Church, or at least not so likely to happen, as the Evils we endeavour to avoid.</hi> There are two Things which I am oblig'd to make out; First, That <hi>the Submitting to a Bishop put into the place of another unjustly Depos'd by the Civil Autority,</hi> is not in itself <hi>Sinfull:</hi> And, 2dly. That <hi>the ill Consequences, to which it is liable, are either not so mischievous to the Church, or at least not so likely to happen, as the Evils we endeavour to avoid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 5. First, It is not in it self <hi>Sinfull:</hi> For if it is so, it must be so for one, or more, of these following Reasons: Either, first, because it is forbidden by some express Law of God; Or, 2dly. because it makes us <hi>Accomplices</hi> in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>; Or, 3dly. because of the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi> which the inferior Clergy have taken to their Bishop, and the inferior Bishops to their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop; Or, lastly, because, as one of our Adversaries, the learned <hi>Vindicator,</hi> contends, such a Bishop as is placed in the room of one Deposed by the Civil Autority, is in reality <hi>no Bishop.</hi> These Objections I shall consider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. First, It is not against any Law of God. For as to our <hi>Case,</hi> the Scripture is altogether silent. 'Tis true, it Commands us to be obedient to our Governors, and that Command reaches as well to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> as to the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral:</hi> But when there are <hi>two</hi> that stand Competitors, and both claim our Obedience; to which of those <hi>two</hi> our Obedience ought to be paid, it leaves to our Wisdom to determine.</p>
                     <p>§. 7. Neither, 2dly. does it make us <hi>Accomplices</hi> in the <hi>Injustice.</hi> For if a <hi>Landlord</hi> be <hi>unjustly</hi> and <hi>invalidly</hi> dispossess'd of his <hi>Estate</hi> by an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority, Who thinks the <hi>Tenant</hi> an <hi>Accomplice in the Injustice,</hi> because he pays his <hi>Rent</hi> to the present Possessor? Should the Clergy refuse to submit to the Bishops in possession, it could onely serve to draw down Ruin upon themselves?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62950:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It cannot restore those whom the State has deposed. It is not our Submitting to the present Possessors, that ejects the former; for they are already irretrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Depos'd, since the Supreme Power is peremptory against 'em. That has publickly declar'd, that, whoever are our Bishops, the old ones shall govern us no longer. If we think the Proceeding <hi>unjust,</hi> 'tis enough that we remonstrate against it, and express our dissatisfaction. If that will not doe, the Good of the Publick obliges us to be quiet.</p>
                     <p>§. 8. Neither, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> is it <hi>sinfull</hi> on the account of the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience.</hi> For that is taken not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>unconditionally,</hi> but with this Supposition, That the Bishop, to whom we take it, has <hi>power</hi> to govern us. If I take an Oath, to be faithfull or obedient to a Governour, whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> I engage my self to him as a <hi>Governour,</hi> that is, as one that <hi>can govern:</hi> If therefore he <hi>can no longer govern,</hi> whatsoever the Impediment is, my Obedience is no longer engag'd. As it is in the State, so it is in the Church: The Oath that is taken to a Bishop, as he is the Governour of a Church, is not taken for the sake of the Bishop, but for the Peace and good Order of the Church. 'Tis this was the <hi>Design</hi> of the Church when she order'd such an Oath to be taken. When therefore the Oath tends no longer to the Good of the Church, but <hi>notoriously</hi> to Schism, Disorder, and Confusion, it cannot any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger oblige: but is void of it self, by virtue of the Church's Intent and Design in the first Institution of it.</p>
                     <p>It is further to be consider'd, that particularly here in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience</hi> is always taken with this Supposition, That the <hi>Civil</hi> Power, as well as the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> do allow the Bishop to govern.</p>
                     <p>But let us suppose even that which in reason we ought not to suppose: Let us suppose, that the Bishop intended that the Oath should always oblige. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was the Intent of the Bishop; <hi>That</hi> was not the Intent of the <hi>Church.</hi> And it is the Intent of the <hi>Church,</hi> not the <hi>private</hi> Intent of the Bishop, that gives an Obligation to the Oath. I add, That should it be both the Intent of the Bishop, and likewise the Intent of the Person who takes the Oath, that it should always oblige; should it run in these express words; <hi>I will always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to you, if Depos'd by the Civil Autority, in opposition to him, whosoever he be, that shall be put into your place:</hi> Should any one, I say, take such an Oath as that, yet he cannot be oblig'd by it. The Oath is in it self unlawfull, 'tis a <hi>Sin</hi> against the Publick, repugnant to the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> It would be in effect to swear thus: <hi>I will for your sake oppose the Welfare of the Publick, and break the Vnion of the Church; I will leave the Communion of the Church, and adhere to you, tho' I have not any Reason to do so besides this bare Oath.</hi> To conclude; Whatsoever is <hi>notoriously</hi> repugnant to the Church's interest, so as to be <hi>necessarily</hi> productive of <hi>very great</hi> Evils, is so far from being obliging, that it would be a <hi>Sin</hi> to act according to it.</p>
                     <p>It is granted by our Adversaries, that the Obligation of an Oath of Canonical Obedience ceases, if a Bishop is depriv'd, tho' never so <hi>unjustly</hi> by a <hi>Synod:</hi> Now what is the Reason of that? 'Tis because to adhere to a Bishop, when a <hi>Synod</hi> has fully deposed him, and placed another in his See, must occasion a <hi>Division</hi> in the Church, and disturb the <hi>Publick.</hi> If that is the Reason, as no one can assign any other, (at least there can be none but what is grounded on that,) then the Reason is the same in both Cases: and consequently in both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62950:120"/>
Cases tho Oath will be equally void. 'Tis in vain to allege, That in the Case of a <hi>Synod</hi> we cease to be obliged by our Oath, because every Bishop is suppos'd to have obliged himself to submit to the Determination of a Synod; whether <hi>just</hi> or <hi>unjust</hi>; and therefore when a <hi>Synod</hi> has Deposed him, tho' by an unjust sentence, his Place is truly void by virtue of his supposed <hi>Consent:</hi> For suppose a Bishop should have always declar'd, that he never would give his Consent, that a Synod should have Power to Depose him by an <hi>unjust</hi> Sentence: ought we not however to submit to the new Constituted Bishop? Our Adversaries will tell us, that we ought. But why? 'Tis because the Necessity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Peace of the Church requires it. Well then; it is certain, that it is not the Bishop's <hi>Consent,</hi> but <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>the Good of the Publick</hi> that makes our <hi>Oath</hi> void.</p>
                     <p>Tho' in some Respects there is a great deal of Difference between what is done by a <hi>competent</hi> or a <hi>lawfull</hi> Autority, and what is done by an <hi>incompetent</hi> or an <hi>unlawfull</hi> Autority: yet, as to our Acquiescence, in a Case of Necessity, such as is here supposed, I can see no Difference at all, The <hi>Obligation to acquiesce</hi> is the same in both Cases, when in both Cases the <hi>Necessity</hi> is the same. If a <hi>Lord</hi> be dispossess'd of his <hi>Mannor</hi> by an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority that cannot be resisted, (a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> suppose, or an <hi>unlawfull Court</hi>) Who thinks the Tenant <hi>forsworn</hi> for submitting to the new Possessor? Who makes any difference there between a <hi>Competent</hi> and an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority? And why is the <hi>Tenant</hi> in such a Case not <hi>forsworn?</hi> If he cannot (or ought not to) oppose the Intruder, yet ought he not at least to give up his <hi>Estate,</hi> rather than submit and do <hi>Homage</hi> to the wrong Lord? 'Twill be granted, I presume, by our Adversaries, that he is neither obliged to oppose the <hi>Intruder,</hi> nor yet to give up his <hi>Estate.</hi> But why does the Oath, which he took to the <hi>rightfull</hi> Lord, cease to oblige him? 'Tis because when he took the Oath, he took it onely on this Supposition, That the Lord was <hi>Possess</hi>'d of the Mannor. The Peace and Tranquility of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the Good of <hi>Tenants</hi> in general give that <hi>Restriction</hi> to the Oath.</p>
                     <p>If the Bishop of a <hi>Frontier Town</hi> will not own the Autority of a <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and is therefore Deposed by that Conqueror, I desire to know of our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whether the Clergy of that Town are perjur'd if they own that Bishop whom the Conqueror thinks fit to set over 'em? If a Bishop should by the <hi>Civil Power</hi> be condemn'd to <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>close</hi> Imprisonment, or be banish'd <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> from his Country, so as that it is impossible for him to perform the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Bishop: or should he be carried away Captive we know not where, or from whence we cannot redeem him: What then?

                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62950:120"/>I easily foresee what will be the Reply of our Adversaries.

I seek not yours, but you,</hi> will readily forego his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest for the Welfare and Prosperity of his Flock: And since our ejected Bishops, who are (I am fully perswaded) very worthy and good Men, and real Lovers of their People, have never by any <hi>publick</hi> signification of their Will, laid claim to the Obedience of their People, and do not now exercise their Episcopal Power as before; in reason we ought to presume that they give their Consent that their Successors should be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. But, 2dly. let it be supposed, that the outed Governor does expresly assure his Inferiors, that he <hi>does not</hi> give his Consent, but still lays Claim to their Obedience. Suppose the <hi>conquer'd,</hi> the <hi>banish'd,</hi> the <hi>imprison'd,</hi> or the <hi>captive</hi> Bishop should charge his People expresly upon their Oath never to accept of any other Bishop as long as by the common Course of Nature he himself may be supposed to be living, or till they be assur'd he is dead: Let this I say be supposed, (and easy it is to be supposed,) What must be done in such Cases? Is the Church <hi>perjur'd</hi> if she accepts of another? Will our Adversaries say that she is? <hi>A hard Saying! Who can bear it?</hi> This <hi>Presumption</hi> of the ejected Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's <hi>Consent</hi> is (I know) what is commonly alleg'd by some very learned and otherwise judicious Men, as the true and the onely foundation of Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence when the lawfull Governor is unjustly Depos'd by a Power <hi>incompetent:</hi> But that that is not the true and the <hi>onely</hi> foundation, these Difficulties which I have alleg'd do (me thinks) abundantly demonstrate. Other Men I must leave to their own ways of <hi>Thinking.</hi> For my part, I cannot imagine, that the <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> does depend upon so <hi>ticklish</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi> a Point as that of an ejected Governor's Consent: That, if he refuses to give his Consent, all the <hi>Church</hi> or the <hi>Nation</hi> must be made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to him. It is easy to discover, upon how false a <hi>Principle</hi> that Notion is built. It is grounded on this, That the Oath that is taken to the Governor, is taken <hi>onely</hi> for <hi>his</hi> sake; when if the true End and Design of Government were duely and impartially consider'd, it would be found (as above I observ'd) that the Oath that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Governor, is taken not <hi>onely</hi> for <hi>his</hi> Good, but <hi>chiefly</hi> for the Good of the <hi>Publick</hi>; and that any Oath taken to a Governor that is <hi>notoriously</hi> and in a <hi>high degree</hi> repugnant to the Good and Prosperity of the <hi>Publick,</hi> so as to be <hi>necessarily</hi> productive of <hi>intolerable</hi> Evils, is in its own Nature void; because by the <hi>Publick</hi> it was never design'd that in such a Case it should oblige.</p>

We are next to consider that Objection which is made by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Vindicator,</hi> That a Bishop put into the place of another, deposed by the Lay-power, is in reality <hi>no Bishop.</hi> If this is true, then it must be granted, that we cannot be oblig'd for the sake of Union and Peace, to adhere to the present Possessor. This indeed is the Difference between our <hi>Civil</hi> and our <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Governors. The former are purely <hi>Governors,</hi> and nothing more is required in them but to be capable of <hi>Governing</hi>; The latter are not onely <hi>Governors,</hi> but are likewise the Administrators of Sacraments, and the sole Ordainers of the Clergy. It is therefore necessary, not onely that the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Governor should be duly qualified for Government, but that he should be likewise endued by God Almighty with the Power of Ordaining, and of administring the holy Sacraments. Thus much must be granted: Let us now see what Argument the <hi>Vindicator</hi> can produce to degrade our present Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and to prove 'em <hi>no Bishops.</hi> It is nothing but a Saying of S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> that is nothing at all to his Purpose. The Saying is this: That <hi>a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Bishop is no Bishop.</hi> 'Tis strange methinks, that so great and so worthy a Man, should pretend to raise so great and so extraordinary a Structure upon so weak a Foundation. The Occasion of the Saying was this: <hi>Novatian,</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Presbyter, had rais'd a Schism against <hi>Cornelius</hi> the lawfull Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>; he had got himself to be ordain'd Bishop, tho' <hi>Cornelius</hi> had never been depos'd, was still the <hi>Possessor,</hi> and acknowledg'd the true and the onely Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by all the Churches of the World, both the <hi>Western,</hi> the <hi>Eastern,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi>; and <hi>Novatian</hi> was by all condemn'd as a rank and notorious Schismatick. S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very zealous for the Unity of the Church, thus expresses himself, in his Epistle to<note n="(a)" rend="inter">Epist. 55. <hi>Quo (gradu Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drae Sacerdotalis) occupato de Dei voluntate, atque omnium nostriùm consensione firmato; quisquis jam E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus fieri voluerit, foris fiat ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse est; nec habeat Ecclesiasticam Ordinationem qui Ecclesiae non tenet unitatem; quisquis ille fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Antonianus,</hi> concerning him. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> says he, <hi>being possess'd of the See according to the Will of God, and confirm'd in it by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of us all; whoever would now be a Bishop of that See, must needs be out of the Church; neither can he have any Ecclesiastical Orders, who does not continue in Vnity with the Church. Whosoever he is, whatsoever he may boast of himself or pretend to, he is a prophane Person, an Alien, and not of the Church: And since there cannot be a second Bishop, where another is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62950:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in possession; whosoever is made Bishop after another, who ought to be alone, he is not a second, but none.</hi> This is the place out of which the learned <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi> is pleas'd to draw his Argument; with how <hi>Logical</hi> an Inference the judicious Reader may see. 'Tis strange that That excellent Person should be so much blinded with Prejudice, as not to be able to discover how vast a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between the Case of our present Bishops, and that of which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> discourses. Had <hi>Cornelius</hi> been deposed by the Emperor for refusing to acknowledge his Autority, we have all the reason in the world to believe, That his Deprivation would have been lookt upon by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> as very <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> and <hi>just.</hi> But let us still grant, as we first supposed in our Question, That he ought not to have been deprived by the Emperor himself, but by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: Yet if he had been deprived for refusing to acknowledge the Emperor's Autority; or if he had been upon any other account so deprived by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Autority, as that it would have been impossible for him to exercise his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Jurisdiction; Is it possible for any wise and unprejudiced Man to imagine, That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would have thought so ill of <hi>Novatian</hi> and his Adherents, as he did? If an Enemy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, suppose the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> should in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time have taken a <hi>Frontier</hi> City, and the Bishop of that City should have been deposed by him for refusing to submit to his Autority, Who can believe that That great and wise Man S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> would have declared a new Bishop <hi>no Bishop,</hi> and all his Adherents <hi>Schismatical?</hi> That a <hi>second,</hi> that is, a <hi>Schismatical</hi> Bishop, an <hi>Invader</hi> of a See already <hi>fill'd</hi> and <hi>possess'd,</hi> is no Bishop, is confess'd to be S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Doctrine: But that our Bishops are, in the Sence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the <hi>Invaders of a See already fill'd and possess'd,</hi> that they are <hi>secundi</hi> in his Sence is what we utterly deny. Not a Word, not a Hint in S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> from whence such a thing can be inferr'd. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> may be pleas'd to consider, that our present Possessors did not set up themselves in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to such as were <hi>possess'd</hi> of their Sees; but before they pretended to be Bishops, their Predecessors were made by the Supreme Civil Power <hi>uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Governing,</hi> i. e. were Depos'd. Again, he ought to consider that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Possessors were so far from <hi>ambitiously invading,</hi> like <hi>Novatian,</hi> the Sees of others, that they were all <hi>chose by their respective Churches according to the usual manner; viz.</hi> in the same manner that their Predecessors themselves had been. Let us hold up the <hi>Picture,</hi> which the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has been pleas'd to <hi>draw,</hi> to a <hi>true Light</hi>; and then we shall the better see what a strange <hi>Figure</hi> it is. The <hi>Vindicator's Enthymeme</hi> is this:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> says, that he is no <hi>Bishop,</hi> but a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> who ambitiously invades a See which another is fully possess'd of. <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought, that he is no Bishop, but a Schismatick, who is chosen by the Church, according to the usual manner, into the place of another, whom the Civil Power will not suffer to govern any longer, because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to own its Autority.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>I add, That if a Bishop be a <hi>secundus,</hi> and <hi>no Bishop,</hi> who is put into the place of one unjustly depos'd by the Civil Autority; then it likewise must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he is a <hi>secundus,</hi> and <hi>no Bishop,</hi> who is put into the place of another
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62950:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom a <hi>Synod</hi> has <hi>unjustly</hi> depos'd. But this the learned <hi>Vindicator</hi> will neither himself grant; neither does he, I suppose, believe that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought so. I say that must follow, if we seriously consider the Matter: For the onely good Reason assignable, why in the former Case, the <hi>Successor</hi> is a <hi>secundus,</hi> and <hi>no Bishop,</hi> is this; Because the <hi>Predecessor</hi> has still a <hi>Right</hi> to the Bishoprick. Now 'tis certain, that the Reason is the same in the latter Case: For a Bishop, whom a <hi>Synod</hi> has <hi>unjustly</hi> depriv'd, has still as much <hi>Right</hi> to his Bishoprick, as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>invalidly</hi> depos'd by the Civil Autority. For to me 'tis absurd, that any <hi>unjust</hi> Sentence should take away the <hi>Right:</hi> tho', the Nature of Government requiring it, it is oftentimes necessary that we should submit to such a Sentence. And this (if I am not mistaken) is the common Sence of Mankind. When a Bishop is <hi>unjustly</hi> depriv'd by a <hi>Synod,</hi> we submit to his Successor; not because we imagine, that the other has no longer a <hi>Right,</hi> but onely for <hi>Peace sake.</hi> That a Bishop <hi>unjustly</hi> depriv'd by a <hi>Synod,</hi> has still a <hi>Right</hi> to that Bishoprick, as well as a Bishop deposed by an <hi>Incompetent</hi> Autority, may be clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from this, That after he is deprived, he may be again restor'd, and his Successor be deposed by Appeal to another <hi>Synod:</hi> (and yet the ejected Successor is accounted a true Bishop:) Now is that done justly or not? There is no one will say it is not: And yet it is impossible that the Successor should be <hi>justly</hi> deprived, if the other had <hi>no Right.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude: That a Bishop, who is put into the place of another, unjustly deprived by the Secular Power, is a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Bishop, will by and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Opinion and the Practice of the Antients in general. Let us now proceed to demonstrate, that, as the submitting to a Bishop, whose Predecessor was unjustly deposed by the Civil Autority, is not in it self a <hi>Sin</hi>; so <hi>the ill Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to which it may be liable, are either not so mischievous to the Church, or not so likely to happen as the Evils we endeavour to avoid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">§. 10. The Evils we endeavour to avoid area a <hi>Schism</hi> and a <hi>Persecution</hi>; two Evils as <hi>great</hi> as can possibly befall the Church. And that those two very great Evils must needs be the <hi>certain</hi> and the <hi>immediate</hi> Consequences of a <hi>non-submission,</hi> is too evident to any Considering Man to need any Proof. If the ill Consequences, to which a <hi>submission</hi> may be liable, are so <hi>great</hi> as those two Evils, but not so <hi>certain</hi>; or if they are so <hi>certain,</hi> but not so <hi>great,</hi> it must then be granted that, with respect to Consequences, a <hi>Submission</hi> is more <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> than a <hi>Non-submission.</hi> Now if we consider those evil Consequences which may justly be charg'd upon the <hi>Submission,</hi> we shall find that they are so far from being <hi>both</hi> so <hi>great</hi> and so <hi>certain,</hi> that they are <hi>neither</hi> so <hi>great</hi> nor so <hi>certain,</hi> as those two Evils, which, by a <hi>Non-submission,</hi> must unavoidably be brought upon the Church.</p>
                     <p>So far indeed is the <hi>Principle,</hi> which we maintain, from being <hi>necessarily</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any <hi>very</hi> ill Consequence, that it is not easy to foresee any Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence at all that is <hi>Evil.</hi> As it is for the Good, the Peace, and Prosperity of the Church, that we think our selves obliged to comply, upon occasion, with the Necessity of Times: So if ever the Civil Power (which to fear in this Reign would be very unjust and unreasonable) should pretend to break in upon the <hi>Essentials</hi> of the Church, we should then be obliged not to yield to such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. If the <hi>evil Day</hi> must needs some, (which God forbid!) we will keep it off as long as we can. When it necessarily comes, as now we shew our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62950:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Prudence,</hi> so we'll then prove our <hi>Fortitude.</hi> Not to endeavour to escape from <hi>Damascus</hi> when a <hi>Basket</hi> is fairly offer'd, would be Folly in an <hi>Apostle:</hi> And to run on to <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> when it <hi>honestly</hi> may be avoided, is, according to the <hi>Sanctions</hi> of the Primitive Christians, a <hi>Sin.</hi> Should a Person <hi>absolutely unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> be imposed upon us for a Bishop, we are not then to accept him. If a Roman <hi>Decius</hi> would depose all our Bishops, and not permit us to constitute others in their places, that so he may destroy our Religion, we are not then to regard either what he does or commands. As the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Fabian,</hi> tho', to avoid the Fury of a Persecution,<note n="*" rend="inter">The <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy for that reason deferr'd the Election of <hi>Cornelius</hi> (above 16 Months) as they tell S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in a Letter; but as soon as the Emperor had left <hi>Rome,</hi> they chose <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</note> 
                        <hi>Propter rerum &amp; temporum dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultates,</hi> we might possibly deferr the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet as soon as we thought it convenient, we would choose a <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Tyrant's Decrees. If an <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> King <hi>Frazamund</hi> should command us not to Ordain any Bishops, that so the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion may of Course be rooted out, and his <hi>Heresy</hi> onely prevail, we would then no more value that Command than the <hi>Catholicks</hi> heretofore did; but in spite of his Edict, would get as many Bishops ordain'd as we thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the Church. But how can our Case be compared with either of these? Here is no forbidding Elections, no deposing all Bishops in general, no impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>unqualified</hi> Persons, no destroying of Religion, no advancing of Heresy. The onely Question here is, Whether <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos</hi> may be <hi>follow'd,</hi> when <hi>Cephas</hi> is in <hi>Prison,</hi> and is render'd uncapable of acting as an <hi>Apostle?</hi> Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are resolv'd to have <hi>Cephas</hi>; If they cannot have him, they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have <hi>Christ.</hi> To us 'tis altogether indifferent, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> as long as we have <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is onely one Inconvenience that I can possibly foresee, which can justly be charg'd on this Principle which we advance; and that is this: That by a Submission to the present Possessor, the Civil Governor is like to be encouraged to tyrannize over the Church, and to turn out such Bishops as he does not like, whensoever he pleases, tho' never so unjustly. If that be the Objection of our Adversaries; I answer, First, That the same Inconvenience is in all manner of Government: By submitting to a Bishop who is put into the place of another, whom a <hi>Synod</hi> has unjustly depos'd, that <hi>Synod</hi> may be possibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to turn out others unjustly, as many as it does not like, tho' never so worthy. Secondly, That here in <hi>England</hi> it is not the Will of the Prince that can turn out a Bishop. He has all the same Securities that another Subject can have, and he cannot be deprived of his Bishoprick without a due Course of Law.

to be so very dissolute, as to turn out frequently the Bishops of the Church without any just Cause; yet who can look upon that Mischief to be comparable to that of a <hi>Schism</hi> and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Persecution?</hi> What can the suffering of a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men be, when compared to the Peace and Tranquillity of the whole Church besides? Our Adversaries may be pleas'd to consider, That it was not for the Bishops that the Church was establish'd; but the Bishops were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the sake of the Church. It is not therefore the Welfare of the Bishops, as the Bishops are these or those Men, much less of some <hi>few</hi> particular Bishops, but the Welfare of the whole Church in general that is chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                     <p n="11">§. 11. And thus, I hope, I have sufficiently made out what I proposed to prove, That the submitting to a Bishop, who is put into the place of another unjustly deposed by the Civil Autority, is neither in it self a <hi>Sin,</hi> nor liable to ill Consequences so likely to happen as the Evils we endeavour to avoid; or, if so likely to happen, not so great and pernicious to the Church as those are. From whence it necessarily follows, That such a Submission is in it self highly <hi>reasonable.</hi> Which was the first Proposition we proposed to be demonstrated. I come now to the Second General proposed to be made out, That such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is agreeable to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Antients.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">§. 12. But before I put an end to this Chapter, and proceed to the Proof of this last Proposition, there remains yet one thing more to be consider'd, and that is the Imputation of <hi>Heresy,</hi> which the learned <hi>Vindicator</hi> is pleas'd to fix upon us. Any Opinion, says the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> on account of which Men separate from their Ecclesiastical Governors, is <hi>Heretical,</hi> tho' it be not in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so: And such an Opinion is not <hi>Heretical onely, when Men designedly sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from others on that very account, because they are not of that Opinion; but also when they venture on such Practices on account of that Opinion, wherein others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate with 'em; for that very reason, because they cannot join with 'em in that Opinion. Then plainly the differing in such Opinions, makes a difference of Communion unavoidable; and therefore the Opinions themselves, in such a Case as this is, are Signals of different Communions, which will come under the Charge of Heresy.</hi> His meaning is, that We, maintaining this Opinion, That the Civil Power has Autority to depose a Bishop for a <hi>Political</hi> Crime; or, if it has no such Autority, when once it has deposed a Bishop, it is lawfull to acknowledge the Successor; and in consequence of that Opinion, submitting now to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Possessors, are therefore <hi>Hereticks,</hi> because He and his Party cannot join with us in that Practice, as being of the contrary Opinion. Here it comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind, what S. <hi>Ierom</hi> somewhere says, That he that can with <hi>Patience</hi> hear himself call'd <hi>Heretick,</hi> is no <hi>good Christian.</hi> This is true of those Heresies which were so in the Opinion of the Antients: But in this Case we <hi>dare</hi> to be <hi>patient. Ego tibi Haereticus tu mihi:</hi> That's all the Return we shall make; The <hi>Vindicator,</hi> in consequence of his Opinion, that the Civil Autority has no power to depose a Bishop; and that if a Bishop is so deposed, his Successor ought to be rejected, tho' otherwise never so worthy, adheres to the Bishops deprived, and disowns those that are put into their places. In this Practice of the <hi>Vindicator</hi> we cannot join with him; and for that very reason, because we cannot join with him in his Opinion. And what now follows from our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Notion of <hi>Heresy,</hi> but that he himself is a <hi>Heretick?</hi> It is nothing at all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62950:124"/>
to our Purpose. But for his own sake I shall here take upon me to add, (with a <hi>pace maximi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That he may be properly call'd a <hi>Heretick,</hi> who separates from the Church, because the Church is not of his Opinion, tho' the Opinion is not at all in its own nature Heretical, I grant: For there is a sort of <hi>Heresy</hi> which is not sinfull on the account of the Opinion maintain'd, but onely because it is a <hi>separation</hi> from the Church. But this I assert in opposition to what is laid down by the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> That to all <hi>Heresy</hi> (as the word is strictly taken to denote a <hi>Sin</hi> contradistinct to <hi>Schism</hi>) it is necessary that there be an <hi>Opinion</hi> maintain'd; which either the <hi>Church</hi> condemns, or for which the Person that maintains it, does of himself separate from the Church. If it be not for any <hi>Opinion</hi> that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is divided from the Church, but onely for what is <hi>done</hi> by the Church, he cannot be call'd, in a strict sence, a <hi>Heretick,</hi> but onely a <hi>Schismatick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">§. 13. But to wave this Dispute, as not at all material, and to suffer the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> if he pleases, to enjoy his Notion; What now is the Use he would make of it? What is his Design in advancing it? The Use he makes of it is this: He alleges the aforesaid <hi>Heresy</hi> as a Reason for their Separation. He tells us, That we being guilty of <hi>Heresy,</hi> they ought by our own Concessions to keep off from our Communion, because we our selves acknowlege that <hi>Heresy</hi> is a just cause of Separation. <hi>Tho' we should admit,</hi> says he, <hi>that the Author of the</hi> Baroccian <hi>Treatise had been successfull in all that he has attempted: we may yet justify our adherence to the deprived Bishops, and our Separation from our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries opposite Altars, and justify it too by the Doctrine of their own Author: for even he permits a Separation where Orthodoxy is concern'd, and expressly excepts this Case from the Number of those which he pretends to confute. An Heretical Bishop he calls a false Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis strange that the worthy and learned <hi>Vindicator</hi> should be so much out in his <hi>Logick,</hi> as not to see the Inconsistency of what he alleges, and to offer this as a <hi>reason</hi> for their <hi>not communicating</hi> with us! If it is their <hi>not communicating with us</hi> that makes our Opinion <hi>Heretical,</hi> and us <hi>Hereticks</hi>; how do they <hi>refuse to communicate with us</hi> for this reason, <hi>because we are Hereticks?</hi> We could not be <hi>Hereticks</hi> according to the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>'s own Notion, 'till they <hi>had refused to communicate with us.</hi> So dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing it is, First to do a thing rashly, and then to <hi>hunt</hi> for a <hi>Reason!</hi> If this Plea of our Author is good, I would very fain know how any <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> can be proved to be unlawfull. Let our Author stand out a little, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with our old <hi>Dissenters.</hi> He asks a Dissenter, why he separates from the Church? The Dissenter tells him 'tis, because the Church is <hi>Heretical.</hi> But why Heretical? Because she thinks it lawfull to oblige her Members to the use of Ceremonies, and pursuant to that Opinion she actually imposes the use of 'em. In the use of these Ceremonies (says the Dissenter) we cannot join with you; and for that very reason, because we cannot join with you in this Opinion, That the Church has power to impose upon its Members the use of Ceremonies: And because we cannot join with the Church in this Opinion and Practice, upon that very account the Church is <hi>Heretical.</hi> Thus according to our Author's own Plea: but the Plea would be vain and <hi>Illogical.</hi>

                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62950:124"/>§. 14. But this is not all: We are not onely <hi>Hereticks</hi> upon that account, but, as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> contends, we are <hi>Hereticks</hi> likewise (as <hi>Heresy</hi> signifies an <hi>erring</hi>) even in <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> He affirms, that our Opinion is a <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Error,</hi> because (as he says) it is utterly destructive of the Church, as the Church is a <hi>Society</hi> distinct from the <hi>State.</hi> To maintain this Opinion, That for <hi>Political Crimes</hi> a Bishop may be lawfully Depriv'd by the Civil Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Or this, That supposing he cannot be lawfully so depriv'd; yet if he is deprived, it is lawfull for Peace-sake to submit to his Successor: How that is destructive of the Church, as the Church is a <hi>Society,</hi> I, for my part, cannot perceive. To me 'tis much more apparent, that to advance this Opinion, That a Bishop cannot be deprived by the Civil Autority <hi>for any Crime whatsoever,</hi> is destructive of all <hi>Civil</hi> Government, which, as well as the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> is of God's Institution. He therefore that advances that Notion, advances a very dangerous Notion. But it is not my Business at present to engage in these Disquisitions. I shall onely make bold to ask the <hi>Vindicator</hi> a few Questions. If he thinks that Opinion, concerning the Power of the Magistrate, a <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Heresy,</hi> and enough to justify the present <hi>Separation,</hi> how came it to pass that he did not leave the Communion of those, whom he knew to be the Maintainers of that Opinion, before this time? I will ask him one Question more: If the late Bishops should be again restor'd, would he then refuse to communicate with those who advance that Opinion? If he would not; then it is certain, that he does not think that enough to justify the present <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> One more, and then I have done. I desire to know, if our Author knows none of his own Communion, who themselves acknowledge the Power of the Supreme Civil Governor to depose a Bishop for <hi>Political Crimes?</hi> 'Tis strange if he should be ignorant of what every body knows: And it is to be believ'd, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves of his own Communion, at least some of 'em, agree with us in this Opinion, which the <hi>Church of England</hi> has all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this time accounted <hi>Orthodox,</hi> tho' the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is pleas'd to declare it a <hi>Heresy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But enough, and too much, of these Matters. We will leave our much honour'd Adversary to invent some other new Notion more consistent, and more usefull for his Cause: And will now proceed to enquire how <hi>Heretical</hi> our Forefathers were in thinking it lawfull to adhere to the <hi>present</hi> Possessor, and in acting accordingly.</p>
