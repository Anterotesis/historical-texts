         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>AN APPEAL OF All the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> in ENGLAND to GOD, and all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> in order to manifeſt their Sincerity to GOD and the KING.</head>
                  <p>HAving in ſome late Treatiſes given a ſhort Account of the Advances of the Church of <hi>England</hi> towards <hi>Popery,</hi> from the beginning of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am obliged to mention ſome Particulars over again, which leads me to ſome other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations very material for the Deſign in hand.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Firſt Reformers in the dayes of <hi>E.</hi> 6. though of ſeveral Judgments about the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of the Government, were all of honeſt Principles and Sentiments in their Doctrine; and had the ſame mind and deſign to purge the then preſent Church of its Idolatry, Superſtitions, and groſs Errours, and to bring in the ſame pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that was profeſſed by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> and which hath been and is ſtill retained by the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> that were and are now.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103629:3"/>
2. That the ſaid firſt Reformers being divided in their Opinions about retaining that which was good, and taking away whatſoever was amiſs in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as to the outward Governmnt, the Opinion that the Reformation could not be thoroughly done for matter of Government and Externals, as it was poſſible for matter of Doctrine, prevailed ſo far with Biſhop <hi>Hooper, Rogers,</hi> and others that wiſht it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as to make them forbear any further urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a compleat Reformation, in hopes that when the people that were inſtructed in the true, ſaving Doctrine, ſhould be more numerous, the oppoſition to a through Reformation in all points would be leſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this rude draught of Reformation, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that time, had very bad Succeſs; becauſe the <hi>Conformable</hi> Party prevailed ſtill with the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and the Grandees of the Realm, to have it a ſtanding Law, that was not to be repealed nor altered, and which drawing along with it Non-Reſidency, plurality of Livings, a meer form and garb of Religion and Piety, outward pomp and grandeur, beſt ſuited with a Worldly intereſt; whileſt the other Party, who were then <hi>Puritans,</hi> and whom we now call <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> retained, and do ſtill to our days, a deſire, and longing after a thorow Reformation, and they have endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103629:3"/>
by Conferences, Remonſtrances, and Writings, to have it introduced.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That yet the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> were not all of one mind, there being ſtill a Party among them very peaceable and Orthodox, and at leſs diſtance from the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> eſpecially among the Gentry, that were no Courtiers, and in great Towns, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Corporations; whileſt the other Party, made up of <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> grew corrupt, and ſo far from hearkening to a further Reformation, that they made nearer advances towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Jealouſies and apprehenſions daily encreaſing, and fears of inclining to <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> intervening in the Years 38, and 39; and the Diſcontents riſing up in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was forced to call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which began in 1640.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That that <hi>Parliament,</hi> both <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> was moſt, if not all, compoſed of ſuch Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Orthodox Church of <hi>England</hi> men I have but now mentioned, and all conforming to the Rites, Ceremonies of Epiſcopacy and Hierarchy, but yet greatly averſe to Popery, Tyranny, and the Corrupt Party of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that inclined towards <hi>Rome;</hi> Witneſs the many <hi>Speeches</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> they made, as of the Lord <hi>Faulckland,</hi> Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyer, Digby,</hi> and others, with whom Good and Honeſt Biſhops joyned.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103629:4"/>
7. That the Ground and Riſe of the Civil War in 1640, and 43, was in oppoſition to ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and other bad inſtruments.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in 1642, and 43, were all in perfect Conformity to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſo was the Army too that they raiſed; for the General, the main Body of the Army, the Officers and Captains both by Land and Sea, were all <hi>conformable</hi> to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and none of them <hi>Puritans, Presbyterians, Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Sectaries,</hi> or <hi>Conventiclers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. That likewiſe, the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> choſen by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were all <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> and none of them <hi>Silenced Miniſters,</hi> except 8. or 9, and 4 <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. That the firſt Intentions of the <hi>Parliament</hi> was ſo far from ſubverting the Government of Church and State, eſtabliſhed by Law, and from taking away the Houſe of Lords and Biſhops root and branch; that it was only to reform the abuſes of both, and to ſettle ſuch a Model of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as was recommended by the Pious and Learned Biſhops, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> and which did not much differ from that which our <hi>Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi> that now is, recommended to his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his <hi>Declaration</hi> 1660. about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That the <hi>Parliament</hi> had no thoughts of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103629:4"/>
bringing in the <hi>Covenant</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> had not the neceſſity of their Affairs forced them to joyn with the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. That no man was obliged by it to take away <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but only as they are in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Neither was it the Intention of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> at firſt, to take away Deans and Chapters, but to make them more ſerviceable and uſeful, to take away <hi>Pluralities, Non-reſidencies,</hi> and to ſettle a more proportionable Maintenance for Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. That the Change, or Subverſion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the taking away the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> and with them the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and excluding the greateſt part of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and laſt of all, the taking away the <hi>King,</hi> and all the Confuſions, and Diſorders, that happened thereupon, did ariſe from a third Party, <hi>viz.</hi> The Army, that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>Parliament;</hi> Neither for <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> nor for <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> but was an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to them all, and ſought their abſolute ruine and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. That the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> who uſually now go by the name of <hi>Presbyterians, Fanaticks, Independents, Rebels,</hi> Sons of <hi>Belial, &amp;c.</hi> by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Church-Party, that have been always ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advances towards Popery, were ſo far from being the firſt in Arms in oppoſition to the <hi>King,</hi> our late bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

Martyr; and being contrivers of his Death, and of taking away Monarchy; that on the contrary, it was the only Party (while the others of the <hi>King</hi>'s Friends ſate ſtill) that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and ſince 48, in his behalf, to the hazard of their Lives (witneſs Mr. <hi>Love,)</hi> and that in 1660, had a chief hand in reſtoring our gracious Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the II. to his Throne; for which never enough to be valued Benefit and kindneſs, although it was but duty, no Party has been more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely perſecuted by the Corrupt-Party of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> But of this, more anon.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That the <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> mentioned in the Tenth Conſideration, was a confirmation of another former <hi>Declaration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. That whereas, when the <hi>King</hi> came over from the <hi>Hague,</hi> there was a great expectation that his Printed <hi>Declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> would be ſufficient to compoſe all differences and heats, and unite all Parties, by taking away the ſtumbling block of ſubſcribing to thoſe Ceremonies that were not warranted by the Word of God; but juſt on the contrary, the Clamours of the Corrupt Party of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at length prevail'd for reſtoring of thoſe Ceremonies. All which good Biſhop <hi>Brownrig</hi> foretold, a little before his Death, in ſaying, That there would continue the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and Animoſities, that were before; and, with them, the ſame ſpirit of Perſecution which the Corrupt Church-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before 1640, was the cauſe of.</p>

That the Zeal and Fervour of the prevailing Corrupt Church-Party in <hi>England</hi> at this preſent juncture of time, in writing ſo many Books againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſtanding up, ſo ſtoutly againſt the Horid Attempt upon the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Life, and introducing of <hi>Popery,</hi> and hearkening to ſome terms of Reconciliation with the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> to make the oppoſition the ſtronger againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> does no way ſeem to be the effect of a Chriſtian Moderation, but a meer worldly Intereſt, like the zeal of <hi>Jehu,</hi> the union of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> two Mortal Foes againſt the Common Enemy: Or like that of <hi>Auguſtus, Brutus,</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103629:5"/>
                     <hi>Caſsius,</hi> againſt <hi>Antony:</hi> 'Tis the goodneſs of a ſtubborn Boy, juſt ſo long as the Rod is over his Back; for had another ſpirit moved the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than a Worldly one, it would have appeared above theſe 100 Years; when (alas!) no ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made by the <hi>Papists</hi> againſt their Lives, and Livings, when a Hundred Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances were made to them, with Prayers and Tears, for the removing of the offending Rites and Ceremonies; and of the great inclination they had for Popery, in depopulating <hi>England,</hi> by driving men away to Colonies abroad: but could never be heard.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Things being thus ſtated, one may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and ſtrongly conclude, That it is a moſt horrid untruth, and calumnie to make the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Conventiclers,</hi> or <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> not only the firſt authors, and abettors of the Civil Wars, and of the firſt taking up of Arms in oppoſition to the Evil Counſellors about the <hi>King</hi> in 42 and 43, but alſo the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of <hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt; when as they have been, and ſtill are the great preſervers of the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon, Life, Honours, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Prerogatives; the beſt Chriſtians, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103629:6"/>
beſt Reformed, and the beſt Subjects of the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. And the falſe and unworthy ſtiling of theſe Reſtorers of the <hi>King, Rebels, Fanaticks, Sms of Belial,</hi> &amp;c. doth carry along with it the ſame devilliſh Malice; which makes it now become a common Proverb in the Mouths of this corrupt Church of <hi>England-Party,</hi> That they had rather be <hi>Papists,</hi> than <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> and that were there a Turn of State, (as God forbid) they would ſooner turn <hi>Papists,</hi> than <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Beſides, the idle, fooliſh, ſenceleſs, but alſo malicious miſtake, to make the holieſt of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> to paſs for <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who, though they love their perſons, and the holineſs of their Doctrine, and Lives, yet either they are wholly averſe to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe they do not very well know what it means; Since the Well-affected fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Preaching, and imitate their Lives, but yet by no means upon any account of their Government.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. That the worſt thing in the carriage of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103629:6"/>
the <hi>Conformists</hi> towards the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> is their raſh, uncharitable, and unchriſtian judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hearts and Inſides of men, (which are only known to <hi>God Almighty,</hi> who is the Searcher of Hearts,) as if they were made up of Deceit and Hipocriſie; and alike conſtruing their unblameable behaviour and carriage, as if it were but formal, and extrinſecal, and of the pure, Orthodox Doctrine of their Sermons and Writings, though never ſo much ſummed up in Scripture phraſes, as if all was but <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Tone,</hi> and taking of God's Name in vain; when they make a quite different Judgment of the <hi>Conformists,</hi> both of their Lives and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and when they make uſe of the ſame Scripture terms as the others do; for in their eſteem they are looked upon as true; ſincere, and holy Chriſtians, though their outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment do ſomewhat differ from that of the other.</p>
                  <p>This I intend, by God's aſſiſtance, to make clear to you in a larger Diſcourſe, from the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> who doubtleſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in handling of the Nature of Juſtification by Faith, but agree with the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> in making uſe of the ſame Scripture-Expreſſions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103629:7"/>
and commend ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Davenant, Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, uſher, Hall,</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> all <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> for doing the like, and who will tell us, that this Juſtification by Faith is <hi>a Recumbency of a poor Sinner upon the Lord Jeſus Christ; a casting of our ſelves upon him, relying on his Merits, laying hold on him, cloſing with him, going to him, and ſhrowding our ſelves under the Robes of his Righteouſneſs:</hi> Moſt of which are Scripture phraſes: But yet for all this, the very ſame Expreſſions, being uttered by ſuch <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen, Manton, Anneſly, Jacomb, Bates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins, Alſop, Cradock, Silvester, Watſon, and Others,</hi> for the better ſetting out the nature of Juſtification by Faith, are looked upon by Dr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> as meer Impoſters, Charms, Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, artificial Jugglings, Terms of Modiſh and Courtly Faith, by which this Doctor makes good the ſaying of <hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger, <hi>Epist.</hi> 21. <q>Multum intereſt quid à quo<expan>

                  <p>That ſuch a prejudice againſt the Generation of God's Children, that make it their grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to get an aſſurance of Heaven and of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as are, not only many of the Peaceable

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall inſiſt very particularly upon ſome very conſiderable Inferences and Concluſions which I ſhall draw from ſome <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that I have already taken notice of, but which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too often inculcated; the truth of which is known ſufficiently by thoſe that are moſt Eminent in Piety and Holineſs of Living, and in Learning, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the Biſhops <hi>Hooper, Smith, Rudd, Carleton, Grindall,</hi> the two <hi>Abbots, uſher, Hall,</hi> and by other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that were as <hi>Conformable</hi> as thoſe Biſhops.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That though the firſt Reformation in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, was extremely pure as to its Doctrine, it was notwithſtanding very defective and imperfect as to the exterior Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe it was adjuſted to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time where the <hi>Papists</hi> were Twenty, for One, that was reformed in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103629:8"/>
2. That the firſt Reformers imagined, that when the People, converted to the true Faith, ſhould be more Numerous, and more diſpoſed to receive a more perfect Reformation, The Succeſſors of the firſt Reformers would apply themſelves to it with more Earneſtneſs and Zeal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But it never came into their thoughts, that their Succeſſors would be guilty of ſo great a fault, as to act the quite contrary to ſuch a good Project and Deſign, in perſuading both Princes and Parliaments to bring the firſt <hi>Rude Draught</hi> of Reformation into a <hi>ſtanding Law:</hi> but only to have it eſtabliſhed for a certain time, untill they themſelves ſhould ſee they were able to effect a more perfect Reformation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Practice of theſe Succeſſors of the firſt Reformers hath been unreaſonable, wicked, impious, and cruel; in the Impoſition of ſeveral things, which they themſelves have owned not to be neceſſary, and at beſt but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, under <hi>pain</hi> of deprivation <hi>ab officio &amp; beneficio;</hi> although all the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> have not been equally guilty, for ſome among them have approved of theſe meaſures they have taken towards the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> but yet have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103629:8"/>
connived at them either by their ſubmiſſion, or their ſilence, and have not vigorouſly enough ſet themſelves againſt the Corruption that ſo much prevailed.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> I gather theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, which naturally follow the aforeſaid Premiſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſeveral Biſhops and Doctors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> to be Perſons of great Learning, Worth, and Piety, but who are Extreme Admirers of the Epiſcopacy of <hi>England,</hi> and all its Conſequences, and who have alſo preferred its Government to all other Eſtabliſhments in <hi>Europe,</hi> have by an unlucky accident, contributed more towards the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchie, and its Practiſes, and towards the perpetuating the Feuds and Quarrels between the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> than it has been poſſible for any other Corrupted Party to do by all their Irregularities, and advances towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it may be ſaid of theſe good Biſhops and Doctors before mentioned, what the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Sages have obſerved of <hi>Anſelme, Bernard, Thomas Aquinas, John of Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Gerſon,</hi> That by their great repute of Piety, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103629:9"/>
they have contributed more to the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Tyranny, and Religion, in the Minds of the People, than a hundred ſuch as <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII, and <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII. were able to effect by their Tyranny, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impurity of their Lives, for the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting of the Pope and his Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it is not to be believed how much the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſuffer in the Eſteem of our Great Men of the Proteſtant Party in <hi>Europe;</hi> who, hearing people talk of the Learning and Piety of ſo many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Doctors, all <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and who reſemble thoſe four Doctors I have juſt before named, ſay aloud, that the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> muſt needs be very unreaſonable, and of a very nice and fantaſtical Piety, for refuſing to Conform to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after the Example of thoſe four Doctors.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That how good ſoever the Intentions of ſome of the Biſhops and Doctors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be, that are of the ſame temper of ſpirit with theſe four Doctors, and what kindneſs ſoever they may have for the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists;</hi> it is impoſſible They ſhould ever come over to them, and conſent to terms of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Moderation, ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this Judgment and Opinion, That of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103629:9"/>
all the Eſtabliſhed Eccleſiaſtical Governments in <hi>Europe,</hi> that of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the moſt excellent, and the moſt <hi>Apostolical,</hi> and that there is nothing of defect in it; and ſo long as the multitude of their Benefices, and the great honour they are in, in the World, blinds their Judgment, there being no likelihood, nor hopes, that thoſe, who are raiſed ſo high, and that live in honour and abundance, richly, and fatly, (unleſs they will imitate good Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> who beſtowes moſt of his Church-Revenues on the Poor,) will diminiſh any thing of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both as to their Retinue, or their Kitchin, and will deſcend from high to low; and that a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who now goes before the <hi>Barons,</hi> will quit his Place, to be only a poor ſimple Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and Watchman over a ſmall company of <hi>Priests,</hi> ſuch as were St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin:</hi> For this Eminence of Fortune and Dignity does abſolutely ſhut up the door to all the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Reformation, which we learn from <hi>Mounſieur Claude</hi> in his Defence of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> where he tells us, That the Cardinal <hi>du Prat,</hi> for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was the moſt violent of all men, and the moſt inraged againſt <hi>Luther</hi>'s Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was provided of Five Biſhopricks, and I know not how many other good and fat Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:103629:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That for theſe Reaſons, Methinks, it might be expected from theſe good Biſhops and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that by a Chriſtian condeſcention, they would endeavour to incline their Brethren the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> to abate ſomething of their heat and vigorouſneſs againſt the <hi>Non-Conformists;</hi> but ſo long as they themſelves are neither ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any error or defect in their Church, it is not to be expected, or hoped for from them, that they ſhould go about the doing of any ſuch good work, how great and eminent ſoever they be, no more than it ought to be expected from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, ſo long as they do look upon, and verily believe, their Church to be infallible.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it cannot be conſiderately ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the perfect day of hope, of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Reformation, and of the Reconciliation of the <hi>Conformists</hi> to the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi> ſhould break forth from theſe good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Doctors, nor from any of the Clergy, but from KINGS, and the Princes of the People, whoſe hearts are in <hi>God</hi>'s hands, and who holds them as the Rivers of Waters.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. As for the <hi>Odium</hi> that is caſt upon the <hi>Congregational Way,</hi> and thoſe who are called <hi>Independents,</hi> as being the more immediate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and abettors of the <hi>King</hi>'s Murther, and of taking away <hi>Monarchy,</hi> it can be eaſily wiped
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103629:10"/>
off, and made out, That <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>'s Army, like that of King <hi>David</hi>'s in the Wilderneſs, was a Medley or a Collection of all Parties that were diſcontented, as ſome <hi>Courtiers,</hi> ſome <hi>Epiſcoparians,</hi> few of any Sect, but moſt of none, or elſe of the Religion of <hi>Thomas Hobbes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Scarborough,</hi> not mentioning the <hi>Papists,</hi> who had the greateſt hand in the Death of <hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt; the ſucceſs of which made them ſo daring and impious, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive another moſt Damnable and Helliſh Plot to cut off the Life of his Sacred Majeſty that now is, his Royal Son, and our moſt Gracious Soveraign.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. That ſince the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> were a generation of men, either of the firſt date (as it is moſt likely,) or, at leaſt, that roſe in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> at the ſame time as the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> did; and ſince they were for number and quality, as great, or rather greater, and more conſiderate than the other, and who, in their Judgment, came nearer, as to the outward Government, and Purity of Worſhip, not only to the firſt Reformers, <hi>Zuinglius, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Practice; and who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were the <hi>TRUE PROTESTANTS,</hi> moſt Conformable to that Party in <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſo ſtiled themſelves <hi>Protestants,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103629:11"/>
to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Edicts of <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Spire,</hi> it muſt needs be a great wickedneſs and cruelty too in the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> becauſe they had all the while the Countenance of <hi>Princes,</hi> and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Sword, to perſecute the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and to deprive them of the liberty of ſetting up Purer Ordinances in Conventicles, and of ſharing in the Publick Maintenance for the Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. That it is a moſt barbarous, improper, uncharitable, and unchriſtian language in the Corrupt-Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ſtile themſelves the only true, and properly ſo called, <hi>PROTESTANTS,</hi> and to diſcard all others in <hi>Europe,</hi> from the right to that name, for want of ſuch <hi>Epiſcopal Ordinations</hi> as are in <hi>England:</hi> as if that 500 men poſſeſſing the three parts of the Church-Revenues in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould better deſerve to be called <hi>Protestants,</hi> than the firſt ſo called in <hi>Germany;</hi> whereas what ever Biſhop <hi>Bilſon, Andrews,</hi> Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> could ſay in the behalf of the Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as being the moſt <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and Primitive,) there is none more oppoſite, not only to that of the firſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but alſo to Scripture, Reaſon, and Antiquity.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Theſe being the Material Heads, or a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103629:11"/>
Summary <hi>Idea</hi> of the whole, to be more largely and particularly handled hereafter, (if God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Life and Time to the Author,) I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpt much from the <hi>Scrinia</hi> of the Reverend and Learned Divine Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> but yet ſo, as to take the liberty to follow my own Method and <hi>Genius,</hi> as to the menage of it.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. So then the main deſign of the Subſequent Book, whereof this is a brief, but full <hi>Specimen,</hi> ſhall be to ſhew, prove, and make clear to You, the unreaſonableneſs, unconſcionableneſs, and conſequently the ungodlineſs of retaining, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and preſſing the things in debate between the <hi>Conformists</hi> and the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and of perſecuting thoſe, that refuſe to ſubmit to them, or at leaſt to approve of them.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. That Diſſenters could not, cannot, ought not, neither in reaſon, nor in Conſcience, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them, at leaſt for the <hi>aſsenting,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi> to them, and the approving of them.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. That thoſe <hi>Conformists,</hi> whom I call Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and Orthodox men, ſuch as were the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 1640, and thoſe of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> aſſembled, and their Predeceſſors, and all others, however otherwiſe, moſt upright, ſincere, Orthodox, holy, and well-minded perſons, ſince the firſt Reformation in <hi>King Edward</hi> the Sixth's dayes, and Lovers of the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103629:12"/>
have hitherto been <hi>Conformists,</hi> were all guilty of prevarication, and of a-ſinful yielding, comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aſſenting, and ſubſcribing to a Church-way, which doubtleſs is ſinful.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And therefore, that the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> who ever ſince <hi>King Edward</hi>'s dayes, in <hi>Conformity</hi> to the true Doctrine of thoſe of the beſt ſort of <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> kept gathered Churches, and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of the Pariſhes, had right Reaſon, and Scripture on their ſide, and walked with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Conſcience, were the beſt reformed from <hi>Popery,</hi> and thoſe that preſerved the true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Doctrine, Worſhip and Government, and conveyed it to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. The Author may Incidently ſpeak of the nature of the Church, Synods, Aſſociations, and Fraternities by a confederate diſcipline, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any means hear of a National Church-Tribunal, independant on the Magiſtrate, to whom only he allows the ſetting up of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Worſhip, by Perſuaſion and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but not in the leaſt by forcing men to it, by penal Lawes, except they be <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or diſturbers of the Publick Peace.</p>

                  <p>I AM very ſenſible, that My late Book, viz. <hi>A ſhort and true Account of the ſeveral Advances the Church of</hi> England <hi>hath made towards</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath raiſed up very great and fierce tempeſts againſt me, as well from ſome of my Friends, as from thoſe that are moſt otherwiſe to me; eſpecially from thoſe who can very calmly, ſedately, patiently, and without any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the world, ſee the publication of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Books, and ſuch others that are much what of the ſame ſtuff with them, that are good for nothing but to inſtruct People either in Atheiſm, or, at beſt, in an indifferency as to Matters of Religion; but who are highly provoked, if any One comes but near their <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> either to make a Seaſonable Diſcovery, or, in Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to bring them the wholeſome Application of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſuch as is this Truth, That the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would never have been ingaged in ſuch a deſign as to introduce <hi>Popery</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> by Maſſacres, and other wayes of the higheſt cruelty; if they had not been very well aſſured, that, though the Corrupt-Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are the moſt prevailing now, be not in a diſpoſition to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103629:14"/>
give their Conſent to ſuch Maſſacres, (the thoughts of which are alone ſufficient to ſtrike a horrour into the worſt of them,) yet, they are all of them, (I mean the Corrupt Party) pretty inclinable to, or (which is not a jott leſs) not very much againſt, embracing the Religion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I WILL begin with the Heat and Paſſion of my Friends againſt me, and with the Judgment which they make upon <hi>my Short and True Account, &amp;c.</hi> they ſay, That that Book is altogether now unſeaſonable, When as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great Learning, Piety, and Merit, and who, at the bottom, are very Sincere and Upright in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> to whom I might joyn Profeſſor <hi>Burnett,</hi> are making it their buſineſs, as they think it their duty, to re-unite the Two Parties, the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and when they are moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly imployed in reducing to Practice the Means of Peace and Concord, according to Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi>'s Model; and that inſtead of lending them my helping hand, and aſſiſting them in ſo good a Work, I am doing what I can to divide both Parties, and to exaſperate and imbitter them one againſt the other.</p>
                  <p>BUT, Methinks, theſe Gentlemen either have not read my Book at all, or elſe have no mind to underſtand the deſign of it, which is to diſ-ingage, and free all honeſt Perſons, ſuch as are the above-mentioned Doctors, from the Corrupt Party of their Church, to joyn and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves with that of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> that ſo thoſe two Parties might Conſolidate in one, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, (for <hi>vis <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita fortior,)</hi> be more capable to act with greater Zeal and Vigour againſt the third
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103629:14"/>
Party, that are making their <hi>Advances towards</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>ALSO My deſign in that Book is, to make thoſe honeſt Perſons and Doctors underſtand, who, on one hand, do perfectly agree with the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith and Doctrine; and, on the other, with that Corrupt-Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in Matters of Government and Ceremonies; My deſign, I ſay, is, to make them underſtand the truth of theſe following Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries.</p>
                  <p>THAT ſeeing this former Agreement ought to be much otherwiſe the foundation <hi>of the Communion of Saints,</hi> and the cauſe which ſhould ingage and bind their Hearts, Affections, and Intereſts together, than the latter; thoſe good and honeſt Doctors are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the more obliged in Conſcience to adhere to the <hi>Non Conformiſts,</hi> who agree with them in Matter of Faith, than to thoſe who do only agree with them in matter of Ceremonies: and they will find that they are obliged to it ſo much the more, if they will but take upon them the trouble of inſiſting upon ſome Obſtacles, which have, for above theſe hundred Years, hindered, and, as I may ſay, ſtaved off the re-union of the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> with the <hi>Non-Conformiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE firſt Obſtacle, is, the Averſion which the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> as well the good as the bad, have alwayes had, even in, and ſince the time of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. down to our dayes, untill the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> were awakened by this laſt moſt Damnable and Helliſh Plott of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to take away the Life of our Sacred Soveraign, <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, to Subvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and utterly to aboliſh the Proteſtant Religion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103629:15"/>
and Name among Chriſtians; the averſion, I ſay, they had to hearken to any terms of Reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>THAT this Averſion has eſpecially appeared in the Corrupt-Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have evermore turned a deaf ear to the Cryes, Clamours, and Remonſtrances, which the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> (whereof the Chief was Biſhop <hi>Hooper,)</hi> have made, to be freed and diſcharged from the heavy Yoke of Ceremonies, and to perſuade and bring over theſe obſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive men, to paſs on, from that firſt but rude draught of Reformation made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. which (that ſo much Contemptible and deſpiſed Man now a days by them, but, I ſay, honeſt) Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> calls <hi>tolerabiles ineptias,</hi> to a more perfect Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to what the laſt mentioned great Man, <hi>Calvin,</hi> (for I cannot ſpeak his Name but with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming reverence) expreſſes of it, <q>Sic ergò à talibus rudimentis incipere licuit, ut doctos, proboſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan>; et graves Chriſti Miniſtros ultrà eniti, et aliquid limatius et purius quoerere conſentaneum foret. Epiſtola ad Anglos Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furtenſes,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT theſe Obſtinate Men of the Corrupt-Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have been always ſo remote from hearkning to, and anſwering the requeſts of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> that they have been juſt the contrary; and they are ſo much the more violent and inflexible, as they have been making their continual advances towards the Doctrines and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUxT I find, that the greateſt Obſtacle to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union comes from theſe honeſt, upright, and ſincere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom I mentioned before, and from whom we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103629:15"/>
ought to expect, that they ſhould come over three parts of four of the way to this Reconciliation; but from which they are, and will be, very remote, ſo long as they do openly and loudly maintain, That that firſt Eſtabliſhment of Government in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. is not a rude draught, and, much leſs, as <hi>Calvin</hi> would needs have it, <hi>tolerabiles ineptioe;</hi> but that it is a Model of Government in the laſt perfection, a Maſter-Piece that cannot be made better, and which, of all the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are in the World, comes neareſt to that of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>THAT ſo long as the Government which the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> would have, hath no agreement or affinity with that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it is not to be hoped, that Two Parties, who both do verily believe themſelves to be in the right, can ever be perſuaded to come to any agreement of a middle way, which cannot be, at leaſt in their accounts, but wrong and vitious; though, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the belief which I have of, and the eſteem I bear to them both, they do each lye under Errour, and a groſs and vitious extremity, I do not at all queſtion, if they would each of them be willing to abate ſomething of their pretended right, but that both Parties might meet in a juſt <hi>Middle,</hi> and an <hi>equal temperament</hi> which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſembles that <hi>Vertue,</hi> that keeps the ballance even between <hi>two Vices,</hi> and the good and handſome husbandry, which is the <hi>Medium</hi> between <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Prodigality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT all theſe Obſtacles hindering and keeping off the re-union of the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> with the <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> it would be therefore a moſt Excellent and Chriſtian Deſign, and a bleſſed Work, to labour to undeceive all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103629:16"/>
honeſt perſons, as well <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> as <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> of thoſe mighty great, and unaccomptable prejudices, which each of them are prepoſſeſſed with, and which makes them ſo hugely ſtand up for the pretended Excellency of their Government; without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which good Work, this deſired Reconciliation is not feaſible, it being, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſayes, impoſſible, that thoſe who think themſelves whole, ſhould ever be cured of their diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>BUT of all my Friends who treat me ruggedly, there is One eſpecially, that violently carries himſelf out againſt me, for having condemned the manner of Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s uſage of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> upon the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith; which, he ſayes, I have done meerly from a ſpirit of malice and revenge, for his having denyed to give me the Sacrament in his Church in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> becauſe I reluſed to take it kneeling: But I proteſt before Almighty God, (who is the Searcher of hearts, and knows that I ſpeak the truth,) that I have not the leaſt ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of it, nor indeed can I make any tolerable hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome pretence to have one, becauſe, after he had ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed me, that Doctor came to my Lodging, and deſired my excuſe, and made me a very obliging and extream ſatisfaction: but it is the Cauſe of God, which carries me forth to repel the wrong and injury he does to the honeſteſt perſons in the World; Which yet, methinks, might be pardonable, if he was not ſo—hardy, as to put himſelf in the place and ſtead of GOD, in judging of their inward intentions, as when he aſſures us, that all thoſe Expreſſions (of <hi>Downham, Davenant,</hi> and <hi>R. Hooker,</hi> which are thoſe of the Holy Scripture, upon the ſubject of Juſtification by Faith, and which without doubt he highly approves of in the Mouths of the holy Apoſtles, and of thoſe three Doctors,) are the words of a falſe and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103629:16"/>
hypocritical heart, when they are ſpoken by the <hi>Non-Conformiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS for the down-right <hi>Thames-Street</hi> way of Railing againſt me, which, I am ſure, none of my Friends would uſe, and all others, of any improved Civility, or good Manners, do nauſcate and abhor; (but pure Streams can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flow from an impure Fountain; and ſo I am ſatisfied.) I do not value them, nor can they prejudice any, but the perſons from whom they iſſue: they that will be flinging up dirt, do manifeſtly ſhow themſelves of a dirty humour, and much good may do them, whoſoever they are, with ſuch their beloved Naſtineſs: but, methinks, they are greatly like thoſe of the Lawyer, whom <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſpeaks of, that thought he had very ſolidly baſfled, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the cauſe of his Adverſary, becauſe his Lawyer had committed a groſs Soloeciſme in his Plea. All the Arguments of that Inſignificant Rayler, that has drawn the Lively Picture of <hi>Lewis du Moulin,</hi> as he thinks, to the worſt and beaſtlieſt advantage, and it may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conceals his Name, becauſe he is aſhamed to own the uglineſs of his daubing; I ſay, all the Arguments of that Inſignificant Railer reſemble thoſe of that Oratour, who would needs have the cauſe of <hi>Vatinius</hi> to be the worſt, becauſe he had crooked Leggs; or are like to <hi>Origen</hi>'s Enemies, who finding themſelves unable to refute thoſe pretended errors, thought, to be ſure, they ſhould acquit themſelves bravely, by running him down with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that other people made of his Perſon and Writings; for, without ever entring into the merits of the cauſe, he alledges <hi>Mounſieur Daille,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſpeaking to my diſadvantage. He might alſo, if it had but once come into his unthinking, but raſh head, have added the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who calls me <hi>Wretch,</hi> and <hi>Wicked,</hi> and blackens me after a ſtrange and unworthy manner, only
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103629:17"/>
becauſe I have ſaid of him, (and I believe, did I but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely appeal to his Conſcience, it could not upbraid me with a lye) that the Judgment which he makes at this day of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when it laviſhly pours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him I know not how many great Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, is quite contrary to that Opinion he was of concerning it about Twenty Years ago, when he was not ſo well provided and lined with them: Except he be ſomewhat nettled, becauſe I have ſo plainly laid open the weakneſs of his Argument, to make out the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> for denying, <hi>viz,</hi> That all things that are not expreſly forbidden in the Word of God, are ſufficient to juſtifie thoſe who ſubmit to them, when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Command of the Magiſtrate intervenes. Such great men as He, and as <hi>Mounſieur Daille</hi> was, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like to Rivers, that raiſe themſelves to ſo vaſt a height, that they overflow their Banks, and the Bounds of decent moderation: ſuch was once <hi>Mounſieur Daille,</hi> when he flew out againſt me in ſuch violent heats for having taken it ill, becauſe he unhandſomely and unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly treated my Father.</p>
                  <p>AS to what this Author of <hi>the Lively Picture,</hi> &amp;c. ſayes of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and of the ſiniſter Judgment he makes of me; he is much gone aſtray (like a loſt Sheep) from the truth; for not many years ago, did this ſame Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> dedicate a Book to me in theſe words, <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Powers of Magiſtrates and Church Paſtors, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>TO MY LEARNED, SINCERE, AND WORTHY FRIEND, Lewis du Moulin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, The way which the Author of <hi>the Lively Picture</hi> takes, to expoſe a Perſon to the Laughter, and Scorn of all the World, and to make him paſs for an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Noddy-peeks, a Lyer, and a moſt impertinent Scribler, who knows neither what he ſayes, nor what he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103629:17"/>
writes, very well, ought not to be that of alledging the Judgment which ſuch Perſons as <hi>Mounſieur Daille,</hi> and the Dean of <hi>Windſor</hi> make of him; but he ſhould, if he had been able, have quoted thoſe Writings, and Sentences, wherein he might convince the World, that they were the product of a man, that had neither Brains to make a Judgment; nor Learning, nor Stile, nor that had any thing of truth in him.</p>
                  <p>AS to the <hi>CELE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SMA,</hi> of which he makes me the Author, I abſolutely deny it: but If I were ſo, I might, (what he will never have any occaſion to do) without vanity, boaſt, That I had made one of the beſt Pieces that ever had yet been extant in the World; I mean, in the behalf of the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and where there is neither Truth, nor Judgment, nor Learning, nor good Language, nor any thing elſe wanting that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to give a Book applauſe. If I was of his humour, I might wire-draw upon him ſubſtantially far beyond his length; but I had rather ſpeak a great deal of truth in a few pithy words, than to be, like him, ſcandalouſly falſe, tedious, and railing, and never know in reaſon when to come to a</p>

                  <p>To this I may add, that the perſecuting pirit of thoſe Men, that, either in pretence, or in reality, do profeſs an exact practiſe of Piety and Devotion, comes from a ſecret kind of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> and Averſion to all manner of Religion; when the pureſt is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Eye-ſore to ſuch Spirits; as is ſo much the more apparent and manifeſt, by how much it is evident that they would not be ſeen to act againſt Profaneneſs, debauched courſes, Drunkenneſs, or Popery; becauſe thoſe diſorderly ways and courſes have a great Sympothy and agreeableneſs with the profane ſpirits of the World.</p>
