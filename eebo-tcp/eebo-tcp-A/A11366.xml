            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By which peruersenesse of eithers error, those Nations which haue bin famous for their <hi>Military valour,</hi> haue vtterly lost their ancient reputation, after their imbracement of Letters and learning.</p>
            <p>The best reasons that I can giue, are either to be grounded vpon desire of case, or else vpon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the precepts of Nature and Diuinity; which not only abhorre the effusion of blood, but withal depose their former infusion of <hi>Barbarisme</hi> and cruelty; as in experience wee haue seene it come to passe, first by the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> and afterwards by succeeding Nations. The people of <hi>Asia,</hi> were euer accounted good Orators and pen-men, but the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> rude and rough fellowes, vtterly vnlearned: and yet by war and Conquest, at home and abroad, acquired worthy purchases, and had their fortunes eternized to the world; not by themselues, but by strangers: Whereas the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions, wars and Conquests of the <hi>Celts,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> are either buried in obliuion, or at least Ballated in one sheet of paper, and that (for the most part) by their enemies.

            <p>Wherefore to make a iudicious coniecture of the goodnesse of Histories, wee ought to remember the wise counsell of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> not onely in our choose, but also in our reading, <hi>That an Author ought not to be accepted with an ouer-weening credulity, nor reiected with peremptorie incredulity.</hi> For if we credit al, in all writers, we cannot choose but oftentimes swallow things false, for true, and so commit grosse errors in dispatches of importance: So againe, if we should presentli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rsonages, or passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or mony, will preuaricate his integrity. But what should discourage succeeding Ages, that they should feare to write freely of their Equals? Surely in these times, it is not probable that amongst such variety of Authors, no one should be found, whose workes were not void of affection, of corruption, of enuy, of passion. Let the iudicious Reader therefore, between these extreames (of lightnesse and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
<pb facs="tcp:17128:4"/>
rashnesse) take the middle course, so shal he cul out of euerie good <hi>Author</hi> singuler purity. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him censure the worke, before he fully vnderstand the depth and sufficiencie of the Author. But indeede this should be the care of the state, to looke into the argument and method of Books before they come to the Presse, least by the vulgar censuring of some deficient labours, others of more suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency be dishartned from publishing their writings. For in this choise of Authors, which euery student ought to propose vnto himselfe, I would not haue euery one to be his own iudge (for censure is a gifte of art and experience) but to moderate his opinion by coherence, comparisons, &amp; infallible reasons, which if they be not allowed by the maior partie, let him neuer be ashamed to change his determination. For as those which will spend their verdicts vpon Pictures, their dimensions, lineaments &amp; colours (wherin the skilfullest eie is often cozened and deceiued) ought not to bee ignoraunt of Symmetry, to giue true iudgement: So is it necessarie for him that will distinguish betweene the sufficiency and insufficiencie of Historie, not onelie to bee well read in the Arts, but also much conuersant in humaine occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
            <p>Of Writers in this kind there are three sorts, the first whereof being wel qualified by nature, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by learning, haue bin called vnto Magistracie. The second sort haue wanted learning, and yet proued verie sufficient by the adiuncts of Nature and experience: and the letter being somewhat hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by Nature, and wanting experimentall imploiment, haue notwithstanding by their industrie and integritie in their collection of Historie, euen equalled those who haue spent the greatest portions of their daies in the Counsell-house of Princes. Of euery one of these you shall find infinite variety, &amp; so much the greater, by how much euerie one sauoureth of more or lesse integrity, learning and experience. The best are those which are best seene in all these, and free from passion. I adde passion, because it is harde for an vpright conscience discoursing of an euill subiect, to abstaine from hard language; or on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, to attribute vnto good actions a moderate commendation. For the inserting medestly in praise of the good, and dispraise of the wicked, hath giuen no smal ocasion for the amplifying of Historie. Whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f good Authors ought to be noted, what shall we say of Euill?</p>
            <p>No slight consideration must therefore be taken, whether our Historiographer hath written of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or of others; of Fellow-Citizens or Strangers; of Friends or Enemies; of Militarie discipline or Ciuill Gouernement; of his Equals or Inferiours; and lastly, of his owne time, or of sore-passed ages.

            <p>Whereuppon wee are to gather, that of all sorts of Historiographers those are worst to bee liked of, which with impure handes (as the Prouerbe is) presume to write of History, being both vnexperienced in affaires of importance, and veterly vnlearned. Of these is my chiefest Caue at in choise of Historie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17128:4"/>The next to beware of, is a rayling or a passionate Writer (for you shall not find all Authors free from this humor) and him suspect of flattery, by praising himselfe, his fauourites and Country men, and bitterly taunting his opposites, or enemies. But when you meet with an Authour, who giueth his enemy his due commendation, read him with trust and beleefe; and the rather, if he bee a stranger to both parties: esteeme him as litigious persons do of Vmpiers in Abitrementes, voyd of partiality. For it is aparant that <hi>Dionisius Hallicarnasseus</hi> (a man of no eminent place in Gouernment) wrote the History of the <hi>Romans</hi> with better faith and more vprightnesse, then <hi>Fabius, Salust,</hi> or <hi>Cato,</hi> men aduanced to wealth and honour in their Common-weales. For <hi>Polibius</hi> a <hi>Graecian</hi> in many places doth tax <hi>Fabius</hi> &amp; <hi>Philenus</hi> of falshood, the one a <hi>Roman</hi> the other a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> and both writing vpon the <hi>Punicke</hi> warres; the one giuing all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the other to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> These are the words of <hi>Polibius. Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> avoucheth that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> behaued themselues valiantly, and the <hi>Romans</hi> baselie and cowardly. But <hi>Fabius</hi> by the censure of <hi>Polibius</hi> was a man of approued honesty, &amp; wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to whom the proiects of the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor the counterplots of the enemy were hidden, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuealed Yet both Orator like were very wary to say or do any thing to their own irreputations. But let not any thinke, that in an History he can discharge both the part of an Orator &amp; Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. For I cannot allow of those writings which in praises and flattery are copious, in reprehension of vices, briefe and penurious; this maxime being most iustifiable, that euen the man of best dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and vprightnesse, committeth manifold errors. Wherein <hi>Equinard</hi> and <hi>Acciolus</hi> haue so magnified <hi>Carolus Magnus, Eusebius</hi> Constancie, <hi>Nebrensis</hi> Ferdinand, <hi>Iouius</hi> Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Medices, <hi>Phillostratus</hi> Apollonius, <hi>Procopius</hi> Bellisarius, <hi>Staphilus,</hi> and <hi>Leua,</hi> Charles the fift, that heerein they haue rather merited the sirnames of <hi>Orators,</hi> then of <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers.</hi> And therefore let the iudicious Censurer suspend his iudgement not by the scale of Friends and Countreymen, but by the verdict of enemies also. Against <hi>Phillip Comines,</hi> in praising of <hi>Lewes</hi> the <hi>XI.</hi> let him oppose <hi>Meir;</hi> and not <hi>Meir</hi> onely, but <hi>Paulus Aemilius;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the one is excessiue in commending, the other as farre gone in discommending; the third in a meane. <hi>Meir</hi> tearmeth him <hi>periurious and fratricide, whose desire was aboue al things, without regard of the Lawes of God or man, to become sole Tyrant of the state.</hi> The same Author calleth <hi>Comines</hi> himselfe, <hi>Traitor</hi> and <hi>Fugitiue.</hi> And therefore in these altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I wish neither of them to be belieued, because the one was highly aduanced and inriched, by the King, the other a professed enemy, and had his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to bee possessed with expectancy of grace, feare, or enuy. So <hi>Tacitus</hi> did avowe the actions of <hi>Tiberius, Claudius, Caius,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> reported in their life times to be full of flattery through feare, and after they were dead, as full of despight, and both false. And therefore it was his first prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he would write them without Enuie or Flattery, as in a time of more securitie. For hee wrote an hundred yeares after their deaths, and peraduenture had read the saying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <hi>New Histories were as fabulous and distatiue as those of deepest Antiquity.</hi>
            </p>

And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Catalogue of all the best Orators, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not one liuing, least they which by chance or negligence were forgotten or omitted (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe speaketh) should conceiue displeasure.

For as <hi>Metas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes</hi> affirmeth, <hi>All men that writ of Princes are not to be beleeued, but especially the Priests, to whose fidelity and custody the publicke Annals were incredited.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Berosus,</hi> who collected the raignes of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> out of the Annals of his predecessors. This <hi>Metasthenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if a History haue such and so many witnesses as cannot be contested, it hath the greater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parancie of truth, yea in seeming incredulities, especiallie if it suffer examination and triall. For vvho would beleeue that the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate at the motion of a Clowne, who dreamed that <hi>Iupiter</hi> called vnto him in his sleepe, and willed him to admonish the Senate that they should renew the plaies, because he that lead the dance in the former shawes had daunced falsie. The Senate assented. One man perchance in relating this triuiall accident would not be beleeued, but heerein <hi>Plutarch, Lyuy, Dionisius, Valerius</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> do all agree; who in so vniforme a consent of the Senate and people could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a falshood.</p>
            <p>But methinkes I heare one say, the latter was deceiued by the error of the former; and so each after other. Surely and so it may be, not onely in the Historie of humanitie, but also of Nature: For the olde world reported, that Swan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> approching their ends, would sweetlie sing their Funerall farewels; a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition not onely receiued from the times of <hi>Eschilus</hi> by Poets and Painters, but likewise by the chiefest of the Phylosophers, <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Chrisippus, Philostratus, Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca.</hi> And yet <hi>Pliny,</hi> and after him <hi>Athenaeus</hi> report vppon proofe, that it is but a Fable, and so to this day it yet remaineth.</p>
            <p>But as for naturall Historie the validitie thereof, whereof we meane not to discourse, it soone experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, which in humaine (for their infinite confusions) can neuer be examined. As for example; Many good Writers, and not one, or two, but almost twentie wrote that the Duke of <hi>Orliance</hi> was beheaded for Treason, and that at <hi>Paris</hi>: and yet it was apparant, that XXX. yeares after his imprisonment in <hi>England,</hi> he returned into <hi>France,</hi> and there peaceably died. For which rashnesse my Countrey-man <hi>G. Bellay</hi> doth sharpely reprehend those Historiographers, who will audaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uslie commit to publique beliefe the flying reports of fame and the vulgar. Of this fault <hi>Strabo</hi> taxed <hi>Possidonius, Erastos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes</hi> &amp; <hi>Metrodorus. They deliuered for true history</hi> (saith he) <hi>the reports of the most inconstant people.</hi> But <hi>Possidonius</hi> vsed the Authoritie of <hi>C. Pompey,</hi> so that I thinke hee could write nothing vnaduisedly.</p>
            <p>Therefore when Authors disagree amongst themselues, I take it the safest course to beleeue the latest,
<pb facs="tcp:17128:5"/>
at leastwise if their reasons co-here necessarily, and their Arguments are strong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o proue what they say. For such is the Nature and obscurity of truth, that vnlesse it be raked from auncient and fundamentall Originals, it will hardly appeare like it selfe, but best then, when the reports, the flatteries and passions of the vulgar are buried with their bodies.</p>
            <p>As to Religion, because the Controuersies betweene the professions and professors thereof, are so ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciable, I woulde not aduise a man to seeke out the Opinions of the Heathen among the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers, nor of the <hi>Iewes</hi> amongst the <hi>Christians,</hi> nor that of the <hi>Christians</hi> amongst the <hi>Moores</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> but to read the Authors of euerie sect and Religion by themselues, to weigh the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the writer, and the validitie of the thing written, and how they agree or disagree amongest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. So much (concerning this Argument) as hath beene set foorth by diuers Authors, I will rather blanch with the imputation of mistaking and ignorance in Antiquities, then with the foul Title of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth; euen as the old <hi>Graecians</hi> dealt with the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Celts,</hi> and the <hi>Romaines</hi> with the <hi>Caldeans</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h one being ignorant in the Antiquities of either Nation.</p>
            <p>In reading the disgraces of an enemy, let our assertion bee suspended vntill we haue examined the worth of the writer; for an aduersaries report is not rashly to bee reiected, nor at first sight imbraced; but heerein let vs imitate <hi>Caligula,</hi> who commanded the History of <hi>Caesar</hi> written by <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Labienus,</hi> and condemned by the Senate, to be published; saying, <hi>That it was profitable for the state, to haue the Actions of euery man, vnderstood by all men.</hi> Yet for my part, if the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the one or the other concerning <hi>Caesar,</hi> were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow extant, I would not altogether admit them to beliefe; no nor build confidence on <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe, when he writeth, that the <hi>Pompeyans</hi> made no conscience of Diuine and humaine thinges, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t no Sacriligious violence vnattempted, whereas he himselfe without any feare of Religion or deity, sacked all the Temples of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and broake vp the Treasurie of the Holy Sanctuary, which <hi>Pompey</hi> and his faction feared and refused to violate. But the reason that moued <hi>Caesar</hi> to disperse these scandals on <hi>Pompey,</hi> was to make his enemy odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that so he might pretend a iust cause of war, when to a good man no excuse can seem reasonable to wage warre against his Countrey.</p>
            <p>As concerning his Commentaries, most men receiue them with approoued allowance, and no maruel, when a Generall was forbidden by the Law <hi>Porcia</hi> to giue in to the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Treasury, a false report what number of enemies he had slaine. Wherein if he failed, he was to be depriued of his General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and denied his triumphall Ceremony; which rather then <hi>Caesar</hi> would giue ouer, hee would not sticke to account that lawfull which made best for his purpose, how vnlawfull soeuer. Which law, though he had not kept inviolably, yet the feare of infamy so awed his ambition, that hauing many enemies, hee knew they would not haue failed to indict him of falshood, especially being resolued to publish his books in his own life time. An instance whereof is to be seene in <hi>Cicero</hi> his <hi>Anti-Cato,</hi> though he wrote saith <hi>Tacitus</hi>) as persons accused are accustomed to behaue themselues before Iudges.</p>

With this disease (if it may be tearmed a disease, with an honest fallacy to maintaine the reputation of our Countrymen) almost all Historiographers are troubled. And therefore had I rather read <hi>Caesar</hi> discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the manners of the <hi>Galles, Tacitus</hi> of the <hi>Germans, Polibius</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi> of the <hi>Frankes,</hi> for that they were strangers, vnaduanced, vncorrupted, &amp; were wel acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Originals of those things, whereof they presumed to write.</p>
            <p>The next doubt that troubleth my mind, is whether an Historiographer, ought to praise, dispraise, shew his opinion; Or leaue all to the iudgement of his Reader. For either partie I will lay downe the best alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ons I can, and so leaue it to discretion.</p>
            <p>Historie ought to be nothing but a representation of truth, and as it were a Map of mens actions, sette forth in the publicke view of all commers to bee examined; And therefore the predesca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting opinion of the writer cannot but bring much discredite to the Action, in that hee presumeth to prepossesse the minds of Artists with imaginarie assertions, seeming to teach those, who knew better then himse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>No lesse guiltie of another sault are many Historiographers, who in the midst of their discourses, fall off from their entended Narrations, to play the Orators or Rethoritians, so deluding the expectations, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the memories of their readers.

Neither did his fauour towards the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> so drowne the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his owne Countreymen, but that he gaue them their due praises. And although he were by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cast into banishment, when he wrote his History, yet he not onely cleared his onely aduersarie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile worker <hi>Pericles</hi> from publicke obloquy, but being dead thought him so praise-worthy for his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, gouernment, that he doubted not to prophesie, but that with his death the state would fall into a present declination: yet <hi>Diodorus</hi> sticketh not secretly to carpe at the method of his Orations, as doth <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> (witnes <hi>Iustine</hi>) against <hi>Lyuy</hi> &amp; <hi>Salust</hi>: saying, <hi>That they exceeded the bounds of History, by inserting their direct and indirect Orations.</hi> For (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) <hi>nothing can be more pleasing in History then simple and significant breuity.</hi>

            <p>In our daies <hi>Iouius</hi> imitated <hi>Polibius</hi> as concerning the Generall Historie of his time, saue heerein is the difference, that <hi>Polibius</hi> was either an Actor or Commander, or had the pervsall of the publicke records: <hi>Iouius</hi> reported many things vpon heare-say, and at aduenture. <hi>Polibius</hi> was trained in the military discipline and offices of state, <hi>Iouius</hi> in neither. <hi>Polibius</hi> was a Noble man in his Countrey, <hi>Iouius</hi> a <hi>Plebeian: Polibius</hi> a Generall, <hi>Iouius</hi> a Physition.

For as <hi>Bessarius</hi> the Cardinall when hee saw verie many whose liues were questionable, canonized at <hi>Rome</hi> through blind deuotion, saide; hee doubted whether all were true which was related of the ancient Saints: so fabulous Historiographers are often an occasion, that those of desart are called into suspition.</p>
            <p>If he would haue imitated <hi>Polibius,</hi> he should haue bin mindfull of his owne position set down in the Preface of his Histories: That <hi>he that swarueth from the truth of his proiect, pulleth out the eye of a most beautifull creature.</hi> How well he obserued this admonition, we wil not make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, by him, who tearmed him an <hi>Author of Tales,</hi> neither by <hi>Sleydan,</hi> nor <hi>Brutus Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (who often blame him for vntruths) because the one was of a contrarie religion, the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture excepted vnto for imputation of <hi>Tirrany,</hi> but by <hi>Guicciardine</hi> the Parent of History and an Author without all exception.

Which rash protestation (in my fancie) he broched by the president of <hi>Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who thought himselfe by so much superiour to any Historiographer whatsoeuer, that writ the life of <hi>Alexander,</hi> by how much <hi>Alexander</hi> excelled all other Emperours.<note place="margin">Arrianus</note> Surely this <hi>Arrianus</hi> was a man learned &amp; wise, as apeareth by his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon <hi>Epictetus;</hi> and moreouer ioyned experience to his reading, insomuch that <hi>Adrian Augustus</hi> for his singuler sufficiency, preferred him to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship, hauing run through all other inferiour offices, yea euen in the integritie of the state.

            <p>The first man I meet withall is <hi>Dionisius Halicarnasseus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dionisius</note> who besides his modest method of speech and his Attique dialect; wrote the Antiquities of the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Original of their Cities foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with such integrity, as no <hi>Graecian</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> hath at any time done the like. For whereas the <hi>Latines</hi> neglected things triuiall, as Sacrifices, Playes, Triumphs, Ensignes of Magistracies, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall gouernment of the state, Subsidies, Auguries, Parliaments, and the difficile diuision of the people into wards and Tribes; Lastly, the potencie of the Senat, the priuiledges of the Commons, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Magistrates, and the power of the people, be in my iudgement hath best performed them of anie man liuing. And to make them the more easie to bee vnderstood, hee hath compared the customes of the <hi>Greeks</hi> with the Lawes of the <hi>Latines,</hi> deriuing the priuiledges of Clyents which <hi>Romulus</hi> institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (and which <hi>Caesar</hi> noteth to be common amongst the <hi>Gals</hi>) from the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Thessali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> The <hi>Roman Dictator</hi> to be of equall power to the <hi>Haumoste</hi> of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> to the <hi>Archon</hi> of the <hi>Thessalians</hi> and the <hi>Aesynmet</hi> of the <hi>Mytilens:</hi> yea, had it not hin for this mans labours, the Lawes of <hi>Romulus, Numa</hi> and <hi>Seruius,</hi> together with the Original discent of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> had bin long since buried in forgetfulnesse, through the pride of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who accounted &amp; omitted these remembrances as base &amp; vulgar (A fault almost common with al Authors) as if they were as well knowne to strangers, as to Natiues.</p>
            <p>The like diligence almost vsed <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities;<note place="margin">Plutarch</note> what censure is to be giuen of him, I thinke euerie man knoweth. For seeing he was the Schoole-maister of that excellent Prince <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian,</hi> an ancient Courtier, and at last Gouernour of <hi>Istria,</hi> there is no question to be made, but he ioyned practise and experience to his great wisedome. Hee wrote the Historie of the two most famous people of the world, not methodically and in order, but abruptly, and by way of Comparison. All that I admire in him is his so free opinion in al matters, that to me he seemeth rather a censurer of Princes, then an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographer; yet with this submission to his worth, that if any man may be thought a fit Vmpire in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of such weight, I hold him to be <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or no man. For vvhat could be vnknovvne to a man of so high a reach, so deepe a iudgement? Which are verie remarqueable in his most graue disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Republicke, and his profound Philosophie. The Originall occasions of wars, their openings, their progressions, ouerthrowes, and victories, he handleth like an excellent Commander. And sometimes he discendeth to matters of meanest moment, euen of houshold affaires; as is that remembraunce of <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor, who of purpose set enmitie betweene his seruants, <hi>Least by their ouermuch licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they should busie their braines about proiects of farre worse consequence.</hi> The like he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who accustomed to <hi>sell to the vtmost aduantage the reuenues of his domaines, and to buy by the penny his daily prouision.</hi> Oftentimes hee relateth thinges incredible and meerely fabulous, but he vseth the worde <hi>Phasi,</hi> to forewarne rash beleefe. As in the life of <hi>Licurgus,</hi> he writeth, <hi>That a</hi> Lacedemonian <hi>Lad suffered the Rack euen to death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he would reueale the theft of a Fox:</hi> And that <hi>Agesilaus was amerced by the</hi> Ephori <hi>for populer dependancy.</hi>

we our selues should now be resolute to purchase our own pardons. For sithence the Soueraignty hath diuolued, vnder the power and oppression of some few great men; Kinges and Tetrachs haue bin gladde to protest themselues their vassals: people and Nations haue paide them contribution; but as for the residue of vs the Nobility, how valorous, how good, howe Noble or ignoble soeuer, we are accounted of but as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: depriued of Honor, and subiected to those, vnto whom, if right might take place, wee ought to be Lords, and to giue the Law.

from the Senate. Nothing inferior to this mans vanity, was his rash and peremptory carriage: he coulde neither silence what he heard of other, nor bury in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion his priuat offences: taking no regard of his speech, or action.</p>
                     <p>He had long bin acquainted with <hi>Fuluia,</hi> an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady, to whome after hee perceiued that hee was but coldly welcome, (for that his present pouerty coulde not answere her his former liberality) hee resolued with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to set al vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> boasts; somtime to promise mountains, sometime to menace her, and rather then faile, somtime to vse her more rudely, then hee had beene accustomed.

                     <p>This sudden report first wrought the minds of most men to inuest <hi>M.T.

But vppon the approach of the storme, enuy, and Pride, lay buried in silence.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon the day of election being come, <hi>M. Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and <hi>C.

But the rashnes of <hi>Cateline</hi> was neuer the more asswaged: euery day he went more forward then other; he prepared armor, and distributed it in places of greatest importance throughout <hi>Italy:</hi> he tooke vp as much mony as the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of his friends, or his owne assurance could procure, causing it to bee conueyed to one <hi>Manlius</hi> at <hi>Fesule,</hi> who afterward acted a principal part in the rebellion.</p>
                     <p>It was reported, that at that time he laboured men of al fashions, yea and some women, who after their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities

were of no worth, by reason that age had put a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to their fees, but not to their riot, were become deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indebted.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. At that time, in my iudgement, the condition of the <hi>Roman</hi> people appeared most miserable: Vnto whome, notwithstanding that all places from East to West were subiected by Armes, and that at home they wallowed in ease and riches (the onely two contents which all flesh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth:) yet fostered they within their owne bowels a viperous consort of fellow-Cittizens, who rather then they woulde surcease the obstinacie of their priuate Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, cared not what became of themselues and their countrey. For, after the two proclamations, divulged by authority from the Senate, it was not knowne that anie one man of such a multitude, neither for lucre of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed reward, reuealed any part of the conspiracy, neither
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17128:30"/>
vpon assurance of pardon, sought to flie from the partie. So desperat a contagio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reuolt, like to a Pestilential Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had possessed the minds of the greater part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and worse then that, the zeale of those, who were guilty of the proiect, was not onely estranged, but the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersal body of the Commons in affectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nouelties, did as farforth as they durst, allow of the busines. But this could be tearmed no new accident; for in all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, you shall euer finde some (who haue little to lose) to mallice their betters, to speake well of the wicked, to mislike the present, to affect nouelties, and in contempt of their owne Fortunes, to desire change. In tumults and vprores they take least care for their liuings; how euer the world goes, they can be no loosers.</p>
                     <p>But the Comminalties of Citties were led vpon other respects and diuersity of occasions: First, all those who were infamous for life and behauiour; secondly, such as had wasted their stockes; And lastly, those that durst not shew their heads for some notorious offences, (these I say) flocked into <hi>Rome,</hi> as into a common receptacle.</p>
                     <p>In the next ranke followed such as had not yet forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Sillas</hi> victory; some of their companions they beheld raised from the degree of common souldiers, to the honor of Senators: Others, so aduanced in wealth, that thereby they were now inabled to maintaine a bountifull Table, and to weare rich apparrell. If the matter were once again triable by Armes, euery one hoped to share in like For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. As for those strong and youthfull bodies, whose ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds could scarcely find them a liuing by the day labour of the plough, (and in that respect had their fingers itching to be dealing in priuate and publicke rewards) were soon inticed to preferre the idle games of the citty, before the thriftlesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that (as before) it is no new matter, to see the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, basest, and worst-bred sort of people, to expect spoile and their owne inrichment, by the generall confusion of the state.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, whosoeuer was of any other faction, saue that of the Senate, did rather in his hart wish more welfare to the league, then good to the state. Thus forepassed corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after many yeares, began again to returne into the Citty.</p>

                        <p>Honourable Lords, as I take it, this should be your case, let not the offences of <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> and his associates, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with your passions, then becommeth the greatnesse of your callings: neither, let wrath be saide to esclipse your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reports. For, if a sufficient punnishment can be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to equalize their defaults, I cannot but approue this newe Counsell: But if the quality of the offence exceed all immagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then my opinion is, that they be punished according to the prescript forme of our ancient Lawes.</p>
                        <p>Many, who before mee haue spoken their minds, haue laide out in very eloquent and rhethoricall tearms, the miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the commonwealth, the cruelty of Warre, the fortune of the conquered: agrauating their discourses wth the rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Virgins, the tearing of children from the bosomes of their parents, the abusing of Matrons, the robbing of Temples, the Pillaging of houses; withall, not forgetting to moue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and passion, by recitall of woundes, fieringes, armes, slaughtred carcasses, &amp; bloudy Funerals: Good God! to what end tended these their Orations, but to enflame your displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures against the offenders? As if any speech, could exasperate that dull spirit, whom the least remembrance of so heynous a Treason (of it self) could not irritate. A Suppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impossible. Priuate iniuries take deepest impression, yea with som men deeper then reason should Warrant.</p>
                        <p>But Honourable Lords, in diuers men, diuers sorts of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are tollerable. To those that liue in inferiour callinges, if

thorough passion they commit an ouersight, few obserue it: their eminences outshine not their fortunes: But the errours of great personages and men of quality, the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth doth forthwith take into examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this I speak, to prooue that highest Fortunes haue meanest priuiledges to offend, neither ought they to be induced by fauour, nor moued by hatred,<note place="margin">

That which the Vulgar terme Anger in meane men, with greater Persons is censured to be pride and cruelty.</p>
                        <p>Verily, (Honorable Fathers,) I am of this opinion, that no punishment, can bee aunswerable to the quality of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but the Natures of most men are giuen to remember the last ends of their familiars, and forgetting the fact, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the punishment, if it neuer so little exeeede mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p>I cannot but acknowledge, that whatsoeuer the good and resolute <hi>D. Sillanus</hi> hath spoken, hath proceeded from zeale to his Country: and in this weighty businesse, I confesse, his integrity and modesty to be such, that thereunto, his Nature hath neither bin induced by flattery, neither ouerwrought by partiality. Neither can I iustly say, that his censure any way sauoureth of cruelty: for what can be tearmed cruell, that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice can inflict vpon such offenders. But surely, the president is not vsuall in our Common-wealth; and therefore, either feare, or priuat iniury hath ouerwrought thee, (ô <hi>Decius Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> Consull elect) to giue thy consent to this new forme of punishment.</p>
                        <p>Offeare, it were idle to discourse, sithence such strong as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance is in armes, by the especial prouidence of this our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Consull. As touching the punshment, I can speake trueth as the case now standeth: <hi>That to men in distresse and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, death is the end of sorrow, life a torment</hi>: Death dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth al mortal misfortunes: <hi>Beyond, there is no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of griefe, nor place for ioy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the immortall Gods, I wonder, that in giuing your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, you did not giue direction, that first, they should bee whipped with rods! was it for that the Law <hi>Portia</hi> did forbid it? Or that you had regarde to some other, late Law? Why?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17128:38"/>
The Lawes do impose banishment, not death; but vppon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Cittizen? Or was it, because you esteemed whipping to be a more greeuous punnishment, then beheading? If so, then what can be bitter or ouer-greeuous against men convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of so heinous a Conspiracy? But if you ouer-slipped the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for stripes, as of a punishment too too gentle, how co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to passe then, that in the losse, you make a conscience of equity, when in the greater, you proceede without doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But why should any man be offended at that which is by Law decreed against Traitors to their Country? Time, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fortune, so powerfull amongst mortall Creatures, wil ratifie that nothing hath happened vnto these men beyond their deserts.</p>
                        <p>Many euill conclusions haue arisen from good Principles: as where the Helme hath bin intrusted to indiscreet and insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Pilots, these newe Presidents, haue beene commonly transferred from worthy and well-minded Cittizens, to base and incapable Ministers. So, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hauing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne the <hi>Athenians,</hi> committed the administration of their Common-wealth, to thirty Gouernors: At first; they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached the most notorious offendors, men generally hated, and executed them without Processe. The people applauded and commended the course, but by little and litle Liberty swarned into Lust: The Innocent and Nocent were condemned at their pleasures: the vulgar were terrified, and so the Citty op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with seruitude, now miserably smarted for her foolish ouersights.</p>
                        <p>In our daies, when the victorious <hi>Silla,</hi> commaunded <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masippes,</hi> and his damned crew, who had no meanes to liue, but vpon the generall spoile, to be worthily slaine; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended not his iudgement? Euery man cryed, it was Nobly done to free the Common-wealth of such mercilesse, thriftles, and seditious Rascals: but what followed, this was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of a cruell massacre: For, as any of his followers affected the mansion, the Lordshippe, yea, at last the plate or apparrell of any of the Comminalty, his course was, to do his endeuour to inroll him in the number of the Proscripts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:17128:38"/>Honourable Lords, I speak not this, for that I suspect the like in <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> no nor in these times, but in this huge and populous Citty, it is not vnknowne to you, that many and variable humours lie lurking continually.</p>
                        <p>And so, at some other time, and some other being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull,</hi> with an Army at commaunde, a false report may happen to passe for truth; when, vpon this president, if the <hi>Consull</hi> by Commission from the Senate, should vnsheath his sworde, what end I pray you, should the state expect of this rash deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination? Who shall limit his power? Who shall moderate his armes?</p>
                        <p>Honourable Lords, our predecessors, were neuer to seeke of <hi>Counsell</hi> nor <hi>Courage,</hi> neither did Pride preuaricate their minds from following another mans aduice, so it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. To forge armes, and warlike furnitures they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the <hi>Samnits.</hi> The Ensignes of Magistracy, (for the most part) they borrowed from the <hi>Thuscanes</hi>: yea, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they sawe fitting amongst their allies, or Enemies, they tooke great care to bring the vse thereof into the Citty. They admired Vertue in al men, they enuied it in none: but in those times, in imitation of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> they punished a Cittizen with stripes, a condemned man, with death.</p>
                        <p>But in processe of time, as the common-wealth beganne to grow great by the multitude of inhabitants, iealousies incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, innocency was circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vented, &amp; such like enormities were daily committed. For remedy whereof, the Law <hi>Porcia,</hi> and diuers other wholesom statutes were enacted; by which banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was prouided in cases of condemnation.</p>
                        <p>These Authorities (Honourable Fathers) in my Opinion should be Motiues exceeding perswasiue, to alter or frustrate these your new determinations. Beleeue it, the valours and wisedome of those men, who from so slender foundations haue established so great, so glorious an Empire, could not bee, but much more eminent in them, then in vs, who can hardly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that, which they most prouidently bequeathed vs. Howe then Sir? Will you haue the Prisoners discharged, and the troopes of <hi>Cateline</hi> re-enforced? No surely. But my censure is, that their goods be forfeyted, and their bodies sequestred

                                 <p>Honorable Lords, reuoluing with my selfe, the Nature of this weighty businesse: the goodly Arguments (I must bee plaine) which other men haue thereuppon framed, are of no validity with mee to mooue approbation. For, in my iudgment, they haue but onely spent time in discoursing, what punnishment were fitting for men intending the ruine of their Countrey, the vndoing of their parents, the spoile of priuate houses, and the ouerthrowe of Religion.</p>
                                 <p>But Noble Lordes, this storme calleth vnto vs for a speedy preuention, not a lingering Consultation. Offences already committed may be punnished at leasure; but it will be too late to talke of Iustice, when remedy is past, and offendors growne puissant. If the Citty bee gained, what power (I beseech you) remaineth to the Conquered?</p>
                                 <p>For the loue of the immortall Gods, let mee intreat you all, to whom beautifull houses, goodly reuenewes, pictures, and costly hangings are more in admiration, then the Common-good; if you haue any desire longer to be Lordes of these vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (of what esteeme soeuer) if it be but to continue the meanes of these your delightes, now at the last pinch assume your courages, and let a true remorse of the generall Welfare wholy possesse your irresolute opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. It is no time now to take order for impositions, or to talke of the iniuries of our Associats;

Our liues and Liberties at this instant are questionable. Honourable Lordes, I haue often spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my minde freely in this thrice-Honorable assembly; I haue made sundry motions tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Ryots</hi> and <hi>Couetousnesse</hi> of this state, procuring to my selfe no small hatred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: but I, who could neuer flatter mine owne imperfections, could lesse indure the insolencie of Others. And though you gaue but small credit to my sayings, and nothelesse the Common wealth slorished; yet (beleeue it) Prosperity onely excused your remisnesse.</p>
                                 <p>I speake not this, as if time now serued to dilate, whether we are degenerated in manners or no: Neither how great, or how glorious the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is, or hath bin: But whether this greatnesse, this glory (be they more, be they lesse) are like to continue ours, or we enforced to part stakes with our enemies.

I confesse that <hi>C.

Therefore (Honourable Lords) whensoeuer it shall bee your pleasures to ratifie your Iudgement against <hi>Lentulus,</hi> &amp; his associats, beleeue it with constancy, that then you vndo <hi>Cateline,</hi> and disperse his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: the sooner ye doe it, the sooner you breake them: Delay is dangerous; it hopeth it resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.

This <hi>Massinissa</hi> had three Sonnes; <hi>Micip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, Manastaball</hi> and <hi>Gulussa. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastaball</hi> and <hi>Gulussa</hi> died; by whose death the Kingdome entirely descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Micipsa. Micipsa</hi> had issue, <hi>Adherbal</hi> and <hi>Hiempsal; Iugurth,</hi> he fostered as the Sonne of his Brother <hi>Manastabal,</hi> for that his Grand-father <hi>Massinissa</hi> had left him vnaduanced, as his base Grand-Childe begotten on the body of a Concubine. The man was ambitious, well qualified, of a ready wit, and great spirit, elder then <hi>Adherbal</hi> or <hi>Hiempsal.</hi> In iealousie whereof, <hi>Micipsa,</hi> fearing that if he should die during the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his children, that their Cousin <hi>Iugurth</hi> might happen am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biciously to vsurpe the Kingdome, resolued to oppose him to daungerous aduentures, in hope by these meanes to see him miscarry.</p>
                  <p>About the same time it happened, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Scipio,</hi> besieged <hi>Numantia</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto <hi>Micipsa</hi> sent certaine Regiments of Horse and foote, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commaund of his Kinsman <hi>Iugurth,</hi> their Generall; making full accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this iourney, to heare newes answerable to his plotted desseignements, but Fortune had otherwise decreed: for in this war, the reputation of <hi>Iugurth</hi> more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased; yea, he made so many faire proofes of his valour in this Action, that <hi>Scipio</hi> not only commended him in a publicke Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but (the warre ended, and <hi>Numantia</hi> razed) he inuested him with many military honors; by his Letters commending his seruice to <hi>Micipsa,</hi> in very worthy and honourable tearmes,
<pb facs="tcp:17128:46"/>
which bred so sodaine an alteration in the King, that whereas before, he fully minded his destruction, hee now wisheth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth nothing so much as his welfare and aduancement; adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him his Sonne, and shortly after dying, left him Co-heire with his Children, throughout his whole estates and dominions. After whose disease, the three Roytelets, <hi>Adherbal, Hiemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> and <hi>Iugurth,</hi> deuising with themselues about the portion of the Kingdome, <hi>Iugurth</hi> trayterously slayeth <hi>Hiempsal,</hi> the younger of the twaine, and casting in his haughty mind, how by the death of the other, he might become sole Lord of the whole, firmely resolueth to leuy an Army, wherwith he giueth the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to the elder Brother <hi>Adherbal.</hi> Who after this defeature, flyeth to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there aggrauating his Brothers death, his owne banishment, and <hi>Iugurths</hi> treasons, beseecheth aid of the Lordes of the Senate. The Lords accord, and send tenne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners into <hi>Affricke,</hi> to make diuision of the Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them: who had no sooner ended the businesse, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their backes, but <hi>Iugurth</hi> entertayned his former practises, and a new inuadeth his Brothers portion with warre and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To represse this his insolency, <hi>Adherbal</hi> of meere necessitie is driuen to leuy an Army, and to march against <hi>Iugurth,</hi> but is againe ouerthrowne, and with a few Horsemen in his company forced to fly vnto <hi>Cirtha,</hi> whether <hi>Iugurth</hi> aduaunceth his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and besiegeth the Citty. Hereof <hi>Adherbal</hi> by Letters cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth the Lordes of the Senate, giuing them to vnderstand, vppon what desperate tearmes his estate depended, how hee was depriued of his kingdome by <hi>Iugurth,</hi> and forced by warre and famine to vndergoe such vtmost extremities, that long time he was not able to make good the place of his refuge, euen the sanctuary of his life: That his aduersary little regarded the censures of the Senat: finally, that they would vouchsafe to send him potent and speedy succours. Vpon the opening of these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters many gaue their opinions, in fauour of the distressed estate of <hi>Adherbal,</hi> but others corrupted by the <hi>Numidian,</hi> aduised rather to send Commissioners vnto <hi>Iugurth,</hi> with authority to commaund him in the name of the Lordes and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to abstaine from farther violence. <hi>Iugurth</hi> gaue these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners during their imployment in <hi>Affricke,</hi> faire language and faithfull protestations, but after their departure fell a

fresh to his former proiects. Wherupon, the besieged, desire <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbal</hi> to pitty the estates of so many innocent people in the Towne, that seeing he could not otherwise prouide for his safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he would yeelde the place vpon assurance of his life one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Which being granted, and the towne surrendred, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Oth or kindred, <hi>Iugurth</hi> falsifieth his Faith, and cruelly murdereth his innocent Brother. The newes whereof much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted the Lordes of the Senate, and therefore they posted away <hi>Lucius Calphurnius Bestia</hi> (the Consull) with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Affricke,</hi> to giue stop to his further proceedinges: but he being corrupted by <hi>Iugurth,</hi> in stead of punishing the Traitor, concluded a most dishonorable peace. Wherewith the Lordes of the Senat being much more moued then before, dispatched away <hi>Albinius</hi> the Consull, with order and authority to represse the Traytors insolencies: but him <hi>Iugurth</hi> so long deluded with promises and counterfeit demonstrations of submission and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that the yeare beeing spent, without doing any thing, he was inforced to leaue all as he found it, and to hasten to Rome against the day of election, nominating his brother <hi>Aulus</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Army &amp; <hi>Prouince.</hi> This man, either on a foolish opinion to reap the glory of finishing this warre, or vppon aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice to fill his priuate Coffers, in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, leadeth the Army into the open field. <hi>Iugurth</hi> quickly fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the insufficiency of this new <hi>Generall,</hi> pretending feare and cowardize, trayneth his enemy into woody and mountanous Countries; yea, and to colour his subtilty, sendeth his humble pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall, with offers of submission and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. The faster he fled, the more eager was <hi>Aulus</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, vntill <hi>Iugurth</hi> taking the benefit of time, and the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the place, found easie meanes to rout the whole <hi>Romain</hi> Army. The day following, they fell to composition: First, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Prisoners should be dismissed <hi>Sub iugum</hi>: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the whole army within ten daies cleerly to depart the bounds of <hi>Numidia.</hi> This daunted the people, for the present, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering againe their spirits (notwithstanding the composition of <hi>Aulus,</hi> and his peoples ouerthrow) they dimitted <hi>Numidia</hi> to <hi>Metellus</hi> (the Consull) for his Prouince. This excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder finding the Army corrupted by the remisse carriage of
<pb facs="tcp:17128:47"/>
his Predecessors, first restored the Ancient discipline, &amp; then by hazarding a set-battell with <hi>Iugurth,</hi> put him to the worse. After him, <hi>Marius</hi> (Consull elect) succeeded in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who persecuting the war with courage and good Fortune, vtterly vndid the <hi>Numidian,</hi> and getting him into his possession by policy, led him through <hi>Rome</hi> as a Captiue, before his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphall Chariot.</p>

                                 <p>Thus honourable Lords, if I had neither lost some part of my people, neither had cause to complaine of the reuolt of others: yet, if any misfortune should haue against expectation befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len me, I would haue implored the protection of your fauours, vnto whom, for the maiestie of your Empire, euery Subiests

Vnto our Neighbour Common-Weales, or Kings? My Lords, they all hate vs in regard of your alliance. In those places, on no side can I turn my visage, but I shall behold many hostile remembrances of our Auncestors seruice. Can they then take compassion of him, who was once their capitoll enemy? No my Lordes: <hi>Micipsa</hi> taught vs to crouch to no men, but to the <hi>Roman</hi> people: yea, to defie strange leagues and alliances.

                     <p>And therfore he himselfe marched in the voward with the readiest Cohort, accompanied with a choice band of Slinges and Archers: <hi>C. Marius</hi> his Lieutenant ledde the Rereward with the horsmen. Vpon both sides he equally deuided the Auxiliary horse, vnder the conduct of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Legions, and the captains of the Cohorts; that beeing intermingled with the light harnessed foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they might be ready at all assaies to repulse the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Chiualry. For <hi>Iugurth</hi> was so subtle, and so wel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scituation of places, and the Art of sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, that it was hard to resolue, whether he were more to be doubted absent or present, intreating of peace, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing of warre.</p>

Here into the Consull made proofe either to put a garison, or vppon denial to force the place, if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity seemed to aduise him thereto. And therefore he commanded the inhabitants to prouide him corne, and other such necessaries, which the wantes of war required: supposing (as experience made proofe) that the credite of the Marchants, and the place fit for the stowage of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, woulde become very aduantagious to his future preparations. Amidst these deuises, <hi>Iugurth</hi> by submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue messengers, and with far more earnestnesse then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beseecheth peace, offring vnto <hi>Metellus</hi> an absolute surrendry of al, except his owne life, and his childrens.</p>

                        <hi>Iugurth</hi> obseruing that the tayle of the enemies Army had passed his formost ranks, maketh hast to take that part of the hill from whence <hi>Metellus</hi> had descended, with a troope of some two thousand footemen, fearing least the departed enemy would thither returne againe for refuge, and fortifie.

wounded a farre off, and found no meanes of reuenge by striking or aduancing to ioyne.

                     <p>The whole businesse seemed long doubtfull, variable, bloudy, and lamentable: some fled, others pursued, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ensignes were followed, nor order kept: euery man, as daunger attached him, there receiued the charge and made his best resistance.

                     <p>By this time a great part of the day was spent, and yet the victory vncertaine: All sortes languished with labour and heat. But <hi>Metellus</hi> perceiuing that the <hi>Numidians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan somewhat to faint, by some and some he gathered his scattered Troopes into one Battallion: hee relyeth the rankes, and faceth the aduerse footmen with foure Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary cohorts.

                     <p>One party was more violent to wound another, then carefull to defend their owne bodies. The cry was mixt with contrary encouragements, with contrary, ioyes and contrary sorrowes. The noise of Weapons ascended the Aire, and no spare of shot was made on either side.

as men are constrained to doe in auoiding, or weilding their missile weapons.</p>
                     <p>Which being made knowne to <hi>Marius,</hi> (for vpon that quarter lay his charge) he began of purpose to slaken the assault, and to dissemble a distrust of preuailing, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Numidians</hi> at pleasure to behold the Kinges en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</p>

                     <p>When these, nor many like speeches, could direct the mind of <hi>Marius, Metellus</hi> answered: that as soone as the common cause would admit permission, he would yeilde to his request.</p>

This done, he assaulted such Castles and Townes, as both for theyr scituation and strength of men, were least able to make defence: In other places likewise he had many battailes &amp; light skirmishes: In the meane while his newe souldiers began to grow hardy, and to enter into fight without any feare of perill, as wel perceiuing, that all such as fled, were either slain or taken captiues: that euery mans assurance of safety rested in his strength and sufficience: that vpon Armes and prowesse their welfare depended: That theyr Liberty, their Country, their Kinred, and whatsouer they had, consisted heerein: and finally, that this was the way to acquire glory and riches.

                     </argument>
                     <p>BVt <hi>Marius</hi> like a prudent and industrious Captaine, had an eie both on his owne Army and his enemies: he wel perceiud what most aduantaged or disadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged th'one or other side: he set spies to obserue what waies the kings tooke, &amp; ouerreached all their counsels &amp; strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems: he suffered nothing to bee slacke or vnprouided on his part, or any thing to remaine safe and secure to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. By reason whereof, many times on his way hee charged and defeated <hi>Iugurth,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Getulians</hi> as he found them forraging and spoiling our confederates, and not far from the Town of <hi>Cirtha</hi> forced the King himself to leaue his armes behind him.</p>
                     <p>But at length perceiuing, that these exploits were only glorious, and no way furthered him to force <hi>Iugurth</hi> to battaile whereby at one blow he might impose an ende vnto these lingering warres, he determined to besiege all such Townes, as either for strength of men or natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, were of greatest importance and succor to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and contrarily most preiudiciall to the <hi>Romans:</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that <hi>Iugurth,</hi> if he endured this, should bee debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his strongest forts &amp; places of refuge, or at least, be heerby prouoked to a pitcht battel. For <hi>Bocchus</hi> by sundry Messengers had before signified vnto <hi>Marius,</hi> that for his part he was desirous of amitie and friendship with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and that he should not feare him as an enemy.</p>
                     <p>But whether he dissembled heerin, to the end, that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising the <hi>Romans</hi> vnawars, he might giue them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blowe, or whether through the inconstancy and insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his mind, it was vsuall with him to change war for peace, it is vncertaine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:17128:91"/>But the Consull proceeding in his former resolution, began to assault townes and fortified castels; some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he tooke by force, some through fear, &amp; others by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of reward &amp; bounty: at first he dealt with the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler sort, supposing that <hi>Iugurth</hi> would for their defence be drawn to a battaile: but receiuing intelligence, that he was gone far off, and imployed in other affaires, he thought it high time to attempt matters of greater consequence, and more difficulty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There was a Towne large and strong, scituate in the vast and wilde desertes, named <hi>Capsa:</hi> of which <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Lybius</hi> was said to be the first founder. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants hereof, vnder the gouernment of <hi>Iugurth,</hi> were gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peaceably ruled, free from tribute, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard remained most firme and true vnto him.</p>
                     <p>They were furnished against forraine inuasion, not onely with walles, Armes, and Men, but which was much more, by the difficulty of the place and scituation. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting those fieldes that lay neere vnto the Towne, all the Region about, was wilde, desert, and vnmannured; wanting Water, and anoyed with Serpentes, who (as all other wilde beastes) become enraged for want of meate. Moreouer, the mischieuous Nature of those Serpents, is by nothing more then by drought prouoked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marius</hi> was maruailously enflamed with a desire to take this Towne, as well for the seruice of the Warre, as for that it seemed a very hard and difficult enterprise, and partly for that <hi>Metellus</hi> had formerly with great applause taken the Towne of <hi>Thala,</hi> not much vnlike this place, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for scituation or defence: Onely the difference was, that not farre from the VValles of <hi>Thala</hi> were certaine Springes and Fountaines; whereas the <hi>Capsians</hi> had but one continuall water-spring, and that within their wals: those without vsing no other then rain-water, which both there, and in all other places of <hi>Affrique,</hi> remote from the Sea, that are wilde and desert, is the more easily endured, for that the <hi>Numidians</hi> for the most part feede on Mike, and the flesh of sauage beasts; desiring neyther Salt, nor other Sawce to whet there stomackes, as hauing prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17128:92"/>
sufficient to appease hunget and thirst, but not for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity or daintinesse.</p>
                     <p>The Consull therefore hauing enquired the truth of these matters; becam confident, I think on the help of the gods. For it was impossible he shuld either in wit or policy haue beene sufficiently prouided to encounter so many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, especially hauing there but small store of Corne (for as much as the <hi>Numidians</hi> imploy their grounds rather in pasture then tillage) &amp; that quantity which they had, was by the Commandement of their king conueied into their strong holds. Their fields were also dry and barren with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit, it being then the latter end of Summer: Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, <hi>Marius</hi> made sufficient prouision as his ocasions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Hee committed to his auxiliary troopes of horse the conuoy of such Cattle, as formerly he had taken from the enemy, and sent his Lieutenant <hi>Aulus Manlius</hi> with his lightest armed Cohorts to the Towne of <hi>Laris,</hi> where he had layed in his souldiers pay, and victuals: alledging that hee himselfe would go a forraging, and within fewe daies meet him there.</p>
                     <p>Thus concealing his purpose, he led his army toward the Riuer <hi>Tanais</hi>: and made daily in his iournies equall &amp; ratable distribution of his Cattle amongst his Army, as they were deuided by hundreds, and troopes of thirties, or other small companies. taking order that of the hides of those beasts, should bee made vessels for the cariage of Water: And moreouer (no man knowing his pretence) he prouided such store of Corne and other necessaries as shortly should be requisite for his entended enterprize. In a word, on the sixt day arriuing at the riuer, he had a great number of those vessels made of the hides of beasts: There pitching his Tents slightly fortified, he commaunded his souldiers to take their repast, and be ready to depart by the setting of the Sunne; willing them further to leaue all their baggage behinde, and charge their carriages onelie with water.</p>
                     <p>At length, when he saw his time, he departed from his Tents, and trauelling, all that night, rested on the morning with his Army: The like he did the second night, and the

third night, long before day, hee arriued at a place full of Hillocks, not aboue two miles distant from the Town of <hi>Capsa</hi>; where, as couertly as he could, he ambushed his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But the day approching, &amp; a great part of the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> not mistrusting any enemy, being issued out of the Towne, <hi>Marius</hi> suddenly caused all his Horse, and with those, his lightest foot-men to make hast, and seize vpon the gates of the Citty: Immdiately himselfe follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not farre from the Riuer of <hi>Mulucha,</hi> that deuides the kingdome of <hi>Iugurth</hi> and <hi>Bocchus,</hi> there is a rocke or stony mountayne in the midst of a plaine, whereon was scituated a rude ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, large enough, but of an incredible heigth, hauing one only narrow entrance into it: The discent of this rocke was naturally so steepe, as if purposely it had been so built by the hands of workmen; <hi>Marius</hi> with all his endeuours intended to force this Castle, for that the Kinges treasure lay there, which he effected, (but rather by chaunce than cunning) for in the Castle was sufficient prouision, both of men, munition and corne, as also a spring of water.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, the scituation thereof was such, as by no meanes was assaultable, eyther by Mounts, Towers, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, or other warlike Engines, the entry thereinto being very narrow, trauersed and cut on both sides: Our appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches also were made to no purpose, and with great perril, for as they came neere the wall, they were beaten downe and destroyed with fire and stones; So as the Souldiers could neither performe their workes for the steepnesse of the place, nor serue without perill in their approches: The valiantest were either slaine or wounded, and feare aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the rest.</p>

The souldier hauing searched &amp; spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out all things which he thought needfull, returned the same way hee came, not rashly as hee ascended, but with great regard and Caution. Forthwith he retired to <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> declaring what hee had done, and aduised him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Castle on that side, from whence he had disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, offering himselfe for a guid, and alledging that there was no hazard or perril in the enterprise. <hi>Marius</hi> forthwith commanded such as were then present to go with the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurian,</hi> to try the truth of this information: who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning made diuers reports thereof, euery man according to his fancy, some esteeming it to be an easie, some a difficult enterprise. But the Consull began to be of better cheare, and forthwith out of his number of Trumpiters and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets he selected fiue, the most nimble and light amongest them, and withall foure Centuries for their aide and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: All which he willed to be at the commaund of the <hi>Ligurian,</hi> vnto whom hee appointed the next day for the execution of this seruice, who at the time limited, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his commandement, hauing prepared and ordred all things necessary, repaired vnto the said place.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Centurions</hi> by the direction of their guid, changed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17128:94"/>
both their armes and apparrel, and went with their heads and feet bare, to the end that they might the better see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and climb with more steadinesse. Their swords as also their Targets (which according to the <hi>Numidian</hi> fashion were made of Leather, as well for their lightnes, as for that in their clashing together they made the least noise) were fastned at their backs. The <hi>Ligurian</hi> then clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing vp before the rest, tyed cords vnto such stones, and olde Mores or rootes, as hung out beyond the rest of the wall, that the souldiers taking holde thereon, might the more easily ascend: such as were fearefull thorough the strangenesse of the way, he holpe vp with his handes, and where the ascent was steepest, hee caused them to climbe vnarmed, himselfe following with their armor. Such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as to the eie seemed most dangerous, himselfe chieflie assaved; ascending, descending, and going forwards, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the rest to follow. At length, but late and sore wearied, they became Maisters of the Castle, which on that side was left vnregarded, for that those of the castle, were then, as at other times imployed in fight against their enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marius</hi> hauing by Messengers vnderstood what the <hi>Ligurian</hi> had done, albeit he had all that day entertained fight with the <hi>Numidians,</hi> yet then encouraging his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, issued out from his defenses, and with Engines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Walles, threatning them also aloofe with slings, Artillery, and other Ordinance. But the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> hauing formerly broken downe and burnt the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Romans,</hi> contained not themselues within the wals of the Castle, but day and night passed to an fro on the outside thereof, rayling at the <hi>Romans</hi> and reproching <hi>Marius</hi> with cowardice; menacing our souldiers to make them bond-slaues vnto <hi>Iugurth,</hi> and by meanes of theyr good fortune grew fierce and insolent.</p>
                     <p>But now as the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Numidians</hi> were in earnest conflict, each encountring other with great violence, thes fighting for glory and Empire, they for their liues &amp; safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the <hi>Ligurian</hi> on the sudden sounded an allarme at their backs, whereat, first ran away the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17128:94"/>
that were placed to behold the battell; next, such as were nearest vnto the walles, and lastly the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, aswell armed as disarmed, betook themselues to flight: The which so chancing, the <hi>Romans</hi> began to charge the more furiously; they slew and wounded diuers, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling on their dead bodies, enforced themselues to ascend the wall. Thus Fortune still fauoured the ouerweening rashnesse of <hi>Marius,</hi> &amp; in his owne error, he found glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 These passages thus depending, meane time <hi>Lucius Silla</hi> the <hi>Questor</hi> arriued in the Campe, with a great troop of Horse. He had beene left behinde in <hi>Rome,</hi> to raise an Army of Latines and Allies their confederates; But forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are now fallen into discourse of so renowned a man, it will not be amisse to treat somewhat of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conditions, for hence-forward we shall haue no occasion to speake of his actions: and <hi>Lucius Sisenna,</hi> who of all others that haue written of him, hath with greatest dilligence, and most faith pursued the History, seemeth to me, not to haue spoken liberally and freely enough of his worthinesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scilla</hi> then was nobly descended from the race of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician,</hi> but his Gentry was almost extinct and worne out by the sloth of his auncestors. He was alike and excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, both in Greeke and Latine; of a haughty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, addicted to his pleasures, but more to glory: his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant howers were spent in Luxury, yet pleasure neuer hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his affayres: Only he might haue better aduised him selfe in the choice of a more honest wife. He was eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, subtile, sociable, and in dissembling or disguising his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, the depth of his wit was incredible: He was liberal in guifts, chiefly of his money: and before the ciuill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest (albeit he was the most happie of all others) yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune neuer exceeded his industry, insomuch as many dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bted, whether he was more vertuous or fortunate: But for his latter actions, I am vncertaine whether it wil more shame or grieue me to repeat them.</p>
                     <p>Then as is before said, when he came with his troope of horse into <hi>Affricke,</hi> and the campe of <hi>Marius</hi> (being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Nouice and vnexperienced in the warres) in a short
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17128:95"/>
season with fewe bickerings, became the most cunning &amp; expert leader amongst the <hi>Romans.</hi> Moreouer, he would kindly entreate his souldiers, giue liberally to such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as also voluntary to others: he could hardly bee drawne to take any thing; but more ready to returne it with recompence, then to pay a iust debt. He neuer rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any thing lent, but rather endeuoured to haue as many as he could, remaine his debtors. His fashion was to discourse both pleasantly and seriously, with the basest and men of meanest ranke, and would very often bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them in their labours, their marches, and theyr watchings, neither in the meane while (as lewd ambition is accustomed) would he with slanders wound the honor and reputation, either of the <hi>Consull,</hi> or any other. In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or execution he suffred no man to go beyond him, but heerein himselfe excelled the most part: and by these meanes in a short space, hee became indeared both vnto <hi>Marius</hi> and the souldiers.</p>

                     <p>The souldiers at first, beeing thus taken vnprouided, stood amazed, but now calling to mind their wonted va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, did eyther betake them to their weapons, or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded others against the insulting enemy, whilst they ran to arme. The horsemen gat to horse, &amp; did what they could to stay the enemies course. The fight rather resembled an incursion, then a battell. The footmen without Ensignes or rankes were mixt amongst the Horse; Some ran away, some were slaine, some making obstinate resistance were circumvented behinde, by the enemy: neither valour nor steele could warrant life, the enemy pressed so fast on with inequality of numbers, and dispersion on all quarters.

                     <p>But <hi>Marius,</hi> taking Counsel vpon necessity, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his souldiers to retire vnto two hilles nearely adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Vpon the one, hardly of sufficient capacity to pitch their Tents, was a large Fountaine of Water; the other was more aduantagious, by reason of his eminencie, and some naturall fortifications. Vpon that with the Water, he commaundeth <hi>Silla</hi> with the horsemen to keepe good watch all that night: himselfe by some and some, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his dispersed souldiers in troopes from amongst their enemies, in no lesse confusion, then themselues.

                     <p>The Kings being discouraged by the difficultie of the place, sound likewise the retrait, and suffer not their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to lodge far from the place, but enuironing the hils with multitudes, confusedly sette them downe.

                     <p>For <hi>Marius</hi> being very confident, vppon the rawnesse of the enemy, giueth a strict commaund for keeping of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all the night; so farre forth, as not to sound the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet according to custome, at the setting or relieuing of the watch. Then vpon the approach of the dawning (the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy being now weary, and not long before ouertaken with sleepe) <hi>Marius</hi> willeth the Mercinary Trumpeters, and the Drummes of all the Cohorts, winges and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, vppon the sodaine to sound, as also the Souldiers

                     <p>Whereupon, euery man began to fall into ranke, to put on his Armour, to draw his Weapon, and to expect the enemy.

                     <p>AT that time there liued in the Court of <hi>Bocchus,</hi> a certaine <hi>Numidian</hi> called <hi>Aspar,</hi> a man in very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious acceptance with his Maiesty, whom <hi>Iugurth</hi> (hearing of the sending for of <hi>Silla</hi> to Court) had imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Ambassadour, closely and cunningly to obserue what passed in counsell. To him was adioyned <hi>Dabar,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Massugrada,</hi> a kinsman of <hi>Massinissas,</hi> but not by the mother. For his mother was begotten on a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine.

                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:17128:101"/>
to make demonstration, on his maisters behalfe; <hi>That</hi> Bocchus <hi>was ready to performe whatsoeuer the</hi> Roman <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should command him. That</hi> Silla <hi>should nominate the day, the place, and time for conference: That hee would hold good coresponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy vpon all ocasions. That he needed not to take any exceptions against the Ambassador of</hi> Iugurth, <hi>for that he had bin purposely sent for,</hi>

                        <hi>the better to compound their common Controuersies.</hi> For otherwise (he gaue out) that hee could not preuent the traines of <hi>Iugurth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I am of Opinion, that with more then a <hi>Punique</hi> disloyalty, <hi>Bocchus</hi> entertained the treaty, both with the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Numidian</hi> for other respectes, then those which he publickely pretended.

                     <p>Wherupon <hi>Silla</hi> replied, that he would speak to some few points in the presence of <hi>Aspar</hi>; the residue priuatly, or at least-wise not in the hearing of many.<note n="1" place="margin">

                        </note> Likewise he maketh report, what answere he expected.</p>
                     <p>At their next meeting, being at <hi>Sillas</hi> own apointment, He saith, <hi>That being sent from</hi> Marius <hi>the</hi> Consull, <hi>hee was arriued in these parts to be ascertained from the Kings owne mouth, whether he were desirous of peace or war.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereunto the king (as he had bin aduised) made no other reply,<note place="margin">

                     <p>About midnight, <hi>Silla</hi> is secretly sent for by <hi>Bocchus</hi>: Faithfull trucemen are imployed on both sides, And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> the intercurrour, a very honest Gentleman sworne to both their good likings.
