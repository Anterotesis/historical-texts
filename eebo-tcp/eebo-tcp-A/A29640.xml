            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Yet may we gently mourn, not that he's gone,</l>

               <l>On <hi>her</hi> still <hi>weeping</hi> Marble-monument.</l>
               <l>

               <l>But, 'tis no wonder that a <hi>Stoick</hi> you</l>

               <l>Well, I had thought, in point of suffring, <hi>no-man</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Could <hi>me</hi> have stript; but now, I <hi>yeeld</hi> t'a <hi>woman.</hi>

Upon the death of HENRY Lord

Heir of the Right Honorable FERDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANDO
Earl of Huntingdon;
Deceasing immediately before the day
designed for his Marriage.</head>
               <l>FOrbear, forbear, <hi>Great</hi> house of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>T'engross this Grief, as if 'twere all your own:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Kingdom</hi> has a share; and every <hi>Eye</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Claims priviledge to <hi>weep his</hi> Elegie.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Mirrour</hi> of our Age, Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> dead?</l>
               <l>And in his Urn, our <hi>hopes,</hi> thus, buried?</l>
               <l>And shall not <hi>we</hi> come in, (who share i'th' smart)</l>
               <l>In your sad consort, to lament our part?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>We must</hi>—or, if that language be you say,</l>
               <l>Rude, and uncivil; we <hi>intreat</hi> we <hi>may.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Alas! our griefs swell high, whilst inward pent;</l>
               <l>They'll burst our hearts, unless we give them vent.</l>
               <l>For pity then, if not to spare <hi>your</hi> eyes,</l>
               <l>Let <hi>our</hi> tears joyn, to mourn his Obsequies.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Sweet souls,</hi> alas! when we have wept our fill,</l>
               <l>You'll finde enough of tears, for you left, still.</l>

But stay—What voice was that? Methinks I hear</l>
               <l>My better <hi>Angel</hi> whisp'ring in my ear</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Words</hi> of another strain, which purer are</l>
               <l>Then what my <hi>Carnal Muse</hi> suggesteth, far.</l>
               <l>What though our loss be great; so <hi>great,</hi> that none</l>
               <l>In our <hi>Age</hi> has exceeded it, but <hi>One?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet, this is not the way t'express our Pieties,</l>
               <l>By making large <hi>Alembecks</hi> of our Eyes.</l>
               <l>The greater our loss is, the more's his gains;</l>
               <l>And, whom our <hi>eyes</hi> think dead, our <hi>hearts</hi> know</l>
               <l>A <hi>Saint</hi> in heaven: who, being <hi>there inthron'd,</hi> (reigns</l>
               <l>How can he take it, <hi>here</hi> to be <hi>bemoan'd?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Away then with these <hi>Pagan</hi> Rites, and be</l>
               <l>More <hi>Christian-like</hi> in your Solemnity:</l>
               <l>And know, he celebrates his <hi>Fun'ral</hi> best,</l>
               <l>Who comes unto't, as to a <hi>Nuptial</hi>-feast.</l>
               <l>And truely, 'tis his <hi>Nuptial</hi>-feast <hi>indeed;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Not, that which <hi>Man</hi> meant, but, which <hi>God</hi> decreed.</l>
               <l>A Marriage fit for him; and, in my sence,</l>
               <l>Most sutable unto his <hi>Innocence:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A Marriage with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> who took his sin,</l>
               <l>First, quite away from him; and then, took <hi>Him.</hi>
               </l>

               <l>The <hi>Cause</hi> to vanish, and yet ne'er be mist:</l>

Unto its former life and beauty: But</l>
               <l>Pityable Man, when once his eyes are shut,</l>
               <l>Is no more seen; but past recov'ry lost;</l>
               <l>A tender fleeting Form, a Bloodless Ghost.</l>
               <l>And, 'las, that God-like Youth that did amaze</l>

               <l>Beyond her known <hi>Idea</hi>'s He, in whom</l>
               <l>So many Noble Bloods had found their home;</l>
               <l>(Like some fam'd <hi>River,</hi> whose proud streams are great,</l>
               <l>Because that Other <hi>Rivers</hi> therein meet:)</l>
               <l>He that was onely like Himself; hath quit</l>
               <l>His Cage of Clay; I saw a paleness sit</l>
               <l>Upon his lips, and lurid darkness break</l>
               <l>And chase the Orient Purple of his cheek.</l>
               <l>I saw his Eyes seal'd to eternal <hi>Night,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And all those Spices which Corruption fright</l>
               <l>Straw'd on his Waxen Limbs. He's gone, he's gone,</l>
               <l>And cruelly fled; and yet not he alone,</l>
               <l>But Courage, Sweetness, Innocence, and Truth,</l>
               <l>And all those sweet imbellishments of Youth;</l>
               <l>And all those full Perfections which engage</l>
               <l>Our praise, and cast a reverence on Age;</l>
               <l>And all those Arts, which by long toil acquir'd,</l>
               <l>Do make men either useful or admir'd:</l>

All which he mastred, not as others, who</l>
               <l>By lame Degrees to a Full stature grow;</l>
               <l>He, at the first, was such: what other men</l>
               <l>From Climate, Humour, Temper, Custom gain,</l>
               <l>Nature endow'd him with: and though she please</l>

               <l>In this vast <hi>Miracle</hi> she her self surpast,</l>
               <l>And shew'd, at once, Perfection and Haste.</l>
               <l>Nor was there any thing in him to weed,</l>
               <l>To prune, or straighten: that Celestial Seed</l>
               <l>The Stars had shed into him, could not flow</l>
               <l>To Loosness, nor yet poorly under-grow.</l>
               <l>Nothing in him was crooked, lame, or flat,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Geometrically</hi> proportionate:</l>
               <l>Nor had he that which the severely Wise</l>
               <l>Deplore in Men, and would abolish; Vice.</l>
               <l>His was a Snowie soul, a pure Essence</l>
               <l>So clearly shining in'ts first Innocence,</l>
               <l>That He did that Opinion true declare,</l>
               <l>That Vice and Evil utter Nothings are.</l>
               <l>Nor was his Knowledge other: that pure Minde</l>
               <l>Was too Aethereal, and too refin'd,</l>
               <l>To know or common Paths, or common Bounds:</l>
               <l>His was like Lightning, which all Sight confounds,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52510:25"/>
And strikes so swiftly, that it seems to be</l>
               <l>Rather the object of the Memory.</l>
               <l>Thus did he oft his Tutors sense prevent,</l>
               <l>And happily surprise him in's intent:</l>
               <l>Thus he o'er-run all Science, (like a King</l>
               <l>Conquering by approach) as if that every Thing,</l>
               <l>Stript of its outward dross, and all refin'd</l>
               <l>Into a Form, lay open to his Minde:</l>
               <l>Or his pure Minde could suddenly disperse</l>
               <l>It self all ways, and th'row all Objects pierce.</l>
               <l>Yet whatsoe'er into his Minde did pass,</l>
               <l>Though writ in <hi>Water,</hi> did remain in <hi>Brass.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet has this <hi>Genius</hi> made a sad depart,</l>
               <l>Maugre those strong Resistances of Art,</l>

               <l>His tender Cheeks blossom'd by their first Down;</l>
               <l>Maugre those Hopes which did so bravely feign</l>
               <l>That a great Race should spring from him again;</l>
               <l>A Race of <hi>Hastings</hi>'s, whose High Deeds should raise</l>

But ('las) these Hopes are now meer Dreams become,</l>
               <l>And all those Glories buried in his Tomb.</l>
               <l>Too rigorous <hi>Fates,</hi> 'tis but an envions sport,</l>
               <l>To make those Lives that are most brave, most short;</l>

               <l>A way so oft to Massacre Mankinde?</l>
               <l>Or cannot milder Heaven one Influence throw,</l>
               <l>To make one thing Glorious and Lasting too?</l>
               <l>But there's a difference 'twixt Heav'n and Earth,</l>
               <l>And those things which from Each receive their birth:</l>
               <l>On Earth, the finest things fade soonest; there,</l>
               <l>Ill-boding Meteors the most short-liv'd are.</l>
               <l>And yet,(<hi>my Lord</hi>) since that Celestial fire</l>
               <l>That is shut up within us, doth aspire,</l>
               <l>Being once freed, like an ambitious Flame,</l>
               <l>Unto that Fountain, from whence first it came;</l>
               <l>With what a glorious Brightness is He gone,</l>

               <l>Seize on that Intellect? How doth it glow</l>
               <l>With fresh Illapses of the purest Light,</l>
               <l>Free from the Bondage of chill Sense and Night?</l>
               <l>How do the <hi>ghosts</hi> with admiration gaze</l>
               <l>On this great Shade! With what a proud amaze</l>

               <head>An ELEGIE
On the death of the Right Honourable,
Henry Lord Hastings;
Presented at his Funeral.</head>
               <l>HOw comes this press of People to this place,</l>
               <l>Oppress'd with inward Anguish? On each face</l>
               <l>Sorrow sits deeply printed; and each eye,</l>
               <l>Swoln big with Grief, drops down an Elegie.</l>
               <l>'Tis Love, that <hi>Magnes</hi> of the world, that drew</l>
               <l>This sad Assembly hither, not to view</l>
               <l>Each other, but with Zeal and Service pure,</l>
               <l>To wait on him, who, living, I am sure,</l>
               <l>Was so compleat Perfection, that I may</l>
               <l>(<hi>Sans</hi> Flatt'ry) call him Miracle, and say,</l>
               <l>He di'd to make his Motto good, this way,</l>
               <l>In height of Gratitude, for to express,</l>
               <l>He honour'd us to wait upon his Herse.</l>
               <l>Who can be silent now, or so dull grown,</l>
               <l>Not to have sense? An universal Groan</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52510:31"/>Befits a Gen'ral Loss. Come, let us sigh</l>
               <l>Together; so conspiring far more high</l>
               <l>To raise his Fame and Monument: I know</l>
               <l>The gentler Windes will their assistance show,</l>
               <l>And on their wings transport his lovely Name</l>
               <l>As far as <hi>Titan</hi> with his fulgent Flame</l>
               <l>Doth gild the World. This done, their latest breath,</l>
               <l>In hoarse and hollow Murmures against Death,</l>
               <l>They will expire: which I should also do,</l>
               <l>Were it not Womanish, and Childish too.</l>
               <l>We may not grieve too much, lest it should prove</l>
               <l>Envie at Happiness, not Signes of Love.</l>
               <l>For he was Vertue's Magazine, and thence</l>
               <l>He did disperse his pretious Influence</l>
               <l>On all about him. He was right compleat,</l>
               <l>And, which is wonderful, as Good as Great.</l>
               <l>Cease then your Grief, and dry your eyes: though hence</l>
               <l>He's fled, yet still a great Intelligence</l>
               <l>He lives; and will for many Ages stand,</l>

               <l>COme, Tragick <hi>Muse,</hi> finde me one Spring through all</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Parnassus</hi> Rise, womb-swell'd with bitter'st Gall,</l>
               <l>To write my Heart, as Sable as the Herse;</l>
               <l>My Thoughts as Black, as ever stood in Verse.</l>
               <l>Resigne, for once, th' <hi>Elixar</hi> of All yet</l>
               <l>Ere vow'd unto thy Shrine; their Fancie, Wit,</l>
               <l>Their Language; Youth of all; yet all this Store,</l>
               <l>Too small to pencil That, which calls for More.</l>
               <l>Lend me a Fancie, which may reach; a Minde</l>
               <l>As full of Excellency, in every kinde,</l>
               <l>As th' Earth of Causes, or the Heavens of Light:</l>
               <l>The Sun's but full, and full's the <hi>Margarite.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Fit me with Tiptoe-Language, to command</l>
               <l>The sharpst-ey'd Intellect, and force a stand:</l>

Such may the Subject be, so full of dress,</l>
               <l>Deserving more then Language can express.</l>
               <l>Furnish my Brain with onely so much Art,</l>
               <l>To tell the World, <hi>There was One,</hi> whose least part</l>
               <l>Deserv'd the largest Volume: tell me then,</l>
               <l>If so much Youth was not th' Abstract of Men.</l>
               <l>When These have done their parts, and Thousands more,</l>
               <l>All is but <hi>Callis,</hi> unto <hi>Tagus</hi> shore;</l>
               <l>A Minute, to an Age; Lead-Oar, to Gold:</l>
               <l>So precious was that Gem now Caskt in Mold.</l>
               <l>If (Passenger) thou ask whom this may be,</l>
               <l>Thus Thron'd on such an height of Dignity;</l>
               <l>I may not tell, but blushing, when each Letter</l>
               <l>Terms my speech rude, because 'tis spoke no better.</l>
               <l>Ghess by the Sequele; see the Mourners all,</l>
               <l>Ev'n drunk with Asps, and Cockatrices gall;</l>
               <l>Pensive to death: view next th' Attendants; see</l>
               <l>How each one droops, because it was not he.</l>
               <l>The very Steeds which drew that heavenly Load,</l>
               <l>Went such a pace, as if they'd understood</l>
               <l>Their Master's fall; so slowe, yet full of grace,</l>
               <l>As ne'er to come unto a parting-place.</l>
               <l>Like hairy Comets pregnant with Mishaps,</l>
               <l>Do seldom come alone; but After-claps</l>

Of Princely Horrour, (issues of that Womb:)</l>
               <l>Such (though in State) are Waiters on a Tomb.</l>
               <l>Lo here, the Crest, the Sword, the Gantlet, all</l>

               <l>Though <hi>Darby, Suffolk, Clarence,</hi> great in State,</l>

               </l>
               <l>None e'er disdain'd this Royal, Loyal Stem,</l>
               <l>Faithful to Church, true to the Diadem:</l>
               <l>Well might it be thought Honour to fix there,</l>
               <l>Where God's sole Soveraign, and the prime sole Peer.</l>
               <l>So much of every Line, of every Good,</l>

               <l>Was here; that as in him they lived all</l>

                  <l>The Grievance of my Minde for this sad Fate?</l>
                  <l>Wanting the Learned Phrases to set forth,</l>
                  <l>In high Expressions, such a Subject's worth.</l>
                  <l>Let deep Divines, that long have studied Art,</l>
                  <l>Adorn their Lines to please: I'll write my Part.</l>
                  <l>Then on, my mournful Pen, help, Muses nine,</l>
                  <l>That he may drop a Tear, that reads a Line;</l>
                  <l>When he shall know the grievous Sighs and Groans</l>

Great pity 'tis, so young a Branch as He,</l>
                  <l>Should drop so sudden, from so good a Tree.</l>
                  <l>But Heaven th'Author of all earthly things,</l>
                  <l>Must have his will on Lords, as well as Kings.</l>
                  <l>Nor is the Root so faded, but hath power</l>
                  <l>To plant a Graft that may produce a Flower,</l>
                  <l>To equalize the Loss you so lament,</l>
                  <l>And cure the Malady of Discontent.</l>
                  <l>Cease not to mourn, yet, let not inward Grief</l>
                  <l>Cause a Despair, since heaven can give relief.</l>
                  <l>They're Angels guard him; King of kings hath sent,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Cease then to weep; for he and Angels sing</l>

               <l>Amidst an Inundation of such Grief,</l>
               <l>As to be dry'd up cannot hope relief</l>

               <head>Upon the death of the Lord
HASTINGS.</head>
               <l>GO, intercept some Fountain in the Vein,</l>
               <l>Whose Virgin-Source yet never steept the Plain.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hastings</hi> is dead, and we must finde a Store</l>
               <l>Of Tears untoucht, and never wept before.</l>
               <l>Go, stand betwixt the <hi>Morning</hi> and the <hi>Flowers;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And, ere they fall, arrest the early <hi>Showers.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hastings</hi> is dead; and we, disconsolate,</l>
               <l>With early <hi>Tears</hi> must mourn his early <hi>Fate.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Alas, his <hi>Vertues</hi> did his <hi>Death</hi> presage:</l>
               <l>Needs must he die, that doth out-run his <hi>Age.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Phlegmatick and Slowe prolongs his day,</l>
               <l>And on Times Wheel sticks like a <hi>Remora.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What man is he, that hath not <hi>Heaven</hi> beguil'd,</l>
               <l>And is not thence mistaken for a <hi>Childe?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>While those of growth more sudden, and more bold,</l>
               <l>Are hurried hence, as if already old.</l>
               <l>For, there above, They number not as here,</l>
               <l>But weigh to Man the <hi>Geometrick</hi> yeer.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52510:40"/>
Had he but at this Measure still increast,</l>
               <l>And on <hi>the Tree of Life</hi> once made a Feast,</l>
               <l>As that of <hi>Knowledge;</hi> what Loves had he given</l>
               <l>To Earth, and then what Jealousies to Heaven!</l>
               <l>But 't is a <hi>Maxime</hi> of that State, That none,</l>
               <l>Lest He become like Them, taste more then one.</l>
               <l>Therefore the <hi>Democratick</hi> Stars did rise,</l>
               <l>And all that Worth from hence did <hi>Ostracize.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet as some <hi>Prince,</hi> that, for State-Jealousie,</l>
               <l>Secures his neerest and most lov'd <hi>Ally;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Thought with richest Triumphs entertains,</l>
               <l>And in the choicest Pleasures charms his Pains:</l>
               <l>So he, not banisht hence, but there confin'd,</l>
               <l>There better recreates his active Minde.</l>
               <l>Before the <hi>Chrystal Palace</hi> where he dwells,</l>
               <l>The armed <hi>Angels</hi> hold their <hi>Carouzels;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And underneath, he views the <hi>Turnaments</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of all these Sublunary <hi>Elements.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But most he doth th' <hi>Eternal Book</hi> behold,</l>
               <l>On which the <hi>happie Names</hi> do stand enroll'd;</l>
               <l>And gladly there can all his Kinred claim,</l>
               <l>But most rejoyces at his <hi>Mothers</hi> name.</l>
               <l>The gods themselves cannot their Joy conceal,</l>
               <l>But draw their Veils, and their pure Beams reveal:</l>
