         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt, becauſe all knowledge begins at the
effects which are obvious to ſenſe, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the nature of things, therefore wee will
begin this <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the evill of ſin, from
the miſchievous effects it hath filled the world
withall, it having done nothing but wrought
miſchiefe ſince it came into the world, and all the
miſchiefe that hath beene done, it alone hath
done, but eſpecially towards the poore ſoule of
man, the miſerable ſubject of it.</p>
                  <p>Which firſt it hath debaſed the ſoule of man,
the nobleſt creature under heaven, and higheſt
allyed, made to be a companion fit for God
himſelfe, but ſinne hath ſtript it of its firſt native
<hi>excellency,</hi> as it did <hi>Reuben, Gen.</hi> 49. 41. debaſed
the ſoule more worth than all the world, as
Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, that onely went to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3413:6"/>
price of it: yet ſinne hath made it a drudge and
ſlave to every creature it was made to rule:
therefore the <hi>Prodigall</hi> as a type is ſaid to <hi>ſerve
ſwine,</hi> and <hi>feed on huskes,</hi> ſo as every vanity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
it. Therefore we find in Scripture, that men
are ſaid to be <hi>ſervants to wine, Tit.</hi> 2. 3. ſervants to
riches, and divers luſts, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is that <hi>ſhame</hi> attends upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 21. Now ſhame ariſeth out of an apprehenſion
of ſome excellencie debaſed: and by how much
the excellencie is greater, by ſo much is the
ſhame the greater, and therefore unutterable
confuſion will one day befall ſinners: becauſe
ſinne is the debaſement of an unvaluable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it not onely debaſeth it, but defiles
it alſo; and indeed there was nothing elſe that
could <hi>defile it, Mat.</hi> 15. 20. for the ſoule is a moſt
pure beame, bearing the image of the <hi>Father of
lights:</hi> as farre ſurpaſſing the ſinne in pureneſſe,
as the ſunne doth a clod of earth; and yet all the
dirt in the world cannot defile the ſunne; all the
clouds that ſeeke to muffle it, it ſcatters them all:
but ſinne hath defiled the ſoule, yea, <hi>one</hi> ſinne,
the leaſt defiles it, in an <hi>inſtant, totally, eternally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, one ſinne did it in the fall of <hi>Adam, Rom.
5. 17. one offence</hi> polluted him, and all the world.
Now ſuppoſe you ſhould ſee one drop of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſeazing on the ſunne, and putting out that
light and eye of heaven, and to looſen it out of
the orbe it moves in, and cauſe it to drop downe
a lump of darkneſſe, you would ſay it were a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3413:7"/>
ſtrange darkneſſe: this ſinne did then in the ſoule,
to which yet the ſunne is but as a Taper.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it defiles it thus <hi>in an inſtant.</hi> Take
the moſt glorious Angell in heaven, and let one
of the leaſt ſinnes ſeaze upon his heart, he would
in an inſtant fall downe from heaven, ſtript of all
his glory, the uglieſt creature that ever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held:
you would count that the ſtrongeſt of all
poyſons, that would poyſon in an inſtant; as <hi>Nero</hi>
boiled a poiſon to that height, that it killed <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus</hi>
as ſoone as he received it; now ſuch an
one is ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſinne defiles it <hi>totally:</hi> it reſts not in
one member onely, but beginning at the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
eates into the will and affections; ſoaks
through all. Thoſe diſeaſes we account ſtrongeſt,
which ſeaze not on a joynt or a member onely,
but ſtrikes rottenneſſe through the whole body.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it defiles <hi>eternally,</hi> it being <hi>aterna
macula,</hi> a ſtaine which <hi>no nitre or ſope,</hi> or any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can <hi>waſh out, Ier.</hi> 2. 21. There was once let in
a deluge of water, and the world was all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd
with it; it waſhed away ſinners indeed,
but not one ſinne. And the world ſhall be a fire
again at the latter day, and all that fire, and theſe
flames in hell that follow, ſhall not purge out
one ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it hath robbed the ſoule of the <hi>image
of God,</hi> deprived <hi>us of the glory of God, Rom.</hi> 3. 23.
the image of Gods holineſſe, which is his beauty
and ours: wee were beautifull and all glorious
once within, which though but an accident, is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3413:7"/>
more worth than all mens ſoules devoid of it, it
being a likeneſſe unto God, <hi>a divine nature,</hi>
without which no man ſhall ſee God. Though
man in Innocency had all perfections united in
him <hi>via eminentiae,</hi> that are to be found in other
creatures, yet this was more worth than all: for
all the reſt made him not like to God, as this did;
without which all Paradiſe could not make
<hi>Adam</hi> happy; which when he had loſt, he was
left <hi>naked,</hi> though thoſe his other perfections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
with him; which is <hi>profitable for all things,</hi>
as the Apoſtle ſayes. The leaſt dramme of
which, the whole world emballanced with,
would be found too light; without which the
glorious Angels would be damned devills, the
Saints in heaven damned ghoſts, this it hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
man of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it hath robbed man even of God
himſelfe: <hi>Your ſinnes ſeparate</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>betwixt
you and me:</hi> and therefore they are ſaid to <hi>live
without God in the world:</hi> and in robbing a man of
God, it robs him of all things; for <hi>all things are
ours,</hi> but ſo farre as <hi>God is ours;</hi> of God whoſe
face makes heaven, he is all in all, <hi>his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is better than life,</hi> and containeth beauty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
riches, all: yea they are but a drop to
him.</p>
                  <p>But its miſchiefe hath not ſtaid here, but as the
<hi>Leproſie of the Lepers</hi> in the old Law, ſometimes
infected their houſes, garments; ſo it hath hurld
confuſion over all the world, brought <hi>a vanitie</hi>
on the <hi>creature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. and <hi>a curſe:</hi> and had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3413:8"/>
not Chriſt undertooke the ſhattered condition of
the world to uphold it,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> it had fallen about <hi>Adams</hi>
cares.</p>
                  <p>And though the old walls and ruinous palace
of the world ſtands to this day, yet the beauty, the
gloſſe, and glory of the hangings is ſoyled and
marred with many imperfections caſt upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
creature.</p>
                  <p>But as the houſe of the Leper was to be pulled
downe, and Traitors houſes uſe to be made jakes:
ſo the world (if Chriſt had not ſtept in) had
ſhrunke into its firſt nothing: and you will ſay,
that is a ſtrong carrion that retaines not onely
infection in it ſelfe, but infects all the aire about:
ſo this, that not the ſoule the ſubject of it onely,
but all the world.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it was the firſt founder of hell, and laid
the firſt corner ſtone thereof: ſinne alone brought
in and filled that bottomleſſe gulfe with all the
fire, and brimſtone, and treaſures of wrath, which
ſhall never be burnt and conſumed. And this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and pierced Chriſt himſelfe, poured on
him his Fathers wrath, the enduring of which
for ſinne, was ſuch, as that all the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
had crackt and ſunke under it.</p>
                  <p>But yet this eſtimate is but taken from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it, the eſſence of it which is the cauſe of
all theſe evills, muſt needs have much more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
in it. Shall I ſpeak the leaſt evill I can ſay
of it? <hi>It conteins all evills alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in it:</hi> therefore
<hi>Iames</hi> 1. 23. the Apoſtle calls it <hi>filthineſſe, and
abundance of ſuperfluitie,</hi> or excrement as it were,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3413:8"/>
of naughtineſſe. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. As if ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that if all evills were to have an excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a ſcumme, a ſuperfluitie, ſinne is it, as being
the abſtracted quinteſſence of all evill. An evill,
which in the nature and eſſence of it <hi>virtually,</hi>
and <hi>eminently,</hi> containes all evills of what kinde
ſoever that are in the world; Inſomuch as in the
Scriptures you ſhall finde that all the evills in the
world, ſerve but to anſwer for it, and to give
names to it. Hence ſinne it is called <hi>poyſon,</hi> and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<hi>ſerpents:</hi> ſinne is called <hi>a vomit,</hi> ſinners <hi>dogs:</hi>
ſinne the ſtench of graves, and they <hi>rotten ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres:</hi>
ſinne <hi>mire,</hi> ſinners <hi>ſowes:</hi> and ſinne <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
blindneſſe, ſhame, nakedneſſe, folly, madneſſe,
death,</hi> whatſoever is filthy, defective, infective,
painfull. Now as the holy Ghoſt ſayes of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,
as is his name, ſo is he;</hi> ſo may wee ſay of
ſinne: for if <hi>Adam</hi> gave names to all things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their nature, much more God, <hi>who
calls things as they are.</hi> Surely God would not
ſlander ſinne, though it be his onely enemie. And
beſides, there is reaſon for this, for it is the cauſe
of all evills. God ſowed nothing but good ſeed
in the world; <hi>He beheld, and ſaw all things were
very good.</hi> It is ſinne hath ſowne the tares: all
thoſe evills that have come up, ſorrowes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
both unto men and beaſts. Now whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is in the effect, is <hi>via eminentiae</hi> in the cauſe.
Surely therefore it is to the ſoule of man (the
miſerable veſſell and ſubject of it) all that, which
poyſon, death, and ſickneſſe is unto the other
creatures, and to the body; and in that, it is all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3413:9"/>
theſe to the <hi>ſoule,</hi> it is therefore more than all
theſe to it: for <hi>corruptio optimi peſsima:</hi> by how
much the ſoule exceeds all other creatures, by ſo
much muſt ſinne, which is the corruption, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
death, and ſickneſſe of it, exceed all other
evills.</p>
                  <p>But yet this is the leaſt ill that can be ſaid of it.
There is 2. ſome further tranſcendent peculiar
miſchiefe in it, that is not to be found in all other
evills, as will appeare in many inſtances.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, all other evills God proclaimes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the author of, and ownes them all; though
ſinne be the meritorious cauſe of all, yet God the
efficient and diſpoſing cauſe. <hi>There is no evill in
the City but I have done it.</hi> He onely diſclaimeth
this, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 13. as a baſtard of ſome others bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
for <hi>he is the Father of lights, ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the utmoſt extremity of the evill of
puniſhment God the Sonne under-went, had a
cup mingled him of his Father, more bitter than
if all the evils in the world had beene ſtrained in,
and he dranke it off heartily to the bottome; but
not a drop of ſinne, though ſweetned with the
offer of all the world, would goe downe with
him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, other evils the Saints have choſen
and imbraced as good, and refuſed the greateſt
good things the world had, as evill, when they
came in competition with ſinne. So <hi>Moſes thoſe
rather to ſuffer, much rather than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of</hi> ſinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. from 24. to 28. So <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi>
when <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empreſſe threatned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3413:9"/>
him: goe tell her, ſayes he, <hi>Nil niſi peccatum ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo,</hi>
I feare nothing but ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, take the Devill himſelfe, whom you
all conceive to be more full of miſchiefe than all
the evills in the world, called therefore in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
<hi>ſpirituall wickedneſſe, Eph.</hi> 6. 12. yet it was
but ſinne that firſt ſpoiled him, and it is ſinne <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth</hi>
the very devils: he was a glorious Angell,
till he was acquainted with it: and could there
be a ſeparation made betweene him and ſinne,
he would be againe of as good, ſweet, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a nature, as any creature in earth or heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Though other things are evill, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
makes the creature <hi>accurſed</hi> but ſinne: as
all good things in the world doe not make a man
a bleſſed man, ſo nor all the evills accurſed. God
ſayes not, bleſſed are the honorable, and the rich,
nor that accurſed are the poore: but <hi>curſed is the
man that continues not in all things, Gal.</hi> 3. 10. a
curſe to the leaſt ſinne; and on the contrary, <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is the man whoſe iniquities are forgiven, &amp;c.
Rom.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, God hates nothing but ſinne. Were all
evills ſwept downe into one man, God hates him
not ſimply for them, not becauſe thou art poore
and diſgraced, but onely becauſe ſinfull. It is ſin
he hates, <hi>Rev. 2. 15. Iſa.</hi> 27. 11. yea it alone: and
whereas other attributes are diverſely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in their effects to ſeverall things: as his
love and goodneſſe, Himſelfe, his Sonne, his
children, have all a ſhare in: yet all the hatred
(which is as large as his love) is ſolely poured
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3413:10"/>
out upon, and wholly, and limited onely unto
ſinne.</p>
                  <p>All the queſtion will be what tranſcendencie
of evill is in the eſſence of it, that makes it above
all other evills, and hated, and it onely by God,
Chriſt, the Saints, &amp;c. more than any other
evill.</p>
                  <p>Why? It is <hi>enmity with God, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts
we know ſpeake eſſences: the meaning is,
it is as directly contrary to God, as any thing
could be: for contrary it is to God, and all that
is his.</p>
                  <p>As 1. contrary to his eſſence, to his exiſtence,
and being God: for it makes men hate him, <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 30. and <hi>as he that hateth his brother is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 15. ſo hee that hateth God may be
ſaid to be a murtherer of him, and wiſheth that he
were not. <hi>Peccutum eſt Dei-cidium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Contrary it is to all his attributes which
are his <hi>name:</hi> men are jealous of their names:
Gods name is himſelfe; as 1. It makes a man
ſlight Gods goodneſſe, and to ſeeke happineſſe
in the creature, as if hee were able to be happy
without him. And 2. it depoſeth his ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and ſets up other Gods before his face. 3. It
contemns his truth, power, and juſtice. And 4.
turnes his grace into wantonneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And as to himſelfe, ſo to what ever is his, or
deare to him. Beſides, A King hath 3. things in
an eſpeciall manner deare to him: <hi>His Lawes,
His favour ites, his image ſtampt upon his coine:</hi>
and ſo hath God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:3413:10"/>
Firſt, his lawes and ordinances: God never
gave Law, but it hath beene broken by ſinne;
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the definition of it, <hi>The transgreſsion of
the Law, 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 4. yea it is called deſtroying the
Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 126. And know, that Gods
Law, the leaſt tittle of it, is more deare to him,
than all the world. For ere the leaſt tittle of it
ſhall be broken, heaven and earth ſhall paſſe.
The leaſt ſinne therefore, which is a breach of
the leaſt law, is worſe than the deſtruction of the
world: and for his worſhip, (as envying God
ſhould have any,) it turns his ordinances into
ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for his favourites: God hath but a
few poore ones; upon whom becauſe God hath
ſet his love, ſinne hath ſet its hatred.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for his image even in a mans owne
breaſt: the law of the members fights againſt the
law of the mind, and endevoureth to expell it,
though a man ſhould be damned for it. <hi>Gal. 5. 17.
The fleſh</hi> (namely ſinne) <hi>luſteth againſt the Spirit,</hi>
for they are contraries. Contrary indeed; for me
thinkes though it hates that image in others, that
yet it ſhould ſpare it in a mans ſelfe, out of ſelf-love;
but yet, though a man ſhould be damned,
if this image be expelled, it yet laboureth to doe
this; ſo deadly is that hatred, a man hates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as holy, ſo farre as he is ſinfull.</p>
                  <p>It abounds now ſo high, as our thoughts can
follow it no farther: <hi>Divines</hi> ſay, it aſpires unto
infinity, the object againſt whom it is thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto, being God, who is infinite, they tell
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3413:11"/>
us, that objectively, ſinne it ſelfe is infinite. Sure I
am, the worth of the object or party offended,
aggravates the offence: an ill word againſt the
King is high treaſon, not the greateſt indignity to
another man. Sure I alſo am, that God was ſo
offended with it, as, though he loves his Sonne
as himſelfe, yet he (though <hi>without ſinne</hi>) being
but <hi>made ſinne</hi> by imputation, yet God <hi>ſpared him
not:</hi> and becauſe the creatures could not ſtrike a
ſtroake hard enough, he himſelfe was <hi>pleaſed to
bruiſe him, Eſay 53. 16. He ſpared not his owne
Sonne, Rom.</hi> 8. 32. His love might have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him, to have paſſed by it to his Sonne; at
leaſt a word of his mouth might have pacified
him: yet ſo great was his hatred of it, and offence
at it, as he powred the vialls of his wrath on him:
Neither would entreaty ſerve, for <hi>though he cryed
with ſtrong cryes it ſhould paſſe from him,</hi> God
would not, till he had out-wraſtled it.</p>
                  <p>And as the perſon offended, aggravates the
offence, as before, ſo alſo the perſon ſuffering,
being God and man, argues the abounding ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it. For, for what crime did you ever hear
a King was put to death? their perſons being
eſteemed in worth above all crime, as civill.
Chriſt was the <hi>King of Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet there is one conſideration more to
make the meaſure of its iniquity fully full, and
to abound to flowing over, and that is this,
that the leaſt ſinne virtually more or leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
all ſinne in the nature of it (I meane not
that all are equall, therefore I adde more or leſſe)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3413:11"/>
and I prove it thus: becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> by one offence
contracted the ſtaine of all, no ſooner did one
ſinne ſeaze upon his heart, but he had all ſinnes
in him.</p>
                  <p>And ſo every ſinne in us by a miraculous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
inclines our nature more to every ſinne
than it was before: it makes the pollution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a deeper dye; not onely to that ſpecies of
ſinne, whereof it is the proper individuall act, but
to all elſe: as bring one candle into a roome, the
light ſpreads all over; and then another, the
light is all over more increaſed: So it is in ſinne;
for the leaſt cuts the ſoule off from God, and
then it is ready to goe a whoring after every va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that will entice it, or entertaine it.</p>
                  <p>And this ſhewes the fulneſſe of the evill of it,
in that it containes not onely all other evills in the
world in it, but alſo all of its owne kinde. As you
would count that a ſtrange poyſon, the leaſt drop
of which containes the force of all poyſon in it:
That a ſtrange diſeaſe, the leaſt infection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
brought the body ſubject to all diſeaſes: yet
ſuch an one is ſinne, the leaſt making the ſoule
more prone and ſubject to all.</p>
                  <p>And now you ſee it is a perfect evill; and
though indeed it cannot be ſaid to be the chiefeſt
in that full ſenſe wherein God is ſaid to be the
chiefeſt good; becauſe if it were as bad as God
is good, how could he pardon it, ſubdue it, bring
it to nothing as he doth? and then how could it
have addition to it, one ſin being more ſinfull than
another? <hi>Ezek. 8. 15. Iohn</hi> 19. 11. But yet it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3413:12"/>
hath ſome analogie of being the chiefeſt evill, as
God the chiefeſt good.</p>
                  <p>For 1. as God is the chiefeſt good, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is to be loved for himſelfe, and other things
but for his ſake; ſo alſo in ſin the chiefeſt evill,
becauſe it is ſimply to be avoided for its ſelfe; but
other evills become good, yea deſirable when
compared with it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as God is the chiefeſt good, becauſe
he is the greateſt happineſſe to himſelfe; ſo ſin,
the greateſt evill to it ſelfe: for there can be no
worſe puniſhment of it,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> than its ſelfe; therefore
when God would give a man over, as an enemie
he meanes never to deale withall more, he gives
him up to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, it is ſo evill, as it cannot have a
worſe <hi>Epithete</hi> given it, than it ſelfe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle, when he would ſpek his worſt
of it, and wind up his expreſſion highteſt, <hi>uſque ad

<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13. that as in God being
the greateſt good, <hi>quicquid eſt in Deo eſt Deus ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi>
therefore his attributes and names are but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<hi>idem praedicatur de ſeipſo:</hi> ſo it is with ſinne,
<hi>quicquid eſt in peccato, peccatum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> he can call
it no worſe than by its owne name, <hi>ſinfull ſinne.</hi>

                     <p>AND what have I beene ſpeaking of all this
while? Why? but of one ſinne in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
nature of it. There is not a man here, but
hath millions of them; as many as the ſands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sea ſhore; yea, as there would be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
were all the world pounded to duſt, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in number alſo; and therefore ere we goe
any further, let all our thoughts break off here in
wonderment at the abounding of ſinne, above all
things elſe; for other things, if they be great,
they are but a few; if many, they are but ſmall:
the world, tis a big one indeed, but yet there is
but one; the ſands, though innumerable, yet
they are but ſmall; your ſinfulneſſe exceeds in

                        </gap>oth.</p>
                     <p>And next, let all our thoughts be wound up to
the moſt deepe and intenſe conſideration of our
eſtates; for if one ſin abounds thus, what tongue
can expreſſe, or heart can conceive their miſery,
who to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. are yet
in their ſinnes?</hi> that is, ſtand bound to God in
their owne ſingle bond onely, to anſwer for all
their ſinnes themſelves; and cannot, in the eſtate
wherein yet they ſtand of impenitencie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe,
plead the benefit of Chriſts death, to
take off and eaſe them of the guilt of one ſinne,
but, all their ſinnes are yet all their owne, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3413:13"/>
to a man in Chriſt they are not; for his owne
bonds are cancelled, and given in, and Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into bonds for him, and all his ſins tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon him.</p>
                     <p>Now for a proper character of their eſtate, and
ſutable to this expreſſion:</p>
                     <p>Firſt then a mans ſinnes may be ſaid to be ſtill
his owne: when he committeth ſinne, <hi>out of his
owne,</hi> that is the full frame and inclination of his
heart. Thus the devill is ſaid to ſinne, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 44.
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>out of his owne;</hi> the whole frame of his
ſpirit is in it; which a man in Chriſt cannot be ſo
fully ſaid to doe, for hee hath a new creature in
him <hi>that ſinneth not, 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 1, 9. that can ſay even
when he ſins, <hi>It is not I, but ſinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, then ſinne is a mans owne, when
he hates it not, but loves it: <hi>The world loves his
owne,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 29. and ſo doth a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man his ſinne, <hi>more than any good;</hi> which is
<hi>Davids</hi> character, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 3.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, what is a mans owne, he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
and cheriſheth; therefore <hi>Eph. 5. 19. No
man hates his owne fleſh, but loveth it, and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it:</hi> ſo doe men their ſinnes, when they are
their owne. Thoſe great and rich oppreſſors,
<hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 5. are ſaid to <hi>nouriſh their hearts in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes,</hi>
and in pleaſure, <hi>as in a day of ſlaughter;</hi> as
living upon the creame of ſinning, and having
ſuch plenty, they pick out none but the ſweeteſt
bits to nouriſh their hearts withall.</p>
                     <p>4. So what a man <hi>provides</hi> for, that is his own;
ſo ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>A man that provides not for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3413:13"/>
his owne, is worſe, &amp;c.</hi> When therefore men <hi>make
proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> as the <hi>phraſe</hi> is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14.
have their Caterers and contrivers of their luſts,
and whoſe chiefeſt care is every morning, what
pleaſures of ſinne they have that day to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it is a ſigne that their ſins are their owne.</p>
                     <p>In a word, when men live in ſinne, 'tis the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
uſed, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 6. She that lives in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
is dead while ſhe lives.</hi> When the revenewes
of the comfort of mens lives come in, from the
pleaſures of ſinne, and that ſupplies them with
all thoſe neceſſaries that belong to life; as when
'tis their element they <hi>drink in like water;</hi> their

and it goes downe, and troubleth them not; their

contrived ſome <hi>miſchiefe, ver.</hi> 16. their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
as when <hi>violence and oppreſsion covers them as

Pſal.</hi> 73. their recreation alſo, <hi>It is a paſtime for
a foole to doe wickedly,</hi> he makes ſport and brags
of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 23. yea their health, being <hi>ſick</hi>
and diſcontented, when their luſts are not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as <hi>Ahab</hi> was for <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard; <hi>Amnon
grew leane,</hi> when hee could not enjoy his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                     <p>All theſe, as they live in their ſins here, and ſo
are dead whileſt they live, and ſo are miſerable,
making the greateſt evill their chiefeſt good; ſo
when they come to die (as we all muſt doe one
day) and how ſoone, and how ſuddenly we know
not; wee carry our ſoules, our precious ſoules,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3413:14"/>

and then we are <hi>ſpilt like water, which none
can gather up againe;</hi> or but as a candle in a paper
lanthorne; in clay walls, full of cranyes, often
but a little cold comes in, and blowes the candle
out;) and then, without a through change of
heart before, wrought from all ſinne, to all
godlineſſe, they will <hi>die in their ſinnes.</hi> And all,
and the utmoſt of all miſeries is ſpoken in that
one word: and therefore <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he would
ſumme up all miſeries in one expreſſion, tells the

can never be puniſhed enough. But as the killing
of a King, is amongſt men a crime ſo hainous, that

then what is the weight of his hands, even of
thoſe hands, <hi>which ſpan the heavens, and hold the
earth in the hollow of them?</hi> and if God take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hands to puniſh, he will be ſure to doe unto

what will millions of millions doe? And

not engender anſwerable apprehenſions of it in
you, (this being but painting the toad, which you
can look upon and handle without affrightment)
I wiſh that if without danger you could but lay
your eares to hell, that ſtanding as it were behind

and to allude to us, as <hi>Naomi</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ruth,</hi> Is there
yet any more ſonnes in my wombe, that they
may be your husbands? So ſay I, Hath God any
more ſuch ſonnes? or is not this Chriſt good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough?
or are we afraid of being happy too ſoon,
in being married to him?</p>
                     <p>But yet if we will have Chriſt indeed (without
whom we are undone) <hi>how ſhall we thou continue
in ſinne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> which is thus above meaſure ſinfull? no
not in one. The Apoſtle ſpeaks there in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of impoſſibility and inconſiſtencie. Chriſt,
and the raigne of one ſinne, they cannot ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, wee will not ſo much as take
Chriſt, untill firſt wee have ſeene more or leſſe

thus appeares to any but in its owne colours, that
man will looke upon the leaſt ſinne then, as upon
hell it ſelfe; and like a man affrighted, feare in
all his wayes, leſt he ſhould meet with ſinne, and
ſtarts at the very appearance of it; he weepes if
ſinne doe but ſee him, and hee doe but ſee it in
himſelfe and others; and cryes out as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did,
<hi>How ſhall I doe this, and ſinne?</hi> and then a man will

life, as a man that can no longer live, <hi>oh give me

is to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſeek him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21. his heart
thereupon will much more deteſt and loathe it:
he ſaw it evill afore, Out then it comes to have a
new tincture added, which makes it infinitely
more ſinfull in his eyes; for he then lookes upon
every ſinne as guilty of Chriſts bloud, as dyed
with it, though <hi>covered by it; the grace of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
teacheth us to deny all ungodlineſſe and
worldly luſts. The love of Chriſt conſtraines him.</hi>
Thinkes he, Shall I live in that for which Chriſt
died? ſhall that be my life, which was his death?
did he that never knew ſinne, undergoe the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for it, and ſhall I be ſo unkinde as to enjoy
the pleaſure of it? No, but as <hi>David</hi> when hee
was very thirſtie, and had water of the well of
<hi>Bethleem</hi> brought him, with the hazard of mens
lives, powred it on the ground; for ſayes hee, <hi>It
is the blood of theſe men:</hi> So ſayes he, even when
the cup of pleaſures is at his very lips, It coſt the
blood of Chriſt, and ſo pours it upon the ground.

And as the love of Chriſt conſtraines him, ſo the
power of Chriſt doth change him. Kings may
pardon Traytors, but they cannot change their
hearts; but Chriſt pardons none, hee doth not
make new creatures, and all <hi>old things paſſe away,</hi>
becauſe he makes them friends, favourites to live
with, and delight in; and if men <hi>put on Chriſt, and
have learned him, as the truth is in Ieſus, they put
off as concerning the former converſation the old
man, with the deceitfull luſts;</hi> and he <hi>ceaſeth from

                     <q>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him

And of all other hee inculcateth this of ſinning

in a long, large, and particular indictment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

ver. 26. &amp;c.</hi> and all <hi>kinds of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
ver.</hi> 29. hee doth both in the beginning,
and end of the bill, bring in this aggravation, that
<hi>they ſinned</hi> againſt knowledge in all theſe. So
<hi>ver.</hi> 18. he begins the indictment and promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods wrath above all for this, that <hi>they
with-held the truth in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> which
was as much as all that unrighteouſneſſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
barely in it ſelfe conſidered: And then again
in the end, when hee comes to pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
he comes in with this, after all particulars
had beene reckoned up, <hi>Who knowing the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God againſt thoſe which doe ſuch things, yet
doe them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that this Doctrine is cleare from hence,<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
That <hi>to ſinne againſt knowledge,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">To ſin againſt knowledge is the higheſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of ſinning.</note> either in omitting
good duties which we know we ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
or committing of ſinnes we know wee
ought not to doe, <hi>is the higheſt aggravation</hi> of
ſinfulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>I put both in both ſinnes of omiſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
for ſo the particular ſinnes the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
are taxed for here, are of both ſorts; as <hi>not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying,</hi>
or <hi>worſhipping God,</hi> as well as <hi>turning his
glory into a lye, &amp;c.</hi> to omit prayer, when your
conſciences tell you, you ought to doe it: to omit
holy diſcourſe, examining the heart, when you
know you ought to doe them, are as well ſinnes
againſt knowledge, as to tell a lie againſt your
knowledge, or as to ſteale and forſweare, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3413:23"/>
murder, or be drunke, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now when I ſay, it is an aggravation to theſe
ſinnes, my meaning is this: That take any ſinne
thou thinkeſt moſt groſſe, and view it barely in
the act of it, put the act nakedly in the one ſcale,
be it a ſinne of uncleanneſſe, or drunkenneſſe;
and then put this circumſtance which was added
to it in the other ſcale, that before and when
thou diddeſt it, thou kneweſt it to be a ſinne, this
alone weighs as much, yea more than the ſinne it
ſelfe doth: that as it is ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> that <hi>he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this to all his other ſinnes, that he caſt Iohn in
priſon,</hi> who told him of his <hi>Herodias,</hi> and ſo is
made as much as all his former ſinnes: ſo is this
brought in here, that in and unto all their unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
this was added, <hi>they with-held the
truth,</hi> the light of their conſciences (which is as
a Prophet from God) they did impriſon <hi>in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe,
ver.</hi> 18. And therefore when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
would convince <hi>Balſhazzar</hi> of his deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to loſe his Kingdome, and that he was not
able to <hi>hold weight in the ballance, Dan.</hi> 5. 22.
what puts he into the other ſcale againſt him to
weigh him up, and to ſhew he was <hi>too light, ver.</hi>
21, 22? he tells him how his <hi>father knew the God
of heaven,</hi> and how <hi>that</hi> his knowledge coſt him
ſeven yeares the learning among wild beaſts, and
<hi>thou</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>his ſonne kneweſt all this, and yet
didſt not humble thy ſelfe.</hi> Here is the aggravation
weighs downe all: he knew the God of heaven
againſt whom he ſinned, and that judgement on
his Father for his pride; and then withall he tels
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3413:24"/>
him, that <hi>this God, in whoſe hands is thy breath, and
all thy wayes, thou haſt not glorified.</hi> I name this
place among many others, becauſe it is parallel
with this in the text. Ile name no more, but give
<hi>reaſons</hi> and <hi>demonſtrations</hi> for it.</p>

it onely by comparing it with other kinds
of ſinning.</p>
                        <p>To ſinne, though out of <hi>ſimple ignorance,</hi> when
that ignorance is but the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that is, ſo as if a man had knowne it a ſinne,
he had not done it, doth not yet make the fact not
to be a ſinne, though it leſſeneth it. For <hi>Luke 12.
48. He that did not know his Maſters will, was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
when the thing committed was worthy of
ſtripes, though he did not know ſo much, becauſe
the thing deſerves it. And the reaſon is, becauſe
the Law being once promulged, as 1. to <hi>Adam</hi>
it was, and put into his heart, as the common ark
of mankinde; though the tables be loſt, yet our
ignorance doth not make the Law of none effect.
For the <hi>Law of nature</hi> for ever binds, that is, all
that was written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, becauſe it was
thereby then publiſhed in him, and to him for us.
But <hi>poſitive lawes,</hi> as I may call them, as to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. anew delivered, bind not, but
where they are publiſht. <hi>Ioſiah</hi> rent his clothes,
when the booke of the Law was found, becauſe
the ordinances were not kept, although they had
not knowne the Law of many yeares; yet becauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3413:24"/>
they ought to have knowne it, therefore for all
their ignorance, he feared wrath would come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So alſo <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 17. ſinnes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
were to be ſacrificed for: yet however, it
leſſeneth the ſin, therefore <hi>he ſhall be beaten with
few ſtripes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſure, if ignorance leſſeneth them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
aggravates; for <hi>contrariorum eadem eſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio:</hi>
therefore <hi>he that knowes, ſhall be beaten with
many ſtripes.</hi> Yea ſuch difference is there, that
God is ſaid to <hi>wink</hi> at ſins of <hi>ignorance. Acts 17.
30. The time of this ignorance God winks at.</hi> Whiles
they had no knowledge, God tooke no notice:
yea and he abates ſomething for ſuch ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the creature hath <hi>a cloake,</hi> hath ſomething
to ſay for its ſelfe; (as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 22.)
but when againſt knowledge, they have no cloak.
Yea farther, <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes a <hi>ſinne of ignorance</hi> to
be <hi>no ſinne,</hi> in compariſon: So there, <hi>If I had not
ſpoken and done thoſe workes never man did, they
had had [no ſinne.]</hi> (That is) none in compariſon,
but <hi>now they have no cloak,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">How much ſinnes againſt knowledge doe tranſcend ſins of ignorance.</note> no ſhelter to award
the ſtripes, or plea to abate of them.</p>
                        <p>And that you may ſee the ground of this vaſt
difference betweene ſinnes of ignorance, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
knowledge,<note place="margin">In ſins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance there may be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if he had known it, he would not have done it: but not ſo in theſe.</note> conſider firſt, that if a man ſin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
(ſuppoſe the act the ſame) out of <hi>ignorance</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there may be a ſuppoſition, that if hee had
knowne it, he would not have done it; and that
as ſoone as he doth know it, he would or might
repent of it. So 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 8. If they had knowne,
they had not crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> The like
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3413:25"/>
ſayes Chriſt of <hi>Tyre, Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha, that if
the ſame things had beene done in them, they would
have repented.</hi> But now when a man knowes it
afore, and alſo conſiders it in the very commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, and yet doth it, then there is no roome for
ſuch a ſuppoſition, and leſſe hope. For what
is it that ſhould reduce this man to repentance?
is it not his knowledge? now if that had no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to keepe him from his ſinne, then it may be
judged, that it will not be of force to bring him to
repentance for it; for by ſinning the heart is
made more hard, and the knowledge and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of it weakned and leſſened, as all power
is, when contemned and reſiſted, <hi>Rom. 1. 21. their
fooliſh heart becomes darker. Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe
hath a touch of this notion in the third of his
Ethicks, that if a man ſinne out of <hi>ignorance,</hi> when
he knowes it, he repents of it; if out of <hi>paſsion,</hi>
when the paſſion is over, he is ſorry for what he
hath done: but when a man ſinnes deliberately,
and out of knowledge, it is a ſigne he is fixed and
ſet in miſchiefe; and therefore it is counted wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
and malice. And hence it is, that thoſe
that have beene <hi>enlightned</hi> with the higheſt kind
of light, but that of ſaving grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. and
<hi>Heb. 10. If they ſinne wilfully</hi> after ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, God lookes on them, as thoſe
that will never repent. And therefore likewiſe
the ſchoole gives this as the reaſon why the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
ſinne obſtinately, and cannot repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their full knowledge they ſinne with;
they know all in the full latitude that it may be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3413:25"/>
knowne, and yet goe on.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the vaſt difference that in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is put betweene <hi>ſinnes of knowledge,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, appears in the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for each. A generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the one, not ſo for the other.</note> and of
<hi>ignorance,</hi> will appeare by the different reſpect
and regard that God hath to them, in the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
he requires and accepts for them; and that
both in the acts of repentance, and alſo in the
ſtate of grace and repentance, upon which God
accepts a man, or for want of which he rejecteth
him.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, when a man comes to performe the acts
of repentance, and to humble himſelfe for ſinne,
and to turne from it, God exacteth not, that ſins
of ignorance ſhould particularly be repented of.
But if they be repented of but in the general, &amp; in
the lumpe, be they never ſo great, God accepts
it. This is intimated <hi>Pſal. 19. 12. Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his errour? cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes:</hi>
that was confeſſion enough. But ſinnes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
muſt be particularly repented of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
and that againe and againe, as <hi>David</hi> was
forced to doe for his murder and adultery, or a
man ſhall never have pardon. Yea farther, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
difference will appeare, in regard of the ſtate
of grace and repentance: for a man may lye in a
ſinne he doth not know to be a ſinne, and yet be
in the ſtate of <hi>Grace,</hi> as the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in <hi>Poliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi>
and in divorcing their wives: but to <hi>lye in a
ſinne of knowledge,</hi> is not compatible <hi>with grace:</hi>
but unleſſe a man maintaineth a conſtant fight
againſt it, hateth it, confeſſeth it, forſaketh it, hee
cannot have mercy. This cannot ſtand with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3413:26"/>
of heart. A friend may keepe corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie
with one, hee ſuſpects not to be an
enemy unto his friend, and be true to his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
notwithſtanding: but if hee knowes him to
be an enemie, he muſt break utterly with the one,
if he leanes to the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, yet farther in the third place, ſo vaſt
is the difference,<note place="margin">Some kinds of ſinning againſt knowledge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which done ignorantly leave a capacity of it.</note> that ſome kind of ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of and againſt knowledge, utterly exclude
from mercy for time to come; which done out
of ignorance, remained capable of, and might
have obtained it; as <hi>perſecuting the Saints, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
Chriſt, &amp;c. Pauls</hi> will was as much in
thoſe acts themſelves, and as hearty as thoſe that
ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> for he was <hi>made</hi> againſt
the Church, and in theſe ſins, as himſelfe ſayes,
not ſinning willingly herein onely, but being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with <hi>fury,</hi> as hot and as forward as the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> that ſinned that ſinne: onely ſayes hee,
1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13. I did it ignorantly, therefore I obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
mercie.</hi> Though it was <hi>ignorantly</hi> done, yet
there was <hi>need of mercie:</hi> but yet in that he did it
but ignorantly, there was a capacity and place
<hi>for mercie,</hi> which otherwiſe had not beene. But
thus to ſin <hi>after a man hath received the knowledge
of the truth,</hi> ſhuts a man out from mercie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
and <hi>there is no more ſacrifice for ſinne, for ſuch ſins;</hi>
I ſay, ſuch ſins as theſe, thus directly againſt the
Goſpell, when committed with knowledge. For
ſins againſt the Law, though againſt knowledge,
there was an atonement, as appeares <hi>Levit.</hi> 6.
from the 1. verſe to the 8. where hee inſtanceth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3413:26"/>
in <hi>forſwearing:</hi> But <hi>to perſecute the Saints,</hi> and
<hi>Chriſts truth, with malice,</hi> after knowledge of it,
<hi>there is no more ſacrifice:</hi> not that ſimply the ſin is
ſo great in the act it ſelfe of perſecution, for <hi>Paul</hi>
did it out of ignorance; but becauſe it is out of
knowledge: ſo vaſt a difference doth knowledge
and ignorance put betweene the guilt of the ſame
ſinne.</p>
                        <p>And therefore indeed,<note place="margin">Sinning againſt knowledge is the higheſt to ſinning againſt the holy Ghoſt.</note> to conclude this in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
laſt place, this is the higheſt ſtep of the ladder, next
to turning off: the very higheſt but that of ſinning
againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> which muſt needs argue it
the higheſt aggravation of ſinning, when it aſcends
ſo high, when it brings a man to the brinck, and
next to falling into the bottomleſſe pit, irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
And therefore to <hi>ſinne preſumptuouſly</hi> (which
is all one) and to <hi>ſinne againſt knowledge,</hi> (as appears
<hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. it being there oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſinning out of ignorance, (ſuch a ſinne as

and then next he prayes againſt <hi>preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

There is a <hi>[much]</hi> in that. Thus it was in the
Heathens eſteeme alſo: They acknowledged their
fooliſh wiſdome in morall and naturall <hi>Philoſophie,</hi>
their greateſt <hi>excellencie:</hi> and therefore <hi>Plato</hi>
thank'd God for three things; that he was a <hi>man,</hi>
an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and a <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22.
the Apoſtle mentions it as that excellencie they
did profeſſe. And <hi>Soloman,</hi> of all vanities ſayes this
is the beſt vanity, and that it <hi>exceeds folly, as light

the <hi>knowledge of the Law,</hi> and <hi>of God,</hi> as we have it
revealed to us; this muſt needs be much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3413:27"/>
And ſo the Jewes eſteemed theirs; as in
this ſecond Chapter of the Romanes, the Apoſtle
ſhewes alſo of them, that they <hi>made their boaſt of the

If therefore all tend to this, this is then the
greateſt mercie of all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>For ſecondly,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon. Knowledge is the immediate guide of men in all their wayes: A man ſins againſt his Guide.</note> God hath appointed knowledge
as the immediate guide of men in all their wayes,
to <hi>bring</hi> them to <hi>ſalvation and repentance,</hi> for to <hi>that
it leads them.</hi> It is that ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi>
call'd it: and therefore the <hi>Law, Rom.</hi> 7. 1, 2.
is compared to an <hi>Husband,</hi> (ſo farre as it is written
in, or revealed in the heart) that as an <hi>Husband is
the guide of the wife in her youth,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Law</hi> to the
heart. And whereas <hi>beaſts</hi> are ruled <hi>by a bit and
bridle,</hi> God hee rules men by knowledge. And
therefore if men be wicked, notwithſtanding this
light, they muſt needs ſinne highly, ſeeing there is
no other curbe for them, as they are men, but this:
if he will deale with them as men, this is the onely
way; and therefore if that will not doe it, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
nothing will.</p>
                        <p>It is <hi>knowledge</hi> makes men capable of ſin, which
<hi>beaſts</hi> are not; therefore the more knowledge, (if
men be wicked withall) the more ſinne muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
be reckoned to them: ſo as God doth not
ſimply looke what mens actions and affections are,
but chiefly what their knowledge is, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judgeth men more or leſſe wicked. I may il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3413:28"/>
this by that compariſon, which I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
unto: That as in <hi>Kingdomes, God</hi> meaſures out
the wickedneſſe thereof, and ſo his puniſhments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
principally, by the guides, the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
thereof, what they are, and what they doe;
as in the 5. of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> the 4. verſe it appeares;
where firſt God lookes upon <hi>the poore</hi> people, <hi>but,</hi>
he excuſeth them, <hi>theſe are fooliſh, and know not the
way of the Lord:</hi> and therefore God would have
beene moved to ſpare the Kingdome, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their ſins. But from them at the 5. verſe
he goes to view the <hi>Rules, I will get me to the great
men, for theſe have knowne the way of the Lord: and</hi>
when he ſaw that <hi>theſe had broken the bands,</hi> then,
<hi>how ſhall I pardon thee for this?</hi> So is it in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
towards a particular man: when God lookes
downe upon a man, and ſees him in his courſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
looſe, and wicked, hee lookes firſt upon
thoſe rude affections in him, which are uncleane,
profane, debaucht, greedy of all wickedneſſe; Ay
but ſayes he, theſe are fooliſh of themſelves, but
I will looke upon his underſtanding, and upon the
ſuperiour faculties, which are the guides of theſe
affections, and ſee what they dictate to theſe unruly
affections, to reſtraine them: And when he findes
that the guides themſelves are enlightned, <hi>and have
knowne the way of the Lord,</hi> and that the will and the
affections, though informed with much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
yet <hi>break all bands,</hi> then <hi>how ſhall I pardon
thee? Thee,</hi> who art a knowing drunkard, and a
knowing unclean perſon, &amp;c. ſo as thus to ſin, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
and maketh <hi>ſin out of meaſure ſinfull.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:3413:28"/>
Now that <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> is a mans <hi>guide,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">That know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in that an erroneous conſcience bindeth.</note>
will further appeare by this: That even <hi>erroneous
knowledge</hi> doth put an <hi>obligation,</hi> a <hi>bond,</hi> and a <hi>tye</hi>
upon a man: which can be in no other reſpect, but
becauſe knowledge is appointed to be a mans
guide. Thus if a man thinkes a thing (which is in it
ſelfe <hi>common</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi>) to be a <hi>ſinne,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
(as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4.) although the <hi>Law</hi> forbids
it not, yet <hi>to him it is uncleane,</hi> though <hi>in Chriſt</hi> it is
<hi>not uncleane,</hi> that is, by the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi> For,
this his knowledge and judgement of the thing
hath <hi>to him the force of a Law:</hi> for it propounds it
to him as a <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>as from God;</hi> which <hi>reaſon</hi> of
<hi>his, God</hi> hath appointed as his <hi>immediate guide:</hi> and
the <hi>will</hi> is to follow nothing that is <hi>evill,</hi> which is
repreſented to it, as evill; this is the <hi>Law of meere
nature</hi> in all conditions; therefore if a man ſhould
doe an action which is in it ſelf good, if he thought
it to be evill, he ſhould ſinne, and ſo <hi>è contra,</hi> for he
goes againſt the dictate of nature. So that <hi>errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
knowledge,</hi> though againſt the Law, is a <hi>law
to me,</hi> though not <hi>per ſe,</hi> yet <hi>per accidens.</hi> Now
therefore if to go againſt a falſe light of conſcience
be yet a ſinne, though it proves that the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
allowes the thing was done, and was for
it, then to go againſt the true light of the Law, how
ſinfull is it?</p>
                        <p>Againe, thirdly, the knowledge of the law binds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the perſon ſo much the more to obedience,<note place="margin">Knowledg lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a further obligation as obedience.</note> by
how much the more he knowes it: ſo as though it
would be a ſinne, when he knowes not the Law to
tranſgreſſe it, yet when he knowes it, it is a greater
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3413:29"/>
ſinne. 'Tis true indeed, that <hi>conſcience</hi> and the
<hi>Law,</hi> when they meet, make up but <hi>one Law,</hi> not
two diſtinct Laws: and therefore in <hi>ſinning againſt
knowledge,</hi> though a man doth not commit two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſinnes, yet the knowledge of it doth adde a
further degree of ſinfulneſſe to it: As a cloath is
the ſame cloath when it is white, that it was when
it is dyed with a ſcarlet dye; yet then it hath a <hi>dye,</hi>
a <hi>tincture</hi> given it, which is more worth than the
cloath: and ſo when you ſinne, not knowing the
Law, the ſin is the ſame for ſubſtance, it would be
if you had known it; yet that knowledge dyes it,
makes it a <hi>ſcarlet ſinne,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks, farre greater
and deeper in demerit than the ſinne it ſelfe: and
the ground of this is,<note place="margin">Lawes come in force when promulged.</note> becauſe <hi>Lawes then come to be
in force, when they are promulged,</hi> and made known:
ſo as the <hi>more</hi> they are <hi>promulged</hi> and knowne, the
<hi>more</hi> is the <hi>force</hi> of their <hi>binding,</hi> and ſo the greater
<hi>guilt.</hi> Therefore <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 12. 3. 8. God ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the cords more, the binding force of the law
more upon thoſe Jewes conſciences, to whom he
at the firſt perſonally with majeſty had promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, than upon their children, though upon
theirs alſo. Now if all Gods Lawes, being made
knowne to <hi>Adam,</hi> binde us, and are in force, and
this when we know them not; then if we do know
them, or might know them, they binde much
more: and ſtill the more clearely wee know them,
the obligation increaſeth, and the guilt inſuing
with it: and the rather, becauſe now when wee
come to know them, they are anew promulged, in
a way of a peculiar mercie; wee having defaced
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3413:29"/>
the knowledge of them in our fall.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, when the <hi>Law,</hi> being <hi>knowne,</hi> is <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
there is the more <hi>contempt</hi> caſt upon the <hi>Law,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">There is the more contempt caſt upon the Law.</note>
and the <hi>Law-giver</hi> alſo; and ſo a higher degree
of ſinning. And therefore <hi>Numbers 15. 30. He that
ſinnes out of knowledge,</hi> is ſaid <hi>to reproach the Lord,</hi>
and <hi>to deſpiſe the word.</hi> And therefore <hi>Saul</hi> ſinning
againſt knowledge, <hi>Samuel</hi> calleth it <hi>rebellion:</hi> and
though it were but in a ſmall thing, yet he parallels
it with witchcraft. So alſo <hi>Iob 24. 13. they are ſaid
to rebell,</hi> when they <hi>ſinne againſt light;</hi> becauſe
rebellion is added to diſobedience: For know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is an <hi>Officer</hi> ſet to ſee the <hi>Law executed,</hi> and
fulfilled; and makes God preſent to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. it is called a <hi>witneſſe;</hi>
and therefore in <hi>ſinning againſt knowledge,</hi> men are
ſaid to <hi>ſinne before the face of the Lord himſelfe;</hi> now
what a great contempt is that? Therefore alſo
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. the <hi>hypocrite ſinning againſt knowledge,</hi> is

                        <p>Fiftly, the more <hi>knowledge</hi> a man ſinneth againſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

there knowledge is made but a circumſtance of

                        <p>But alſo thirdly, when they abuſe morall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which yet, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayes, is leaſt apt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3413:32"/>
to be (I am ſure ſhould leaſt be) abuſed, ſo as to
make a ſhew of good pretences to cover their ſins,
and diſſemble them; not onely by finding out ſome
cunning artificiall colour, as <hi>David</hi> did in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Vriah — Chance of warre</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>falls to
all alike:</hi> but when men are ſo impudently hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall,
as to make uſe of religious pretexts, (as
the Devill ſometimes doth) as <hi>Saul,</hi> who pretends
to <hi>Samuel, I have done the will of the Lord:</hi> and
when <hi>Samuel</hi> told him of the cattell, oh, ſayes he,
<hi>they are for a ſacrifice;</hi> when God had expreſly
commanded to kill them all. But this ſhift ſhifted
him out of his Kingdome, <hi>Samuel</hi> pronounceth
him a <hi>rebell in it, Rebellion is ſinne againſt knowledge,</hi>
therefore he knew it. Thus alſo <hi>Iezabel</hi> coloured
over the ſtoning of <hi>Naboth</hi> with a ſolemne faſt. So
<hi>Iudas</hi> fiſheth for money with a charitable pretence,
<hi>This might have beene ſold, and given to the poore.</hi>
In ſins againſt knowledge, uſually the mind inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to find out a colour, and that provokes God
more than the ſinne, becauſe we goe about to mock
him. We ſee men cannot endure a ſhift, much leſſe
the All-knowing God, not to be mocked: and we
ſee it is hard to convince ſuch an one. <hi>David</hi> was
faine to be brought to the rack, ere he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
when he had a ſhift; and men doe ſeeke ſuch
ſhifts onely in caſe of ſinning againſt conſcience:
for elſe there were no need,<note place="margin">When men neglect to get knowledge that might preſerve them from ſinning, &amp;c.</note> they would be ſure to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
plead ignorance, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> did.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, when men neglect the getting and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of <hi>knowledge,</hi> which knowledge might keep
&amp; hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinning, and might make them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3413:33"/>
expert in duties. This is as much as to ſin againſt
knowledge, although the ſins be committed out of
ignorance: yet that ignorance being through their
owne default, it comes all to one: when it may be
ſaid of men, as the Apoſtle doth of the <hi>Hebrewes,
Chap. 5. 12. That for the time they have had to learn,
they might have beene teachers; they had yet need be
taught againe the firſt principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> If a man had an
Apprentice, who through negligence and want of
heeding, and obſerving what hee daily ſees and
heares about his trade, might have got for his time
much knowledge in his trade, whereby he might
have ſaved his maſter much, which hee now hath
loſt him; and rid and perfected much worke, hee
daily ſpoiles him; ſuch careleſſe blockiſh ignorance
it is juſt for his maſter to correct him for, and to
charge on him all that waſte and loſſe, becauſe he
might have knowne how to have done better. And
therefore even they who thought ignorance in it
ſelfe no ſin (wherein they erred) yet the neglect of
knowledge upon this very ground, they thought a
great ſinne, and that it would be ſo farre from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
ſinnes, as that it would aggravate them. So
here we ſee theſe Gentiles ſhall not onely be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
with for the actuall knowledge, they had
attained to, and ſinned againſt; but alſo for what
they might have had, and have picked out of the
creatures. For ſo the Apoſtle brings in this here in
the 20. verſe, that the power of God being cleerly
ſeen in the creatures, they neglecting to ſpell and
reade it, ſo much knowledg as they might have got,
God will reckon to them, and aggravate their ſins
by.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:3413:33"/>
Thirdly, which is yet much worſe, when men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
refuſe knowledge,<note place="margin">When men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe knowledge that they may ſin more freely.</note> that they may ſinne the more
freely; and doe ſtop the eare, leſt they ſhould be
charmed: As when men are loath, and afraid, and
dare not reade ſuch a booke as diſcovers, or might
diſcover that truth to them, the ſubmiſſion to
which would prejudice them, and this to the end
that they may plead ignorance of their ſinne. Thus
alſo thoſe that aſſent not to truth when it comes in
ſtrongly upon them, but ſeek to evade it. But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 38. when the Apoſtle had cleerely diſcovered
the truth in thoſe things controverted, ſo as <hi>who
ever was ſpirituall,</hi> or not fully blind, might ſee, and
would acknowledge the truth: then he ſhuts up his
diſcourſe about them, ver. 27. <hi>If any be ignorant,
let him be ignorant:</hi> for it is wilfull, <hi>it is affected;</hi>
hee ſpeakes it, as elſewhere, <hi>Revel.</hi> laſt, it is ſaid,
<hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill:</hi> that is, hee
that will be unjuſt, and refuſeth to turne, let him
goe on. This is a great ſinne, for God, you ſee,
gives ſuch a man over: one that is but neglectfull,
or dull of capacity, God will take paines with him,
to teach him, and beare with him, as Chriſt did
with his Diſciples: but if he be wilfully ignorant,
he lets him die in his ignorance, and yet will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
with him, as if all his ſinnes had beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt knowledge, becauſe hee refuſed to
know.</p>
                        <p>The fourth is to hate the light, and to endevour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to extinguiſh it.<note place="margin">Is to hate the light, and to endevour to extinguiſh it.</note> This is yet much worſe, when
men hate the Word, and the Miniſters of it, the
examples of Gods people, and the light they carry
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3413:34"/>
with them (they <hi>ſhining as lights in a crooked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Phil.</hi> 2. 15. and yet they hate theſe, as theeves
doe a torch in the night, and fly againſt the light, as
batts doe, and as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 20.) This
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayes is the <hi>great condemning</hi> ſinne of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
So theſe Gentiles put <hi>Socrates</hi> to death for
reproving them. And thus men ſinne alſo, when
they labour to extinguiſh the light in their owne
conſciences, and <hi>like not to retaine God in their
knowledge, verſe</hi> 28. but would ſtudie the art of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe:
When men have put the candle out,
and drawne the curtaines, that they may ſinne, and
ſleepe in ſin more freely and ſecurely. Thus thoſe
alſo ſin in a higher meaſure, who have had a cleare
conviction, that they ought to be thus ſtrict, and
ought to ſanctifie the Lords day, and pray private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but now have loſt this light, and think they
need not be ſo ſtrict: when men <hi>continue not</hi> in
what they <hi>were once aſſured of,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. theſe ſinne againſt their knowledge,
and are the worſt of ſuch ſinners: and this eſtate
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe makes <hi>ſtatum maligni, the ſtate
of a wicked one, namely,</hi> when the ſparkes of light
are extinguiſht or hated. For when any mans <hi>light
is</hi> loſt and <hi>turned into darkneſſe</hi> by ſinning, then, as
Chriſt ſayes, <hi>how great is that darkneſſe?</hi> When
good lawes are not onely not enacted and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but repealed alſo, (it is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> ſimilitude,
to diſtinguiſh an incontinent perſon, and a wicked
man) this is an high kind of ſinning: So of theſe
Gentiles it is ſaid, <hi>their fooliſh heart was darkned;</hi>
they had extinguiſht ſome of that light God gave
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3413:34"/>
them. As ſome drink away their wits, ſo ſome ſin
away their conſciences; and thus by degrees, they
firſt ſinne away the light of the word they had, as
they in <hi>Iude,</hi> who were religious once, and then
they quench even that little ſparke of nature that
is left. Alſo verſe 10. <hi>corrupting themſelves in
what they know naturally.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fiftly, Men ſinne againſt knowledge yet worſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
when they hold opinion againſt their knowledge.<note place="margin">When men hold opinions againſt their conſciences.</note>
So many are ſaid to doe, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. he foretels
they ſhould ſpeake lyes in <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and invent
lyes that ſhould have a pretence of holineſſe; which
they <hi>know</hi> to be a lye, or elſe they ſhould not be
ſaid to ſpeake <hi>lyes in hypocriſie;</hi> but they doe it to
maintaine their honour and greatneſſe, which muſt
downe, if their doctrine prove falſe: and though
many are given up <hi>to beleeve</hi> their lyes, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11.
as a puniſhment of their not <hi>loving the truth;</hi> yet
others of them ſhall know they are lies, and yet
vent them for truths. Thus when men faſhion their
opinion to the times and wayes of preferment, and
their dependances on Great ones, or to maintaine
and uphold a faction, or out of pride, having broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
an error, maintaine it, though the pulling out
that one tile doth untile all the houſe. Theſe are the
two cauſes given of perverting the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.
4, 5. namely, <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> and ſuppoſing
<hi>gaine godlineſſe,</hi> and ſo faſhioning their religion
accordingly: when men are <hi>Knights</hi> of the poſt,
that will write or ſpeak any thing, whereby they
may get gaine and preferment.</p>

Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Men ſin <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt knowledge</hi> it ſelfe in reſpect of <hi>others,</hi>
                           </note> men ſin againſt knowledge in regard

                        <p>Firſt, by concealing it: the Apoſtle indeed ſayes

                           <note place="margin">By concealing knowledge.</note> He ſpeakes it of opinions, or practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

ſaid, in his Apologie for his life, that if they would
give him life, upon condition to keep that truth to
himſelfe, and not to teach it to others, hee would
not accept life upon ſuch a condition: and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
he expreſſeth his reſolution in words ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

4. 20. whether it be better to obey God than men,
judge you:</hi> and, <hi>we cannot but teach the things wee
have heard and ſeene,</hi> ſayes Chriſt: for knowledge
is a thing will boyle within a man forvent, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be impriſoned: It is light, and the end why
light was made, was to be ſet up to give light. And
Chriſt argues from an apparent abſurdity to put a
light under a buſhell, which may give light to all
the houſe; Haſt thou knowledge of God and of
his wayes, thou canſt not but ſpeake (if withall
thou haſt but a good heart) to all in the familie, to
thy wife in thy boſome, &amp;c. God took it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> would teach his children what
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he ſhould know from him: The ſame diſpoſition is
in all the children of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Men endevour to ſuppreſſe knowledge in others.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, when men endeavour to ſuppreſſe
knowledge. As the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they <hi>kept the keyes of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3413:35"/>
it</hi> in their hands, and would not open the treaſures
of it themſelves, nor let others doe it neither. So
they (<hi>Acts 4. 16.) could not deny but a great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
was done by the Apoſtles (ſay themſelves) <hi>but
that it ſpread no further, let us threaten them, and
charge them, that they ſpeake no more in his name.</hi>
And this they did againſt their conſciences by their
owne profeſſion, <hi>we cannot deny it:</hi> as if they had
ſaid, if wee could we would, but it was too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
it was the truth. So when Maſters keep their

thus guilty.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, when wee would make others ſinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

a ſinner,</hi> when through the ſmall light he had, hee
judged it evident enough, that a ſinner ſhould not
doe ſuch a miracle, as was never done ſince the
world began. And ſo <hi>Iezabel</hi> made the Judges, and

not from evidence of the Truth, or by reaſons

ſayes he; as the Papiſts urged <hi>Cranmer,</hi> not by
arguments, but threats and promiſes to recant;
this is the greateſt cruelty in the world, to have a
man murder himſelfe, ſtab his conſcience. To
offend a weak conſcience is a ſinne, if but paſſively,
when thou doſt ſomething before his face, which
his conſcience is againſt: but if thou makeſt him
wound his own conſcience, and to doe an act him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
which his owne conſcience is againſt, it is
much worſe: as if thou beeſt a Maſter, and haſt a

profeſſedly done,<note place="margin">2. Some more permanent and continued, until recalld, though but once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> yet have an habituall and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
permanency, life, &amp; ſubſiſtence given it, ſuch
as that untill a man doth recall them, hee may be
ſaid continually to renew thoſe acts, and every day
to be guilty of them, and to maintaine it, and ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them. As it is with Laws, which
though made but once, are yet continued acts of
the State, whileſt they ſtand in force unrepealed: ſo
is it in ſome ſins. For inſtance, when a man doth
take goods from his neighbour unjuſtly, the act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is done but once: but till hee reſtores them,
he may be ſaid to ſteale them; every day, every
houre, he continues to doe it habitually; So a man
having ſubſcribed to falſhood, or recanted the

a continuall ſin. And ſuch acts (of this latter ſort I
meane) againſt knowledge are moſt dangerous to
commit; becauſe to continue thus in them, though

therefore men find, when they come to repent, the

wayes, and ought to be profeſſed by them. I doe
not ſay, that all, who doe not come in to profeſſe
Chriſt, and that doe not joyne themſelves with his
people, that they goe on againſt knowledge; for
many are ignorant, and miſtaken about them: but
when men are convinced of the truth, and neceſſity
of profeſſing and <hi>confeſsing</hi> of it even <hi>unto ſalvation,</hi>
(as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10) and yet out of fear,

their hornes all together. Theſe goe on in an eſtate
of impenitencie againſt knowledg; for put all theſe
together, and it muſt needs appeare to be ſo: as
Firſt, when they are convinced that this is the
truth, and that ſalvation and the power of religion
is onely to be found in ſuch wayes and men: and

caſe of many of the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> who therefore ſinned
highly: they beleeved, and were convinced, that
Chriſt was the Meſſiah; and ſo then to be confeſt,

they muſt needs know, that his followers onely

refuſe the company, and fould, and food, and

doe thereby profeſſe that there is a work of grace,

                        <p>Thirdly, ſunk and broken profeſſors, ſuch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

when either men are falne from the practice and

Thoſe that have eſcaped the pollutions of the world,

and ſuch are to be pittyed, but yet are in a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3413:39"/>
condition. <hi>Saul</hi> when he was fallen away,
yet had this ingenuity a while left, hee deſired <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
to pray to his God for him, and told <hi>David,</hi>
that he was more righteous than he; yet ſtill went
on in his courſes, and in the end (as ſome have
thought) ſinned againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But others there are, who though they be fallen
from all the inward, powerfull and ſecret perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of duties they once did practice, and from
all conſcience of ſinning, yet retain their profeſſion
which they know to be but an out-ſide: theſe of all
others goe on againſt knowledge: and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15.
they are ſaid <hi>to make a lye;</hi> not onely to <hi>tell a lye</hi> in
words, but to <hi>make a lye</hi> in deeds. Now a lye is a ſin
of all others moſt againſt knowledge, and indeed
againſt a double knowledge, both <hi>facti</hi> and <hi>juris:</hi>
&amp; ſo is this. 1. That they profeſſe themſelves to be
that they know they are not. 2. That they will
not endevour after that ſtate they know they ought
to get into, if ever ſaved. This is the condition of
many, who being convinced of the power of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
have launched forth into a profeſſion, and
hoyſt up ſaile, but now the tyde is fallen, the ſpirit
withdrawne, the conſcience of ſinne extinguiſht in
them; yet for their credit ſake ſtill beare their ſails
up as high as ever: even as many Merchants doe,
who are ſunk in their eſtates, ſtill beare a faire ſhew,
yea will ſeeme richer than ordinary, by purchaſing
lands, &amp;c. Such a profeſſor was <hi>Iudas,</hi> hee began
ſeriouſly, and thought to have gone to heaven, and
was earneſt in good duties at firſt: as they alſo,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. they <hi>really,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:3413:39"/>
of the world, <hi>through the knowledge of Chriſt:</hi>
but in the end <hi>Iudas</hi> became a <hi>groſſe hypocrite,</hi> one
that pretended the poore, when he loved the bag;
and on the ſudden betrayed his Maſter, when yet
the Diſciples knew it not, ſuſpected <hi>Iudas</hi> as little
as themſelves; and <hi>the end</hi> of thoſe alſo, in that
fore-named place, is ſaid to be <hi>worſe than their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
Now becauſe ſuch ſinne ſo highly againſt
knowledge, therefore their puniſhment is made the
<hi>regula</hi> of all other wicked mens; as when it is ſaid,
<hi>that other ſinners ſhall have their portion with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:</hi>
as the wicked Angels puniſhment is made
the meaſure of mens: <hi>Goe ye curſed into the fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

ſuch groſſe Hypocrites, their puniſhment is made
the rule, and ſo the chiefe of all kind of torments,
which ſinners of the ſonnes of men ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe.</p>
                        <p>Now let mee ſpeake a word to all ſuch as thus
go on in a ſtate of impenitencie againſt knowledge:<note place="margin">Application.</note>
this is a high kinde of ſinning, and of all the
moſt deſperate, and doth argue more hardneſſe of
heart, and <hi>deſpiſing the riches of Gods goodneſſe.</hi> For
if, as in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. to go on in ſinne, when a man
<hi>[knowes not,]</hi> that is, conſiders not that <hi>Gods mercy
leads him to repentance, is made the ſigne and effect of
a very hard heart, treaſuring up wrath,</hi> then much
more, when thou knoweſt and conſidereſt thou art
in an impenitent condition, and haſt many motions
leading thee to repentance, is thy heart then to be
accounted hard? When a man commits a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
act againſt knowledge, he haply and uſually ſtill
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3413:40"/>
thinks his eſtate may be good, and that he ſhall not
loſe God utterly, or hazard the loſſe of him; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his ſpirit, being at preſent empty of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him, he ſteales out to ſome ſtolne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
but when a man knowes his eſtate bad, and
that he is <hi>without God in the world,</hi> and yet goes on,
he doth hereby caſt away the <hi>Lord,</hi> and profeſſeth
he cares not for him, or that communion which
is to be had by him, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did his birth-right.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>David,</hi> though he deſpiſed the Lord, yet hee
did not caſt away the Lord, as <hi>Saul</hi> did: for <hi>Saul</hi>
ventured utterly to loſe him, knowing his eſtate
naught. <hi>David,</hi> when hee ſinned, thought Gods
eternall favour would ſtill continue, though for the
preſent he might loſe the ſenſe of it. But when a
man goes on in a ſtate of ſinning, he ventures the
loſſe of Gods eternall love, and ſlights it, and
knowes he doth ſo: when a man knowes that he is
<hi>condemned already,</hi> as being impenitent, and that all
his eternall eſtate lyes upon the non-payment of
ſuch duties of repentance, &amp;c. and that the guilt
of all his ſinnes will come in upon him, and that an
execution is out, and yet goes on, this is more than
to commit one act againſt knowledge, whereby he
thinks he brings upon himſelf but the guilt of that

                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt rule is, The more thou kneweſt, and
didſt conſider the iſſues and conſequents of that
ſinne thou didſt commit, the more thou ſinneſt
againſt conſcience in it: when as in <hi>Rom. 1. ult. Thou
knowing</hi> (ſayes the <hi>Apoſtle) that thoſe that commit

haply hell fire at preſent flaſheth in thy face, and
yet thou goeſt on to doe it, in this caſe men are ſaid

man conſiders, <hi>that the way</hi> to the whorehouſe <hi>are
the wayes to death</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) So when thou
a profeſſor conſidereſt with thy ſelfe before, This
ſinne will prove ſcandalous, and undoe me, diſable
me for ſervice, caſt mee out of the hearts of good
men, and yet doſt it. Thus that fooliſh King was
told againe and againe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 38. 17, 18, 19. that if
he would yeeld to the <hi>King of Babel,</hi> he ſhould ſave
his life, and City, and Kingdome, and live there
ſtill; but if hee would not, he ſhould not eſcape:
but as <hi>Ieremie</hi> told him, <hi>verſe 23. Thou ſhalt cauſe
this City to be burnt with fire,</hi> yet he would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
<hi>This is the word of the Lord</hi> (ſayes <hi>Ieremie,</hi>) and
he knew it to be ſo; and yet being a weake Prince,

had ſaid againe and againe, <hi>Woe be to him by whom
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3413:41"/>
the Sonne of man is betrayed,</hi> and yet went on to
doe it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond rule is,<note place="margin">Rule, The more conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and motives againſt it, did runne through
thee before thou didſt it, ſo much the greater and
more hainous. How often did mercy come in, and
tell thee, that if thou lookeſt for any hope or part
in it, thou ſhouldeſt not doe ſuch an evill? how
often came that in, <hi>Shall I doe this, and ſinne againſt
God?</hi> did any Scripture come in to teſtifie againſt
thee in the nick? did God ſend in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of ſuch a mercie paſt, to perſwade thee; or
ſome mercies to come, which thou dependeſt upon
him for? That which made <hi>Spira's</hi> ſinne ſo great,
was ſuch debates as theſe before: and this made
<hi>Darius</hi> ſinne, in caſting <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lions den,
ſo great; he debated it with himſelfe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 14.
he was ſore diſpleaſed with himſelfe, and laboured
to the going downe of the ſunne to deliver him; he
conſidered that he was as his right hand in all the
affaires of his Kingdome, and a man entrapped
meerely for his conſcience, and that to put him to
death was to ſacrifice him to their malice; he knew
him to be holy, and wiſe, worth all the men that

troubled him afore, and alſo after; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

becauſe that every ſuch conſultation ſhould ſet an

all theſe is exceeding hainous. Sometimes God
orders things ſo, as a ſinne is made a great ſinne, by
ſuch forewarnings; ſo he contrived circumſtances
that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſinned a great ſinne; for <hi>Iudas</hi> knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Saviour of the world; he
knew it by all the miracles he had ſeene, as alſo by
his gracious words and converſe; and he profeſſed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3413:42"/>
as much in following of him; and he had the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word againſt it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not murder the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
But yet further, God to aggravate his ſinne
to the higheſt, orders it ſo, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould tell
him of it when he was to goe about it, pronounceth
a woe to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. 22. that <hi>it had beene good for
that man that he had never beene borne. Mar.</hi> 14. 21.
and the Diſciples they were ſorrowfull at <hi>Chriſts</hi>
ſpeech, when hee ſuſpected one of them; and
ſhewed an abomination and deteſtation of ſuch a
fact, there was a Jurie of eleven men, yea witneſſes
againſt it; yea and <hi>Iudas</hi> againſt himſelfe, he asked
<hi>if it</hi> were <hi>he;</hi> yea and <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave him a ſop, and
told him, <hi>thou haſt ſaid it,</hi> and <hi>doe what thou doeſt
quickly:</hi> which even then might argue to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that he was God, and ſearched and knew
his heart, and yet hee went out and did it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.
How did hee ſinne againſt the haire, as wee
ſpeak, and how did all theſe circumſtances aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
his ſin?</p>
                        <p>But yet a more cleare evidence of this is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Pilate,</hi> whom God many wayes would
have ſtopt in his ſinne of condemning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who
examining him before the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> he could finde
no fault with him, as concerning thoſe things
whereof they accuſed him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 14. and yet to
allay their malice, unjuſtly ſcourged him, <hi>verſe</hi> 16.
And further, when he ſent him to <hi>Herod,</hi> as being
willing to rid his owne hands of him, <hi>Herod</hi> alſo
found nothing worthy of death in him, <hi>verſe</hi> 15.
which was another witneſſe might have confirmed
him concerning Chriſts innocencie. Yea yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3413:42"/>
that the fact might be more aggravated, a moſt
notorious murtherers life muſt be put into the ſcale
with <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and either the one or the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
and when the people yet choſe <hi>Barrabas,</hi>
why (ſayes <hi>Pilate</hi>) what evill hath he done? <hi>ver.</hi> 22.
then he diſtinctly knew and conſidered, that he was
delivered up through envie: Yea and when hee
was upon the bench, and ready to pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as it were, God admoniſht him by his owne
wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 19. whom God himſelfe had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
in a dreame, ſhe ſending him word ſhee
had ſuffered <hi>many things by reaſon of him that night,
and therefore have nothing</hi> (ſayes ſhee) <hi>to doe with
that juſt man:</hi> yea he himſelfe, when he condemns
him, waſheth his hands. And thus it falls out in
many ſinfull buſineſſes which men are about, that
God often and many ſeverall wayes would knock
them off, and ſtops them in their way, as hee did
<hi>Balaam;</hi> reproves them, as he did him by a dumbe
Aſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. ſo there by ſome ſilent paſſage
of providence, and not onely ſo, but by his Spirit
alſo ſtanding in their way, with the threatnings
ready drawne and brandiſht againſt them, as the
<hi>Angell</hi> did with a drawne ſword againſt <hi>Balaam,</hi>
and yet they goe on; this is fearfull.<note place="margin">2. Rules to meaſure the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of ſuch acts in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, 3.</note>

                        <p>There are 3. Rules alſo, whereby the ſinfulneſſe
of ſin, as it is againſt knowledge, may be meaſured,

temptation to a ſinne committed againſt knowledg,
the greater ſinne againſt knowledge it is argued to
be: For then the knowledge is the clearer, paſſion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3413:43"/>
or temptation being as a miſt. But then to ſinne,
when a man is not in paſſion, is to ſtumble at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
For as drunkenneſſe takes away reaſon, ſo
doth paſſion (which is a ſhort drunkenneſſe) cloud
and miſt a mans knowledge. And ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
compares the knowledge of an <hi>incontinent</hi> perſon,
to the knowledge of one that is drunk. When <hi>Peter</hi>
denied his Maſter, though hee had warning of it
before, and ſo it was againſt knowledge, and it
was by lying, and ſwearing, and forſwearing, which
are ſinnes of all other moſt directly againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
yet he was taken unexpectedly; and when
that which might ſtir up feare to the utmoſt in him,
was in his view; for hee was then in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Hall, where his Maſter, juſt before his face,
was arraigned for his life, and he thought he might
alſo have preſently been brought to the barre with
him, if he had beene diſcovered to have been his
Diſciple; ſo as his paſſion being up, his ſoule was
diſtempered, reaſon had little time to recover it
ſelfe; and therefore though it was againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
yet the leſſe againſt knowledge, becauſe
knowledge had <hi>laeſam operationem,</hi> it had not its
perfect worke upon his heart: but now <hi>Iudas,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
his Maſter, had not onely warning before,
but was not tempted to it, but went of <hi>himſelfe,</hi>
and made the offer to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſought how
<hi>conveniently</hi> to doe it, plotted to doe it, had his
wits about him, had time to think of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was (beſides the hainouſneſſe of the act)
more alſo againſt knowledge, and ſo the greater.
So <hi>David</hi> when he went to ſlay <hi>Nabal,</hi> was in hot
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3413:43"/>
blood, in a paſſion; but when hee plotted to kill
<hi>Vriah,</hi> he was in cold blood: he was drunke when
he lay with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> but ſober when hee made
<hi>Vriah</hi> drunke: hee went quietly and ſedately on in
it. And therefore we find <hi>David</hi> blamed onely in
the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> not ſo much for that of <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward regreet, and ſorrow, and reluctancy, the ſtronger is the knowledge, and ſo more againſt it.</note> the more ſorrow, <hi>reniſus,</hi> or reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and regreeting of mind there is againſt a ſinne,
'tis a ſign that the knowledge of it is the ſtronger,
and quicker againſt it, and ſo the ſinne the more
againſt knowledge: for that gaine-ſaying and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of the minde againſt it, ariſeth from the
ſtrength and violent beating of the pulſe of <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and oppoſition of it againſt the ſinne, it ſprings
from the greater and deeper apprehenſion of the
evill of the ſinne in the action, which is then in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and though that reluctancie be a better ſigne
of the eſtate of the perſon, than if there were none
at all; as there is not in thoſe who <hi>are paſt feeling,
&amp; commit ſin with greedineſſe;</hi> whoſe eſtate is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
worſe, and more uncapable of repentance,
yet the fact it ſelf is argued to be the more hainous,
for it argues it to be againſt ſtrong, active, ſtirring
knowledge. This argued <hi>Herods</hi> ſinne to be much
againſt knowledge (as indeed it was) <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 26.
the text ſayes, <hi>he was exceeding ſorrowfull:</hi> now
that he could not have beene, unleſſe he had excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
apprehended what a great ſinne it was to
behead <hi>Iohn,</hi> who, <hi>he knew, was a juſt and an holy

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3413:44"/>
wrought much upon by his miniſterie, and he knew
that he did but ſacrifice him to the malice of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
woman; and in this caſe the ſinne is alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made ſo much the greater, in that <hi>Conſcience</hi>
doth ſtir up a contrary violent paſſion in the heart
againſt the temptation, and therefore yet to doe it,
when there is ſuch a bank caſt up that might reſiſt
it, yet then to break all downe, ſuch a ſin waſts the
conſcience much.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, on the contrary, the more hardneſſe of
heart there is,<note place="margin">The more hardneſſe of heart in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a ſinne knowne to be a ſin, the greater the ſin, as it is a ſin againſt knowledge.</note> and want of tenderneſſe, in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that ſinne, which a man knowes to be a ſinne,
it is argued thereby to be the greater ſinne againſt
knowledge; not onely <hi>the greater ſinne,</hi> but <hi>the
greater ſinne againſt knowledge.</hi> For hardneſſe of
heart in ſinning, is an effect of having formerly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
much againſt knowledge before. For as the
light of the Sun hardneth clay, ſo the beames of
knowledge and conſcience, lighting upon mens
hearts, uſe to harden them, and doe make them in

ſinning againſt knowledge is made the cauſe of a
ſeared conſcience, <hi>they ſpeak lyes in Hypocriſie:</hi>
and therefore knowingly that they are lyes, and
ſuch lyes as damne others as well as themſelves,
which who beleeve are damned, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12.
and if ſo, no wonder if it followes, <hi>having their
Conſciences ſeared with an hot iron.</hi> It is not a <hi>cold
iron</hi> will ſeare their conſciences, and make them
inſenſible, but an <hi>hot iron, a burning and a ſhining

and being rejected, they begin to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3413:44"/>
and ſeared. For knowledge makes ſinnes and
the apprehenſions of them, familiar to a man, and
ſo leſſe terrible and frightfull in the end, as Beares
and Lyons doe become to their keepers, through
cuſtome. <hi>Iudas</hi> had a hard heart, when he came to
betray his Maſter, ſurely his conſcience had ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him at firſt more for nimming out of the bag,
than it did now for this of murder. He could never
have had ſuch a hard heart, had he not had much
knowledge: was it not a hard heart, that when he
was challenged to his face, hee could ſet a brazen
face on it, and did aske as well as the reſt, <hi>Is it I?</hi>
when alſo Chriſt curſed him to his face, who
ſhould doe it, and the Diſciples all abhorr'd it:
had not <hi>Iudas</hi> lived under ſuch bleſſed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

all this would have ſtartled him, and have ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his purpoſe: but he goes on as if it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
though when he had done it, his conſcience
was then opened too late; when a man formerly
hath beene troubled with a ſmall ſinne, more than
now with a groſſe lye, which he can digeſt better
than once the other: or, when before, if he omitted
praying, it troubled him, now he can goe a weeke
without, and is not ſenſible of it, it is a ſigne that
his knowledge hath hardned him.</p>

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt then, to ſinne againſt the inbred light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">To ſin againſt the inbred light of nature.</note>
that is, in ſuch ſinnes, as though thou hadſt
wanted the light of the word in, thou wouldſt have
knowne to be ſuch: This is a high kind of ſinning.
Such the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Iude 10. What things
they know naturally, in theſe they corrupt themſelves,
as bruit beaſts,</hi> putting as it were no difference of
actions, no more than beaſts, no not in what nature
teacheth them, and therefore therein are as beaſts:
for it is the light of nature puts the firſt difference
betweene men and beaſts; and in ſuch kinde of
ſinnes the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inſtanceth in this firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> as
namely, that of <hi>unnaturall uncleanneſſe,</hi> in three
particulars: as 1. <hi>ſelf-uncleanneſſe, ver.</hi> 24. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

that is, alone <hi>by themſelves:</hi> ſo <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi>
underſtand it, which he makes there the firſt degree
of unnaturall uncleanneſſe, which is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
becauſe thou deſtroyeſt that which nature
gave thee for propagation, <hi>quod perdis homo eſt.</hi>
Then 2. the uncleane love of boyes, <hi>men burning in
luſt with men, ver.</hi> 27. be it diſcovered in what dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
it will, though not ariſing to an act of Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3413:45"/>
                           <hi>doing that which is unſeemely, ver.</hi> 27. which
hee therefore ſayes, is the <hi>perverting the uſe</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<hi>of nature,</hi> and ſo is a ſin againſt nature, <hi>leaving
the naturall uſe of women. My brethren, I am aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſpeak of ſuch things as are done in ſecret.</hi> Theſe
kind of ſinnes, by the Apoſtles ranking them, are
in a further degree of unnaturalneſſe, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe they are made the puniſhments of
other ſinnes, which yet were againſt the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
alſo: namely, not <hi>glorifying God</hi> when they
knew him: yet that being a ſinne, the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was not ſo clear in compariſon of theſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe are made the puniſhments of the other,
as being more againſt nature. So for men to be
diſobedient to Parents, ſtubborne to them, and
<hi>without naturall affection,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>ver.</hi>
30, 31. this is againſt nature, even the inſtinct of it.
So unthankfulneſſe, and requiting evill for good,
is againſt a common principle in mens mindes. <hi>Doe
not the Gentiles doe good to thoſe that do good to them?</hi>
your hearts uſe to riſe againſt ſuch an one out of
common humanity; or if you ſee one cruell and
unmercifull, which is another reckoned up, <hi>ver.</hi> 31.
there being uſually principles of pitty in all mens
natures, by nature; therefore for one man to prey
upon, and tyrannize over another, as fiſhes doe
over the ſmall ones, as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> complaineth,
this is againſt nature;<note place="margin">Hab. 1. 14.</note> which teacheth <hi>you to doe as
you would be done to.</hi> So <hi>covenant-breakers,</hi> and lying,
and forſwearing, mentioned <hi>ver. 30. inventers of
evill,</hi> and <hi>truce-breakers,</hi> are ſins againſt nature, and
natural light; lying is againſt a double light,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3413:46"/>
both morall; both <hi>juris,</hi> which tels us ſuch a thing
ought not to be done; and <hi>facti,</hi> whileſt we affirm

ariſeth up in us againſt, though there were no law

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to ſin againſt that light which thou
didſt ſuck in,<note place="margin">To ſin againſt the light of education.</note> when thou wert young, to ſin againſt
the <hi>light of thy education,</hi> this is an aggravation, and
a great one. There is a <hi>Catechiſme</hi> of a bleſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bathſheba,</hi> which ſhee taught <hi>Solomon</hi> when a
child, put in among the records of ſacred Writ,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 31. wherein ſhe counſels him betimes, <hi>not to
give his ſtrength to women;</hi> ſhe foretold him of that
ſinne: and becauſe it is incident to Kings moſt, they
having all pleaſures at command, ſhe tells him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<hi>it deſtroyes Kings:</hi> and ſo alſo <hi>not to drink
wine,</hi> was another inſtruction there he was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
of: this aggravated <hi>Solomons</hi> fault the more;
for reade the 2. Chapter of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and we ſhall
finde there, that hee was moſt guilty in the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
love of theſe two; but hee had not beene
brought up ſo, his good mother had not thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
him. And thus alſo when God would ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
his owne peoples ſin unto them, he recalls
them to their education in their youth in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.
So <hi>Ierem. 2. 2. Goe and cry to them, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the kindneſſe and</hi> towardlineſſe <hi>of thy youth:</hi>
he puts them in mind of their education by <hi>Moſes</hi>
their <hi>Tutor,</hi> and their forwardneſſe then. And ſo
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3413:46"/>
                           <hi>Hoſ. 12. when he was a child, I loved him;</hi> and then
God had <hi>their firſt fruits, ver.</hi> 3. this he brings to
aggravate their <hi>back-ſliding, ver.</hi> 5. Therefore the
Apoſtle urgeth it as a ſtrong argument to <hi>Timothie,</hi>
to goe on to perſevere in grace and goodneſſe, <hi>That
he had knowne the Scriptures from a child:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for him to fall, would be more hainous. The
reaſon is, becauſe the light then infuſed, it is the
firſt, a <hi>virgin</hi> light, as I may call it, which God in
much mercy vouchſafed to pre-poſſeſſe the minde
with, before it ſhould be deflowred and defiled
with corrupt principles from the world; and did
put it there to keep the mind chaſte and pure: and
this alſo then, when the minde was moſt ſoft and
tender, and ſo fitter to receive the deeper impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from it. And hence ordinarily the light ſuckt
in then, ſeaſons men ever after, whether it be for
good, or for evill; it fore-ſtalls, and pre-judgeth a
man againſt other principles: and though a man
comes to have more acquired knowledge and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
after put into him when he is come to perfect
age, yet the ſmall light of his education, if it were
to the contrary, doth bias him, and keeps him fixt,
and bent that way. So we ſee it is in opinions about
Religion: the light then entertained, can never be
diſputed out: ſo in mens wayes and actions, <hi>Traine
up a child in his way, and he will not depart from it.
Prov.</hi> 22. 6. To ſin therefore againſt it, and to put
out the beames of it, or defile it, and to weare out
the impreſſions of it, how wicked is it, and what a
wretch art thou to do ſo?</p>
                        <p>Many of you young ſchollers have had a good
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3413:47"/>
                           <hi>Bathſheba</hi> that inſtructed you, not to poure out your
ſtrength to drinke or women, but to pray private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to feare God, and love him; and when you
come hither, you have good <hi>Tutors</hi> alſo, who teach
you to pray; Miniſters, who inſtill bleſſed truths
into you, from which, one would think, you ſhould
never depart; yet you doe.</p>
                        <p>Think how grievous this is; for if it is made an
excuſe for many a man in ſinning, that it anſwers
but his education; that he never knew or ſaw bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as you ſay of many Papiſts; then muſt it needs
on the contrary, be an aggravation of ſinfulneſſe.
And as it was <hi>Timothies</hi> commendation, <hi>that hee
knew the Scriptures from a child,</hi> ſo it will be thy
condemnation, that thou kneweſt better from a
child, and yet rebelleſt againſt thy light.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the more <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>experimentall</hi> the
light is,<note place="margin">The more reall and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall light men ſin againſt.</note> men ſinne againſt, ſtill the more ſinne; as
when they have learnt it from examples of godly
men, whom they have lived amongſt, or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of Gods dealings with themſelves or
others, and not onely from the word notionally.
To ſinne againſt ſuch light, this addes a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
not onely to ſinne againſt the bare light of
nature, but alſo further, when nature hath beſides
lighted her torch at the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and then when
beyond all this, the reall examples and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made of Gods dealings with a mans ſelfe and
others, ſhall confirme all this, this makes a mans
ſinfulneſſe much more grievous; for as <hi>exempla ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacius
docent quàm praecepta,</hi> ſo the knowledge got
by experiments of mercies or judgements, is of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3413:47"/>
more force and evidence. Knowledge learnt by
experience, is the moſt efficacious. Therefore Chriſt
himſelfe, who knew all things already, yet <hi>learnt</hi>
(in the ſchoole of experience) <hi>by what he ſuffered.</hi>
A little of ſome knowledge diſtill'd out of a mans
owne obſervation, is moſt precious, every drop of
it; therefore the Apoſtle urgeth it on <hi>Timothie,
2 Tim. 3. 14. Continue in the things thou haſt learned,
and beene aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them.</hi> There is a two-fold motive, and both
emphaticall; Firſt, he was <hi>aſſured</hi> in himſelfe; and
ſecondly, that which ſtrengthned that aſſurance,
and was a meanes to worke it, was the example of
the holy Apoſtle, and of his owne Parents, <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of whom thou haſt learned it:</hi> And ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 10.
the Apoſtle againe urgeth his owne example, <hi>Thou
haſt fully knowne my doctrine and manner of life;</hi>
and then alſo brings to his mind the education of
thoſe his godly Parents, who inſtructed him. Hence
alſo, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 10. it is made an aggravation, that
<hi>in the land of uprightneſſe men deale unjuſtly.</hi> Thus
light drawn from the obſervation of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon others, it much aggravates: it is laid
to <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> charge, <hi>Dan. 5. 22. Thou kneweſt all
this, how God dealt with thy father Nebuchadonezer.</hi>
So ſome of you come here, and live in a religious
ſociety, and ſee ſometimes one, ſometimes another
of thy Colleagues turn to Chriſt,<note place="margin">The more ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the light is in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence joyned with a taſte, the greater the ſin.</note> yea haply cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
fellow converted from his evill courſes, and
yet thou goeſt on, this is ſinning againſt a great
light.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the more vigorous, ſtrong, powerfull
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3413:48"/>
the light is that is in thee, and more <hi>ſtirring</hi> in thy
heart, and joyned with a taſte, the greater the ſins
committed againſt it are to be accounted. The more
thou haſt taſted the bitterneſſe of ſinne, and Gods
wrath, and haſt beene ſtung with it as with a <hi>Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice,</hi>
the more thou haſt taſted Gods goodneſſe in
prayer, and in the ordinances, the more of ſuch a
knowledge, and yet ſinneſt the worſe. In the 5. of
<hi>Iohn, 35. Chriſt</hi> aggravates the <hi>Iewes</hi> unbeleefe in
himſelfe, and their preſent hardneſſe, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was
to them, not only a <hi>ſhining,</hi> but alſo a <hi>burning light;</hi>
that is, they had ſuch knowledge engendred by his
miniſtery, as wrought joy and heat, as well as
light; therefore it is added, <hi>they rejoyced therein
for a ſeaſon.</hi> And thus their fall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. is aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it was ſuch a light as had taſting with it.
For to explaine this, you muſt know, that between
<hi>ordinary notionall light,</hi> or that aſſenting to ſpirituall
truths which is common with men, from traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
knowledge living in the Church, that between
it and true ſaving light, or <hi>the light of life,</hi> there is a
middle kind of light, which is more than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conviction men have, and leſſe than ſaving
light: it is a light which leaves alſo ſome impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the affections, makes them feele the <hi>powers
of heaven and hell,</hi> and be affected with them. Now
the more of ſuch light againſt a ſinne, be it drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
or uncleanneſſe, or oppreſſion, and yet
falleſt to it againe, the worſe. For this is a further
degree added to knowledg, and not common to all
wicked men. And therefore as thoſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> who
had not onely common meanes of knowledge,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3413:48"/>
but <hi>miracles</hi> alſo, and yet <hi>beleeved not, Iohn</hi> 12. 17.
ſhall be more condemned; ſo thoſe who have ſuch
taſting knowledg ſet on by the holy Ghoſt (which
is as much as if a miracle were wrought, for it is
above nature, a <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> worke of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>)
And therefore to ſinne againſt ſuch light, and ſuch
onely, is that which makes a man in the next
degree of fitneſſe to ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fiftly, to ſin againſt profeſſed knowledge, is an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
aggravation alſo,<note place="margin">To ſin againſt profeſſed knowledge.</note> and an heavy one. To ſin againſt
a mans owne principles which he teacheth others,
or reproves or cenſureth in others. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. laſt,
<hi>Thoſe that profeſſe they know God, and yet deny him,</hi>
theſe are <hi>moſt abominable</hi> of all others: For theſe
are lyars, and ſo ſinne againſt knowledge as lyars
doe, in the 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 4. ſuch an one is called a <hi>lyar</hi>
in a double reſpect, both in that he ſayes hee hath
that knowledge he hath not, it not being true; and
becauſe alſo he denyes that in deed, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
in word, this is ſcandalous ſinning. So <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 24. the <hi>Iewes beaſting of the law,</hi> and of <hi>having the
forme of knowledge</hi> in their braines, cauſed the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
to blaſpheme,</hi> when they ſaw they lived cleane
contrary thereunto: and therefore a brother that
walkes inordinately, was to be delivered to <hi>Satan,
to learne what it was to blaſpheme, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 20. That
is, to learne to know how evill and bitter a thing it
is, by the torments of an evill conſcience, to live
in ſuch a courſe, as made God and his wayes evill
ſpoken of, as it befell <hi>David</hi> when he thus ſinned.
Yea 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, 11. though they might keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with a heathen, becauſe hee was ignorant,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3413:49"/>
and profeſſed not the knowledge of God; <hi>yet if a
brother,</hi> one that profeſſed, and ſo was to walke by
the ſame rules, did ſinne againſt thoſe principles he
profeſſed, then <hi>keepe him not company:</hi> Thus did
<hi>Saul</hi> ſinne. All the Religion he had and pretended
to in his latter dayes, was <hi>perſecuting witches:</hi> yet
in the end he went againſt this his principle; hee
went to a witch in his great extremitie at laſt. And
thus God will deale with all that are hollow, and
ſinne ſecretly againſt knowledge in the end. Hee
ſuffers them to goe againſt their moſt profeſſed
principles.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are aggravations in generall, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable

                     <p>Fourthly, when thou commoſt to lay hold on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
mercy at death,<note place="margin">At death, knowledg ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt, gives up to more horror and deſpaire.</note> thy knowledge will give thee up

though when it is but newly revealed, it is an help;
yet not made uſe of, turns againſt the ſoul, to wound

us, as alſo becauſe ſuch as ſinne againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
ſin with more preſumption; and the more
preſumption in thy life, the more deſpaire thou art

what brought ſuch trouble, and <hi>roarings like Beares</hi>

for the pardon of them. Therefore thou wilt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3413:51"/>
lye roaring on thy death bed, and that thou <hi>knoweſt

<hi>Qui auget ſcientiam, auget dolorem:</hi> He that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

ſpeaks: for knowledge enlargeth our apprehenſion
of our guilt, and that brings more feare and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Have they no knowledge, who eate up my people?
Yes, there is their feare</hi> (ſayes <hi>David.</hi>) Therefore
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28. after ſinning after knowledge, there <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
not</hi> onely a more <hi>fearfull puniſhment,</hi> but a
more <hi>fearfull expectation</hi> in the parties conſciences.
And this is the <hi>worme in hell,</hi> that gnawes for ever.
Light breeds theſe wormes.</p>
                     <p>But then you will ſay, it is beſt for us to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and to keep our ſelves ſo.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, no: For to <hi>refuſe knowledge</hi> will damn
as much as abuſing it. This you may ſee in <hi>Prov. 1.
23. Ye fooles</hi> (ſayes wiſedome) <hi>you that hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Turne, and I will poure my ſpirit upon you, and
make known my words to you.</hi> Well, ver. 24. <hi>they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi>
and would none of his reproof: Therefore ſayes
God, <hi>I will laugh at your calamitie:</hi> that is, I will
have no pitty, but inſtead of pitty, God will laugh
at you; <hi>and when your feare comes, I will not anſwer,
becauſe ye hated knowledge, ver.</hi> 29. ſo as this is as bad.
There remaines therefore no middle way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3413:51"/>
to extricate thy ſelfe at, and avoid all this, no
remedy but turning unto God: otherwiſe thou canſt
not but be more miſerable than other men; yea and
this muſt be done ſpeedily alſo: For thou having
knowledge, God is quicker in denying thee grace,
and in giving thee up to a reprobate mind, than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, who is ignorant. He will wait upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that knows not his will &amp; waies, twenty, thirty,
forty yeares, as he did upon the children of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
that were borne in the wilderneſſe, and had
not ſeene his wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the red ſea:
but thoſe that had, he ſoone ſware againſt many of
them, <hi>that they ſhould never enter into his reſt. Chriſt</hi>
comes as a <hi>ſwift witneſſe</hi> againſt thoſe to whom the
<hi>Goſpell</hi> is preached, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 5. he makes quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
of the treaty of grace with them. Therefore
few that have knowledge are converted when they
are old, or that lived long under the meanes. And
therefore you that have knowledge, are engaged to
repent, and to turn to God, and to bring your hearts
to your knowledge, and that ſpeedily alſo, or elſe
your damnation will not only be more intolerable
than others, but the <hi>ſentence</hi> of it paſſe out more
quickly againſt you. Therefore as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Ioh.
12. 36. Whilſt you have the light, walk in it:</hi> For that
day of <hi>Grace,</hi> which is very clear and bright, is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a <hi>ſhort one.</hi> And though men may live many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
dayes after, and enjoy the common light of
the ſunne, yet the day of grace, and of gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements
to repent, may be but a ſhort one.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the laſt &amp; moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
aggravation which the

of the Gentiles ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(which in the former
Chapter he had, <hi>verſe</hi> 29.
pronounced <hi>full</hi> before) to
make it fuller yet: <hi>Their ſinning againſt mercies,</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:3413:55"/>
and deſpiſing the riches of Gods goodneſſe, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

whereof, can be better no way ſet off and
illuſtrated unto mens conſciences, than by a
diſplay of the riches of that goodneſſe which
mea ſinne againſt. My purpoſe therefore is to
unlock and carry you into that more common
treaſury of outward mercies, and leade you
through the ſeverall roomes thereof, all which
doe continually <hi>leade</hi> you <hi>unto repentance:</hi> That
then reflecting upon our ungratefull waſte, and
abuſe of ſo many mercies in ſinning, thereby
our ſins, every ſinne, the leaſt, may yet appeare
more ſinfull unto us, <hi>who are leſſe than the leaſt of
all thoſe mercies.</hi> Know then, that beſides that
peculiar treaſure of <hi>unſearchable riches of grace
laid up in Chriſt</hi> (the offer of which neglected
and deſpiſed,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 7.</note> addes yet to all that ſinfulneſſe, a
guilt as farre exceeding all that which ſhall be
ſpoken of, as Heaven exceeds the Earth) There
is another untold Mine of <hi>Riches the Earth is full
of,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 24.</note> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, and the Apoſtle here,
which theſe Gentiles onely heard of, and which
we partake of all as much as they. As there are
<hi>riches of grace</hi> offered to you which can never be
exhauſted; ſo there are <hi>riches of patience</hi> ſpent
upon you, which you will have ſpent out in the
end; the expence of which, caſt up, will alone
amount to an immenſe treaſure, both of guilt in
you, and of wrath in God, as theſe words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3413:55"/>
To helpe you in this account, I will</p>
                  <p>1. In generall, ſhew what <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> or Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering</hi> are in God.</p>
                  <p>2. That there are <hi>riches</hi> of theſe ſpent upon
all the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>3. That theſe all <hi>leade men to repentance.</hi> And
then</p>
                  <p>4. I will expoſtulate with you, and aggravate
your ſinfulneſſe, in going on to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> all theſe by
unrepentance, as the Apoſtle here doth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that God is ſaid here to be <hi>Good,</hi> or
Bountifull: 2. Patient, or <hi>forbearing: 3. Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,</hi>
they ſeeme to note out three degrees
of his common mercies unto men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he is a <hi>good,</hi> or a <hi>bountifull</hi> God: for ſo,
as goodneſſe is here uſed, I exegetically expound
it: For though it be true, that <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
may differ; yet when <hi>riches of goodneſſe</hi> are
ſaid to be communicated, it imports the ſame,
and is all one with <hi>Bounty;</hi> And ſuch is God.
And all thoſe noble and royall qualifications and
properties which concurre to make one truely
<hi>good,</hi> and <hi>bountifull,</hi> doe meet and abound in him,
in all thoſe good things which he doth beſtow;
and are found truly in none but in him: ſo that it
may be truly ſaid, that <hi>there is none good but God,</hi>
as Chriſt ſayes of him.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Bounty,</hi> in the generall, which is in God,
may be thus deſcribed:</p>
                  <p>It is a free, willing, and a large giving of what is
meerly his own, looking for no recompenſe againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3413:56"/>
To explaine this, that you may ſee, that all
theſe conditions are required to true goodneſſe,
and all of them to be found in God onely.</p>
                  <p>1. He that is <hi>Bountifull,</hi> he muſt be a <hi>Giver,</hi>
and Beſtower of <hi>good</hi> things: and all he beſtows,
it muſt be by way of <hi>gift,</hi> not by way of <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi>
unto, or by deſert from the party hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes
all on:<note place="margin">Luke 6. 33.</note> Therefore Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.
33. that <hi>to doe good to thoſe who</hi> have done, or <hi>doe
good to us, is not thank-worthy,</hi> nor is it <hi>Bounty.</hi> But
God is therefore truely <hi>good,</hi> becauſe hee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
meerely, and abſolutely <hi>gives</hi> away all
which he beſtowes: For hee was not, nor can
any way become beholden to any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
nor had formerly received any thing from
them,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 35.</note> which might move him hereunto: ſo <hi>Rom.
11. 35. Who hath firſt given him, that hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
him againe?</hi> Nay untill He gave us a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we were not capable of ſo much as receiving
any good thing from him.</p>
                  <p>2. He who is truly termed <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Bountifull,</hi>
all that he gives away muſt be his <hi>owne;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 1.</note> And ſo
all which <hi>God</hi> beſtowes, it is his <hi>owne.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.
24. 1. The Earth is the Lords.</hi> The ground wee
tread on, the place wee dwell in; Hee is our
Landlord. But is that all? for the houſe may be
the Landlords, when the furniture is the Tenants:
therefore he further addes, <hi>And the fulneſſe of it
is his</hi> alſo: that is, all the things that fill the world,
all the furniture,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 11, 12.</note> and proviſion of it both; all the
<hi>moveables.</hi> (So <hi>Pſal. 50. 11, 12.) The cattell and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3413:56"/>
the fowles upon a thouſand hills are mine,</hi> ſayes hee;
and alſo all the <hi>ſtanding</hi> goods, <hi>the corne and
oile</hi> (which you ſet and plant) <hi>are mine, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 9.
yea and the Pſalmiſt in the ſame 24. Pſalme, adds
further, that <hi>they who dwell therein are his</hi> alſo:
not the houſe and furniture onely, but the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
themſelves. And this, by the moſt ſure,
and moſt ſoveraigne title that can be, better than
that of purchaſe, or inheritance, of and from
another: for he hath <hi>made</hi> them; <hi>All is thine,
becauſe all comes of thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.</note> ſayes the ſame <hi>David,
1 Chron.</hi> 29. 11, 12. And <hi>all things are</hi> not onely
<hi>[of him]</hi> but <hi>[through him] Rom.</hi> 11. 36. that is,
they cannot ſtand nor ſubſiſt without him. Even
Kings, (the greateſt and moſt bountifull of men)
their bounty is but as that of the clouds, which
though they ſhowre down plentifully, yet they
firſt received all from the Earth below them.</p>
                  <p>3. He muſt give <hi>largely,</hi> it is not Bounty elſe.
Now <hi>God</hi> is therefore ſaid to be <hi>rich in goodneſſe,</hi>
becauſe he is <hi>abundant</hi> in it. So we finde it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 5. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 24. in which
it is ſaid, that <hi>the earth is full of his goodneſſe,</hi> and
<hi>his riches;</hi> which we may judge of, by what he
ſayes in the 27. verſe of that 104. Pſalme, of
what an houſe he keepes, and what multitudes he
feeds: <hi>All theſe</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>wait on thee,
that thou mayeſt give them meat, and thou openeſt
thy hand, and they are filled with good.</hi> King <hi>Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus,</hi>
to ſhew his bounty, made a Feaſt to his
chiefe Subjects, but it was but for halfe a yeare,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3413:57"/>
and not to all: ſome few halfe yeeres more would
well nigh have beggard him; but God doth thus
continually. The greateſt and moſt bountifull of
men, when they would expreſſe the largeſt of
their bounty, ſpeake but of <hi>giving halfe of their
Kingdomes,</hi> (ſo <hi>Herod,</hi> and he did but talk ſo too)
But <hi>God</hi> beſtowes whole <hi>worlds,</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes,</hi>
as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 35. and <hi>gives them to
whom he pleaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. He that is <hi>bountifull,</hi> muſt give all he gives
<hi>freely,</hi> and <hi>willingly.</hi> Which, though I put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet may imply two diſtinct things: As firſt,
that he that gives, muſt be a <hi>free agent</hi> in it, who
is at his choice, whether he would give any thing
away or no. The <hi>Sunne</hi> doth much good to the
world, it affords a large light, and even halfe the
world at once is full of its glory: yea and all this
light is its owne, not borrowed, as that of the
Moone and Starres is; yet this <hi>Sunne</hi> cannot be
called <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bountifull,</hi> becauſe it ſends forth
this light <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> and <hi>naturally;</hi> and cannot
chooſe but doe ſo; nor can it draw in its beames.
But <hi>God</hi> is a free giver, he was at his choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would have made the world or no; and
can yet when hee pleaſeth, <hi>with-draw his Spirit
and face,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>and then they all periſh, Pſal.</hi> 104. 29.
Secondly, it muſt be <hi>willing by</hi> alſo: that is, no
way conſtrained, nor by extraction wrung from
him, who is to be called <hi>Bountifull.</hi> A <hi>willing
mind</hi> in matter of bounty, is more <hi>accepted</hi> than
the thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. Now of God it is ſaid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3413:57"/>
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 22. that he <hi>gives</hi> the Kingdomes of the
world <hi>to whom he will,</hi> and none <hi>ſwayes</hi> him, or
<hi>can ſtay his hand, ver.</hi> 35. yea hee gives all away
with <hi>delight.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 31. having ſpoken of
feeding every living thing, and of other the like
works of his goodneſſe, throughout that Pſalme,
hee concludes with this, <hi>God rejoyceth in all his
workes:</hi> that is, doth all the good he doth to his
creatures with delight; It doth him good (as it
were) to ſee the poore creatures feed.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, <hi>looking for no recompence</hi> for the
time to come. This is another requiſite in <hi>Bounty.</hi>
Sayes Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 6. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Luke 6. 34. If you give to receive
againe, as ſinners doe,</hi> this is not <hi>thank-worthy:</hi> but
ver. 35. ſo doth not <hi>your heavenly Father:</hi> For
(ſayes he) <hi>Doe good, and hope for nothing againe,
ſo ſhall you be like your Father,</hi> and then you ſhall
ſhew your ſelves true <hi>children of the [moſt High.]</hi>
In which word, he inſinuates a reaſon why God
gives all thus: becauſe he is ſo great, and ſo High
a God, as nothing wee doe can reach him; as
<hi>David</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal. 16. 2. My goodneſſe extends
not unto thee:</hi> he is too high to receive any benefit
by what we doe. And even that thankfulneſſe he
exacts, he requires it but as an <hi>acknowledgement
of our duty, and for our good, Deut.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for the firſt, namely, what <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
and <hi>bounty</hi> is: and how <hi>God</hi> is truely <hi>good,</hi>
and he <hi>onely</hi> ſo. But this attribute of his, and the
effects of it, he exerciſeth towards all our fellow
creatures, and did to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. But
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3413:58"/>
now to <hi>us ward</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) namely
the ſons of <hi>men,</hi> now fallen, hee extendeth and
manifeſts a further <hi>riches,</hi> namely, of <hi>patience</hi>
and <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> which the <hi>devills</hi> partake not
of, the good Angels and other creatures: that
ſinned not, are uncapable of. For as Chriſt ſayes,
<hi>Luke</hi> 6. 35.<note place="margin">Luke 6. 35.</note> In what he beſtowes on us, <hi>he is kind</hi>
to ſuch, as are <hi>evill and unthankfull. Mercy</hi> is
more than <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> for <hi>mercy</hi> alwaies doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<hi>miſery:</hi> and becauſe all the creatures are
<hi>ſubject</hi> to a <hi>miſery, Rom. 8. 20, 21, 22. of bondage
and vanity,</hi> therefore his <hi>tender mercies are over
all his workes.</hi> But yet <hi>patience</hi> is a further thing
than <hi>mercy,</hi> (as <hi>mercy</hi> is than <hi>goodneſſe</hi>) being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed,
not towards <hi>miſerable</hi> creatures onely,
but towards <hi>ſinners,</hi> and includes in it more three
things further towards them.</p>
                  <p>1. Not only that thoſe perſons he doth good
unto do offend, and injure him; but that himſelf
alſo is exceeding ſenſible of all thoſe wrongs, and
moved by them, and alſo provoked to wrath
thereby; it is not patience elſe. So in the 2. of
<hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. It is not <hi>ſlackneſſe</hi> (ſayes he there:) <hi>God
is not ſlack:</hi> that is, he ſits not in heaven as one of
the Idol gods, that regarded not what acts were
kept here below; or took not to heart mens car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
towards him; but is <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> or <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient;</hi>
that is, he apprehends himſelfe wronged,
is fully ſenſible of it; <hi>is angry with the wicked eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 7. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. 11. he hath much adoe to forbear,
even when he doth forbeare, and letteth them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3413:58"/>
alone; he exerciſeth an attribute, a vertue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, namely, <hi>patience,</hi> in keeping in of
his anger; which is as to <hi>keepe fire</hi> in ones bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, this is not all; he doth not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
forbeare, and reſtraine his anger, but vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
that <hi>time</hi> he forbeares them in, that they
might <hi>repent</hi> in it; and his <hi>mercies,</hi> as meanes <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to repentance.</hi> So it followes in that 2 <hi>Pet.
3. 9. But God is long ſuffering to us-ward,</hi> and his
long ſuffering hath this in it, <hi>not willing that any
ſhould periſh, but come unto repentance.</hi> So alſo
<hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 21. it is called <hi>ſpace to repent.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 2. 21.</note> And all the
bleſſings he vouchſafeth, he gives them as means
and guides to <hi>leade them on to repentance,</hi> as here.
And <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 29.<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 29.</note> Have <hi>patience</hi> with me, and I
will <hi>pay</hi> thee all. That is, give me a longer day
and ſpace to pay the debt in, and be willing to
accept it when I bring it, and let me lye out of
priſon, that I may be enabled to pay it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is yet a further thing in his <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
namely, a <hi>waiting,</hi> and expectation that
men would come in,<note place="margin">Luke 13. 17.</note> and <hi>repent.</hi> So <hi>Luke 13. 17.
Theſe three yeeres have I [come ſeeking] fruit, but
have found none:</hi> There was an expectation, a
longing, a deſire it would bring forth fruit, <hi>Oh
when ſhall it once be,</hi> ſayes God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. laſt?</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, that other attribute of <hi>long
ſuffering,</hi> which is the third, is but as a further
degree of <hi>patience; but patience lengthened out far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that is, when <hi>God</hi> hath beene thus <hi>patient,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:3413:59"/>
hath forborne and waited for their comming in,
and that not for <hi>three yeeres,</hi> but haply <hi>thirty,
forty</hi> yeeres, and ſtill they turne not; his patience
then begins (as we would think) to be (as it were)
worne out, and his anger begins to ariſe, as if he
could forbeare no longer; (as it was towards
that tree, <hi>Why cumbereth it the ground? Cut it
downe</hi>) yet hee goes on to ſpare a man another
yeere, and many more yeares ſtill after that; and
<hi>endureth with much long ſuffering</hi> (as <hi>Rom. 9. 22.)
the veſſels of wrath,</hi> endures to wonderment,
above meaſure, beyond all expectation, all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as it were; this is <hi>long ſuffering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond generall head is, that there are
<hi>[riches]</hi> of this his <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. expended on
us.</p>
                  <p>It is a <hi>rich</hi> goodneſſe, patience and long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
<hi>Rich</hi> in <hi>themſelves,</hi> in regard of their <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi>
as they came from him: and <hi>rich</hi> alſo in
regard of their <hi>precious uſefulneſſe unto us,</hi> as they
may be improved by us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>in themſelves</hi> they are <hi>rich:</hi> if wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what is expended, all that while, Hee layes
out, not ſimply his <hi>power</hi> to ſuſtain and uphold
all things, and to maintaine us freely: ſo to doe
is nothing to him. For whilſt he doth but ſo, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
goes out of purſe, or is detracted from him;
(as I may ſo ſpeak) he feeles not the expence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of power, providence, &amp;c. All this coſt him
but words: For he <hi>upholds all, creates all by the
word of his power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. And thus to maintaine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3413:59"/>
the Angels, and to have maintained all mankinde
before they fell, had beene no more. But (my
brethren) when now he maintains us ſinners, not
ſimply <hi>power</hi> goes forth from him, but his <hi>glory</hi>
is expended, and taken from him, and for the
while waſted, detracted from; he loſeth, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
every day infinitely by us, and he is ſenſible
of it; every ſinne takes glory from him, <hi>robs</hi> him,
as he himſelfe complaines: that he <hi>who made the
world, upholds it,</hi> (keeps it together, as the hoops
doe the barrell, it would fall to pieces elſe, to
nothing; <hi>in whom all live,</hi> as fiſhes in the Sea, yea
upon whom all live) that He ſhould live <hi>unknown,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 10.</note>
unthought of, unſerved; yea diſgraced, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in the world, and have this world loſt to
him, as it were; and ſinne, the Devill, wicked
men, to have all the glory from him, to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to carry the whole world afore them: This
ſpends upon him, he had need of Riches to doe
this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider the multitude of ſinners,
that thus ſpend, and live upon theſe riches, no
leſſe than all the world: Hee had need of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of patience in him: He forbeares not one,
but all and every one. We looke upon one man,
and ſeeing him very wicked, wee wonder God
cuts him not off; we wonder at our ſelves, that
God did not cut us off before this, when once
our eyes are opened: nay then caſt your eyes
over all the world, and ſtand amazed at Gods
forbearance towards it. Take the richeſt man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3413:60"/>
that ever was, to have millions of men in his
debt, it would undoe him ſoone. All the world
are in Gods debt, and run ſtill in debt every day
more and more, and yet he breaks not, nay breaks
not them.</p>
                  <p>Nay thirdly, to manifeſt this abundance yet
more, conſider not onely the multitude hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares,
but the time he hath done it: to forbeare
much, and to forbeare it long: he hath forborne,
and beene out of purſe from the beginning of the
world, ſince men were upon the face of the earth,
five thouſand yeeres and a halfe already; and
how long it is yet to the day of Judgement, wee
know not: And yet ye ſee, He is as <hi>patient,</hi> and
as <hi>bountifull</hi> now in the latter dayes of the
world, as he was at the firſt. Did that greateſt
Convert that ever was, that had not lived paſt
thirty yeeres in his ſinfull eſtate (for he was young
when he held the ſtoners clothes that ſtoned <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>)
and <hi>yet was the chiefeſt of ſinners,</hi> did he yet
(as himſelfe ſayes) thinke himſelfe <hi>a patterne of
long ſuffering,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 16.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. though it a great
matter God ſhould forbeare ſo long? what is the
whole world then? if he, being but one ſmall
poore veſſell, was ſo richly laden with the riches
of Gods patience, how is this great bark of the
world then fraught, that hath gone over ſo vaſt a
gulfe of time? how much of theſe his riches
have been laden in it?</p>
                  <p>And then fourthly, adde to this the expenſive
prodigality of all theſe ſinners in all ages; every
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3413:60"/>
ſinner ſpends ſomething, and how laviſh are men
of oathes? <hi>All the thoughts of mens hearts from
their youth up, they are evill, and onely evill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually:</hi>
and how much then hath every man
ſpent him? every ſin is a debt.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, this is a <hi>rich</hi> goodneſſe
and patience in regard of the <hi>preciouſneſſe</hi> and
<hi>uſefulneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>precious,</hi> in regard of what all theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations
of his goodneſſe and forbearance
coſt,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 1.</note> even the blood of his Sonne, <hi>who as a Lord
hath bought and purchaſed all wicked men;</hi> their
lives, and their reprivall, all that time that here
they live; and all the bleſſings and diſpenſations
of goodneſſe, which here they do enjoy. Chriſts
mediation ſo far prevailes with God for all the
world, that it puts a ſtop to the preſent procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of juſtice, which otherwiſe had ſaid of all,
<hi>that day thou ſinneſt, thou dyeſt.</hi> So that as Chriſt
may be called the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of God;
ſo alſo the <hi>patience</hi> and the <hi>long ſuffering</hi> of God.
For, for his ſake, and through his meanes, it is
exerciſed: God would not ſhew a drop of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but for his Sonne. Which, I take, ſtrongly
and clearly intimated, in that dealing of his, with
the Jewes, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 20. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi>
33. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. Immediately after God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

whereof, God the Father in his government was
to proceed) and after they had tranſgreſſed it, He
there declares, that he could not <hi>goe with them:</hi>

day. And is not ſo much time of eaſe from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
infinite mercy? Caſt but your thoughts
upon the Angels that fell, that have been in hell
from the firſt moment of their ſinning, doe but
thinke with your ſelves, what they would give to
have ſo much time, cut out of that eternity, they
are to run through, &amp; to have it ſet apart for eaſe,
and to be void of torment; if the rich man in
hell, made it ſuch a great ſuit, and counted it ſo
great a favour to have but one drop of water
(which could but for a little while (ſcarce more
than a moment) have cooled and eaſed, not his
whole body, but the tip of his tongue only) how
much more would he have thought it mercy, to
have lived ſo many yeares againe as he had done
free from torment? what is it then for thee, to
live ſo many yeares free from the falling of the
leaſt drop of that wrath, whereof the full vialls
ſhould have been poured out many yeares agoe?
The ſame Law was out againſt us, which was out
againſt the Angels;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>That day thou eateſt, thou
ſhalt dye the death:</hi> what put the difference? the
Apoſtle tells us, his <hi>long ſuffering to us ward:</hi> not
to them: for in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 4. he had told us that
hee <hi>ſpared</hi> not the <hi>Angels which fell,</hi> but poſted,
and threw them into hell, as ſoone as they had
ſinned.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, But further, in the 6. place; Is this all?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3413:61"/>
hath it beene barely a time of eaſe given thee, a
time of reprivall? No, it hath beene more, <hi>ſpace
to repent,</hi> and ſo to obtaine thy pardon in, <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 21. And as it hath beene more than eaſe of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto thee, ſo alſo conſider it hath beene
more than ſlackneſſe in him that hath afforded it
to thee, as the Apoſtle there doth tell us. It is
not that he hath tooke no notice of thy offending
him, but he is ſenſible of every idle thought, of
every oath, vaine word, and as the Scripture tels
us, <hi>he is pained at the very heart,</hi> in ſo much as <hi>he
repents</hi> that ever he made thee;<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> he <hi>is angry with
thee every day</hi> thou riſeſt, every time hee lookes
on thee, when ever he meets thee going into the
Taverne to be drunk, the whorehouſe to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
when he meets thee reeling in the ſtreets,
he hath much adoe to forbeare killing thee, as
he had to forbeare <hi>Moſes</hi> when he met him in
the Inne: He is ready to have a blow at thee, and
it ſhould not need be any great ſtroake, or fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his arme about; if he did but blow on thee,
thou wert conſumed. To ſuffer thee to live, doth
therefore coſt him much riches of patience; but
to cut thee off, need coſt him nothing: hee can
doe that with eaſe. But further, all is joyned with
a <hi>willingneſſe</hi> that thou ſhouldſt <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>not
periſh,</hi> as that place tells thee. It were much
mercy for a Traytor to be reprived, to have a
leaſe of his life for twenty yeeres, though there
were no hope nor meanes of obtaining his finall
pardon after that time ſpent, and this alſo, though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3413:62"/>
moneth, a yeere? what others, who have laine
gaſping, would have given a world for time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
(as I have heard one crying day and
night (<hi>call time againe</hi>) or if not then, oh what
in Hell:</p>
                  <p>The third thing I am to ſhew, is, that all this
<hi>goodneſſe, patience,</hi> and <hi>forbearance,</hi> is afforded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you as a meanes, and helpes to bring you
to repentance.<note place="margin">Acts 17. 26, 27, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Acts 17. 26, 27, 28. God</hi> (ſayes
the Apoſtle there) <hi>hath allotted</hi> to men, both their
<hi>times</hi> to live in, and alſo their places of abode and
<hi>habitations,</hi> all richly furniſhed with bleſſings to
uphold their lives &amp; beings. And to what end are
both theſe thus afforded? That they <hi>might ſeek
the Lord, if by groping after him</hi> (even as men in
the darke) <hi>they might haply finde him.</hi> But men
being in the darke, and deſtitute of guides to
bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto God, may yet be as far of finding
him as ever. Therefore adde but the words of
my text, to what the Apoſtle ſayes there, and we
ſee, that this goodneſſe of God takes us by the
hand, and <hi>leads us to repentance;</hi> to turne from
ſinne unto God, and ſo to finde him. And thus
lead are you unto God, by the help of three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
guides, which each after other ſweetly leade
you, and point you out to this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, all this goodneſſe beares witneſſe to
your hearts of a gracious hand that extends it ſelf
in all theſe; therefore in that 17. of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
he ſubjoynes, <hi>God is not far off any of us.</hi> That
there is a good God beſtowes all things on you,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3413:62"/>
is a thought lyes at next doore of all his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
not far off. Yea <hi>they all</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle
to the ſame Gentiles,<note place="margin">Acts 14. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Acts 14. 16.) doe beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of him,</hi> (though they <hi>went on in their owne
wayes) yet</hi> (ſayes he there) <hi>God left not himſelfe
without witneſſe;</hi> that is, an impreſſion on their
hearts that his good hand beſtowed all on them,
when <hi>he filled their hearts with foode and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, His goodneſſe having brought thus
God to mens thoughts, then your owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
take you, and leade you downe into your
ſelves, and beare witneſſe, that you by walking
in your owne wayes, doe nothing but provoke
and offend this good God. So Rom. 2. 15.</p>
                  <p>And then thirdly, there is an indelible princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
common to all men to <hi>love thoſe who love
them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> which after the two former have brought
you hitherto, point, you to <hi>Repentance,</hi> as the
concluſion. <hi>[Shall we goe on to ſinne againſt this
good, ſo good? returne evill for good?]</hi> Is not this
a naturall neceſſary conſequent out of all theſe,
to ſay as they, <hi>Let us therefore feare the Lord, who
giveth us the early and the latter raine,</hi>

5. 26, 27? And though men are ſaid not <hi>to know
this,</hi> in the text, yet the meaning is, they doe not
throughly and effectually conſider thus much, ſo
as thereby to be brought to Repentance, yet
however there is ſuch a witneſſe of all this in all
mens hearts, and thus are they led on unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
would they ſee their way and follow
their guide.</p>

The uſe ſhall be an uſe of expoſtulation (as
here the Apoſtle carryes it) with men ſinfull and
impenitent, for going on to ſinne againſt all this
mercy; together with an aggravation of their
ſinfulneſſe hereby. Men, if young, doe uſually
take the advantage of this their precious time,
(which out of ſo much long ſuffering is vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
them) and of all thoſe precious opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and bleſſings they enjoy, to improve them
onely, in reaping and gathering in to themſelves
the pleaſures of ſinne; making the time of youth
their harveſt of ſinning, and yet thinke to eſcape
by repenting, afterwards: and then when old,
after they have already enjoyed a long and a
faire Sunſhine day to turne to God in, and to
have ſowne much ſeed to the Spirit, the comfort
whereof they might now have reaped; yet as
they have altogether neglected ſo to doe all their
youth, ſo they goe on to doe ſo ſtill, whilſt they
ſee they have any day left, be it never ſo neare
the ſetting; and doe chooſe rather deſperately
to venture their eſtate in the world to come, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the riches of his mercy pardoning, (though
without all care and endeavour to change their
hearts or lives) upon the experience they have
had of the riches of his mercy forbearing them
in this world, thinking to finde him the ſame in
both. With all ſuch, let me reaſon a little, and
from the <hi>riches of Gods goodneſſe, patience, &amp;c.</hi>
ſpent upon them, at once expoſtulate with them,
for their impenitency, and aggravate to them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3413:63"/>
their ſinfulneſſe, and alſo, if poſſible, prevail with
them to goe on to deſpiſe it thus no longer. And
if there be any principle of common ingenuity,
any ſparke (I doe not ſay of grace, but of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of nature) left unextinguiſht, me thinkes it
ſhould affect you, and doe ſome good on youere
I have done.</p>
                  <p>And to that end, conſider a little, and compare
together Gods loving kindneſſes towards you,
and your unkind dealings towards him.</p>
                  <p>To begin at the very beginning of thy being:
how much riches of goodneſſe were there laid
and buried in thy foundation? when the firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſtone was laid, when thou wert made a man,
(beſides the coſt which hath beene ſpent upon
this building ſince) and, curſed as thou art, even
that very foundation was laid in bloody <hi>iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
in which thou wert <hi>conceived;</hi> and the very
materialls of ſoule and body, thou conſiſteſt of,
being tempered with ſinne,<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>like the ſtone in the

                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider how but the other day thou were
meere nothing, and when an infinite number that
never were nor ſhall be, were in as great a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of being as thou, (for when he made this
world, he could have laid it aſide wholly, and
created millions of otherworlds) yet he choſe
thee to have a roome in this, but one world, (for
he means to make no more) and this world could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3413:64"/>
have ſtood without thee, and did before thou
wert, and ſhall doe when thou art gone: yet he
called thee forth out of nothing, and by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power, bade thee ſtand forth when there
was no need of thee. I ſay he choſe thee to have
a being: for as there is an election of things that
are to ſalvation, ſo out of things that were not
unto being. And wretch that thou art, if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteſt
not, thou deſtroyeſt what God hath
made, and hadſt better have kept nothing ſtill,

but his footſteps. And thy body the other peece,

better have beene a toad, or ſerpent, the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt

                  <p>Thirdly, being a man, haſt thou all thy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

wrote them all in his booke, Pſal.</hi> 139. 16. if he had
left out an eye in his common-place booke, thou
hadſt wanted it; is not that a mercy? aske the
blinde. If thou hadſt wanted thoſe windows to
looke out at, thy body would have beene a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
the world a priſon. If a Tongue (<hi>which is
thy glory</hi>) or an eare, thou hadſt lived among
men, as a beaſt among men. And yet when God
gave thee all theſe, what did he but put weapons
into an enemies hand? for haſt thou not uſed all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3413:65"/>
theſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>as weapons of unrighteouſneſſe?</hi> Inſomuch
as <hi>the tongue,</hi> but <hi>one member,</hi> is called <hi>a world of

not, thou hadſt better (as Chriſt ſayes) have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

thou wert a framing) what a ſtately palace hath
he brought thee into, [the world] which thou
findeſt prepared, and ready furniſht with all
things for thy maintenance, as <hi>Canaan</hi> was to the

and conſider how many dayes of payment have
been ſet, and how many promiſes made, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

light of knowledge dawne in thy heart, but thou
beganſt to fight againſt him; and thy firſt
thoughts to this day have beene onely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
evill. And then (haply) in thy younger
yeares, before thou hadſt taſted of the pleaſures
of ſinne, he gave thee an inkling, by meanes of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3413:67"/>
thy education, of his goodneſſe towards thee,
and of that happineſſe to be liad in him, and thou
hadſt the firſt offer of him, ere thy tender yeares
were poyſoned by the world; and he hath dealt
with thee againe and againe, both by his Word
and Spirit; not <hi>waited</hi> onely, but <hi>wooed</hi> thee,
and hath beene a ſuiter to thy heart long: and I
appeale to your hearts, how many promiſes you
have made him, of turning from all your rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to him, after ſuch a Sermon, which was
brought powerfully home: in ſuch a ſickneſſe,
and in ſuch a ſtrait, thy conſcience knowes full
well: And ſtill God hath made tryall of thee,
and given thee longer day; and though thou haſt
broke with him againe and againe, yet he hath
forborne thee againe and againe, and hath waited
this twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, ſixty years, when
thou ſhouldeſt come in, and be as good as thy

and wonder, and ſtand confounded at the
riches of his long ſuffering, that after ſo many
yeares expence, and promiſes broken by thee,
expectations failed in him, and many mockeries
of him, after all this he is yet willing to accept of
the remainder, if thou wouldſt <hi>ſpend the reſt of

as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 3.</note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3. even to loſe

further riches on thee than ever yet thou ſaweſt,
or art able to conceive: yea and all this, when

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither, ſeventhly, hath it beene barely and
ſimply an act of <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>forbearance,</hi> though
joyned with this willingneſſe, thou ſhouldſt not
periſh; or meerely a permiſſive act of ſuffering
thee to live. But God ſhewes forth yet more
riches of goodneſſe joyned with this long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
<hi>in him ye live, and move, and have your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
and doſt thou live in him onely? nay thou
liveſt on him alſo, upon his coſt and charges;
<hi>I have hung upon thee</hi> (ſayes <hi>David) from my
mothers wombe.</hi> And conſider what thy life is,
that of ſo ſmall a bottome, he ſhould ſpin out ſo
long a thred! had hee not drawne it out of his
owne power, as the ſpider doth her web out of
her owne bowels, it had beene at an end the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
minute; to maintaine that <hi>radicall moiſture,</hi>
that <hi>oyle</hi> that feeds the lampe, and light of thy
life, that <hi>radicale balſamum,</hi> this is as great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
as the maintaining the <hi>oyle in the cruze</hi> of
the poore famiſhed widow. And further yet;
hath he maintained thee onely? Nay more, hath
he not defended thee, tooke thy part, protected
thee, tooke thee under his wing, as the hen doth

dangers thy life hath been expoſed unto? Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3413:68"/>
how many wayes, ere this, hadſt thou been
ſnatcht away out of the land of the living? Is
thy caſe, the caſe of the <hi>figtree</hi> onely, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we mentioned, that when God cryed, <hi>Cut
it downe,</hi> another cryed, <hi>ſpare it?</hi> but there have
beene many have cryed, <hi>Cut thee downe,</hi> and God
hath cryed, <hi>ſpare Thee:</hi> there is never a minute,
but the devills would have had a blow at thy
life, as he longed to have had at <hi>Iohs.</hi> That thou,
a poore lump of fleſh, ſhouldſt walke through,
and in the midſt of ſuch an hoſt of fierce and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
enemies, whoſe hearts are ſwelled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
at thee, and God ſhould ſay to them all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thee, as he did to <hi>Laban</hi> concerning <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
Touch not this man.</hi> And yet if thou wert not
liable to their malice and power, yet conſider
how many dangers and caſualties, beſides, thou
haſt beene kept in, and from; as falls, drowning,
killing many wayes; how often have the arrows
of death come whisking by thee, took away thoſe
next thee, (haply of thy kindred, brother, ſiſter,
yoke-fellow, of the ſame houſe, family with thy
ſelfe) and yet have miſſed thee? And if we look
no farther than theſe dayes of mortality we have
lived in; two great plagues in this Kingdome,
how have the moſt of us all here ſurvived, and
now the third is increaſing and growing upon us?
To have our lives in ſuch <hi>deare yeares</hi> of time,
when to <hi>have our life for a prey</hi> is mercy enough,
as <hi>Ieremy</hi> told <hi>Baruch!</hi> that theſe arrows ſhould
flye round about us, over our heads, and miſſe us!
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3413:69"/>
that Gods arreſts ſhould ſeize upon men, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
talking with us, and ſpare us! how often,
many other wayes, hath thy neck been upon the
block, and the axe held over, and yet hath fallen
beſides! To goe no farther than thy own body,
the humours thereof, if God ſhould not reſtraine
them, would overflow and drowne it, as the
waters would the earth, if God ſhould not ſay
to them, <hi>ſtay your proud waves.</hi> And when in a
ſickneſſe they have been let out, yet God hath
kept a ſluce, that ſo much ſhould break forth, and
no more, which ſhould purge, and waſh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and make it more healthfull, as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of <hi>Nilus</hi> doth. And when then thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
hath been brought low and weake, and like
a crazy rotten ſhip in a ſtorme, taking in water on
all ſides, ſo that all the Phyſitians in the world
could not have ſtopt thoſe Leakes; yet hee hath
rebuked wind and ſea, hath careened, mended
thee, and launched thee into the world againe,
as whole, as ſound, and ſtrong as ever; and God
hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Iob 33.</note> as <hi>Iob.</hi> 33. that <hi>Thou ſhouldſt not dye.</hi>
In a word, if thou conſider but what thy life is,
and the dangers it is ſubject to, thou wilt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it as great a wonder to preſerve it, as to ſee
a glaſſe, that hath beene in continuall uſe, gone
through many hands, and hath had many knocks,
and falls, to be kept for forty, fifty, ſixty yeeres
whole and unbroken: God hath carryed <hi>thy life
in his hand,</hi> as it were a candle in a paper lanthorn
in a ſtrong windy night, and kept it from being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3413:69"/>
extinct, when as wee often ſee in many, that a
little cold comes but in at a little cranny, and
<hi>blowes their candle out,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>And eightly, how have theſe yeeres and
hours of thy time been filled up with goodneſſe?
and with how many comforts? For a Traytor
to live, though but upon bread and water all
his dayes, what favour is it? and ſo hadſt thou
lived all this time, never ſo miſerably, though
<hi>all thy dayes thou hadſt eaten thy bread in darkneſſe,
and hadſt had much ſorrow with thy ſickneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 17.</note> (as
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks.) Some there are, who, as <hi>Iob</hi>

this is infinite mercy. Even whatſoever is on this
ſide Hell,<note place="margin">Lamen. 3. 22.</note> is mercy. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22. ſay they in the

mercies are ſhewne us, <hi>that we are not conſumed,
becauſe his mercies are renewed every morning.</hi> If
at the brink of hell, and not in, it is mercy. But
hath he not all this while <hi>filled thy heart with food
and gladneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14. 17.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17?
It were infinite to goe over the particular kinds of
common comforts, which God vouchſafes men

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3413:72"/>
thy ſelfe; as thy reliefe in many ſtreights, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in many buſineſſes; He <hi>workes all our works
in us and for us,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. hath he
not taken ſuch ſpeciall care and providence of
thee, as if hee had regarded no man elſe in the

                  <p>And now when thou haſt conſidered all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke
thy ſelfe withall a little of thy dealings
towards him: what have beene the effects and
fruits of all this goodneſſe? hold up thy head
man, looke God in the face. It is well yet, that
ſhame begins to cover thee. How hath that his
patience and long ſuffering, vouchſafing thee
ſpace to repent, wrought with thee? how nigh
to repentance hath it brought thee? Such is the
perverſeneſſe of mans nature, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 11.</note> that <hi>becauſe ſentence againſt an evill

God defers puniſhing, they defer repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
thou thinkeſt to ſpend the moſt precious
of thy time and ſtrength in ſinning, and give God
the dreggs, the bottome, the laſt ſands, thy
dotage, which thy very ſelfe and friends are
weary of, and all theſe bleſſings and comforts
which God hath vouchſafed thee, how haſt thou
uſed them againſt him? This oyle which ſhould
have beene fuell to thy thankfulneſſe, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the fire of thy luſts, and thy <hi>luſts have
conſumed them all, Iames</hi> 4. The riches hee hath
given, thou haſt made Idols of, and ſacrificed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3413:72"/>
thy deareſt, morning, daily thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
unto, as God complaines, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. from the
15. and ſo on: [His meat] (as at the 29. ver. he
calls it) thou ſacrificedſt to <hi>thy belly, which thou
haſt made</hi> thy God; thy ſtrength to women;
the wealth hee hath given you, you have made
uſe of, but to live at a high rate of ſinning, and to
procure the ſweeteſt bits, the daintieſt and moſt
coſtly ſinnes; The edge of that ſword of power
God hath put into thy hand, thou haſt turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him and his, haply both his Children and
Miniſters; ſo that God, by giving thee all theſe,
hath but made thee more able to offend him, and
hath ſtrengthned an enemy, and by ſparing thee
thus long, hath but made thee more bold to doe
it; all his mercyes have but fortifyed thy heart
againſt him; <hi>Doe ye requite the Lord thus, ye foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
people and unkind?</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> expoſtulates the

                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6. as Chriſt ſaid to the Jewes, <hi>For
which of all my good workes doe yee ſtone me?</hi> So
ſay I to you, for which of all his mercies is it, ye
ſinne againſt him? what, to fight againſt him
with his owne weapons? to betray all he gives
you into the devills, his enemies hands? <hi>What
iniquity did you ever finde in him,</hi> thus to deale?
God will one day thus expoſtulate his cauſe with
you, and <hi>heape coales of fire upon all your heads,</hi>
(if that you turne not) becauſe you have <hi>rendred
him evill for good:</hi> and all theſe mercies thus

with you out of the Text, and what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  <p>Conſider, firſt, what it is thou doeſt; whileſt
thus thou goeſt on, thou art a <hi>Deſpiſer of the
Riches of his goodneſſe:</hi> that which is oppoſite to
goodneſſe, muſt needs be tranſcendently evill.
What, <hi>art thou evill, becauſe God is good?</hi> and ſo
much the more evill, by how much the more
he is good, ſurely there muſt needs be an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
treaſure of wickedneſſe in thee, which
will alſo cauſe in the end a treaſure of wrath in
him; what and ſinne againſt mercy, patience,
long ſuffering, added to goodneſſe? of all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
as the richeſt to the moſt glorious; for
it is that he glories in: in the abuſing of which,
therefore he thinkes himſelfe moſt debaſed: of
all attributes the tendereſt: what, kick againſt
<hi>his bowels?</hi> ſo are his mercies called: canſt hit
him no where elſe but there? to deſpiſe a mans
wiſdome, power, learning, is not ſo much as to
deſpiſe his love; what canſt thou imagine will
become of thee, when thou commeſt to dye?
what is it thou wilt then come to plead and cry
for? O mercy, mercy; why wretch that thou
art, it is mercy thou haſt ſinned againſt. Riches
of mercy and patience abuſed; turnes into fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
I may allude to that ſpeech, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 25.
If a man ſinne againſt his brother,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>the Iudge

                  <p>Well, if thou goeſt on thus to doe ſo ſtill,
thou haſt a <hi>hard heart;</hi> it argues the greateſt
hardneſſe of all other; that is the ſecond. You
uſe not (however it comes to paſſe) to deale
thus with the worſt of men, ſinner like to your
ſelves; but to them that love you, you tender
love againe, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 33. and will you deale ſo
with God? <hi>Is it a ſmall thing to weary men, but
you muſt weary God alſo?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay 7. 13.</note> ſayes <hi>Eſay,</hi> 7. 13. Hee
thought it infinitely leſſe to abuſe men than God;
but you carry your ſelves as men, to men, but
as devills towards God; herein ye have not the
hearts of men in you; not principles of common

                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 6.
the ſpirit of man breakes, melts under kindneſſe;
beaſts indeed yee uſe to prick with goades, but
the cords of a man are the cords of love; no

                  <p>There is a third conſideration the text ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts,
to ſhew the fearfulneſſe of thy ſin in this

ſinning and in impenitency, by deſpiſing his
goodneſſe, to treaſure up wrath againſt the day
of wrath; to ſin againſt mercy, of all other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
wrath; thou muſt pay treaſures, for
treaſures ſpent. As thou laviſhly ſpendeſt riches
of mercy, ſo God will recover riches of glory
out of thee: God will not loſe by thee, but will
reckon with thee in wrath for <hi>every offer</hi> of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
ſpent; for every ſand of long ſuffering that
runs out, hee drops in a drop of wrath into his
Vialls, and it will prove a treaſure, ſuch a treaſure
as ſhall bring in an eternall revenue of glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, of all his glory loſt, and riches ſpent,
with advantage; ſuch a treaſure, as will aske an
eternity of time to be ſpent upon thee, and yet be
never emptied or made leſſe; and the longer thou
goeſt on, the greater heap it will ſwell unto. And
doſt thou know and conſider how faſt this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
fills, and how much the longer thou goeſt on
to adde to it, ſtill the more thou addeſt, ſtill the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3413:74"/>
laſt yeere more than all the yeeres before? every
minutes impenitency adding to this heape and
ſumme, as new figures added in a ſumme uſe to
doe; the firſt is but one, the ſecond makes it ten,
the third an hundred, the fourth a thouſand, and
what a ſumme will this grow to?</p>
                  <p>Ay but thou wilt ſay, Tuſh, I am in proſperity,
in health, wealth, and eaſe, and to day ſhall be as

12. Well, but fourthly, conſider out of the text,
that there will come a day at laſt, the morrow
whereof will be a <hi>day of wrath:</hi> It is treaſuring up
now, but is not brought forth till the day of
wrath, till which day thou mayeſt goe on and
proſper, as <hi>Iob</hi> giving us the reaſon why wicked
men proſper here, ſayes, Chap. 21. They are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to the day of wraths,</hi> in the plurall, becauſe
treaſures are laid up againſt then; thou art yet
ſpared, becauſe thy ſins are not yet full, and that
Treaſure is not full, as the ſins of the <hi>Amorites</hi>
were not; and all this thy preſent proſperity fits
thee but for hell. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. they are ſaid to
be veſſells <hi>fitted for deſtruction,</hi> by long ſuffering.
And ſo <hi>Nahum</hi> tells us, they are but as <hi>ſtubble</hi>
laid out in the Sunne a drying, till it be <hi>fully dry,
Nahum</hi> 1. 10. that it may burne the better; and
like grapes that are let to hang in the Sunſhine till
they be ripe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 16. and ſo thou for the
<hi>winepreſſe of Gods wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thy ſenſeleſſe heart may hap to ſay, I ſee
no ſuch thing, and theſe are but threats, I thinke
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3413:75"/>
ſo; therefore it is ſaid in the Text, that it is a
<hi>Treaſure;</hi> which, as Treaſures uſe to be, is hid
till that day comes, &amp; then <hi>revealed,</hi> as the words
have it. For though thou ſeeſt not this day a
comming, yet God who ſits in heaven, ſees thy
day a comming, as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 13. who
is therefore ſaid to ſee it, becauſe himſelfe ſees it
not; and it is a comming faſter than thou art
aware of it,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 3. Damnation ſlumbereth not,</hi>
though thou dreameſt not of it; <hi>lingreth not:</hi> as
an hue and cry, it is ſent out, and is on its courſe,
and will in the end overtake thee, and that when

when thou art aſleepe, yet dreameſt not of it,
2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. when thou art leaſt prepared for it,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 5.</note> as
in the old world, when they were eating and
