         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow <hi>I</hi> have by Gods bleſſing
obtained (that which you
can witneſſe <hi>I</hi> have ſeriouſly
laboured after) a thrice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
yeares experience in this deſpicable,
but comfortable employment of teaching
Schoole; I think it not amiſſe to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the world, what method I have
hitherto uſed, and which <hi>I</hi> reſolve to
continue, ſo long as God ſhall enable me
to undergoe this profeſſion of a Schoole-Maſter,
which at firſt I undertook, and
have ever ſince perſiſted in, by your
encouragement.</p>
            <p>How far this <hi>New Diſcovery</hi> is
improved, ſince I made it at <hi>Rother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and afterwards writ it out at <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Humbie,</hi> whileſt <hi>I</hi> lived more reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
in the houſe of that Noble Knight,
<hi>Sir William Brownelwoe,</hi> (whom I
<pb facs="tcp:61977:3"/>
think my ſelf ever bound to honour for
for his ſingular and undeſerved favours
to me in many particulars) <hi>I</hi> refer it to
you to conſider. For as you ſometimes
then peruſed it in Manuſcript, ſo I hope
you will (at your leiſure) look upon it
now in print, and not like it much worſe,
then formerly.</p>
            <p>For I may truly ſay, that beſides what
I have obſerved by reading ſundry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
treating of this ſubjest, or gained
by frequent and familiar converſe with
men of known abilities, both in City
and Country. I have profited moſt in this
<hi>Art of teaching,</hi> by my Scholars; who
have been my daily inſtructers, how to
ſuit my method to their ſeveral capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And of all that ever I have taught
either in publick Schoole, or in my own,
or others houſes, in more private manner,
I have been beholding moſt to my <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Scholars, who as they are generally
quick-ſpirited, and forward to learn,
where the way is eaſy to them; ſo are
they ſoon apt to flag and be diſcouraged,
when any difficulties appeare in their
<pb facs="tcp:61977:3"/>
way. For their ſakes therefore, (who by
reaſon of many Schooles were ſometimes
occaſioned to remove from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
I was enforced to facilitate the
most common way of teaching, according
to what you ſee, I have here endeavoured
in theſe ſmall Treatiſes.</p>
            <p>In the publiſhing whereof I beſeech
you, that I may not offend in making uſe
of your name, as well as my Maſters; for
as I was inſtructed by him at the School,
ſo I was by your means ſent, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for in the Vniverſity; and though I
can never be able to requite your care and
pains on my behalf, yet I have long deſired,
even whileſt you are both living, to teſtify
to the world, that I am not forgetful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
of your great benefits. If what I
have here done be liking to your ſelfe, I
ſhall leſſe need to care how others cenſure
me, or it; Foraſmuch as you have known
me ſince my firſt ſtudies, and are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
able to judge of a way to come by
learning, as having been your ſelf well
methodized in your youth, and attained
to that perfection in all kinde of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:61977:4"/>
which many do much admire, but
few can hope to exceed. But I know to
whom I write, and therefore I will not
adventure into an Ocean of what may be
ſaid of your demerits, eſpecially to mee

to your acceptance, as a Teſtimony of

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is yet a queſtion amongſt
Schoole-boyes, and not
likely to be haſtily by
them decided, <hi>whether K.
Alexander was more bound
to Philip his Father, that begat him, or
his Master Ariſtotle that inſtructed

unrequitable Benefits. Should I
therefore not acknowledge that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
good, which with many co-partners
I obtained by your care

worſe then <hi>ungatefull.</hi> And what
token of thankfulneſſe can I tender,

ſmall Manual, which moſt nearly
concernes <hi>the profeſſion of a Schoole-Maſter;

of good attending it,</hi> to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
as well as others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61977:5"/>
For 1. If we look at the benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
wherein can we better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
our time and ſtudy, then in
traing up of children to become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
inſtruments of much good
in both? Nay, ſhould a man but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſpect himſelf, he may finde
it very profitable to augment his
learning, and not a little advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to the increaſe of his yearely
Revenues.</p>
            <p>2. What more pleaſing variety
can there be, then that of childrens
diſpoſitions and fanſies? what better
Recreation, then to read and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of ſo many ſundry ſubjects,
as we meet with in ordinary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours?
Beſides, the delight which
is to be taken by our Scholars ready
progreſſe in a conſtant even way,
will far exceed all care and toyle
that can be beſtowed in helping
them to profit.</p>
            <p>3. Should I goe about by thoſe
millions of Arguments that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
<pb facs="tcp:61977:5"/>
(as Voluntiers) to maintain
the lawfulneſſe of this calling, as
commanded by God, continued in
all ages, practiſed by the well-learned
and truly vertuous, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by all good men, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and encouraged by moſt noble
Princes, and religiouſly diſpoſed
people; oppoſed onely by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Gods truth, and moſt diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
by perſons that are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(for want of breeding) either
debauched, or ignorant. I might
write a larger Volume, and to leſſer
purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But alas, we that wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the burden of School-teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
can tell by our own experience,
how laborious it is both to minde
and body, to be continually intent
upon the work, and how irkſome it
is (eſpecially to a man of a quiet
temper) to have ſo many unwilling
provocations unto paſſion; what
good parts for learning, and right
qualification in all points of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb facs="tcp:61977:6"/>
is required of us; how ſmall
our yearly ſtipend is, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
all our other incomes are.
Again, we call to minde the too
much indulgency of ſome Parents,
who neither love to blame their
childrens untowardneſſe, nor ſuffer
the Maſter to correct it; we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their generall ingratitude for
the Maſters well-doing, and their
open clamour for his leaſt doing
amiſſe; we obſerve their common
indiſcretion in wholly imputing the
Scholars leſſe profitting to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
more neglect, and their happy
thriving to their own onely toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe;
not to mention their fond
Ambition, in haſtening them too
faſt. Beſides, the ſmall account
which the vulgar have, the too cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious
eye which the more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
caſt, and the ſlight regard
which our young Academians (for
the moſt part) carry towards <hi>a poor
Schoole-Maſter,</hi> make us ſometimes
judge our calling (as many do) too
<pb facs="tcp:61977:6"/>
mean for a Scholar to undertake,
or deſire to ſtick too many yeares.
We let paſſe childrens imperfections
and untowardneſſe, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
our daily torture; ſo that we
could rather wiſh, our ſelves might
leave our charge, then adviſe any
friends we have to undertake it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
are very great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet ſuch as attend a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
calling, and therefore muſt
with Fortitude be conquered, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
undergone. Should the
Mariner, becauſe of danger, the
Husband-man becauſe of toyle, the
Souldier becauſe of hardſhip, the
Magiſtrate becauſe of interruption,
the Miniſter, becauſe of many mens
diſordered converſations, abandon
their profeſſions; it would then
fare with a State, as (the Tale ſaith)
it did once with the body, when
the whole pin'd away, becauſe no
member would diſcharge its proper
function.</p>

Neither can I ſay to whom I

in their places. Nay, (give me leave
to ſpeak it) to commend your
knowne Dexterity in this excellent
calling, there have been (I think)
as many, and thoſe, as well-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Schoole-Maſters your <hi>quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
Scholars, as have been trained
up by any one man in <hi>England.</hi>

up the number, who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

private, for nigh thirty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Scholars, and have at laſt for
mine own eaſe, and the ſatisfaction

writ out, and which upon your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and my own further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
I have thought meet to
obſerve conſtantly, reſerving ever
the liberty of varying in matters of
of circumſtance, as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
And for ſome things (it may
be) you may rightly ſay (as I am
ever bound moſt thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that I was your Scholar,
ſeeing in them I have ſo nearly
ſeemed to track that method, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which I was inſtructed by
your ſelf.</p>
            <p>Daigne (I beſeech you) to accept
this ſmall offer of a willing minde,
and if you finde it helpful to you or
yours, in any kinde, to uſe it freely;
where you ſhall eſpie the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

it with impartial mildeneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

This Petition alſo I prefer to them
of better judgement, as it happeneth
to come into their hands.</p>
            <p>The Lord continue you long in
your eminent place, to doe the
Church and Common-wealth moſt
acceptable ſervice, and to reap to
your ſelf much comfort thereby,
that when at laſt you ſhall have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

at Gods hands an immortal Crown,

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Conſtancy in a good Method

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y aim being to diſcover the old
Art of teaching Schoole, and
how it may be improved in
every part ſuteable to the
years and capacities of ſuch
children as are now commonly taught;
I ſhall firſt begin my diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a petty-Schoole, &amp; here or elſe where
I ſhall not buſie my ſelf or Reader about
what a childe of an extraordinary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſs,
and having a teacher at
home, may attain unto, and in how
ſhort a ſpace, but onely ſhew how a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of various wits may be taught all
together with abundance of profit and
delight to every one, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the proper
and main work of our ordinary Schooles.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then, it is uſual in Cities and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61977:16"/>
greater Towns to put children to Schoole
about four or five years of age, and in
Country villages, becauſe of further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
not till about ſix or ſeven; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<hi>The ſooner a child is put to School, the
better it is,</hi> both to prevent ill habits, which
are got by play and idleneſs, and to enure
him betimes to affect learning and well
doing. Not to ſay, how the great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of parents lives, ſhould make
them careful of their Childrens early e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
which is like to be the beſt
part of their patrimony, what ever good
thing elſe they may leave them in this
World.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve that betwixt three and four
years of age a childe hath great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
to peep into a book, and then
is the moſt ſeaſonable time (if conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
may be had otherwiſe) for him
to begin to learn; and though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
then he cannot ſpeak ſo very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,
yet the often pronouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his letters, will be a means to
help his ſpeech, eſpecially if one take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in what organ or inſtrument he is
moſt defective, and exerciſe him chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly
in thoſe letters which belong unto it.</p>
                  <p>Now there are five organs or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſpeech, in the right hitting of
which, as the breath moveth from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61977:16"/>
through the mouth, a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of every letter is made, viz.
the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the roof
of the mouth, and the throat; Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which if one rank the twenty four
letters of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Alphabet, he ſhall
find that <hi>A, E, I, O, V,</hi> proceed by degrees
from the throat, along betwixt the
tongue and the roof of the mouth to the
lips contracted, and that <hi>Y</hi> is ſomewhat
like <hi>I,</hi> being pronounced with other let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but if it be named by it ſelf, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
ſome motion of the lips. <hi>B, F, M,
P, W,</hi> and V conſonant, belong to
the lips. <hi>C, S, X, Z,</hi> to the teeth. <hi>D, L,
N, T, R,</hi> to the tongue. <hi>B, H, K, Q,</hi>
to the roof of the mouth. But the ſweet
and natural pronunciation of them is
gotten rather by imitation then precept,
and therefore the teacher muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to give every letter its diſtinct and
clear ſound, that the childe may get it
from his voice, and be ſure to make the
child open his mouth well as he uttereth
a letter, leſt otherwiſe he drown or
hinder the ſound of it. For I have
heard ſome foreiners to blame us <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men</hi>
for neglecting this mean to a
plain and audible ſpeaking, ſaying, that
the cauſe, why we generally do not ſpeak
ſo fully as they, proceeded from an ill
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61977:17"/>
habit of mumbling, which children got
at their firſt learning to read; which it
was their care; therfore to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
betimes, and ſo it ſhould be ours,
ſeeing <hi>Pronounciation is that that ſets out a
man, and is ſufficient of it ſelf to make one an
Oratour.</hi>

know all his letters in a very little time.</head>
                  <p>THe uſual way to begin with a child,
when he is firſt brought to Schoole,
is to teach him to know his letters in the
Horn-book, where he is made to run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the letters in the Alphabet or
Chriſt croſs-row both forwards &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
until he can tel any one of them,
which is pointed at, and that in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
character.</p>
                  <p>This courſe we ſee hath been very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
in a ſhort time, with ſome more
ripe witted children, but others of a
ſlower apprehenſion (as the moſt and
beſt commonly are) have been thus
learning a whole year together, (and
though they have been much chid and
beaten too for want of heed) could ſcarce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61977:17"/>
tell ſix of their letters at twelve moneths
end, who, if they had been taught in a
way more agreeable to their meane
apprehenſions (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> might have wrought
more readily upon the ſenſes, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
their mindes with what they did)
would doubtleſſe have learned as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
if not as faſt as the quickeſt</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore mention ſundry ways
that have been taken to make a childe
know his letters readily, out of which
the diſcreet Teacher may chuſe what is
moſt likely to ſuit with his Learner.</p>
                  <p>I have known ſome that (according
to Mr. <hi>Brinſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y's</hi> direction) have taught lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones to pronounce all the letters; and
to ſpell pretty well, before they knew
one letter in a book; and this they did,
by making the childe to ſound the five
vowels <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> like ſo many bells up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his fingers ends, and to ſay which
finger was ſuch or ſuch a vowel, by chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
2 Then putting ſingle conſonants
before the vowels, [leaving the hardeſt
of them till the laſt] and teaching him
how to utter them both at once, as <hi>va, ve,
vi, ve, vu, da, de, di, do, du.</hi> 3. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
by putting the vowels before a
conſonant to make him ſay, <hi>as, es, is, os,
us, ad, ed, id, od, ud.</hi> Thus; they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from ſyllables of two or three, or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61977:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more letters, till a child hath been pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nimble in the moſt. But this is rather
to be done in a private houſe, then a
publick Schoole; how ever this manner
of exerciſe now and then amongſt little
Scholars will make their leſſons more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The greateſt trouble at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of children is to teach them how
to know their letters one from another,
when they ſee them in the book altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
for the greatneſſe of their number
and variety of ſhape do puzle young wits
to difference them, and the ſence can
but be intent upon one ſingle object at
once, ſo as to take its impreſſion, and
commit it to the imagination and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Some have therefore begun but
with one ſingle letter, and after they
have ſhewed it to the childe in the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,
have made him to finde the ſame any
where elſe in the book, till he knew that
perfectly; and then they have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to another in like manner, and ſo
gone through the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Some have contrived a piece of ivory
with twenty four flats or ſquares, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of which was engraven a ſeveral
letter, and by playing with a childe in
throwing this upon a table, and ſhewing
him the letter onely which lay uppermoſt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61977:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have in few dayes taught him the whole
Alphabet.</p>
                  <p>Some have got twenty four pieces of
ivory cut in the ſhape of dice, with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
engraven upon each of them, and
with theſe they have played at vacant
hours with a childe, till he hath known
them all diſtinctly. They begin firſt with
one, then with two, afterwards with
more letters at once, as the childe got
knowledge of them. To teach him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to ſpell, they would place conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
before or after a vowel, and then
joyn more letters together ſo as to make
a word, and ſometimes divide it into ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables,
to be parted or put together; now
this kind of letter ſport may be profitably
permitted among you beginers in a School
&amp; in ſtead of ivory, they may have white
bits of wood, or ſmall ſhreads of paper
or paſt-board, or parchment with a
letter writ upon each to play withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Some have made pictures in a little book
or upon a ſcroll of paper wrapt upon
two ſticks within a box of iceing-glaſs,
and by each picture have made three ſorts
of that letter, with which its name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth;
but thoſe being too many at
once for a childe to take notice on, have
proved not ſo uſeful as was intended.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61977:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Some likewiſe have had pictures and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
printed in this manner on the back
ſide of a pack of cards, to entice children,
that naturally love that ſport, to the love
of learning their books.</p>
                  <p>Some have writ a letter in a great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
upon a card, or chalked it out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a trencher, and by telling a child
what it was, and letting him ſtrive to
make the like, have imprinted it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his memory, and ſo the reſt one
after another</p>
                  <p>One having a Son of two years and a
half old, that could but even go about
the houſe, and utter ſome few gibber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
words in a broken manner; obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him one day above the reſt to be
buſied about ſhells and ſticks, and ſuch
like toys, which himſelf had laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a chair, and to miſſe any one that
was taken from him, he ſaw not how, and
to ſeek for it about the houſe; became
very deſireous to make experiment what
that childe might preſently attain to in
point of learning; Thereupon he devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a little wheel, with all the Capital
Romane letters made upon a paper to
wrap round about it, and fitted it to turn
in little a round box, which had a hole ſo
made in the ſide of it, that onely one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might be ſeen to peep out at once;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61977:19"/>
This he brought to the childe, &amp; ſhowed
him onely the letter O, and told him
what it was; The childe being overjoyed
with his new gamball, catcheth the
box out of his Fathers hand, and run's
with it to his play fellow a year younger
then himſelf, and in his broken language
tell's him there was an O, an O; And
when the other asked him where, he
ſaid, in a hole, in a hole, and ſhewed
it him; which the leſſer childe then took
ſuch notice of, as to know it againe ever
after from all the other letters. And
thus by playing with the box, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
concerning any letter that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſtrange to him, what it was, the
childe learnt all the letters of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
in eleven dayes, being in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<hi>A B C,</hi> and would take pleaſure
to ſhew them in any book to any of his
acquaintance that came next. By this
inſtance you may ſee what a propenſity
there is in nature betimes to learning,
could but the Teachers apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to their young Scholars tenuity;
and how by proceeding in a cleare &amp; facil
method, that all may apprehend, every
one may benefit more or leſs by degrees.
According to theſe contrivances to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
children, I have publiſhed <hi>a New
Primar;</hi> in the firſt leafe, whereof I have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61977:20"/>
ſet the Roman Capitalls (becauſe that
Character is now moſt in uſe, &amp; thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the moſt eaſie to be learn't and have
joyned therewith the pictures or images
of ſome things whoſe names begins with
that letter, by which a childs memory
may be helped to remember how to call
his letters, as A, for an Ape, B. for a
Bear, &amp;c. This Hieroglyphicall deviſe
doth ſo affect Children who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
forward to communicate what they
know) that I have obſerved them to
teach others, that could not ſo readily
learn, to know all the letters in a few
houres ſpace, by asking them, what
ſtands A. for? and ſo concerning other
letters backwards and forwards, or as
they beſt liked.</p>
                  <p>Thus when a childe hath got the names
of his letters, &amp; their ſeveral ſhapes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in a playing manner, he may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
taught to diſtinguiſh them in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
leaf, which containeth firſt the
greater, and then the ſmaller Roman
Characters, to be learned by five at
once or more, as the childe is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them; other Characters I would
have forborn, till one be well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with theſe, becauſe ſo much variety
at the firſt doth but amaze young
wits, and our Engliſh characters, (for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61977:20"/>
the moſt part) are very obſcure, &amp; more
hard to be imprinted in the memory.
And thus much for the learning to know
letters; we ſhall next (and according to
Order in Teaching) proceed to an eaſie
way of diſtinct ſpelling.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How to teach a childe to ſpell diſtinctly.</head>
                  <p>THe common way of teaching a childe
to ſpell, is, after he know's the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in his Alphabet, to initiate him in
thoſe few ſyllables, which conſiſt of one
vowell before a conſonant, as, <hi>ab, eb, ib, ob
ub, &amp;c.</hi> or of one vowel after a conſonant,
as, <hi>ba, be, bi, bo, bu, &amp;c.</hi> in the Horn-book, &amp;
thence to proceed with him by little and
little to the bottom of the book, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him twice or thrice over till he can
ſay his leſſon, and then putting him to
a new one.</p>
                  <p>In which courſe I have known ſome
more apt children to have profited prety
well, but ſcarce one often, when they
have gone thorow the book, to be able
to ſpell a word that is not in it; And ſome
have been certaine years daily exerciſed
in ſaying leſſons therein, who after much
endeavour ſpent, have been accounted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61977:21"/>
meer block-heads, and rejected all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as uncapable to learn any thing;
whereas ſome Teachers that have aſſayed
a more familiar way, have profeſſed, that
they have not met with any ſuch thing
as a Dunſe amid a great multitude of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Schollars.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is <hi>Tullies</hi> obſervation of old,
and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his aſſertion of latter years,
that it is as natural for a childe to learn,
as it is for a beaſt to go, a bird to fly, or
a fiſh to ſwim, and I verily beleeve it,
for the nature of man is reſtleſſely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to know things, and were diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
taken out of the way, and
meet helps afforded young learners,
they would doubtleſs go on with a great

proficiency at their books then uſually
they do; And <hi>could the Maior have the

                  </p>
                  <p>Amongſt thoſe that have gone a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
way to reading, I ſhall onely mention
Mr. <hi>Roe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> the latter of
whom I have known to have taught lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
children not much above four years
old to read diſtinctly in the Bible, in ſix
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61977:21"/>
weekes time, or under; their books are
to be had in print, but every one hath
not the art to uſe them. And Mr. <hi>Cootes</hi>
Engliſh-School-Maſter ſeem's rather to
be fitted for one that is a Maſter indeed,
then for a Scholar.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the way then which is uſuall,
you may (if you think good) make uſe
of that which I have ſet down in the new
Primar to help little ones to ſpell readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and it is this.</p>
                  <p>1. Let a childe be well acquainted with
his vowells, and made to pronounce
them fully by themſelves, becauſe they
are able to make a perfect ſound alone.</p>
                  <p>2. Teach him to give the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or force of the conſonants, and to
take notice how imperfectly they ſound,
except a vowel be joyned with them.
Both theſe are ſet apart by themſelves.
(p. 2.)</p>
                  <p>3. Proceed to ſyllables made of one
conſonant ſet before a vowel (Sect, 5.)
and let him joyne the true force of the
conſonant with the perfect ſound of the
vowel, as to ſay, <hi>ba, be, bi, bo, bu, &amp;c.</hi>
Yet it were good to leave <hi>ca, ce, ci, co,
cu,</hi> and <hi>ga, ge, gi, go, gu,</hi> to the laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the valor of the conſonant in the
ſecond and third ſylables doth differ
from that in the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61977:22"/>
4. Then exerciſe him in ſyllables made
of one vowel ſet before one conſonant,
(Sect. 6.) as to ſay, <hi>ab, eb, ib, ob, ub, &amp;c.</hi>
till he can ſpell any ſyllable of two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
backwards or forwards, as, <hi>ba,
be; bi, bo, bu; ab, eb, ib, ob, ub; ba, ab; be,
eb; bi, ib; bo, ob; bu, ub;</hi> and ſo in all
the reſt comparing one with another.</p>
                  <p>5. And if to any one of theſe ſyllables
you adde a letter, and teach him how to
joyne it in ſound with the reſt, you will
make him more ready in ſpelling; as, if
before <hi>a b</hi> you put <hi>b,</hi> and teach him to
ſay <hi>bab;</hi> if after <hi>ba,</hi> you put <hi>d,</hi> and let
him pronounce it <hi>bad,</hi> he will quickly
be able to joyne a letter with any of the
reſt, as, <hi>nip, pin, but, tub, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To enure your young-Scholar to any,
even the hardeſt ſyllable, in an eaſie
way.</p>
                  <p>1. Practiſe him in the ioyning of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
that begin ſyllables (Sect. 7.)
ſo as that he may give their joynt forces
at once; thus,</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed him to ſound <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l</hi> or <hi>br</hi>
together, make him to pronounce them,
and a vowel with them, <hi>bla, bra, ble, bre,</hi>
and ſo in any of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Then practiſe him likewiſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
that end ſyllables, (Sect. 8)
make him firſt to give the force of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61977:22"/>
joyned conſonants, and then to put the
vowels before them; as, <hi>ble</hi> with the vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
before them ſound <hi>able, eble, ible, oble,
uble,</hi> to all which you may prefix other
conſonants and change them into words
of one ſyllable, as, <hi>fable, peble, bible, noble,
bubble:</hi> (with a <hi>b</hi> inſerted or the <hi>like.</hi>
Where obſerve that <hi>e</hi> in the end of many
words, being ſilent, doth qualifie the
ſound of the foregoing vowel, ſo as to
make words different from thoſe that
have not <hi>e;</hi> as, you may ſee <hi>made,</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
quite from <hi>mad, bete</hi> from <hi>bet, pipe</hi>
from <hi>pip, ſope</hi> from <hi>ſop,</hi> and <hi>cube</hi> from <hi>cub.</hi>
Whereby I think them in an error, that
leave out <hi>e</hi> in the end of words, and
them that in pronouncing it make two
ſyllables of one, in <hi>ſtable, bible, people, &amp;c.</hi>
which judicious Mr. <hi>Mulcaſter</hi> will not
allow.</p>
                  <p>In this exerciſe of ſpelling you may do
well ſometimes to make all the young
beginners ſtand together, and poſe them
one by one in all ſorts of ſyllables, till
they be perfect in any; and, to make
them delight herein,</p>
                  <p>1. Let them ſpell many ſyllables toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which differ onely in one letter; as,
<hi>and, band, hand, land, ſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Teach them to frame any word of
one ſyllable, by joyning any of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61977:23"/>
which go before vowels, with
thoſe that uſe to follow vowels, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in vowels betwixt them; as, <hi>black,
bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck; clack, clock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this they may do afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, having ſeverall looſe
letters made and given them, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
or divide in a ſporting manner,
which I may rightly terme the Letter-ſport.</p>
                  <p>When a childe is become expert in
joyning Conſonants with the vowels,
then take him to the Diphthongs (Sect.
9.) and there,</p>
                  <p>1. Teach him the naturall force of
a Diphthong (which conſiſts of two vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
joyned together) and make him to
ſound it diſtinctly by it ſelf; as, <hi>ai, ei, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Let him ſee how it is joyned with
other letters, and learne to give its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nountiation
together with them, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him how the ſame Diphthong differs
from its ſelf ſometimes in its ſound, and
which of the two vowels in it hath the
greateſt power in pronouncation, as, in
<hi>people e</hi> ſeemeth to drown the <hi>o.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And beſides thoſe words in the Book,
you may adde others of your own, till
by many examples the childe do well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
your meaning, and ſo, as that
he can boldly adventure to imitate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61977:23"/>
you, and practiſe of himſelf</p>
                  <p>Thus after a childe is throughly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in the true ſounding of the vowels
and conſonants together, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the ſpelling of words, firſt of
one ſyllable (Sect. 10.) then of two (Sect.
11.) then of three (Sect. 12.) then of
four (Sect. 13.) in all which let him be
taught how to utter every ſyllable by it
ſelf truly and fully, and be ſure to ſpeak
out the laſt. But in words of more ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
let him learn to joyne and part
them according to theſe profitable rules.</p>
                  <p>1. An Engliſh ſyllable may ſometimes
conſiſt of eight letters, but never of more,
as, <hi>ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 In words that have many ſyllables,
the conſonant between two vowels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the latter of them; as, Hu-mi-li-tie.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſonants which are joyned in the
beginning of words, are not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the middle of them; as, <hi>My-ſte-ry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Conſonants which are not joyned
in the beginning of words, are to be
parted in the middle of them; as, <hi>for-get-ful-neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. If a conſonant be doubled in the
middle of a word, the firſt belong's
to the ſyllable foregoing, and the latter
to the following; as, <hi>poſ-ſeſ-ſi-on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61977:24"/>
6. In compound words, every part
which belongeth to the ſingle words,
muſt be ſet by it ſelf; as, <hi>In-a-bi-li-ty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe rules have I here ſet down
rather to informe the leſs skilful teacher,
how he is to guide his learner, then to
puzle a childe about them, who is not yet
ſo well able to comprehend them.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo divided thoſe words in the
Book, to let Children ſee how they
ought to divide other polyſyllable
words, in which they muſt alwayes he
very carefull (as I ſaid) to ſound out the
laſt ſyllable very fully.</p>
                  <p>To enable a child the better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any word he meets withall in
reading, I have ſet down ſome more
hard for pronuntiation; (Sect. 14) in
often reading over which he may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
to help his utterance; and the
Maſter may adde more at his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
till he ſee that his willing Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
doth not ſtick in ſpelling any, be it
never ſo hard.</p>
                  <p>And that the child may not be amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with any thing in his book, when he
cometh to read, I would have him
made acquainted with the pauſes, (Sect.
15.) with the figures, (Sect. 16.) nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
letters, (Sect. 17.) Quotations (Sect.
18.) and Abbreviations (Sect. 19) which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61977:24"/>
being but a work of few houres ſpace,
may eaſily be performed after <hi>he can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
ſpell,</hi> which when he can do, he
may profitably be put to reading, but
not before; for I obſerved it a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in ſome of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> Scholars, (whoſe
way was to teach to read preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſpelling at all) that when they
were at a loſſe about a word, they made
an imperfect confuſed ſound, in giving
the force of the conſonants, which if
they once miſſed they knew not which
way to help themſelves, to find what
the word was, whereas if after a childe
know his letters, he be taught to gather
them into juſt ſyllables, and by the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſyllables together to frame a
word, (which as it is the moſt antient,
ſo certainely it is the moſt naturall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of teaching) he will ſoon be able,
if he ſtick at any word in reading, by the
naming of its letters, and pronouncing
of its ſyllables to ſay what it is, and then
he may boldly venture to read without
ſpelling at all, touching the gaining
of a habit whereof, I ſhall proceed to ſay
ſomewhat in the next chapter.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How a child may be taught to read any Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Book perfectly.</head>
                  <p>THe ordinary way to teach children
to read is, after they have got ſome
knowledge of their letters, &amp; a ſmatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſome ſyllables and words in the
horn-book, to turn them into the <hi>A B C.</hi>
or Primar, and therein to make them
name the letters, and ſpell the words,
till by often uſe they can pronounce (at
leaſt) the ſhorteſt words at the firſt ſight.</p>
                  <p>This method take's with thoſe of promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wits, but many of more ſlow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
not finding any thing to affect
them, and ſo make them heed what they
learne, go on remiſſely from leſſon to
leſſon, and are not much more able to
read, when they have ended their book,
then when they begun it. Beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<hi>A B C.</hi> being now (I may ſay) gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
thrown aſide, and the ordinary
Primar not printed, and the very fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls
of chriſtian Religion (which
were wont to be contained in thoſe
books, and were commonly taught chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at home by heart before they went
to Schoole) with ſundry people (almoſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61977:25"/>
in all places) ſlighted, the matter which
is taught in moſt books now in uſe, is
not ſo familiar to them, and therefore
not ſo eaſie for Children to learn.</p>
                  <p>But to hold ſtill to the ſure foundation,
I have cauſed the Lords Prayer (Sect.
20.) the Creed (Sect. 21.) and the ten
Commandements (Sect. 23.) to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Roman character, that a childe
having learned already to know his
letters and how to ſpell, may alſo be ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
to read by them, which he will
do the more cheerfully, if he be alſo
inſtructed at home to ſay them by heart.</p>
                  <p>As he read's theſe, I would have a
childe name what words he can at the
firſt ſight, and what he cannot, to ſpell
them, and to take notice what pauſes
and numbers are in his leſſon. And to
go them often over, till he can tell any
tittle in them, either in or without the
book.</p>
                  <p>When he is thus well entered in the
Roman character, I would have him
made acquainted with the reſt of the
characters now in uſe (Sect. 23.) which
will be eaſily done, by comparing one
with another, and reading over thoſe
<hi>ſentences, Pſalms, Thankeſgivings,</hi> and
<hi>Prayers</hi> (which are printed in greater
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61977:26"/>
and leſſe characters of ſundry ſorts) till
he have them pretty well by heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus having all things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
reading Engliſh made familar to
him, he may attaine to a perfect habit
of it. 1. By reading <hi>the ſingle Pſalter.
2. The Pſalmes in meeter. 3. The Schoole
of good manners,</hi> or ſuch like eaſie
books, which may both profit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
him. All which I would wiſh he may
read over at leſt thrice, to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as well as the words, leave an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon his mind. If any where he
ſtick at any word (as ſeeming too hard)
let him marke it with a pin, or the dint
of his nayle, and by looking upon it
againe, he will remember it.</p>
                  <p>When he can read any whit readily,
let him begin the Bible, and read over
the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> (and other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Hiſtories in other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which are moſt likely to delight
him) by a chapter at a time; But acquaint
him a little with the matter beforehand,
for that will intice him to read it, and
make him more obſervant of what he
read's. After he hath read, aske him ſuch
generall Queſtions out of the Story, as
are moſt eaſie for him to anſwer, and he
will the better remember it. I have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61977:26"/>
known ſome, that by hiring a child to
read two or three chapters a day, and to
get ſo many verſes of it by heart, have
made them admirable proficients, and
that betimes, in the Scriptures; which
was <hi>Timothies</hi> excellency, and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers
great commendation. Let him
now take liberty to exerciſe himſelf in
any Engliſh book (ſo the matter of it be
but honeſt) till he can perfectly read in
any place of a book that is offered him;
and when he can do this, I adjudge him
fit to enter into a <hi>Grammar</hi> Schoole, but
not before.</p>
                  <p>For thus learning to read Engliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
I allow two or three years time,
ſo that at ſeven or eight years of age, a
child may begin Latine.</p>

               <div n="5" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Wherein children, for whom the Latine tongue
is thought to be unneceſſary, are to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
after they can read Engliſh well.</head>
                  <p>IT is a fond conceit of many, that
have either not attained, or by their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61977:27"/>
own negligence have utterly loſt the uſe
of the Latine Tongue, to think it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unneceſſary for ſuch children to
learn it, as are intended for Trades, or
to be kept as drudges at home, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about husbandry. For firſt there
are few children, but (in their playing-years,
and before they can be capable of
any ſerious employment in the meaneſt
calling that is) may be ſo far grounded
in the Latine, as to finde that little
ſmattering they have of it, to be of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
uſe to them, both for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the Engliſh Authors (which
abound now a dayes with borrowed
words) and the holding diſcourſe with
a ſort of men that delight to flant it in
Latine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Beſides I have heard it
ſpoken to the great commendation of
ſome Countries, where care is had for
the well education of children, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Peaſant (almoſt) is able to diſcourſe
with a ſtranger in the Latine tongue; and
why may not we here in <hi>England</hi> obtain
the like praiſe, if we did but as they,
continue our children at the Latine
Schoole, till they be well acquainted
with that language, and thereby better
fitted for any calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61977:27"/>
Thirdly, And I am ſorry to adde, that
the non-improvement of childrens time
after they can read Engliſh any whit
well, throweth open a gap to all looſe
kinde of behaviour; for being then (as
it is too commonly to be ſeen, eſpecially
with the poorer ſort) taken from the
Schoole, and permitted to run wildeing
up and down without any control, they
adventure to commit all manner of
lewdneſſe, and ſo become a ſhame and
diſhonour to their Friends and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>If theſe or the like reaſons therefore
might prevail to perſwade them that
have a prejudice againſt Latine, I would
adviſe that all children might be put to
the Grammar-Schoole, ſo ſoon as they
can read Engliſh well; and ſuffered to
continue at it, till ſome honeſt calling
invite them thence; but if not, I would
wiſh them rather to forbear it, then to
become there an hinderance to others,
whoſe work it is to learn that profitable
Language. And that they may not
ſquander away their time in idleneſs, it
were good if they were put to a Writing-Schoole,
where they might be, Firſt
helped to keep their Engliſh, by reading
of a chapter (at leaſt) once a day; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61977:28"/>
ſecond. taught to write a fair hand; and
thirdly afterwards exerciſed in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique,
and ſuch preparative Arts, as
may make them compleatly fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
any ordinary calling. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus trained up in a way of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
they will afterwards prove more
eaſily plyable to their Maſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>Now, foraſmuch as few Grammar-Schooles
of note will admit children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, till they have learn't their Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;
the teaching of that book, alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
for the moſt part a work for a Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Schoole,
where many that undertake
to teach it, being altogether ignorant of
the Latine Tongue, do ſorrily performe
that taske, and ſpend a great deal of time
about it to little or no purpoſe. I would
have that book, therefore by ſuch let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and left to the Grammar-School, as
moſt ſitting to be taught there onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is intended as an introduction
of Grammar, to guide children in a
way of reading, writing, and ſpeaking
Latine, and the Teachers of the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-Art
are moſt deeply concerned to
make uſe of it for that end. And in ſtead
of the Accidents, which they do neither
underſtand nor profit by, they may be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61977:28"/>
benefitted in reading Orthodoxal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmes
and other Books, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
them in the Duties of a Chriſtian,
ſuch as are <hi>The Practiſe of Piety, The Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of Quietneſſe, The whole duty of Man;</hi>
and afterwards in other delightful books
of Engliſh Hiſtory; as, <hi>The Hiſtory of
Queen Elizabeth;</hi> or Poetry, as <hi>Herberts
Poems, Quarl's Emblems;</hi> and by this
means they will gain ſuch a habit and
delight in reading, as to make it their
chief recreation, when liberty is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. And their acquaintance with
good books will (by Gods bleſſing) be
a means ſo to ſweeten their (otherwiſe
ſowr) natures, that they may live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
towards themſelves, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
converſe with other perſons.</p>
                  <p>Yet if the Teacher of a Petty-Schoole
have a pretty underſtanding of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Tongue, he may the better adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to teach the Accidents, and proceed
in ſo doing with far more eaſe and profit
to himſelf and learner, if he obſerve a
ſure method of grounding his children
in the Rudiments of Grammar, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
them to ſpeak and write familiar
Latine, which I ſhall hereafter diſcover,
having firſt ſet down ſomewhat how to
remedy that defect in reading Engliſh,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61977:29"/>
with which the Grammar-Schooles are
very much troubled, eſpecially, where
there is not a good Petty-Schoole to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
that work afore-hand. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I proceed further, I will expreſſe my

                  <head type="sub">Of the founding of a Petty-Schoole.</head>
                  <p>THe Petty-Schoole is the place where
indeed the firſt Principles of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and learning ought to be taught,
and therefore rather deſerveth that

                  <p>Out of this conſideration it is (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
that ſome nobler ſpirits, whom
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61977:29"/>
God hath enriched with an over-plus
of outward means, have in ſome places
whereunto they have been by birth (or
otherwiſe) related, erected Petty-Schoole-houſes,
and endowed them with
yearly ſalaries; but thoſe are ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
towards the maintenance of a
Maſter and his familie, or ſo over-cloyed
with a number of Free-Scholars, to be
taught for nothing, that few men of
parts will daigne to accept of them, or
continue at them for any while; and for
this cauſe I have obſerved ſuch weak
foundations to fall to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Yet if any one be deſireous to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
towards ſuch an eminent work of
charity, my advice is, that he erect a
Schoole and dwelling houſe together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of a Market-Town, or
ſome populous Country-Village, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate
it with a ſafe yard adjoyning
to it, if not with an Orchard or Garden,
and that he endow, with a ſalary of (at
leaſt twenty pounds, <hi>per annum,</hi> in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
whereof all ſuch poor boyes as
can conveniently frequent it, may be
taught <hi>gratis,</hi> but the more able ſort of
neighbours may pay for childrens teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if the Schoole was not free; for
they will find it no ſmall advantage to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61977:30"/>
have ſuch a Schoole amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Such a yearly ſtipend and convenient
dwelling, with a liberty to take young
children to board, and to make what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
he can beſt by other Scholars,
will invite a man of good parts to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the charge, and excite him to
the diligent and conſtant performance
of his duty; eſpecially, if he be choſen
into the place by three or four honeſt
and diſcreet Truſtees, that may have
power alſo to remove him thence, if by
his uncivil behaviour, or groſe neglect
he render himſelf uncapable to perform
ſo neceſſary a ſervice to the Church and
Common-Wealth.</p>
                  <p>As for the Qualifications of one that
is to be the Teacher of a Petty-Schoole, I
would have him to be a Perſon of a pious,
ſober, comely and diſcreet behaviour,
and tenderly affectionate towards chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
haveing ſome knowledge of the
Latine Tongue, and abilitie to write a
fair hand, and good skil in Arithmetick,
and then let him move within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of his own orb, ſo as to teach all his
Scholars (as they become capable) to
read Engliſh very well, and afterwards
to write and caſt accouts. And let him
not meddle at all with teaching the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61977:30"/>
except onely to ſome more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
wits, which are intended to be ſet
forwards to learn Latine, and for ſuch be
ſure that he ground them well, or elſe
diſmiſſe them as ſoon as they can read
diſtinctly, and write legibly, to the
Grammar School.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould here have cloſed my diſcourſe;
and ſhut up this Petty-Schoole, were it
not that I received <hi>a model for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Students</hi> from a worthy friends
hands (&amp; one that is moſt zealouſly and
charitably addicted to advance Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to help it in its very beginnings
to come forwards to its full Riſe)
by which I am encouraged to
addreſſe my remaining words to the
Godly-minded Truſtees and Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
for ſo good a work, (eſpecially to
thoſe amongſt them that know me, and
my School-endeavours) and this I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
requeſt of them, that as they have
happily contrived a Model for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

ſo they would alſo put to their hands for
the improvement of Schoole-learning,
without which ſuch choiſe abilities as

poſſibly be obtained. And for the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61977:31"/>
firſt foundation of ſuch a work; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to offer my adviſe, that in ſome
convenient places, within and about
the City, there may be Petty-Schooles
erected, according to the number of
wards, unto which certain poor children
out of every Pariſh may be ſent, and
taught <hi>gratis,</hi> and all others that pleaſe
to ſend their children thither may have
them taught at a reaſonable rate, and be
ſure to have them improved to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of what they are capable. And I
am the rather induced to propound ſuch
a thing, becauſe that late eminent, Dr.
<hi>Bathurſt</hi> lately deceaſed, Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> and
ſome others yet living did out of their
own good affection to learning, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

afterwards let every one ſettle to his
preſent taske.</p>
                  <p>5. The whole Schoole may not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be divided into four formes; whereof
the firſt and loweſt ſhould be of thoſe
that learn to know their letters, whoſe

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61977:32"/>
of thoſe that learn to ſpell, whoſe
leſſons may be in the Single-Pſalter. The
third of theſe that learn to read, whoſe
leſſons may be in the Bible. The fourth
of thoſe that are exerciſed in reading,
writeing, and caſting accounts, whoſe
leſſons may be in ſuch profitable Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-Books
as the Parents can beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
and the Maſter think fitteſt to be

                  <p>6. Let their leſſons be the ſame to

proportion them to the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
thus thoſe that are abler may
profit themſelves by helping their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
fellowes, and thoſe that are weaker
be encouraged to ſee that they can keep
company with the ſtronger. And let
the two higheſt in every forme give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to the Maſter when they come to
ſay, of thoſe that were moſt negligent
in geting the leſſon.</p>
                  <p>7. When they come to ſay, let them all
ſtand orderly in one or 2 rowes, &amp; whilſt
one ſayeth his leſſon, be ſure that all the

he can ſay better, let him take his place,
and keep it till the ſame boy or another
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61977:33"/>
win it from him. The ſtriveing for
places (eſpecially) amongſt little ones,
will whet them all on to more diligence,
then any encouragement that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them; and the Maſter ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſparing to whip any one for his book,
except he be ſullenly negligent, and
then alſo I would chuſe rather to ſhame
him out of his untowardneſſe by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
ſome of his fellowes, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him why he cannot do as well as
they, then by falling upon him with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
words, or injurious blowes. A great
care alſo muſt be had that thoſe children
that are ſlow witted and of a tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
be not any way diſcouraged, though
they cannot make ſo good performance
of their task as the reſt of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                  <p>8 On Mundayes, Wedneſdayes and
Fridayes they may ſay two leſſons in a
forenoon and two in an afternoon; and
on Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes in the
forenoons they may alſo ſay two leſſons;
but on Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes in
the afternoons, and on Saturday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
I would have the time ſpent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amineing,

Graces, Prayers, and Pſalms, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and
the Ten Commandements (which are for
that purpoſe ſet down in the <hi>New-Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>)
very perfectly by heart. And thoſe
that can theſe well may proceed to get
other Catechiſms, but be ſure they be
ſuch as agree with the Principles of
Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>9. Their leſſons being all ſaid, they ſhould
be diſmiſſed about eleven a clock, and
then care muſt be taken that they go e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one orderly out of the Schoole, and
paſſe quietly home without any ſtay by
the way. And to prevent that too too
common clamour, and crouding out of
the Schoole door, let them riſe out of
their places one by one with their hat,
and book in their hand, and make their
honours to their Maſter as they paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his face, one following another at a
diſtance out of the Schoole. It were
fitteſt and ſafeſt that the leaſt went out
the foremoſt, that the bigger boyes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
may give notice of any miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
upon the way.</p>
                  <p>10 Their return to Schoole in the
after-noon ſhould be by one of the
clock, and thoſe that come before that
hour, ſhould be permitted to play with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their bounds till the clock ſtrike one,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61977:34"/>
and then let them all take their places
in due order, and ſay their leſſons as
they did in the fore-noon. After leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ended, let one read a chapter, and
ſay a Prayer, and ſo let them again go
orderly and quietly home, about five a
clock in the ſummer, and four in the
winter ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>11. If neceſſity require any one to go
out in the School time, let him not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the Maſter by asking him leave,
but let him leave his book with his next
fellow above him, for fear he ſhould elſe
ſpoile it, or looſe it, and in caſe he tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
too long forth, let notice be given to
the Monitor.</p>
                  <p>12. Thoſe children in the upper form
may be monitors, every one a day in
his turn, and let them every evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all leſſons ſaid, give a bill to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of their names that are abſent and
theirs that have committed any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and let him be very moderate in
correcting, and be ſure to make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
betwixt thoſe faults that are viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
enormous, and thoſe that are but
childiſh tranſgreſſons; Where admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
readily take place, it is a needleſſe
trouble to uſe a rod, and as for a <hi>ferula</hi>
I wiſh it were utterly baniſhed out of all
Schooles.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61977:34"/>
If one, before I conclude, ſhould ask me,
how many children I think may be well
and profitably taught (according to the
method already propoſed) in a Petty-School;
I return him anſwer, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
fourty boyes will be enough
throughly to employ one man, to hear
every one ſo often as is required, and ſo
many he may hear and benefit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
without making uſe of any of his
Scholars to teach the reſt, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may be permitted, and is practiſed
in ſome Schooles, yet it occaſioneth too
much noyſe and diſorder, and is no
whit ſo acceptable to Parents, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to the children, be the work never
ſo well done. And therefore I adviſe,
that in a place where a great concours of
children may be had, there be more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
then one employed according to the
ſpatiouſneſſe of the room, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of boyes to be taught; ſo that every
fourty Scholars may have one to teach
them; and in caſe there be boyes enough
to be taught, I would appoint one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Maſter, to attend one ſingle forme,
and have as many Maſters as there are
forms, and then the work of teaching
little ones to the height of their beſt
improvement may be throwly done,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61977:35"/>
eſecially if there were a writeing-maſter
employed at certain houres
in the Schoole, and an experienced
Teacher encouraged as a ſuperviſor, or
inſpector, to ſee that the whole Schoole
be well and orderly taught, and diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>What I have here writ concerning the
Teaching and ordering of a Petty-Schoole,
was in many particulars expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
by my ſelf with a few little
boyes, that I taught amongſt my Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-Scholars
in London, and I know
thoſe of eminent worth, and great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that upon tryal made upon their
own children at home, and others at
Schoole are ready to atteſt the eaſe and
benefit of this method. Inſomuch as I
was reſolved to have adjoyned a Petty-Schoole
to my Grammar-Schoole at the
Token-houſe in <hi>Lothbury London,</hi> and
there to have proceeded in this familiar
and pleaſing way of Teaching, had I not
been unhanſomly dealt with by thoſe
whom it concerned, for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
ſake to have given me leſſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.
Nevertheleſſe, I think it my
duty to promote Learning what I can,
and to lay a ſure foundation for ſuch a
goodly ſtructure as learning is; And
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61977:35"/>
though (perhaps) I may never be able to
effect what I deſire for its advancement,
yet it will be my comfort, to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
ſomwhat to others that may help
thereunto. I have here begun at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ground work, intending (by Gods
bleſſing) forthwith to publiſh <hi>The New
Diſcovery of the Old Art of Teaching,</hi> which
doth properly belong to a Grammar-Schoole.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I intreat thoſe into
whoſe hands this little work may come,
to look upon it with a ſingle eye, and
whether they like or diſlike it, to think
that it is not unneceſſary for men of
greateſt parts to beſtow a ſheet or two at
leaſure time upon ſo mean a ſubject as
this ſeem's to bee. And that God which
cauſeth immenſe rivers to flow from
ſmall ſpring-heads, vouchſafe to bleſſe
theſe weak beginings in tender age, that
good learning may proceed hence to its
full perfection in riper years.</p>

                  <p>THE want of good Teachers of
Engliſh in moſt places where
Grammar-Schooles are erected,
cauſeth that many Children are
brought thither to learn the Latine
Tongue, before they can read well. And
this chiefly, to prevent their loſſe of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61977:38"/>
time with thoſe that can teach them no
further.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch Scholars for the moſt part
become the greateſt diſgrace to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of all the reſt, partly becauſe indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and illiterate parents (I wil not ſay
ſervants) that can ſcarcely read Engliſh
themſelves, become too ſevere judges
of his work, and partly becauſe he ſeem's
to ſome to undervalue himſelf by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
Petties into his Schoole. But for
the toyl and trouble that he hath in
teaching ſuch, I rather ſeek how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
it, then go about in words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it.</p>
                  <p>To help therefore that defect of
reading Engliſh aright, you may take
this, as the moſt uſeful courſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Let them read a Chapter every
morning, and every noon in <hi>the New-Teſtament,</hi>
and at ten and four a clock, a
piece of the <hi>Accidents,</hi> which will require
(at leaſt) a quarter of a year to be read
over, in caſe the children be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
but in caſe they be any whit
ready, it may be gone over in ſix weeks
time.</p>
                  <p>2. To exerciſe their ſlender memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
at their firſt coming to Schoole, and
to find them ſome little task over-night
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61977:38"/>
(to which they ſhould be inured at the
firſt, that they may not take it more
hardly afterwards) let them commit to
memory ſome few ſtaves of ſuch Pſalms
in Meeter, as you in your diſcretion
ſhall think beſt to ſute with their ſhallow
apprehenſions: <hi>Pſalm. 1. 4. 12. 15. 19.
25.</hi> 34. 67. 100. 103, 104 119. are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>That they may be more perfect in
their leſſons before they come to ſay;</p>
                  <p>1. It were good, if you did now and
then read a piece for their imitation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the juſt and full pronounciation
of each ſyllable, and making pauſes as
they come.</p>
                  <p>2. But eſpecially as they ſit in their
form, ſee that every one after another
read the Leſſon twice or thrice over (the
higheſt, becauſe the moſt able beginning
to read firſt) and cauſe that every one
attend diligently to what is read, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſtantly upon his book, and let
them have liberty (who can ſooneſt) to
correct him that readeth any word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
and to note it as his miſtake. But
in this a care muſt be had that they make
no noiſe nor diſturbance to the reſt of
the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>3. When they come to ſay, let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61977:39"/>
one in that order you ſhall appoint
(beginning either with the higheſt or
loweſt, or otherwiſe) read the whole
Leſſon, or a piece of it, as the time will
beſt permit you to hear them, and when
the leſſon is gone often enough over, you
may propound a familiar and ſhort que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
or two out of it, thereby to make
ſomewhat of its meaning ſtick in their
memories, and diſmiſſe them to their
places to ask one another the like.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe <hi>the Accidents as it is now
Printed</hi> (eſpecially that part of it which
concerneth the conjugateing of verbs)
<hi>is too full of difficult Abbreviations</hi> for the
moſt Children to read, or ſome Maſters
(that undertake it) to teach; I have
found a great advantage and eaſe by
making uſe of <hi>the examination of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
before I put them to read the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
it ſelf, eſpecially with ſome more
dull-witted boyes, that I could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
faſten upon; and the way I
uſed, it was this: I cauſed,</p>
                  <p>1. That Children ſhould read over
onely the firſt part of it, which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>the Introduction of the eight parts of
Speech,</hi> by taking ſo much at a time, as
they could well be able to read, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to one or more particular heads
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61977:39"/>
of Grammar. Thus in the firſt going
it over, I made them acquainted with
the uſual terms of Grammar-Art, ſo as
to be able (at leaſt) to turn to a <hi>Noun,
Pronoune, Verb,</hi> &amp;c. and to what belong
to them, as, <hi>to the Numbers, Caſes, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Moods,</hi> &amp;c. and to tell how many
there are of each.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſecond reading it over, I
ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght them to take notice what every
part of ſpeech is, and how it differs from
others, and what things belong to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them. And this I did by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
examples, which beſt help to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
their underſtandings in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what they read, and confirm their
memories to keep it. Ex. gr. having
ſhewed them in their Book, that a Noun
is the name of a thing, and that it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive,
or Adjective, and hath Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Caſes, Genders, Declenſions,
and Degrees of Compariſon; I inſtance
ſeveral words, as, <hi>a horſe, of men, ſweet
honey, with ſweeter words,</hi> and let the
Children who can readilieſt, tell me
what belong to them. This is (as Mr.

to ſlip into a Childes underſtanding
before he be aware, ſo as he ſhall have
done his task, before he ſhall ſuſpect
that any was impoſed; he ſhall do his

which may alſo ſerve for the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and pleaſant reading of the Engliſh

of the book (by reaſon of the braſſe
cuts in it) did not make it too hard to
come by.</p>
                  <p>But where the book may be readily
had (as who would not beſtow four
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61977:40"/>
or five ſhillings more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to profit and pleaſe a Son?) I would
adviſe that a child ſhould bring it with
him at his firſt coming to a Grammar-Schoole,
and be employed in it together
with his Accidents, till he can write a
good legible hand, and then a Maſter
may adventure to ground him well in
<hi>Orthography,</hi> and <hi>Etymologie,</hi> by uſing
that Book according to the directions
already given in the <hi>Preface</hi> before it,
and cauſing him every day to write a
Chapter of it in Engliſh and Latine.</p>
                  <p>He that would be further inſtructed

to prepare his Scholars for

the ſtrength and full uſe of reaſon, muſt
conduct his young learner, to follow him
in a rational way, though he muſt not
expect him to goe <hi>aequis poſſibus,</hi> as faſt as

ſeeing a childe is ſlow of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
he muſt not be too quick in his
delivery; and ſeeing a childe is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aukward to his work, he muſt not be
too paſſionate, if he do amiſſe. <hi>Tullies</hi>

placeth in the skil of ſpecialities. And
I would adviſe him that hath to deal
with a childe, to imitate the nurſe in
helping him how to go forward, or
the Gardiner in furthering the growth
of his young plant. <hi>Eſt &amp; hac ſummi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genii
maxima infirmitas non poſſe deſcendere,</hi>
ſaith a Teacher of eloquence; <hi>Tall wits,
like long backs, cannot abide to ſtoop,</hi> but
<hi>whoſoever is a Schoole-Maſter, and would do
his duty as he ought, muſt account it a point
of wiſdom to condeſcend to a childes capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
be it never ſo mean.</hi> How have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to ſee an Artiſt (I mean a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
or the like) ſpend an hour or two
ſometimes in findeing a defect in a piece
of work, which he hath afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
in the turning of a hand; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
a more haſty work-man hath been
ready to throw the thing aſide,
and to neglect it as good for no uſe. <hi>Let
the Maſter ever mind where a childe ſticks,
and remove the impediments out of his way,
and his Scholar will take pleaſure, that he can
go on in learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>There is a great diſproportion betwixt
a Childes capacitie, and the Accidents it
ſelf.</hi> Children are lead moſt by ſenſe,
and the Grammar-rules, conſiſting in
general Doctrines are too ſubtile for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61977:42"/>
them; Childrens wits are weak, active,
and lively, whereas Grammar notions
are abſtractive, dull, and liveleſſe; boyes
finde no ſap, nor ſweetneſſe in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they know not what they mean;
and tell them the meaning of the ſame
rule never ſo often over, their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are ſo wateriſh, that the impreſſion
(if any were made in the brain) is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gone out again. Roat runneth on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace
and mindeth nothing ſo much as
play; and <hi>it is very hard to teach a childe
in doing of a thing to heed, much leſſe to judge
what he doth, till he feel ſome uſe of reaſon,</hi>
in the mean time, he will profit more
by continual practice and being kept
ſtill (as he loves to be) doing, then by
knowing why, and being called upon
to conſider the cauſes wherefore he doth
this or that.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it wil clearly appear to any that
ſhall but minde the confuſed order (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
of the verbs) and the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of ſome Rules and Examples, that,
that book was rather made to informe
thoſe of riper years, who knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Latine before, with the reaſons
of what they knew, then to direct lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones (as we do now) to uſe it as a rule
about that, whereof they are ignorant
altogether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61977:43"/>
3. <hi>It is one thing to learn the Latine Tongue,
or any other Language, &amp; another to learn the
Grammar, as a guide to it, or a means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the reaſon of it;</hi> we ſee how readily
children learn to ſpeak true and proper
Engliſh (and they may alſo do the ſame
in Latine by daily uſe and imitation of
others, long before they are able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a definition of what Grammar
is, or any thing elſe concerning it. And
the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the firſt is
a work of the imagination and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which are apt to take and keep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
having the ſenſes to help them,
but the other belongs to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
which for want of the ſtrength
of reaſon to aſſiſt it, is hard to be wrought
upon in a childe, <hi>and till the memory and
underſtanding go hand in hand, a child learns
nothing to any purpoſe.</hi> Hence it cometh
to paſſe, that Grammar-learning (as
it is generally now uſed) becometh a
a work of more difficulty and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
both to Maſter and Scholar,
then any ſtudie or employment they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
and that many have ſtriven
to contrive more facill Grammars for
their Scholars, whereas indeed the
right and conſtant uſe of any one that
is compleat, ſo as to handle the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bctje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61977:43"/>
totale</hi> of the Art, doth eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all others to its-ſelfe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the Language is ſomewhat
gained.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus premiſed, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it very neceſſary for all ſuch as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to teach Grammar to little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to cheriſh and exerciſe thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
which they ſee do ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
moſt vigorous and prompt in
them, be they memorie, phanſie, &amp;c.
and to proceed orderly and by degrees
(for ſo nature it ſelf doth) that they
may be able to hold pace with their
Teachers, and to perceive how them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
mount higher and higher, and
at every aſſcent to know where they are,
and how to adventure boldly to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of themſelves. And foraſmuch as
the Accidents is generally made uſe of as
an introduction to Latine <hi>Grammar,</hi>
(which <hi>of it ſelfe is but a bare rule,</hi> and a
very naked thing, as Mr. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lchaſter</hi> hath
well obſerved) and <hi>it is one thing to ſpeak
like a Grammarian, and another thing to
ſpeake like a Latiniſt,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> hath
noted) it is fit that both the Accidents
and the Latine tongue together ſhould
be brought within Childrens reach, and
made more familiar unto them then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61977:44"/>
formerly. And how this may be done
even with thoſe of ſeven years of age, or
under, I ſhall now go on to diſcover ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what I have tryed, and do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day ſtill put in practiſe. But this
<hi>I require</hi> aforehand (which Mr. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lchaſter</hi>
alſo wiſht for) <hi>that a childe may have his
reading perfect, and ready in both the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and Latine tongue, and that he can
write a fair hand before ever he dream of his
Grammar.</hi> For theſe will make him he
ſhall never complain of after difficulties,
but cheerefully make a wonderful rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in the reſt of his learning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The commonly received way to teach chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
the firſt Rudiments of Latine-Speech
is, to put them to read the Accidents once or
twice over, and then to let them get it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
book by ſeveral parts, not reſpecting at
all whether they underſtand it, or not.</hi> Thus
they ſpend two or three years (for the
moſt part) in a weariſome toile to no
purpoſe, not knowing all the while what
uſe they are to make of their book, nor
what the learning of ſuch a multitude
of Rules may tend to, and <hi>in the interim
of getting the Accidents by heart</hi> (if great
care be not taken) <hi>they looſe that ability of
Reading Engliſh,</hi> which they brought
from the Petty-Schoole; and this makes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61977:44"/>
the Parents cry out againſt Learning
Latine, and complain of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
not profiting at the <hi>Grammar-Schooles,</hi>
whence they are therefore
ſometimes taken and ſent back again to
a Miſtreſſe of Dame to learn Engliſh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The conſcientious Maſter all the
while ſtriveing to the uttermoſt of his
ſtrength and skil to preſerve his credit,
and not knowing well how to remedie
this miſchief otherwiſe, then by haſtning
on the Children in this common road,
doth over-toyl (if not deſtroy) himſelf,
and diſcourage (if not drive away) his
Scholars, by his too much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore made ſure that
the little Scholars can read very well,
and write plainly before-hand, put ſo
many of them as are well able to hold
pace together into one form, and begin
to <hi>teach them their Accidents in an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
manner,</hi> thus,</p>
                  <p>1. Give them a glymps or inſight into the
introduction or firſt part of it, <hi>by dividing
it into twelve parts, and making them
to take notice of the chief heads in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one; whereof, The firſt may be,</hi>
concerning the eight parts of ſpeech, of a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61977:45"/>
Noun and its kindes, of Numbers, Caſes, and
Genders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond</hi> of the Declenſions of Nounes

                  <p>
                     <hi>The third,</hi> of the declining of Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
and their compariſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth,</hi> of a Pronoune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fifth,</hi> of a Verb and its Kindes,

                  <p>
                     <hi>The tenth,</hi> Of a Participle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The eleventh,</hi> Of an Adverb.</p>

                     <hi>The twelfth,</hi> Of a Conjunction, a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and an Interjection.</p>
                  <p>By this means they ſhall know the
general terms of Grammar, and where
to turn to any Part of Speech, and to
what belongs to it in the Book. As they
get their Parts, make them one to hear
another read it over in their ſeat as they
ſit orderly; as they ſay, let every one
read a greater or leſſer ſhare, as you
pleaſe to appoint, and make the reſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to him that readeth; after they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61977:45"/>
have ſaid, one may take <hi>the examination
of the Accidents,</hi> and out of it ask the
queſtions belonging to their preſent
Part, to which the others may make
anſwer out of the words of their <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
which if they cannot readily do,
he may tell them out of his Book; and
if your ſelfe ſometime examine them in
the moſt familiar and general queſtions,
it will help them to underſtand, and
ſharpen their memories very much for
the getting of that by heart, whereof
they already know ſomewhat.</p>
                  <p>2. When they get <hi>the Introduction</hi>
memoriter, let them take but a very
little at once, that they may get it more
perfectly in a little time, and this will
be a means ſtill to hearten them on to a
new leſſon, but be ſure that every leſſon
end at a full Period; and that none may
ſeem to be overcharged or hindred, let
alwayes the weakeſt childe appoint the
task, and cauſe the ſtronger to help him
to perform it as he ought.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as your Scholars memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are yet very weak and ſlipperie, it
is not amiſſe to help them by more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Repetitions, eſpecially at the end
of every part of ſpeech, which they
ſhould examine ſo often over, till they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61977:46"/>
can anſwer to any thing, that is in their
book concerning it. Then let them
proceed to the next in like manner, not
forgetting to recall the more general
and neceſſary points to memory from
the very beginning, and this will be a
meanes to make them keep all freſh in
minde, and to be able to tell you what
Part of Speech any word is which you
ſhall name, either in Engliſh or Latine,
and what belongs to it, which is one
main end for which the introduction
was made; you may now and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
them in diſtinguiſhing the eight
Parts of Speech, by giving them a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
and after they have writ it out,
making them to mark every word what
part of Speech it by theſe figures, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>3. But as they get the introduction by
heart, and learn to anſwer to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
raiſed out of it, an eſpecial care and
paines muſt be taken ever and anon,
<hi>to make them very perfect in declining
Nounes, and formeing Verbs. Let them</hi>
therefore as it were by by-tasks, <hi>get the
examples of the Nounes, and Verbs very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
which are ſet down in their Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>Firſt let them decline the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61977:46"/>
ſeverally or joyntly,</hi> for by theſe they
may know the Gender, Caſe, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of a Noun, though many learned
Grammarians of late do leave them off
as uſeleſſe. <hi>Harum Muſarum</hi> was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as much as to ſay that <hi>Muſarum</hi> is of
the Feminine Gender, Genitive Caſe,
and Plural Number; And whereas
the Rule beginneth with the Genitive
Caſe, do you ſupply the Nominative
thus,</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Cauſe them with every example to
joyn the Rule of the Declenſion,</hi> and thereby
to know the due Termination of every
caſe in both Numbers, ſaying the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
ſometimes before, and ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Latine, the Nom. caſe ſingular of

in <hi>ae,</hi> as Huic <hi>Muſae,</hi> to a ſong,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Let them give you the bare Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of every declenſion in each caſe in both
numbers,</hi> as to ſay, The Terminations
of the firſt declenſion throughout all

Nom. <hi>a,</hi> Gen. <hi>ae.</hi> Dat. <hi>ae,</hi> Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Terminations of the Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61977:47"/>
caſe ſingular of the five Declenſions
are, of the firſt, <hi>a.</hi> of the ſecond <hi>r, us, um-</hi>
of the third <hi>a, c, e, i, l, n, o, r, s, t, x.</hi> of
the fourth <hi>us.</hi> of the fifth <hi>es.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Terminations of the Genitive
caſe ſingular of the five Declenſions are,
Of the firſt <hi>ae,</hi> the ſecond <hi>i,</hi> the third
<hi>is,</hi> the fourth <hi>us,</hi> the fifth <hi>ei, &amp;c.</hi>
And let them take eſpecial notice of
the endings of the Genitive caſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
becauſe thereby they may know
of what declenſion a Noun is, when
they find it in a Vocabulary, or Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Furniſh them out of their Vocabularie</hi>
or otherwiſe, <hi>with ſtore of examples for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſeveral Declenſion,</hi> till they can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
decline any regular Noune; but
then eſpecially mind them of the Voca.
ſingular of thoſe Nounes that end in <hi>us</hi> of
the ſecond Declenſion, and of thoſe that
are of the neuter Gender, of the ſecond,
third, or 4th declenſion, and what caſes
they make all alike in both numbers.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Exerciſe them in declining Nounes ſo
often, till they can tell you at once the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of any caſe in either number in one or
all the declenſions, and ſay on a ſuddain
what any Noune you name to them doth make
in any one caſe of each Number in Engliſh
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61977:47"/>
or Latine.</hi> As, if you ask them of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion,
caſe and number this termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>os</hi> is, they can preſently anſwer,
that <hi>os</hi> is of the ſecond declenſion, Accu.
caſe and plural number; or, if you
ask them of what Declenſion, Caſe
and Number <hi>virtute</hi> is, they can
anſwer, that <hi>virtute</hi> is of the third
declenſion, the Ablative caſe and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
number. So in Engliſh, if you
ſhould ſay <hi>with a pen,</hi> they can tell you
it is the Ablative caſe and ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and therefore muſt be ſaid in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<hi>Penna.</hi> Or if in Latine you ſhould
ſay <hi>pennas,</hi> they can tell you it is of the
accuſative caſe plural number, and muſt
be ſaid in Engliſh <hi>pennes or the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>In declining Adjectives cauſe them
to minde to what declenſion their ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
belong,</hi> and after they can parſe
every Gender alone by it ſelf, teach
them joyn it to a ſubſtantive of the
ſame or a different declenſion, with the
Engliſh either before or after the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61977:48"/>
                     <hi>feliciſsimi</hi> of moſt happy, &amp;c. then teach
them to joyn a Subſtantive with any one
or all of the Degrees, thus, <hi>Injuſtus pater,</hi>
a harſh father, <hi>iujusta mater,</hi> an unjuſt
mother, <hi>injuſtum animal,</hi> an unjuſt creature.
<hi>Indoctus puer,</hi> an unlearned boy. <hi>Indoctior
puella</hi> a more unlearned girle. <hi>Indoctiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
vulgus</hi> the moſt unlearned common
people.</p>
                  <p>8. To help them the better to perform
this profitable exerciſe of themſelves,
<hi>let them ſometimes write a Noun,</hi> which you
appoint them, <hi>at large, and distinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt</hi>
that part of it which is moveable,
and that which is immoveable; I mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>the fore-part of the word, and its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
thus: Sing. Nom. <hi>Menſ-a</hi> a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Gen. <hi>Menſ-ae</hi> to a Table. Dat. <hi>Menſ-ae,</hi>
to a Table, &amp;c. to the end.</p>
                  <p>Thus likewiſe they may be exerciſed
in writing out Subſtantives, and Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
and forming the degrees of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
with which work they will be
exceedingly much delighted, when once
they can write, and by once writing, they
will better diſcern what they do, then by
ten times telling over; which makes me
again preſſe hard, that either a child may
be able to write before he be put to the
Grammar Schoole, or elſe be put to learn
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61977:49"/>
to write ſo ſoon as he comes thither. For
beſides the confuſed diſorder it will
make in a Schoole, when ſome children
are fitted to undergoe their taskes, and
others are not, <hi>they that can write, ſhall
be ſure to profit in Grammar learning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they that cannot, will do little</hi> but diſturb
the Schoole, and hinder their fellowes,
and bring a ſhame upon their Maſter, and
a blame upon themſelves, becauſe they do
not learn faſter. And, alas poor child,
how ſhould he be made to go that wants
his legges? if he go upon crutches, it is
but lamely. And how ſhould he be taught
Grammar, which is the Art of right wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as well as ſpeaking, that cannot
write at all? I wiſh they that take upon
them to teach boyes Grammar before
they can write, would but take upon them
the trouble to teach one to ſpeak well,
that cannot ſpeak at all. But I ſay no
more of this ſubject, for though what I
ſay have ſeemed to ſome a meer Paradox,
yet upon triall, they have found it a plain
reall Truth; and ſuch as nay man in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
will aſſent to.</p>
                  <p>As for that which is generally objected,
that whilſt children are young, their
hands are unſteady, and therefore they
ſhould go on at their books, till they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61977:49"/>
grow more firm; it will quickly be found
a meer idle phanſie, when ſuch objecters
ſhall ſee leſſe children then their own eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day practiſe fair writing, and make
more ſpeedy progreſſe at their books by
ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now</hi> touching verbs.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Be ſure that children be well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the different kinds of them,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
both by ſignification and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>as alſo with their Moods, Tenſes, and
Signes of them, and with the characteriſtical
letters of the four conjugations</hi> (which are <hi>a</hi>
long, and <hi>e</hi> long, and <hi>e</hi> ſhort, and <hi>i</hi> long.)
And as they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ugate a verb, let them
take more particular notice of its Preſent
tenſe, Preterperfect tenſe, and firſt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
becauſe of theſe, all other tenſes
are formed; and theſe therefore are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in every Dictionary.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Let them firſt repeat over the verb Sum,
according to four Moods onely,</hi> (the Optative,
Potential, and Subjunctive being the
ſame in all verbs) becauſe it hath a proper
manner of declincing, and is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
uſed, and will be helpful to form
the Pretertenſes in the Paſsive voyce,
which conſiſt of a Participle joyned
with it.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Let them get the Active voyce ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61977:50"/>
by heart, and afterwards the Paſſive,</hi>
(though they do it more leaſurely, taking
but one Mood at a leſſon) <hi>and</hi> let them not
now repeat the paradigmes as they ſtand
confuſedly together in their book, but
<hi>ſever them one from another,</hi> and go on with
one at once, <hi>viz. Amo,</hi> by it ſelf, <hi>Doceo,</hi>
by it ſelf, <hi>Lego</hi> by it ſelf, and <hi>Audio</hi> by it
ſelf, thorow all Moods, Tenſes, Numbers,
and Perſons, giving the Engliſh with the
Latine, ſometimes putting the one before,
and ſometimes the other. <hi>And be ſure to
make them mind all the ſignes in Engliſh, and
the terminations anſwering to them in
Latine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Then <hi>teach them to form only the firſt
perſon ſingular of every conjugation ſeverally,</hi>
both with Latine before Engliſh, and
Engliſh before Latine; as, <hi>Amo</hi> I love, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabam</hi>
I did love, &amp;c. or I love <hi>Amo,</hi> I
did love <hi>Amabam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Cauſe them</hi> again <hi>to form onely the
Preſent tenſe, with the tenſes that depend
more</hi> immediately <hi>upon it,</hi> and <hi>then the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tenſe, with thoſe that are formed of it.</hi>
And give them here to obſerve the Rule in
their Accidents touching the Formation
of the Tenſes, which is more eaſie to be
delivered and remembred, thus; All ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that end in <hi>ram, rim, ſſem, ro, ſſe,</hi> are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61977:50"/>
formed of the Preter tenſe, and all the reſt
of the Preſent tenſe, according to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
verſe.</p>
                  <q>Ram, rim, ſſem, ro, ſſe; formabit caetera
Praeſens.</q>
                  <p>6. <hi>Make them to give you the terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the firſt perſon ſingular throughout all
Moods and Tenſes, of each ſeverall Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as to ſay, The terminations of the
firſt perſons ſingular in the firſt Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are <hi>o, abam, avi, averam, abo,</hi> &amp;c. Then
let them run over the Terminations of all
the Perſons in both Numbers of every
Mood and Tenſe in the ſeverall Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
as to ſay; The Terminations of the
Indicative Mood Preſent tenſe of the firſt
Conjugation are, <hi>o, as, at, amus, atis, ant.</hi>
Of the Preterimperfect-tenſe, <hi>abam, abas,
abat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Let them joyn the Terminations of the
firſt perſon, with the ſignes of every Tenſe in
both voyces,</hi> thus, <hi>o</hi> do, <hi>bam,</hi> did, <hi>i</hi> have
<hi>ram</hi> had <hi>bo</hi> ſhall or will, &amp;c. <hi>or</hi> am, <hi>bar,</hi>
was, <hi>us ſum vel tui,</hi> have been, <hi>us eram vel
fueram,</hi> had been, <hi>bor,</hi> ſhall be, &amp;c. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Conjugations. And let them
withall take notice how the three perſons
in both numbers differ both in ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ending, as I <hi>o</hi> and <hi>r,</hi> thou <hi>s</hi> and
<hi>ris,</hi> he <hi>t</hi> and <hi>tur,</hi> we <hi>mus</hi> and <hi>mur,</hi> ye <hi>tis</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61977:51"/>
and <hi>ni,</hi> they <hi>nt</hi> or <hi>ntur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Let them repeat the Active and the
Paſſive voyce together, and compare them one
with another,</hi> as they form them in all
perſons throughtout each Mood and Tenſe
of every Conjugation, thus; <hi>Amo</hi> I love,
<hi>Amor</hi> I am loved. <hi>Amabam</hi> I did love,
<hi>Amabar</hi> I was loved, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Exerciſe them well in ſo many ſeverall
examples of the four Conjugations,</hi> as that
on a ſuddain they can render you any
Verb out of Latine into Engliſh, or out of
Engliſh into Latine, with its right Mood,
Tenſe, Number, and perſon, you telling
them the firſt word of it, or they knowing
it before-hand, as if you ſay <hi>we have run,</hi>
they can anſwer <hi>cucurrimus;</hi> or if you ſay,
<hi>I ſhall blot,</hi> they can anſwer <hi>maculabo,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
learnt that <hi>Curro</hi> is Latine for <hi>to run;</hi>
and that <hi>maculo</hi> ſignifieth <hi>to blot.</hi> To
make them more fully acquainted with
the variation of a verb, it were good ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for them to write one out at full
length, both in Engliſh and Latine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a line betwixt the alterable part of
it, and the termination (which remaineth
alike to all, thus, <hi>Voc-o</hi> I call, <hi>voc-as</hi> thou
calleſt, <hi>voc-at</hi> he calleth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N. B. The Nouns and Verbs being</hi> thus
<hi>perfectly gotten</hi> at the firſt, (till which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61977:51"/>
be done, the Preface before the Grammar
counteth not the Scholar ready to go any
further, and ſaith it may be done with a
quarter of a years diligence, or very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more) <hi>the difficulty of the Latine tongue
will be quite over-paſt,</hi> and a childe will
more ſurely and heedfully learn them
thus ſingly by themſelves, then by long
practice in parſing and making Latine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then he is to attend many other
things together with them, for the better
obſervation whereof, theſe will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
prepare him.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe all children are not ſo
quick-witted, as fully to apprehend the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
alteration of the Nouns and Verbs,
till after long and continued practice, it
were good if a time were ſet apart once a
week, wherein all the Scholars (eſpecially
of the three lower forms, and thoſe in
the upper that are leſs expert, as having
perhaps come from a Schoole wherein
they were never thus exerciſed) may be
conſtantly employed in this moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exerciſe. And for more ready diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
amongſt a multitude, it is not amiſs
if they repeat them thorow in a round
word by word, ſaying every one in order
after another, thus: 1. Sing. Nom <hi>Muſa,</hi> a
Song, 2. Gen. <hi>Muſae</hi> of a Song. 3. Dat. <hi>Muſae</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61977:52"/>
to a Song, 4. Accuſ. <hi>Muſam</hi> the ſong, &amp;c. till
they have gone thorow all the Declenſions,
and Conjugations, and the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
variety of practice upon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as we may obſerve <hi>Corderius</hi> in
his Colloquies, to have given us a hint.
And to ſtirre them all up to more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs,
the Maſter may (unexpectedly
ſometimes) aske the caſe of a Noun, or
the Mood and Tenſe of a Verb, of one
that he eſpieth more negligent in mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then the reſt.</p>
                  <p>As an Help to the better performance of
this neceſsary task, I provided a little
book of one ſheet, containing <hi>the Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Examples of the Declenſions, and
Conjugations,</hi> which the leſs experienced
may make uſe of, till they can exerciſe
themſelves without it; by the frequent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
and ready ſale whereof, I gueſs
it hath not been unacceptable to thoſe of
my profeſſion, for the purpoſe whereto I
intended it: and I have ſometimes in one
afternoon made a thorow practice of all
that hath here been mentioned touching
Nouns and Verbs, without any weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs
at all to my ſelf, or irkſomneſs
to my Scholars, who are generally impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of any long work, if it be not full of
variety, and eaſy to be performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61977:52"/>
Some little paines would alſo be taken
with <hi>the Pronounes,</hi> ſo as to ſhew their
number, diſtinction, manner, of declining
both in Engliſh and Latine, and their
perſons: and then with the Participles
to mind how their four tenſes are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
both by their ſignification and
ending, and how they are declined,
like Adjectives.</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>Adverbs, Conjunctions,</hi> and
<hi>Interjections,</hi> they need only to tell of what
ſignification they are; and touching <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi>
let them obſerve which ſerve to
an Accuſative caſe, which to an Ablative,
and which to both.</p>
                  <p>Now for the more orderly diſpatch of
this firſt part of the Accidents and the
better learning of every part of it, not by
rote, but by reaſon; and to make chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
more cunning in the underſtanding
of the things, then in rehearſing of the
words, and to faſten it well in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories;
I have found it very profitable to
ſet apart two afternoons in a week (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes) for
the examination of it all quite thorow,
cauſing one ſide of a Form to ask the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
out of <hi>the examination of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
and the other to anſwer according
to the words of their book, and whether
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61977:53"/>
they do this exactly <hi>memoriter,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
looking upon the book, it makes no
matter; for the often practiſe hereof, will
be ſure to fix it after a little while in their
underſtanding and memories ſo faſt, that
they will have it ready for uſe, againſt
they come to the ſecond part of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
which concerneth Concordance
and Conſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N. B.</hi> When children firſt begin their
Introduction, they may provide <hi>a little
vocabulary</hi> (if the <hi>Orbis Pictus</hi> be too dear,
out of which they ſhould be made to read
over a Chapter every day, at one or four a
clock, and when it is read over you may
ſee who can give you the moſt names of
things under one head, both Engliſh and
Latine, and let him that tells you the moſt,
have ſome little reward for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to draw on others in hope of the
like, to do as well as he. This profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exerciſe was often uſed by <hi>Corderius,</hi>
and is an excellent mean to help children
to ſtore of words, which are indeed the
ſubject about which Grammar is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
ſo that <hi>to teach one Grammar with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving him ſome knowledge of words, is
to teach him to tye a knot, that hath not a
string to tye it upon.</hi> They may ſay the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction</hi>
for parts, and <hi>the Vocabulary</hi> for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61977:53"/>
leſsons, (as you pleaſe) and when ever
they go out about neceſsitous buſineſs, be
ſure they ſay (at leaſt) four words of
thoſe which they have learnt, and let
them alwayes carry their <hi>Vocabulary</hi> about
with them, to be looking into it for
words.</p>
                  <p>Thus then I allow one half year for
boyes in the loweſt form, that can read
and write before hand, to learn <hi>the first
part of the Accidents,</hi> and how to call
things by their Latine names, making uſe
of <hi>a Vocabulary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then I would have them divide
the whole <hi>Introduction</hi> into twelve parts,
(as they did at the firſt reading of it over)
and repeat conſtantly every morning one
by heart, to fix it well in the memory:
and for fore-noon leſſons (to be ſaid about
ten of clock) they may proceed to <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the Accidents,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Engliſh Rules,</hi> for the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and exerciſe whereof, they may
profitably ſpend the ſucceeding halfe
year.</p>
                  <p>In getting whereof, becauſe cuſtome
hath every where carried it (contrary to
thoſe excellent directions given in the
Preface to the Reader, of which Mr. <hi>Hayne</hi>
mentioneth <hi>Cardinal W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the Authour) for children firſt to read
them over, and afterwards to con them
by heart as they ſtand in the book, (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it a work meerly for the memory,
which ſome children are good at, though
they underſtand nothing at all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many unskilful Maſters, not knowing
how to do otherwiſe, eſpecially with
boyes that cannot write, let them run on
by rote, preſuming that when they have
got the Rules thus, they may be afterwards
made to underſtand them by practiſe in
parſing) I will go along with the ſtream,
and allow my Scholars to get them by
heart, ſaying two or three Rules at a
time, as they do in moſt ſchooles; and as
they do this, I would have them chiefly
to take notice of the Titles, or Heads, and
which are the general Rules, and which
are the Obſervations, and Exceptions
made concerning it, that by this meanes
they may learn to turn readily to any one
of them that ſhall be called for. But that
children may beſt underſtand, and ſooneſt
conceive the reaſon of the Rules, and
thereby be made acquainted with the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of the Latine Tongue, (which is the
main ſcope that this part of the Accidents
aimeth at) I would have them daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<hi>in the practice of Concordance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61977:54"/>
(which will alſo confirm and
ready them in the Introduction) after this
manner.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Let them mark out the more generall
and neceſſary Rules</hi> (as they go along)
<hi>with their examples,</hi> and after they have
got them perfectly by heart, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue
and parſe the words in the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and apply the Rule to the words to
which it belongeth, and wherein its force
lyeth.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Let them have ſo many other examples
beſides thoſe</hi> that are <hi>in their book,</hi> as may
clearly illuſtrate and evidence the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Rule, and let them make it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their own by practiſing upon it, either
in imitating their preſent examples, or
propounding others as plain. Thus that
examples to the Rule of the firſt Concord
may be firſt imitated; <hi>Praeceptor legit, vos
vero negligitis. The Master readeth; and ye
regard not. The Pastors preach, and people
regard not. I ſpeak, and ye hear not. We
have read, and thou mindeſt not.</hi> And the
like may be propounded, as, <hi>whilest the Cat
ſleepeth, the Mice dance. When the Maſter is
away, the boyes will play. Thou neglecteſt,
when I write.</hi> And theſe the children
ſhould make out of Engliſh into Latine,
unto which you ſhould ſtill adde more,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61977:55"/>
till they be able by themſelves to practiſe
according to the Rule.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>After they have thus gone over the
general Rules,</hi> Let them together with one
Rule get its exceptions, and obſervations, as
they lie in order, <hi>and learn how they differ
from the Rule, and</hi> be ſure that they construe
and parſe every example, and imitate, and
make another agreeable to the Rule, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
or exception, as is ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>N. B. Now foraſmuch as little ones
are too too apt to forget any thing that
hath been told them concerning the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a rule and the like, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are of more leaſurely apprehenſions
then others, that require a little conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a thing before they can conceive it
rightly, they may be helped by making
uſe of <hi>the ſecond part of the Accidents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined;</hi>
wherein,</p>
                  <p>1. The Rules are delivered by eaſie
and ſhort queſtions and anſwers, and all
the examples are Engliſhed, and the words
wherein the force of the example lyeth
are applyed to the rule.</p>
                  <p>2. The examples are Grammatically
conſtrued, and all the firſt words in them
ſet down in the margent, and referred to
an Index, which ſheweth what part of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61977:55"/>
Speech they are, and how to be declined
or conjugated. This I contrived at the firſt
as a means to prevent Childrens gadding
out of their places, under a pretence of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abler boyes to help them in conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and parſing theſe examples, but upon
tryal I found it a great eaſe to my ſelf for
telling the ſame things often over, and a
notable encouragement to my Scholars to
go about their leſſons, who alwayes go
merrilier about their task, when they
know how to reſolve themſelves in any
thing they doubt.</p>
                  <p>4. When they have got the ſecond
Part of the Accidents well by heart, and
underſtand it (at leaſt) ſo far as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to give you any rule you call for, you
may divide it alſo into eight parts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the heads ſet down in the book,
whereof, the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, May be</hi> concerning the firſt, ſecond,
and third Concord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond,</hi> concerning the caſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,
and the Construction of Subſtantives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third,</hi> concerning the Conſtruction of
Adjectives, and of a Pronoune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth,</hi> concerning the conſtruction of
Verbs with a Nominative, and Genitive
Caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fifth,</hi> concerning the conſtruction of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61977:56"/>
Verbs with a Dative, Accuſative and Abla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſixth,</hi> concerning the conſtruction of
Paſſives, Gerunds and Supines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſeventh,</hi> concerning time, ſpace,
place and imperſonals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The eighth,</hi> concerning the Participle, the
Adverb, the Conjunction, the Praepoſition, and
the Interjection; <hi>which being added to the
foregoing twelve,</hi> the whole Accidents may
be eaſily paſſed over at twenty Parts, and kept
ſurely in mind by repeating it once a moneth
for morning Parts, and examining it every
Tueſday and Thurſday in the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>As they made uſe of the <hi>Vocabulary,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the firſt part of the Accidents, ſo
may they joyn <hi>Sententiae Puerilis,</hi> with the
ſecond; which book I would have them
to provide both in Engliſh and Latine.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe it renders the Book more
grateful to Children, who by reading their
Leſſons in their Mothers tongue, know
better what to make of them.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe they are apt to miſtake
what they have been conſtrued, eſpecially
in words that have various ſignifications.</p>
                  <p>3. Their memories being ſhort, they
muſt be told the ſame word as oft as they
ask it ere they come to ſay, and when they
come (perhaps) they cannot conſtrue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61977:56"/>
one Sentence to any purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>As they learn this book, let them but
take three or four lines at once, which
they ſhould,</p>
                  <p>1. Conſtrue out of Latine into Egn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and then out of Engliſh into Latine.</p>
                  <p>2. Decline the Nounes and form the
Verbs in it throughout, and give the rules
for the concordance and conſtruction of
the Words.</p>
                  <p>3. Bring their leſſons fair writ out
both in Engliſh and Latine in a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
book, which will exceedingly further
them in ſpelling and writing truly.</p>
                  <p>4. To fix their Leſſons the better in
their memorie, you may ask them ſuch
plain queſtions, as they can eaſily anſwer
by the words in the Sentence.</p>
                  <p>5. Let them alſo imitate a Sentence
ſometimes by changing ſome of the
words, and ſometimes altering their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
                  <p>6. Give them ſometimes the Engliſh
of a Sentence to make into Latine of
themſelves, and then let them compare it
with the Latine in the book, and ſee
wherein they come ſhort of it, or in what
Rule they faile.</p>
                  <p>For though the main end of this Book,
which is full of plain leſsons, both of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61977:57"/>
and godlineſs, be to inſtill thoſe
grave ſayings into childrens minds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſome
of which notwithſtanding are too much
beyond their reach) and it be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſo uſeful as ſome others are for the
ſpeedy gaining of Latine, yet by being
thus made uſe of, it may be very much
improved to both purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Here I think it no digreſſion to tell,
how I and ſome School-fellowes (yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and eminent in their Scholar-like
profeſſions) were nuſled two or three years
together in learning this book of Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
After we had gone over our <hi>Accidents</hi>
ſeveral times by heart, and had learned
part of <hi>Propria quae maribus,</hi> we were put
into this Book, and there made to conſtrue
and parſe two or three Sentences at once
out of meer Latine, and if in any thing we
miſsed, we were ſure to be whipt. It was
well, if of 16. or 20. boyes two at any time
could ſay, and that they did ſay right,
was more by hap-hazard, then any thing
that they knew; For we knew not how
to apply one rule of Grammar to any
word, nor could we tell what part of
Speech it was, or what belonged to it; but
if the Maſter told us it was a Noun, to be
ſure we ſaid it was of the Nominative
caſe, and ſingular number, and if a Verb,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61977:57"/>
we preſently gueſsed it to be of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
Mood, Preſent tenſe, ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and third perſon; becauſe thoſe
coming ſo frequent, we erred the leſſe in
them. And an ignorant preſumption that
we could eaſily ſay, made us ſpend our
time in idle chat, or worſe employment;
and we thought it in vain for us to labour
about getting a leſson, becauſe we had no
help at all provided to further us in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Yet here and there a Sentence, that
I better underſtood then the reſt, and with
which I was more affected, took ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impreſſion,
as that I ſtill remember it, as
<hi>Gallus in ſuo ſtirquilinio plurimum poteſt. Vbi
dolor, ibi digitus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This I have related by the by, to
manifeſt by mine own ſenſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
what ſeverity children for the moſt
part undergo, and what loſs of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
them in their beſt age for learning,
when they are meerly driven on in the
common rode, and are not (rather) guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a dexterous, diligent, and diſcreet
Teacher, to underſtand what they learn in
any book they are put into.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe <hi>all our teaching is but meer
trifling, unleſſe withall we be carefull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
children in the grounds of true Religion,</hi>
let them be ſure to get the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61977:58"/>
                     <hi>Creed,</hi> and the <hi>ten Commandements;</hi> Firſt
in Engliſh, and then in Latine, every Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
morning for Leſsons, from their firſt
entrace to the Grammar Schoole; and for
their better underſtanding of theſe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Chriſtianity, you may (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Mr. <hi>Bernards</hi> little Catechiſme) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
them into ſuch eaſy queſtions, as they
may be able to anſwer of themſelves, and
give them the Quotations, or Texts of
Scriptures, which confirm or explain the
doctrinal points contained in them, to
write out the following Lords day, and
to ſhow on Monday mornings, when
they come to Schoole. In ſhort then, I
would have this loweſt Form employed
one quarter or half a year in getting the
<hi>Introduction</hi> for Parts and Leſsons, and as
long in repeating the <hi>Introduction</hi> at Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parts, and reading the <hi>Vocabulary,</hi> for
After-noons <hi>Parts;</hi> ſaying <hi>the Engliſh
Rules</hi> for Fore-noon Leſsons. <hi>The little
Vocabulary</hi> for After-noon Parts; and <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae
Pueriles</hi> for Afternoon Leſsons, and
the <hi>Principles of Christianity</hi> for Saturday
Leſsons. So that in one years time this
work may be fully compleat, of preparing
them for the Latine tongue, by teaching
them the perfect uſe of the <hi>Accidents,</hi> and
helping them to words, and how to vary
them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THe general courſe taken in teaching the
Rules of the Genders and Nouns, and
Conjugating Verbs,</hi> is, to make children
to <hi>patter them over by heart, and ſometimes
alſo to construe and parſe them;</hi> but ſeldom
or never are they taught the meaning of a
Rule, or how to apply it readily to the
words they meet with elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>The volubility of the Verſe doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
help ſome quicker wits for more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
repeating of them; but others of more
ſlow pace, (that learn better by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what they ſay) are apt to miſcall
every word in their Leſſon, becauſe they
cannot tell what it meaneth; and let
them, take never ſo much pains about
it, very little of what they are to learn,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61977:59"/>
will ſtick in their memories.</p>
                  <p>Some therefore have decryed this
patching of Rules into a cobling verſe;
others have thought it better to denote
the Genders of Nouns, and the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
tenſes of Verbs by the Termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the firſt words, and ſome have
quite altered theſe Rules by expunging
ſome words, and inſerting others, which
they thought might better agree with
them; But for my part, I like his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
well, that ſaid it was impoſſible
for any Grammarian to make better
Rules then theſe in <hi>Propria quae maribus,</hi>
and <hi>As in praeſenti;</hi> for though in ſome
things they may be faulty, as <hi>Quae genus</hi>
is in very many, yet (as Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi> ſaith
<hi>of the Accidents) a wiſe Maſter is not to ſtand
with his children about mending of it, but only
to make them understand the Rules, as they
are ſet down in the Book,</hi> which that they
may well do, I propound this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
                  <p>1. Let them for Fore-noon Leſſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with <hi>Propria quae maribus,</hi> and then
proceed to <hi>As in praeſenti,</hi> leaving <hi>Quae ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
to the laſt, becauſe it is of leſſe uſe, and
harder for children to underſtand.</p>
                  <p>2. In getting theſe Rules at firſt, let
them read them all diſtinctly over, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61977:59"/>
take notice of the Titles or Heads, and
mark out the moſt general Rules, which
they may learn before any of the reſt; And
to make them the better to underſtand
themſelves, you may allow them <hi>an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Propria quae maribus,</hi> &amp;c. which they
may compare all along with that in their
Grammar, and if at any time you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
they do not well apprehend the
meaning of a Rule, do you illuſtrate it by
inſtancing ſome words, that they have
had in their Vocabulary, or elſewhere.
This will make them ſomewhat ready
to turn to any Rule.</p>
                  <p>3. At the next going them over, they
will be able to ſay four or ſix lines at a
time, <hi>memoriter.</hi> And then you may let
them get all before them, and make them
after they have ſaid a Leſſon by heart, to
conſtrue it by the help of a <hi>Construing-book,</hi>
and to decline every Noun, and
Conjugate every verb, by the help of the
<hi>Indexes</hi> annexed to the <hi>Propria quae mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Engliſhed, and explained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>You may exerciſe them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by repeating more and more at a
time, till they can decline Nouns, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate
Verbs, and apply the Rules readily
to them; &amp; having thus gained them, you
may keep them, by dividing the whole

<hi>If you adde theſe ten to
the twenty parts in the Accidents,</hi> they
may run over the whole thirty in ſix weeks;
<hi>ſaying every morning one, except on
Saturdays, which are reſerved for other
occaſions. Their Noon-parts may be
in</hi> the larger Vocabulary <hi>(which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
printed with the grounds of
Grammar,</hi> in an eaſie entrance to the Latine
Tongue, <hi>in which they may peruſe a
whole Chapter at once, and afterwards
ſtrive who can tell you Latine for the
moſt things mentioned in it. And if
at any time the words be not ſo obvious
to their underſtanding, becauſe (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
they know not the things which

thing is, and explain the word by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is more familiar to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their After-noons Leſſons on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
and Wedneſdayes, may be in <hi>Qui
mihi,</hi> which containeth pretty Precepts
of good manners, much befitting chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to obſerve, and which are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in every mean Scholars mouth,
that a childe would bluſh to ſeem igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them. In getting this,</p>
                  <p>1. Let them repeat two diſtichs at
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61977:61"/>
once <hi>memoriter,</hi> and if withall, you let
them get the Engliſh verſes anſwerable
to the Latine, and printed with <hi>the
Grounds of Grammar,</hi> they will fix the
Latine better in their memories.</p>
                  <p>2. Let them conſtrue the Leſſon
Grammatically, and to help themſelves
in that more difficult work, let them
make uſe of the conſtruction made
them at the end of their <hi>Conſtruing-Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Let them read the Latine in the
Grammatical order, and ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
meer Engliſh, and then let them
parſe every word according to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
giving the Rules for the Genders
of Nouns, and the Preterperfect tenſes,
and Supines of verbs; and applying
thoſe of Concordance and Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they come in their way.</p>
                  <p>4. To exerciſe them in true writing,
it were good if they had <hi>a little paper-book,</hi>
wherein to write firſt the Latine,
and then the Engliſh diſtichs at full
length, which they may ſhew, when
they ſay their Leſſon.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>To finde them ſome employment
after the Leſſon, you may give them
ſome eaſie dictate out of it to turn into
Latine; ſometimes by way of Queſtion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61977:61"/>
and Anſwer, and ſometimes more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively;
thus,</hi> What ſhall that Scholar do that
deſireth to be taught? He ſhall conceive the
Maſters ſayings in his minde. Quid faciet
ille diſcipulus, qui cupit doceri? dicta prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptoris
animo ſuo concipiet, <hi>or thus;</hi> A boy
that is a Scholar, and deſireth to be taught,
ought to conceive the Maſters ſayings in his
minde, and ſo as to underſtand them well-Puer
qui diſcipulus eſt &amp; cupit doceri, dictae
praeceptoris animo ſuo concipere debet, atque
ita ut eadem recte intelligat. <hi>And this you
may cauſe any one of them to read, and
let the reſt correct him in any word he
hath made amiſſe, and be ſure they can
all give a rule for what they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After they have repeated theſe verſes
of Mr. <hi>Lilies</hi> ſo often over, that they can
ſay them all at once pretty well by
heart, they may continue their After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons
Leſſons in <hi>Cato,</hi> ſaying two or
three Diſtichs at once, according to the
directions already given in the Preface
to that Book in Engliſh and Latine
verſe; and when they have gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a book of it, let them try amongſt
themſelves who can repeat the moſt of
it by heart, as we ſee <hi>Corderius</hi> did
ſometimes exerciſe his Scholars, as it
appeareth by his Colloquies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61977:62"/>
                     <hi>Now foraſmuch as</hi> ſpeaking Latine is
the main end of Grammar, and there is no
better expedient to help children in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
exerciſe thereof, then frequent peruſal of
Vocabularies for common words, and Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
for familiar phraſes, <hi>and ſuch as are
to be uſed in ordinary diſcourſe; I
think it very convenient to make uſe of</hi>
Pueriles Confabi latiunculae, both in Engliſh
and Latine, <hi>on Tueſdayes and Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
in the Afternoons inſtead of Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
thus,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Let them read a whole Colloquie (if
it be not too long) at once both in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and Latine, not minding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue
it verbatim at the firſt going it
over, but to render the expreſſions
wholly as they ſtand, and are anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one to another, and this will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with the matter in the
book, and enable them to read both
the Languages more readily.</p>
                  <p>2. At a ſecond going over, let them
conſtrue it Grammatically, and then
take any phraſe or ſentence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Leſſon, and make ſuch another by
it, changeing either the words, or
ſome of their Accidents, as the preſent
occaſion requireth; ex gr. As they
ſay in the ſingular Number: <hi>God ſave
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61977:62"/>
you, Salve, Sis ſalvus, jubeo te ſalvere,</hi> or
<hi>ave;</hi> ſo make them ſay in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>God ſave you, Salvete, ſitis ſalvi, jube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
vos ſalvere,</hi> or <hi>avete.</hi> So likewiſe
when they can ſay, <hi>I thank you, Habeo
tibi gratiam, or habetur tibi a me gratia,</hi>
let them imitate, and alter it by ſaying,
<hi>We thank your Father. Habemus Patri tuo
gratiam. My Mother thanks you, Sir. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
habet tibi gratiam, Domine;</hi> or <hi>Habetur
tibi, Domine, a matre mea gratia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they have gone this book ſo
often over, as to be well acquainted
with its phraſes, Let them proceed to
<hi>Corderius Colloquies,</hi> which they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in Engliſh and Latine, and which
they may conſtrue Grammatically, and
cull the phraſes out of it, to make
uſe of them, in common ſpeaking La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
                  <p>Let them have <hi>a little paper-book,</hi>
wherein to gather the more familiar
phraſes, which they finde in every Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
printed in a different character, and
let them by often peruſal at ſpare
times, and bearing them alwayes about
them, get them ſo readily by heart, as
to be able to expreſſe themſelves in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
by them upon any meet occaſion.
And this way of <hi>exerciſing them to ſpeak
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61977:63"/>
according to their Authours expreſſions from
their firſt entrance upon Latine, is the beſt
expedient that can be taken to avoyd Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes,</hi>
which otherwiſe they are very
prone to, ſo long as they are directed
only by Grammar-Rules, and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſeek words in the Dictionary,
where commonly they light upon that
which is moſt improper.</p>
                  <p>And that they may now do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of themſelves by way of night ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
let them every evening tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
a verſe at home out of the 119.
Pſalm, which I conceive is the moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
for the purpoſe of making the three
Concords, and ſome of the more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Rules of conſtruction familiar to
them. In making their Tranſlations,</p>
                  <p>1. Let them be ſure to write the
Engliſh very fair and true, obſerving
its juſt pauſes, and let them alſo make
the like notes of diſtinction in their
Latine.</p>
                  <p>2. When they come to ſhew their
Latines,</p>
                  <p>1. Let one read and conſtrue a verſe.</p>
                  <p>2. Let another tell you what part of
ſpeech every word is, as well Engliſh as
Latine, and what the Engliſh Signes do
note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:61977:63"/>
3. Let the reſt in order give you the
right Analyſis of every word one by
one, and the Rules of Nouns and Verbs,
and of Concordance, and Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And becauſe theſe little boyes are
too apt to blur and ſpoyle their Bibles,
and to make a wrong choyce of words
out of a Dictionary, which is a great
maime and hinderance to them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Latine (and cauſed Mr. <hi>Aſcham</hi> to
affirm, that making of Latines marreth
children) I think it not amiſſe to get
that Pſalm, and ſome other <hi>Engliſhes</hi>
printed by themſelves, <hi>with an Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Index of every word which is proper
for its place.</hi> Right choyce of words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Catechiſme,</hi> firſt in Engliſh, and then
in Latine, or the like. This ſecond

                  <p>1. In repeating <hi>the Accidents</hi> for
morning parts.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>In ſaying</hi> Propria quae maribus, Quae

                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:61977:64"/>
3. In reading <hi>the larger Vocabulary</hi> for
Noon parts.</p>
                  <p>4. In learning <hi>Qui mihi,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                  <p>5. Tranſlating a verſe out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
into Latine every evening at home,
which they may bring to be corrected
on Fridayes, after all the weeks Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
ended, and return written as
fair as poſſibly they can write, on Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday
mornings, after examinations
ended. And thus <hi>they may be made to
know the Genders of Nouns, and Preter-perfect
tenſes, and Supines of Verbs, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
to ſpeak and write true Latine in the
compaſſe of a ſecond yeare.</hi> So that to
children of betwixt ſeven and nine
years of age, in regard of their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſſe
inanimadvertency, I allow two
whole years to practiſe them well in the
Rudiments or Grounds of Grammar,
in which I would have the variation of
Nouns and Verbs to be ſpecially min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for till they be very ready in
thoſe, their progreſs in other things
will be full of uncertainties, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomely
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61977:64"/>
tedious, but if thoſe be once
well got, all other rules which have not
(perhaps) been ſo well underſtood, will
more eaſily (as age increaſeth) be
better apprehended and put in uſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>CHildren are commonly taught the Latine
Syntaxis before they be put to make uſe

but can ſay it readily by heart, conſtrue
it, and give the force of its rules out of
the examples, they are thought to learn
it well enough. But the very doing
thus much, is found to be a work too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
with many, and therefore ſome
have thought good to leſſen the number
of the Rules, &amp; others to daſh out many
examples, as if more then one or two
were needleſſe; ſo that when a Childe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61977:65"/>
hath with them run over this part of the

half of it, or know at all what to do with
any of it.</p>
                  <p>I think it not amiſſe therefore to
ſhew, how it may be all gotten under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly
by heart, and ſettled in the
memory by continual <hi>practiſe,</hi> which <hi>is
the life of all learning;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Let thoſe then of this third forme
divide their Accidents and Rules of
Nounes and Verbs into ten parts,
whereof they may repeat one every
Thurſday morning, and make way for
the getting of the <hi>Syntaxe</hi> on Mundaies,
Tueſdaies &amp; Wedneſ. for morning parts.</p>
                  <p>2. Let them repeat as many Rules

may do well to ſhew the meaning of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

make them compare them with thoſe in
the Engliſh rules under the ſame head, &amp;
to ſee which are contained in the Latine
which are not in the Engliſh, and which
are ſet down in the Engliſh, which are
left out in the Latine.</p>
                  <p>3. To help them to conſtrue well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Examples, which they meet with
as they read their Latine Authors,
or as they Tranſlate Engliſh Sentences
into Latine.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Whittington</hi>
of old, and Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Comenius</hi>

they ſeem ſome what to overſhoot the
capacities of children, who (as Mr. <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi>

                  <p>And for more perſpicuity ſake, I take

any rule, that is not already learned,
for fear of puſſing young beginners in

                  <p>Now foraſmuch as <hi>the daily reading of
Latine into Engliſh is an eſpeciall means to

and do you pick out onely one
boy to conſtrue, and then ask any of the
others the Analyſis of a Noune, or Verb
here or there, or ſome rule of conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which you think they have not
ſo well taken notice of as to underſtand
it fully. Hereby you may alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with the rule and way
of conſtruing, as it is more largely
touched in the following part of this
chapter.</p>

they will take delight in reading
the Tales, and the moral in a Language
which they already underſtand, and will
be helped thereby to conſtrue the Latine

have them to take a whole Fable and its
moral at one Leſſon (ſo that it do not
exceed ſix periods) which they ſhould
firſt read diſtinctly; ſecondly, conſtrue
Grammatically, and then render the
proper phraſes; thirdly, parſe according
to the Grammatical order as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued,
and not as the words ſtand. And
then be ſure they can decline all the
Nounes, and conjugate the Verbs, and
give the Rules for the Genders of the
one, and the Preterperfect tenſes and
Supines of the other; as alſo for the
concordance and conſtruction, either
out of the Engliſh <hi>Rules,</hi> or Latine <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxe,</hi>

word by word in that order, in which
they conſtrued it; and this will inure
them to Orthography.</p>
                  <p>That they may learn to obſerve and
get the true Latine order of placing
words, and the purity of expreſſion
either in Engliſh or Latine ſtyle, let
them imitate a period or more in a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
turning it out of Engliſh into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
or out of Latine into Engliſh,
thus; whereas they read in Engliſh. <hi>A
Cock, as he turned over a dung-hill found a
pearl, ſaying; why do I finde a thing ſo
bright?</hi> and in Latine, <hi>Gallus gallinaceus,
dum vertit ſtercorarium offendit gemmam;
Quid, inquiens, rem ſic nitidam reperio?</hi> they
may imitate it by this or the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
<hi>As a beggar raked in a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
he found a purſe, ſaying; why do I
finde ſo much money here? Mendicus, dum
vertit ſtercorarium, offendit crumenam; quid
inquiens, tantum argenti hic reperio?</hi> By
thus doing, they may learn <hi>to joyne Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
out of their leſsons to their Grammar
Rules</hi> (which <hi>is the moſt lively and perfect
way of teaching them)</hi> and to fetch a Rule
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61977:69"/>
out of their Grammar for every Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
uſing the Grammar to finde
Rules, as they do the Dictionary for
words, till they be very perfect in them.</p>
                  <p>Their Afternoons Parts may be to
conſtrue a Chapter in <hi>Janua linguarum,</hi>
which will inſtruct them in the Nature,
as well as in the Names of things; and
after they have conſtrued, let them try
who can tell you the moſt words, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of thoſe, that they have not met
with, or well obſerved in reading elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
For Afternoon leſsons on
Mondayes, and Wedneſdayes, let them
make uſe of <hi>Mantuanus,</hi> which is a Poet
both for ſtyle and matter, very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

Shepherds are wont ſometimes to talke of
their old loves, whileſt the cattel chew the
cud under the ſhade; for fear, if they ſhould
fall aſleep, ſome Fox, or Wolf, or ſuch like
beaſt of prey, which either lurk in the thick
woods, or lay wait in the grown corn, ſhould
fall upon the cattel. And indeed, watching
is farre more commendable for a Prince, or
Magiſtrate, then immoderate, or unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Paſtores aliquando, dum pecus ſub umbra

Imo enimvero, Principi vel Magiſtratui vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantia

laudabilior eſt. <hi>And this will help to</hi>
prepare their invention for future exerciſes, by
teaching them to ſuck the marrow both of
words and matter out of all their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why I deſire children
(eſpecially thoſe) of more prompt wits,
and better memories, may repeat what
they read in Poets by heart (as I would
have them tranſlate into Engliſh what
they read in Proſe) is, partly becauſe
the memory thrives beſt by being often
exerciſed, ſo it be not overcharged; and
partly becauſe the roundneſſe of the
verſes helpeth much to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them, wherein boyes at once
gain the quantity of ſyllables, and
abundance of matter for phanſie, and
the beſt choyce of words and phraſes,
for expreſſion of their minde.</p>
                  <p>On Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes in the
after-noon (after they have done with
<hi>Corderius)</hi> they may read <hi>Helvici Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quia</hi>
(which are ſelected out of thoſe of
<hi>Eraſmus, Ludovicus Vives,</hi> and <hi>Schottenius)</hi>
and after they have conſtrued a Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie,
and examined ſome of the hardeſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61977:71"/>
Grammar-paſſages in it, let them all
lay aſide their books, ſave one, and let
him read the Colloquie out of Latine
into Engliſh, clauſe by clauſe, and let
the reſt give it him again into Latine,
every man ſaying round as it comes to
his turn. And this will make them to
mind the words and phraſes before
hand, and faſten many of them in their
memories. Help them afterwards to
pick out the phraſes, and let them write
them (as they did others) in a pocket
paper-book. Cauſe them ſometimes to
imitate a whole Colloquie, or a piece of
one; and let them often ſtrive to make
Colloquies amongſt themſelves, talking
two, three, or more together about
things familiar to them, and inſerting
as many words and phraſes as they can
well remember to be proper for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
out of any of their Authours; and
theſe they ſhould ſhew you fair written,
with a note of the page and line, where
they borrowed any expreſſion not uſed
before, ſet down in the Margent of their
exerciſe. And this will make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
to labour every day for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of expreſſions, and encourage
them much to diſcourſe, when they
know themſelves to be certain in what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61977:71"/>
they ſay, aud that they can ſo eaſily
come by Latine, to ſpeak their mindes
upon any occaſion.</p>
                  <p>But if inſtead of <hi>Mantuan,</hi> you think
good ſometimes to make uſe of <hi>Caſtali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Dialogues,</hi> you may firſt make them
read the hiſtory in the Bible by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
apart, &amp; then hear them conſtrue
it Dialogue-wiſe, pronouncing every
ſentence as pathetically as may be After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
One may read it in Engliſh, and
the reſt anſwer him in Latine, clauſe
by clauſe, as is already mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Colloquies.</p>
                  <p>And to help them ſomewhat the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to conſtrue of themſelves, you may
direct them (according to the golden
Rule of conſtruing, commended, and
ſet down at large by induſtrious Mr.
<hi>Brinſley,</hi> in the 93. and 94. pages of his
<hi>Grammar Schoole)</hi> to take</p>
                  <p>1. The Vocative caſe, and that
which dependeth upon it.</p>
                  <p>2. The Nominative caſe of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
verb, and that which dependeth
upon it.</p>
                  <p>3. The Principal verb, and that
which ſerveth to explain it.</p>
                  <p>4. The Accuſative caſe, and the reſt
of the caſes after it. And herein, cauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61977:72"/>
them to obſerve, that Interrogatives,
Relatives, and Conjunctions, uſe to go
before all other words in conſtruing;
and that the Adjective, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive,
the Adverb, and the Verb, the
Prepoſition, and its caſual word, go for
the moſt part together. But be ſure to
teach them often, to caſt the words of a
period into their natural or Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
order; according to which, they
muſt conſtrue; and to know the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of every word and phraſe proper
for its place; and withall, let them have
in mind the chief matter, drift, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of a place, according to
the verſe.</p>
                  <q>Quis, cui, cauſa, locus, quo tempore,
prima, ſequela.</q>
                  <p>Which biddeth one to heed, who
ſpeaks, what is ſpoken, to whom
he ſpeaks, upon what occaſion, or
to what end he ſpeaks; at what time a
thing was done or ſpoken, what went
immediately before, and what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
next after. And if either the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing
be againſt ſenſe, or Grammar
Rule, let them try again another
way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61977:72"/>
To exerciſe them in ſomething (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the getting of Grammar parts) at
home, let them every night turn two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
out of the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon</hi> into
Latine, and write out two verſes of
the New Teſtament Grammatically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued;
and let them evermore take heed
to ſpell every word aright, and to marke
the Pauſes, or notes of diſtinction in their
due places, for by this meanes they will
profit more in <hi>Orthography,</hi> then by all
the Rules that can be given them; and
they will mind <hi>Etymologie,</hi> and <hi>Syntaxis,</hi>
more by their own daily practice, then by
ten times repetition without it.</p>
                  <p>On Saturdayes, after they can ſay <hi>the
Aſsemblies Catechiſme</hi> in Engliſh &amp; Latine,
you may let them proceed with <hi>Perkins
ſix Principles,</hi> and when they have repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as much as they can well by heart, you
may cauſe them to read it out of Engliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Latine, your ſelf ever &amp; anon ſuggeſting
to them the propriety of words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
where they are at a loſſe, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, after they have once made it
Grammatically, to caſt it into the artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
order of Latine ſtyle. And then let
them go to their places, and write it fair
and truly in a little Paper book for the
purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61977:73"/>
If out of every Leſſon as they paſſe this
little Catechiſme, you extract the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
points, by way of Propoſitions,
and annex the Proofs of Scriptures to
them, which are quoted in the Margent,
as you ſee Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath done in the
beginning of the book, and cauſe your
Scholars to write them out all fair and
at large, as they finde them in their
Bibles; it will be a profitable way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
them on the Lords day, and a
good means to improve them in the reall
knowledge of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Now foraſmuch as I have obſerved, that
children about nine years of age, and few
till then, begin to reliſh Grammar, ſo as
of themſelves to ſeek into the meaning
of Rules, thereby to conceive the reaſon
of Speech; I now judge it requiſite for
this form to be made throughly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the whole body of it. Therefore,
after they have gone over the plain <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxis,</hi>
two or three times by morning
parts, as is ſhewed, and have got it pretty
well by heart, (for which I judge three
quarters of a year will be time ſufficient)
you may let them divide the whole Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax
into 12 parts; reckoning them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſeverall Heads of it; thus: The
firſt, <hi>De Concordantia Nominativi &amp; verbi,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61977:73"/>
Substantivi &amp; Adjectivi, Relativi, &amp; Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedentis.</hi>
The ſecond, <hi>de Conſtructione Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantivorum,
&amp; Adjectivorum cum Genitivo.</hi>
The third, <hi>de conſtructione Adjectivorum
cum Dativo, Accuſativo, &amp; Ablative.</hi> The
fourth, <hi>de constructione Pronominum.</hi> The
fifth, <hi>de constructione verborum cum Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo
&amp; Genitivo.</hi> The ſixth <hi>de constructione
verborum cum Dativo, &amp; Accuſativo.</hi> The
ſeventh, <hi>de constructione verborum cum Abla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo.</hi>
The eighth, <hi>de Gerundiis &amp; Supinis,
&amp; de Tempore &amp; Loco.</hi> The ninth, <hi>de
conſtructione Imperſonalium &amp; Participiorum.</hi>
The tenth, <hi>de constructione Adverbiorum.</hi> The
eleventh, <hi>de constructione Conjunctionum.</hi>
The twelfth, <hi>de conſtructione Praepoſitionum,
&amp; Interjectionum.</hi> All which twelve you
may adde to the thirty parts in the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
and <hi>Propria quae maribus,</hi> &amp;c. and
let your Scholars beſtow a moneths time
together in repeating, and examining the
<hi>Accidents,</hi> and thus farre of the Grammar,
(both for Parts and Leſſons) till they
have thorowly made it their own; and
that they may the better conceive how it
hangeth together, and what uſe they are
to make of its ſeverall parts, you ſhould
often make them run over the Heads of
it, and give them an Analyſis of their
dependency one upon another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61977:74"/>
After this, they may more underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
proceed to <hi>the Figures of words and
conſtruction;</hi> the definitions whereof,
and their Examples they need onely get
by heart; and for that purpoſe do you
note them out with a pen, and in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, give as many examples as
may make them fully to apprehend their
meaning. But when they have ſaid the
Definition of one or more Figures at a
part by heart, you may cauſe them to
conſtrue all they finde concerning it; and
to help them in ſo doing, (they that are
otherwiſe leſſe able) may make uſe of Mr.
<hi>Stockwoods</hi> little book of <hi>Figura construed.</hi>
Then let them go on to <hi>Proſodia;</hi> for their
more eaſie underſtanding of which, as
they proceed in it: you may tell them the
<hi>meaning of it in brief, thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proſodia,</hi> being the laſt part of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
teacheth the right pronunciation of
words, or the tuning of Syllables in
words, as they are pronounced; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is divided into <hi>a Tone,</hi> or Accent,
<hi>a Spirit,</hi> and <hi>a Time,</hi> whereof <hi>a Tone</hi> order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the tune of the voyce, ſhewing in what
ſyllables it is to be lifted up, and what
to be let down, &amp; in what both to be lifted
up, and let down; So that there are three
<hi>Tones, a Grave,</hi> which is ſeldome or never
made, but in the laſt ſyllable of ſuch words
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61977:74"/>
as ought to have had an Acute in the laſt
ſyllable, &amp; that in the contexture of words
in this manner; <hi>Nè ſi forte ſopor nos occupet.
an Acute,</hi> which is often uſed to difference
ſome words from others, as uná, together,
ſeduló, diligently, remain acuted at the
end of a Speech, and in continuation
of ſpeech have their acute accents turned
into a Grave, to make them differ from
una, one, and ſedulo, diligent. <hi>A
Circumflex</hi> which is often marked to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
a loſt ſyllable, as amârunt, for ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt.
<hi>A ſpirit</hi> ordereth the breath in
uttering ſyllables, ſhewing where it is to
be let out ſoftly, and where ſharply; as, in
<hi>ara</hi> an Altar, and <hi>hara</hi> a ſwine coate.
The milde <hi>Spirit</hi> is not marked, but the
weak letter <hi>n</hi> being uſed as a note of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
only, and not reckoned as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant,
ſerveth to expreſſe the ſharp Spirit.
There are three Rules of <hi>Accents,</hi> which
are changed by <hi>Difference, Tranſpoſition,
Attraction, Conciſion,</hi> and <hi>Idiome. Time</hi>
ſheweth the meaſure, how long while a
ſyllable is to be in pronouncing, not at all
regarding the Tone. A long ſyllable is to
be a longer while, and a ſhort, a ſhorter
while in pronouncing. Of long and
ſhort ſyllables, put together orderly, feet
are made, and of feet, verſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61977:75"/>
4. Now to know when a ſyllable is long
or ſhort, there are Rules concerning the
firſt, the middle and laſt ſyllables, ſo
that if one minde in what part of a word
the ſyllable ſtands, he may eaſily finde the
Rule of its quantity.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of Proſodia being thus hinted
to them, they may get it by heart at morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parts; &amp; if they cannot conſtrue it well
by themſelves, they may be helped by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
book made by <hi>Barnaby Hampton,</hi> called
<hi>Proſodia conſtrued.</hi> But be ſure that they can
read you every part into Engliſh, and tell
you the true meaning of it. Your own
frequent examination will be the beſt way
to know whether they underſtand it or
not. And to prepare them for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it in making verſes, I would firſt
let them uſe it in learning to ſcan and
prove Hexamiter verſes onely, out of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
or <hi>Mantuan,</hi> or ſuch Authours as they
have read, thus;</p>
                  <p>1. Let them write a verſe out, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
into its juſt feet, giving a daſh or
ſtroke betwixt every one; and let them
tell you what feet they are, and of what
ſyllables they conſiſt; and why they ſtand
in ſuch or ſuch a place; as,
<q>
                        <l>Si Deus-eſt ani-mus no-bis ut-carmina-dicunt.</l>
                        <l>Hic tibi-praecipu-è ſit-pura-mente co-lendus.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61977:75"/>
2. Let them ſet the mark of the Time or
Quantity over every ſyllable in every foot,
and give you the reaſon (according to
the Rules) why it is there noted long, or
ſhort; as,
<q>
                        <l>Sī Dĕŭs ēſt ănĭ-mūs no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bī, ūt-cārmĭnă-dī cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt.</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let them now divide <hi>Figura</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodia</hi>
into ſix parts; The firſt, <hi>de Figuris
Dictionis, &amp; Constructionis.</hi> The ſecond,
<hi>de Tonis &amp; Spiritibus.</hi> The third, <hi>de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m
num ratioue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; generibus.</hi> The fourth,
<hi>de quantitate primarum ſyllabarum.</hi> The
fifth, <hi>de mediis ſyllabis.</hi> And the ſixth, <hi>de
ultimis ſyllabis;</hi> which they may adde to
the forty two parts afore mentioned, and
keep by conſtant repetition of one of them
every day, till they can ſay them all very
well by heart, and give a perfect account
of any thing in them.</p>
                  <p>Then let them begin <hi>the Accidents,</hi>
and go thorow it, and <hi>the whole Latine
Grammar</hi> at twelve parts, onely conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and giving an account of the by-Rules,
but ſaying all the reſt by heart; ſo
that the firſt part may be <hi>The Introduction.</hi>
The ſecond, <hi>The Conſtruction of the eight
parts of Speech.</hi> The third <hi>Orthographia.</hi>
The fourth, <hi>Etymologia,</hi> ſo farre as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61977:76"/>
the <hi>Species, Figure, Number, Caſe,
and Gender of Nounes.</hi> The fifth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the Declenſions</hi> (including <hi>Quae genus)</hi>
and <hi>the compariſon of Nounes.</hi> The ſixth,
concerning <hi>a Pronoun and a Verb.</hi> The
ſeventh, concerning <hi>a Participle, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
a Conjunction, a Praepoſition, and an
Interjection.</hi> The eighth, <hi>Syntaxis,</hi> ſo far as
concerns <hi>the Concords, and the Conſtruction
of Nounes.</hi> The ninth, concerning <hi>the
conſtruction of Verbs.</hi> The tenth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the Construction of Participles, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,
Conjunctions, Praepoſitions and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</hi>
The eleventh concerning <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
Tones, and Spirits.</hi> The twelfth,
concerning <hi>the manner of Verſes,</hi> and <hi>the
quantity of Syllables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in repeating theſe parts, I do not
enjoyn that onely one boy ſhould ſay all,
though I would have every one well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to do ſo; but that one ſhould ſay
one piece, and another another, as you
pleaſe to appoint either orderly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Form, or picking out here and
there a boy at your own diſcretion. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this diviſion, the whole <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
and <hi>Grammar</hi> may be run over once
in a moneths ſpace, and continued in the
upper Formes, by repeating one part
onely, and conſtantly in a week, ſo as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61977:76"/>
it may never be forgotten at the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>This Form in ſhort, is to be employed
about three quarters of a year.</p>
                  <p>1. In reading four or ſix verſes out of
<hi>the Latine Teſtament</hi> every morning, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after Prayers.</p>
                  <p>2. In repeating <hi>Syntaxis</hi> on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
Tueſdayes, and Wedneſdayes,
and the <hi>Accidents,</hi> and <hi>Propria quae
maribus,</hi> &amp;c. on Thurſdayes for morning
parts.</p>
                  <p>3. In <hi>Aeſops Fables</hi> for fore-noone
Leſſons.</p>
                  <p>4. In <hi>Janua Linguarum</hi> for After-noone
Parts.</p>
                  <p>5. In <hi>Mantuan</hi> for Afternoons Leſſons
on Mondayes and Wedneſdayes; and in
<hi>Helvicus's Colloquies</hi> on Tueſdayes, and
Thurſdayes.</p>
                  <p>6. In <hi>the Aſſemblies Latine Catechiſme,</hi>
on Saturdayes for Leſsons.</p>
                  <p>7. In tranſlating every night two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
out of <hi>the Proverbs</hi> into Latine, and two
out of the <hi>Latine Testament</hi> into Engliſh,
which (with other dictated Exerciſes)
are to be corrected on Fridayes, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
ended, and ſhewed fair written
on Saturday mornings; but, becauſe
their wits are now ripened for the better
underſtanding of Grammar, and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61977:77"/>
for them to be made wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, before they proceed to
the exact reading of Authors, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Schoole-exerciſes, I would have
them ſpend one quarter of a yeare,
chiefly in getting <hi>Figura, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodia,</hi>
and making daily repetition
of the whole <hi>Accidents and Common-Grammar.</hi>
So that this third year will
be well beſtowed in teaching chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

they be well grounded in the Grammar;
and how to go more expeditiouſly to work in
Teaching the Latine Tongue, to thoſe that
are at years of diſcretion.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>IT is an ordinary courſe in moſt of our
Grammar-Schooles, for the Vſher to turn
over his Scholars to the higher Master, after
they have gone through the Grammar, and</hi>
(with ſome) <hi>been exerciſed in conſtruing and
parſing here and there a piece of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
lower Authours, and in turning
Engliſh Sentences or dictates into Latine;</hi>
but oft-times it cometh to paſſe, that
partly through the Uſhers want of skill or
care to inſiſt upon thoſe things chiefly,
and moſt frequently, which are the moſt
neceſſary to be kept in minde, and partly
through childrens want of heed, who are
apt to huddle over all Parts and Leſsons
alike, not obſerving what uſe they are to
make of any one in particular, more then
other; there is no ſure foundation laid
for the Maſter to build ſafely upon, which
cauſeth him (if he be not very diſcreet)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61977:78"/>
to caſt off many boyes as unfit by him to
be further wrought upon, or continually
to fret, and grieve himſelf to ſee his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
ſo often miſtake themſelves in any
Taske or Exerciſe that he ſetteth them
about. And the poor children, being all
this while ſenſible of their own imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the firſt Grounds, are daunted to
ſee their Maſter ſo often angry with them,
and that they are no better able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their work to his better ſatisfaction,
which they would gladly do, if they did
but a little underſtand how to go about
it. Some alſo preconceiting a greater
difficulty to be in learning, then they have
hitherto met withall, and not knowing
how to encounter it, become utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with the thoughts of a new
change, and chuſe rather to ſorſake the
School, then proceed to obtain the Crown
of their by-paſt labours; I mean the
ſweetneſs of learning, which they are
now to gain under the Maſter; For <hi>after
children are once well grounded by the Vſher,
they will go on with eaſe &amp; cheerfulneſs under
the Master, delighting to read pure Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and variety of matter in choyce Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
and to excerciſe their wits in curious
phanſies:</hi> and it will be an extraordinary
comfort to the Maſter, to ſee his Scholars
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61977:78"/>
able to run on of themſelves, if he but
once ſhow them the way to perform any
Task that he propoundeth to them. <hi>It
is neceſsary</hi> therefore <hi>for the Master, before
he take Scholars to his</hi> onely <hi>charge, to ſee</hi>
firſt, that <hi>they understand the Rudiments, or
Grounds of Grammar, and then the whole
Grammar it ſelf, and that they can thorowly
practiſe them;</hi> but eſpecially, to help thoſe
in the underſtanding and exerciſe thereof,
that by reaſon of ſickneſs, or the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
have bin oftner abſent, or that have
not been ſo long at the School as their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
or who by reaſon of their age or
ſtature, will quickly think it a ſhame to
be left under the Uſher behinde the reſt.
Now to try whether a childe be well
grounded or not, this courſe may be taken;</p>
                     <p>1. Let him take ſome eaſie Fable in

                     <p>What I have hitherto mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
touching the well gounding of
children, hath chiefly reſpect unto
<hi>Lilies Grammar,</hi> which is yet conſtantly
made uſe of in moſt Schools in <hi>England;</hi>
and from which I think it not good for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61977:93"/>
any Maſter to decline, either in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or publique courſe of Teaching, for
theſe reaſons following.</p>
                     <p>1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe no man can be aſſured,
that either his Scholars will ſtick to him,
or that he ſhall continue with them, till
he have perfectly trained them up by
another Grammar.</p>
                     <p>2 Becauſe, if children be made to
change their Grammars, as often as
they uſe to change their Maſters (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a place where many Schooles
are) they will be like thoſe that runne
from room to room in a Labyrinth,
who know not whether they go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or forward, nor which way to take
towards the door; I mean, they may be
long converſant in Grammar books,
and never underſtand the Art it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>3. Becauſe I have known many, and
thoſe men of excellent abilities for
Grammar-learning, who having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
to proceed by an eaſier way, then
<hi>Lilies</hi> is, have been quite decried by the
generality of them that hold to the
<hi>Common-Grammar,</hi> and have had much
adoe to bear up the credit of their

grounded a Scholar never ſo well, if he
(in hopes of an exhibition or Scholar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
or other preferment to be had)
be removed from him to one of our
greater Schooles, he ſhall be made <hi>pro

                     <p>5. Becauſe children in their tender

into them, and by aſſiduity of long

cannot be bred in them under two or

may be as well habituated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by <hi>Lilies</hi> Grammar as any
other, according to the Plat-form of
teaching it, which I have already
ſhewed, and by means of thoſe helps
which I have publiſhed for the better
explication of ſome parts of it.</p>
                     <p>Yet I do not deny, but a far eaſier
way may be taken to teach children;
Firſt the grounds and Rudiments, and
afterwards the whole Syſteme of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61977:94"/>
then that which is generally now
in uſe according to <hi>Lilie,</hi> whom after
I had obſerved many eminent School-maſters
(who have publiſhed Grammars
of their own) to condemn of many
Tautologies, defects, and errours; and
withall, to endevour to retain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Grammar, I eſſayed my ſelf
to ſee what might be done in that
kinde, with an eſpeciall eye upon the
ſlender capacities of children, with
whom I had to do. And after triall
made, that ſuch inſtruments would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
my work, I was bold to publiſh
firſt <hi>An eaſie entrance to the Latine tongue,</hi>
and then <hi>The Latine Grammar fitted for the
uſe of Schooles,</hi> which, how I have for
ſundry yeares taught, together with
<hi>Lilies Grammar,</hi> I ſhall now briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
                     <p>1. As children are going over the
<hi>Accidents,</hi> and that part of the <hi>Grammar,</hi>
which concerneth the Genders of nouns,
and the Preterperfect tenſe, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of verbs, I make them one day to
peruſe that part of the Grounds of
Grammar, which concerneth the eight
parts of Speech ſeverally handled, and
another day to read that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
their conſtruction, and every
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61977:94"/>
Saturday morning to run over their
examination, which being but a Task of
about half an hour, doth exceedingly
help their underſtanding and memory in
getting their every dayes parts, and
keeping them in minde; eſpecially if
they be made ſometimes to look upon
their Synopſis's, and thereby to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
how handſomely and orderly the
Rules hang together.</p>
                     <p>2. Likewiſe, as children proceed
in <hi>Lilies Grammar</hi> (which commonly is
but very ſlowly, becauſe it being all in
Latine is hard to be underſtood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomewhat long in learning, boyes
are apt to forget one end of it, before
they can come to another) I cauſe them
to make uſe of the <hi>Latine Grammar,</hi> which
I <hi>fitted to the uſe of Schooles</hi> together with
it. This I uſually divide into twelve or
ſixteen parts, (letting the <hi>Appendix</hi> alone
till they underſtand all the reſt) in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which I cauſe them to ſpend half
an hour for the moſt part every day,
and by comparing what they read with
that in <hi>Lilies Grammar,</hi> I make them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
how what they learn in <hi>Lily,</hi> ought
rightly to be placed, according to the true
method of Grammar Art, which they ſee
analyſed in the Synopſis. They may firſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61977:95"/>
read it over in Engliſh only, and then
in Latine and Engliſh together, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
only in Latine. And becauſe
<hi>frequent examination is a main expedient to
faſten what is taught,</hi> I cauſe them every
Saturday morning, to make uſe of <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio
Latinae Grammaticae,</hi> (which is
now lately printed) and let one boy ask
the queſtions out of the Book, and the
reſt anſwer him orderly out of the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars
in their hands. And this I finde,
that <hi>a natural and clear method of teaching
Grammar, is the beſt means that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to open the underſtanding for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or to ſtrengthen the memory for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of any inſtructions that can be given
concerning it.</hi> And I judge that method to
be moſt natural and eaſie, which doth
at once lay open the ſubject that it trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of, and enlighten a mean capacity to
apprehend it on a ſuddain; and which
hath withall a power in it ſelf, that
whether the diſcourſe upon the matter
be more contracted or enlarged, it
can bring all that can be ſaid of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a few certain and general Heads, by
way of Common-place; which being ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept in minde, all other documents
depending on them, as particulars, will
eaſily be remembred.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61977:95"/>
Thus have I freely imparted my
thoughts touching the moſt familiar
way that I have hitherto known (either
by my Maſters, or my own practice, or
any thing that I have obſerved by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or converſe with experienced
School-maſters) of teaching the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Grammar, and making uſe of theſe
ordinary School-books in every form,
which are taught in moſt Schooles in
England. And becauſe <hi>it belongs chiefly to
the Vſher in moſt of our Grammar-Schools, to
teach children to underſtand and make uſe of
their Grammar, and by degrees to furniſh them
with proper words or good phraſe,</hi> that they
may be able of themſelves to write or
ſpeak true Latine, or tranſlate either way
pretty elegantly, before they come under
the Maſter; I call this part of my <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
The Vſhers duty, wherein he may</hi> plainly
<hi>ſee</hi> how he ought to reſpect <hi>the end, the
means, and the manner how</hi> to uſe every
help or mean <hi>for the better</hi> diſpatch of
that which he is continually imployed
about; <hi>viz.</hi> the well <hi>grounding of Children
in Grammar learning:</hi> which may be done
in three yeares, with the ordinary ſort
of boyes, even thoſe of the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
if <hi>Diſcretion</hi> in every particular
be uſed, which is <hi>beyond any directions that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61977:96"/>
can be given.</hi> So that under the Uſher I
admit of three forms; The firſt of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
The ſecond of Practitioners, The
third of Proficients in the knowledge of
Grammar.</p>
                     <p>Having done therefore with ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
children, (whoſe inanimadvertency
is the Teachers daily trouble (and not to
mention their other infirmities) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that they be held long in one and
the ſame work, and be made ever and
anone to repeat again what they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learned) I ſhall next adde ſomewhat
concerning teaching men at ſpare hours
in private, with whom (by reaſon of
their ſtronger capacities, and more uſe
of reaſon) a far ſpeedier courſe may be
taken, and greater Proficiency may be
made in half a year, then can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from children in three years ſpace.
And what I ſhall here deliver is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that experiment which I have
made with many young Gentlemen, for
theſe eleven or twelve years together
laſt paſt, in <hi>London;</hi> who being very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of their own want of the Latine
tongue, and deſirous (if poſſibly) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, have thought no coſt nor pains
too little to be employed for gaining of
it, and yet in few moneths, they have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61977:96"/>
either been ſo grounded, as to be able to
help themſelves in a plain Authour, in
caſe they knew nothing before; or ſo
perfected, as to grapple with the moſt
difficult and exacteſt Authours, in caſe
they had formerly but a ſmattering of
the Language; and this they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at leiſure time, and at far leſſe
expenſe, then they now prize the jewel
at, which they hav. In teaching of a
man then, I require none of thoſe helps,
which I have provided for childrens
uſes, (though perhaps he may find bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to himſelf by peruſing them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate)
only I deſire him at the firſt to get
<hi>an eaſie entrance to the Latine tongue,</hi> and by
it I ſhew him as briefly, orderly and
plainly as I can,</p>
                     <p>1. How he ought to diſtinguiſh words,
ſo as to know what part of Speech any
word is.</p>
                     <p>2. To tell what belongeth to every
ſeveral Part of Speech.</p>
                     <p>3. To get the Examples of the Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
&amp; Conjugations very exactly, ſo as
to know what any Noun or Verb ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
according to its Termination: and to
ſtore him with words, I adviſe him to
peruſe a Chapter in the Vocabulary (at
leaſt) once every day, and to obſerve the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61977:97"/>
Latine names of ſuch things as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in uſe, and better known to him.</p>
                     <p>4. Then I acquaint him with the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rules of Concordance and Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and help him to underſtand them by
<hi>ſundry ſhort examples appliable thereunto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Laſt of all, I cauſe him to take ſome
of the <hi>Collectanea,</hi> and help him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue,
parſe, imitate, and alter them, untill
he be able to adventure upon ſome eaſy
Authour.</p>
                     <p>After he be thus made well acquainted
with <hi>the Grounds of Grammar,</hi> I bid him
to procure the <hi>Latine Grammar fitted</hi> for
his uſe, as well as <hi>for Schooles;</hi> and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with it a Latine Teſtament, or Bible,
and then I cauſe him to read over his
Grammar (by as much at once as he can
well peruſe in halfe an houre) and be
ſure that he thorowly underſtand it; and
after every one of the foure Parts of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
I give him a Praxis of it; by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
whereof, he may eaſily know how to
uſe his Rules, and where to find them.</p>
                     <p>When by this meanes he can tell what to
do with his <hi>Grammar,</hi> I turn him to <hi>the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Testament,</hi> (beginning with the firſt
Chapter of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, becauſe it
is moſt eaſy) and there I make him (by
giving him ſome few directions, which he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61977:97"/>
hath, together with his <hi>Grounds of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar)</hi>
to learn to conſtrue of himſelfe ſix,
eight, or ten verſes, with the help of his
<hi>Engliſh Bible;</hi> and to parſe them exactly
according to his Grammar, and by going
over three or four Chapters, he will be
able to proceed underſtandingly in his
<hi>Latine Bible</hi> without help.</p>
                     <p>Which when he can do, I adviſe him
to get <hi>Corderius Engliſh and Latine,</hi> where
he is chiefly to take notice of the phraſes,
how they differ, in both languages, and to
imitate here and there a Colloquie, to try
what good Latine he can write or ſpeak of
himſelf. And now I commend to his own
private reading, <hi>Dialogi Gallico Anglo-Latini,</hi>
by D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

by peruſal of which, together with <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
he may be furniſhed with copy of
words and phraſes, for common diſcourſe

                        </gap> the artificial manner of placing

upon the Latine alone, I make him

read <hi>Terence</hi> over and over, and to obſerve
all the difficulties of Grammar that he
meets in him, and after he is once Maſter
of his ſtile, he will be pretty well able for
any Latine Book, of which I allow him to
take his choice.</p>
                     <p>VVhether he will read <hi>Tully, Pliny, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>

purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>If he would exerciſe himſelf in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
or Poetry, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe his beſt way is
to imitate the moſt excellent pieces of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he findes in the beſt and pureſt
Authors, (eſpecially <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Virgil)</hi> till
he can do well of himſelf <hi>Horace</hi> and
<hi>Buchanan's Pſalms</hi> will ſufficiently ſtore
him with variety of Verſes.</p>
                     <p>And now if one ſhould ask me before I
conclude this Book, and begin with the
next, whether it be not poſſible for men
or children to learn Latine, as well as
Engliſh, without Grammar-Rules.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer. Firſt, that it is hardly poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe the Latine tongue is not ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
ſpoken, as Engliſh; which is
gotten only by hearing and imitation.</p>
                     <p>2. That it is not the better way, partly
becauſe they that are well acquainted with
Grammar, know when they or others
ſpeak well, and when they ſpeak ill; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they that are ignorant of the Rules, take
any Latine for good, be it never ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
or full of Solaeciſmes, and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they that are skilful in Grammar, are
able to doe ſomething in reading Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
or tranſlating, or writing Epiſtles,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61977:99"/>
or the like, by themſelves; whereas they
that learne Latine without any Rule, are
able to do nothing ſurely if their Teacher
be away. Beſides, if the Latine be once
well gotten by Rule, it is not ſo apt to be
forgotten; as if it be learned only by rote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the learner is at any time able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what he hath loſt by the help of his
own intellect, having the habit of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
in his mind. Yet (I conceive) it is
the readieſt way to the gaining of this
Language; to joyn aſſiduity of ſpeaking
and reading, and writing, and eſpecially
double tranſlating to the Rules; for as the
one affordeth us words and phraſe, and
the other directs us how to order them for
a right ſpeech; ſo the exerciſe of both
will at laſt beget ſuch an Habit in us, that
we may increaſe our ability to ſpeak and
underſtand pure Latine, though (perhaps)
the Rules of Grammer, be forgotten
by us.</p>
                     <p>Having here done with the <hi>Vſhers Duty,</hi>
I ſhall (God willing) go on to diſcover
<hi>the Masters Method</hi> in every particular,
according to what I have either practiſed
my ſelf, or obſerved from others of my
profeſſion. And I hope this my ſlender
diſcovery will excite ſome of greater pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
and experience, to commit alſo to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61977:99"/>
publick their own obſervations; by whom
if I may be convinced, that I have any where
gone in an erroneous way, I ſhall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retract my courſe, and endevour to ſtere
by any mans Chart, that I finde more caſte
and ſure, to direct me. In the mean time,
I commit my little veſſel to the waters all
alone, and deſire God, that whatever
Dangers attend it, he would ſo protect
and proſper it, that it may ſafely arrive to
the Port which I chiefly aim at; <hi>viz.</hi> the
honour and ſervice of his divine Majeſty,
and the benefitting of both Church and
Common wealth, in the good education
of children.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How to make the Scholars of the fourth Form
very perfect in the Art of Grammar, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
of Rhetorick; &amp; how to enter them
upon Greek in an eaſy way. How to practiſe
them (as they read Terence, and Ovid de
Triſtibus, and his Metamorphoſis, and
Janua Latinae linguae, and Sturmius,
and Textor's Epiſtles) in getting Copy
of words, and learning their Derivations
and Differences, and in varying phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
How to ſhew them the right way of
double tranſlating, and writing a moſt
pure Latine ſtyle. How to acquaint them
with all ſorts of Engliſh and Latine
verſes, and to enable them to write faimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and elegant Epiſtles either in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
or Latine, upon all occaſions.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Vſher <hi>having throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his Duty, ſo as</hi> to lay a
ſure foundation by teaching Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
and lower Authours and uſing
other helps <hi>for mentioned,</hi> to acquaint his
Scholars with the words, and order of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
tongue, as well for ſpeaking, as writing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61977:102"/>
it: The Maſter <hi>may more cheerfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to build further, and in ſo doing,</hi>
he ſhould be as carefull to keep what is well got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as diligent to adde thereunto. <hi>I would
adviſe therefore, that the Scholars of this
fourth form may,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Every morning read ſix or ten verſes
(as formerly) out of the <hi>Latine Teſtament</hi>
into Engliſh, that thus they may be become
well acquainted with the matter, and
words of that moſt holy Book; and after
they are acquainted with the <hi>Greek Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
they may proceed with it in like
manner.</p>
                  <p>2. Every Thurſday morning repeat a
part out of the <hi>Latine Grammar,</hi> according as
it is laſt divided, that by that meanes they
may conſtantly ſay it over once every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And becauſe their wits are now ripe
for underſtanding Grammar notions, where
ever they meet with them, I would have
them every one to provide <hi>a Paper-book of
two quires</hi> in Quarto, in the beginning
whereof, they ſhould write the Heads of
Grammar by way of common place, as
they ſee it in my <hi>Latine Grammar,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
noted the pages, they ſhould again
write over the ſame Heads, (leaving a
larger or leſſe diſtance betwixt them, as
they conceive they may finde more or leſſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61977:102"/>
matter to fill them withall) in the leaves of
their Book, and inſert all niceties of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
that they finde, either in their daily
leſſons, or in peruſing other Books at
ſpare houres, eſpecially ſuch as either me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically,
or critically treat of Grammar;
amongſt which I commend <hi>Mr. Brinſley's
poſing of the Accidents. The Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon Lilies Grammar, Stockwoods diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
Mr. Pooles Engliſh Accidents, Hermes
Anglo-Latinus, Phalerii Supplementa ad
Grammaticam, Mr. Birds, Mr. Shirleyes, Mr.
Burleyes, Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Gregories, Mr.
Haynes, Mr. Danes, Mr. Farnabies,</hi> and other
late printed <hi>new Grammars,</hi> (which they
may read in private one after another) will
afford them ſeveral obſervations. As for
<hi>Authores Grammaticae Antiqui,</hi> which are
commonly printed together; <hi>Diſpauterius,
Linacer, Melancthon, Valerius, Alvarez, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Sulpitius, Voſſius,</hi> and the like, either
ancient or modern, they may take the
opportunity to read them, after they come
to higher Forms, and pick out of them
ſuch pretty notes, as they have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
met withall, and write them in their
<hi>Common-place-booke.</hi> And becauſe it may
ſeem a needleſſe labour for every Scholar
to be thus imployed, and it is (almoſt) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for one alone to procure ſo many
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61977:103"/>
Grammars, <hi>it were to be wiſhed, that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Schoole of note, there might be a Library,
wherein all the best Grammars that can be
gotten, might be kept, and lent to thoſe boyes,
that are more industriouſly addicted to Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
Art, and which intend to be Scholars, that
they may read them over, and refer what they
like in them to its proper Head.</hi> And to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them in ſo doing, the Maſter may
do well at the firſt to direct them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
at leiſure times to caſt an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Books, and ſee what they have
collected of themſelves. But be ſure that
they keep their Paper-book fair, and that
they write conſtantly in it, with a legible
and even hand.</p>
                  <p>3. Thus they may have liberty to learn
Rhetorick on Mondayes, Tueſdayes, and
Wedneſdayes, for morning Parts. And to
enter them in that Art of fine ſpeaking, they
may make uſe of <hi>Elementa Rhetorices,</hi> lately
printed by <hi>Mr. Dugard,</hi> and out of it learn
the Tropes and Figures, according to the
definitions given by <hi>Talaeus,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
more illuſtrated by <hi>Mr. Butler.</hi> Out of
either of which books, they may be helped
with ſtore of examples, to explain the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
ſo as they may know any Trope
or Figure that they meet with in their own
Authours. When they have throughly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61977:103"/>
learnt that little book, they may make a
Synopſis of it, whereby to ſee its order, and
how every thing hangs together, and then
write the Common place heads in a Paper-book
(as I have mentioned before touching
Grammar) unto which they may referre;
whatever they like in the late <hi>Engliſh
Rhetorick, Mr. Farnabies Index Rhetoricus,
Suſenbrotus, Mr. Hornes Compendium Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torices,</hi>
or the like, till they be better able
to peruſe other Authours, that more fully
treat of the Art; as, <hi>Voſſius's Partitiones
Oratoriae. Orator extemporaneus, Teſmari
exercitationes Rhetoricae, Nic. Cauſſinus.
Paiot de elequentiâ,</hi> and many others; with
which a School-Library ſhould be very
well furniſhed for the Scholars to make
uſe on, accordingly as they increaſe in
ability of learning.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Elementa Rhetorices</hi> in their firſt
going over, ſhould be explained by the
Maſter, and conſtrued by the Scholars, and
every example compared with its Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And the Scholars ſhould now be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
of themſelves to obſerve every Trop
and Figure, that occurre in their preſent
Authours, and when they ſay, to render it
with its full definition, and if any be more
eminent and worthy obſervation then
others, to write it down in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place-book,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61977:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and by this means they
will come to the perfect underſtanding of
them in a quarter of a yeares time, and
with more eaſe commit it all to memory
by conſtant parts, ſaying a whole Chapter
together at once; which afterwards they
may keep by conſtant Repetitions, as they
do their Grammar.</p>
                  <p>4. When they have paſſed their Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
you may let them beſtow thoſe hours,
which they ſpent about it, in getting the
Greek Grammar for morning parts. And
becauſe in learning this Language, as well
as the Latine, <hi>we are to proceed by one Rule,
which is moſt common and certain;</hi> I preferre
<hi>Camdens Greek Grammar</hi> before any that
I have yet ſeen, (though perhaps it be not
ſo facill, or ſo compleat as ſome latelier
printed, eſpecially thoſe that are ſet out
by my worthy friends, <hi>Mr. Busbie</hi> of
Weſtminſter, and <hi>Mr. Dugard</hi> of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
Taylors Schoole) in the firſt going
over of which, I would have them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
onely the Greek letters, and their
diviſions, the Accents, and eight Parts of
Speech, the Articles, Declenſions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations,
the Adverbs, Conjunctions, and
Prepoſitions by ſeveral parts, as they are
beſt able to get them, and to write down
ſo much as they ſay at once in a fair Paper-book,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61977:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very exactly obſerving and marking
every Accent, and note of diſtinction.
And this will quickly enable them to
write or read Greek very truly, eſpecially
if they minde the abbreviated characters,
which are now lately printed at the end
of moſt of theſe Grammars. This work
will take up <hi>about a quarter of a years time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next half year, they may get over
the whole Grammar in that order, as it is
printed. And in the <hi>interim</hi> thereof, they
may make uſe of their <hi>Greek Testament</hi>
every morning after prayers, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as they formerly uſed their Latine
one. They may begin with the Goſpel
of <hi>S. John,</hi> which at the firſt you may
help them to conſtrue and parſe <hi>verbatim,</hi>
but after a while when they have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtrength to do ſomewhat of themſelves,
you may let them make uſe of <hi>Paſors Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xicon,</hi>
which they will better do, by help
of the <hi>Themes,</hi> which I cauſed to be printed
<hi>in the Margent of the Greek Testament,</hi> which
will lead them to <hi>Paſor,</hi> to ſee the Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
of any word in the Teſtament. <hi>Mr.
Dugard</hi> hath lately compleated <hi>his Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
Graeci Teſtamenti Alphabeticum, unâ
cum explicatione Grammaticâ vocum ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
in uſum Tironum; nec non concordantia
ſingulis vocibus appoſita, in uſum Theologiae
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61977:105"/>
canditatorum;</hi> which were it once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the preſſe, as it now lyeth ready
in his hand, would be <hi>a moſt excellent help to
young Scholars, to proceed in the Greek Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of themſelves, in an underſtanding and
Grammatical way.</hi> And I hope it will not
be long ere he publiſh it for common uſe.
When they have gone over the Declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Conjugations, and are able to
write Greek in a very fair and legible
character, let them write out the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digmes
of every Declenſion and Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and divide the moveable part of the
words, from the Terminatious, as you
may ſee it done in Mr. <hi>Dugards Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta
Grammaticae Graecae.</hi> After they are
thus acquainted with every particular
example, they may write out all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions
one by another, and the three
voyces of the Verbs throughout all moods
and tenſes in all Conjugations, that ſo
they may more readily compare them one
by another, and ſee what Tenſes are alike,
or which are wanting in every voyce. If
theſe things were drawn into Tables, to
be hanged up in the Schoole, they would
help the weaker boyes.</p>
                  <p>And to ſupply them with ſtore of Nouns
&amp; Verbs, you may let them repeat as many
nouns as they can wel get at once, out of Mr.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61977:105"/>
                     <hi>Gregories Nomenclatura;</hi> and afterwards as
many Sentences as they can wel ſay at once,
out of <hi>Seidelius,</hi> or the latter end of <hi>Clavis
Graecae linguae,</hi> by the repeating, conſtruing
and parſing, whereof they will learn all the
Primitive words of the Greek Tongue,
and be able to decline them. And thus
they will be very well fitted to fall upon
any approved Greek Authour, when they
come into the next Form. But if you
would have them learne <hi>to ſpeak Greeke,</hi>
let them <hi>make uſe of Poſselius's Dialogues,</hi>
or <hi>Mr. Shirleyes Introductorium,</hi> in Engliſh,
Latine, and Greek. I commonly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Tueſdayes and Thurſdayes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noones
for this employment, before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
my Scholars had performed their
other Tasks.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Terence,</hi> of all the School-Authours
that we read, doth deſervedly challenge
the firſt place, not onely becauſe <hi>Tully</hi>
himſelf hath ſeemed to derive his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from him, and many noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
are reported to have aſſiſted him in
making his Comedies; but alſo becauſe
that Book <hi>is the very quinteſſence of familiar
Latine, and very apt to expreſſe the most of
our Angliciſmes withall.</hi> The matter of it
is full of morality, and the ſeveral Actors
therein, moſt lively ſeem to perſonate the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61977:106"/>
behaviour and properties of ſundry of the
like ſort of people, even in this age of ours.
I would have the Scholars, therefore of
this form to read him ſo thorowly, as to
make him wholly their own. To help
them in ſo doing, I have rendred a good
part of it into Engliſh, anſwerable to the
Latine line by line, in the adverſe page,
and I intend (God willing) ere long to
compleat the whole, according to what I
have formerly undertaken, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
                  <p>This Authour I would have the Scholars
to read conſtantly every Monday, Tueſday,
Wedneſday, and Thurſday, for fore-noon
Leſſons, taking about half a page at once,
till they begin to reliſh him, and then they
will eaſily take more, and delight to be
exerciſed in him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>1. Let them write out every Leſſon very
fair and exactly, as they ſee it printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them both in Engliſh and Latine.
And this will be a means to perfect them
in Orthography, and to imprint what they
learn in that Authour in their mindes.
They ſhould have a Quarto Paper-book
for this purpoſe, wherein nothing elſe
ſhould be written.</p>
                  <p>2. Let them tranſlate about four or ſix
lines Grammatically in a looſe paper, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61977:106"/>
by this means they may better take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the way of conſtruing.</p>
                  <p>3. Let them conſtrue the whole Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
both Grammatically, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the phraſe, and this will acquaint
them with the proprieties of both
Tongues.</p>
                  <p>4. Let them parſe it according to the
Grammatical order, examining every
word to the utmoſt of what Grammar
teacheth concerning it, and this will
make them thorowly to underſtand
<hi>Lilie,</hi> and ſometimes to conſult other
Grammars, where he comes ſhort in a
Rule.</p>
                  <p>5. Let them cull out the moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
words, and phraſes, and write
them in a Pocket-book, with figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
where to finde them in their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour;
and ſet them ever and anon
be conning theſe by heart, becauſe theſe
(of all others) will ſtand them in moſt
ſtead for ſpeaking Latine, or writing
Colloquies and Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>In reading of this book, it is not
amiſſe for the Maſter to minde his
Scholars of the true <hi>decorum</hi> of both
things and words, and how fitting
they are for ſuch perſons to do or
ſpeak, as are there repreſented, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61977:107"/>
upon ſuch occaſions as they did, and
ſpake them. As in <hi>Andria,</hi> they may
obſerve not onely in generall, how apt
young men are to be enticed, old men
to chide, ſervants to deceive, &amp;c. but
more particularly they may ſee how
ſome men are more apt to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away by paſſion then others are, and
how different their natures are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
though their age and breeding
may be the ſame. Thus they ſhall finde
<hi>Simo</hi> and <hi>Chremes,</hi> two old Citizens, the
one pettiſh and apt to overſhoot himſelf
in many things, the other more cal me
and circumſpect, and therefore better
able to pacify and adviſe others. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
they ſhall meet with two young
Gentlemen, <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Charinus,</hi> the
one whereof, being very towardly and
hopefull, was drawn away by ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and thereby brought into much
trouble of mind, betwixt a fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Father, and a care to make
amends for his fault committed; but
the other being raſh and childiſhly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
is ſet upon what he deſireth with
ſuch eagerneſſe, that he will have it,
though it be impoſſible for him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, and he be utterly ignorant of
uſing any meanes to come by it. But
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61977:107"/>
above all, they will laugh at the knave
<hi>Davus,</hi> to read how he preſuming upon
his own cunning wit, diſpleaſeth <hi>Sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
&amp; enſnareth <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> and at laſt brings
himſelf within the compaſſe of the laſh.
And, in this and other comedies, they
may obſerve many remarkable ſayings
and actions, which will hint much to
abundant matter of invention for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
exerciſes. As when they hear <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
cry <hi>Hem aſtutias! Fie upon craft!</hi> they
may take an occaſion to enlarge upon
the matter, as to ſay; <hi>One may quickly,
perceive by</hi> Davus <hi>in</hi> Terence, <hi>what a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
wit will come to, that doth alwayes
buſie it ſelf to circumvent and entrap others;
for this fellow, after he had cozened his old
Maſter, and unhappily taught his Maſters ſon
to tell his father a lie, and intangle himſelf in
a double marriage, and ſaw his knavery could
not help him to eſcape his own danger, was
ready at laſt to hang himſelf; and though
he came off pretty well with his young Maſter,
by condemning himſelf, and asking forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and promiſing to amend the matter he
had utterly ſpoyled; yet in the height of his
jollity, the old man catcheth him at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,
and without hearing him to ſpeak a
word for himſelf, calleth for</hi> Dromo, <hi>and
makes him hoiſe him up, and carry him away
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61977:108"/>
to the houſe of correction, and there to tye him
neck and heels together, and whip him
ſmartly for the roguery he had done.</hi> Such
Dictates as theſe, the Maſter may give
his Scholars ſometimes to turn into
pure Latine, till they be able to make the
like of themſelves. And this is indeed to
make a true uſe of this excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
according to what <hi>Eraſmus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects</hi>
in his golden little book, <hi>de Ratione
inſtituendi Diſcipulos,</hi> which is worth ones
peruſal, that is exerciſed in teaching
youth.</p>
                  <p>When you meet with an Act or Scene
that is full of affection, and action, you
may cauſe ſome of your Scholars, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have learned it to act it, firſt in
private amongſt themſelves, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the open Schoole before their
fellowes; and herein you muſt have a
main care of their pronunciation, and
acting every geſture to the very life.
This acting of a piece of a Comedy, or a
Colloquy ſometimes, will be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
means to prepare them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Orations with a Grace, and I
have found it an eſpeciall remedy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
that ſubruſtick baſhfulneſſe, and
unreſiſtable timorouſneſſe, which ſome
children are naturally poſſeſſed withall,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61977:108"/>
and which is apt in riper yeares to
drown many good parts in men of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
endowments.</p>
                  <p>6. Their after-noon parts, on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
and Wedneſdays, may be in <hi>Janua
Latinae linguae;</hi> which book ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
read over, becauſe it will at once
furniſh them with the knowledge of
words and things, into the reaſons of
which, they will now be more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
inquiſitive, then furmerly; becauſe
their preſent years do teach them to be
more diſcurſive in their underſtanding,
as growing more towards men. And
therefore in this book they ſhould not
onely firſt minde the ſignification, and
Grammatical conſtruction of words, but
Secondly, endeavour to gain a Copy of
good and proper words for expreſſion
of one and the ſame thing, as that they
may not only tell you that <hi>domus</hi> but alſo
<hi>aedes</hi> is Latine for a houſe, &amp; that <hi>decor,</hi>
and <hi>pulchritudo</hi> are Latine for <hi>beavty</hi> as
well as <hi>forma;</hi> and in finding ſuch Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyma's
as theſe, they may be helped
as well by Dictionaries, as by frequent
reading. Thirdly, They may with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the Original out of <hi>Rider</hi>'s Latine
<hi>Dictionary,</hi> or <hi>Beckman do Originibus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinae

ſignification; which they may learn
out of <hi>Auſonius Popma, Laurentius Valla,
Cornelius Fronto, Varro de linguâ Latinâ,</hi>
and the like books fit to be kept in the
Schoole Library.</p>
                  <p>7. On Tueſdaies and Thurſdaies in
the after-noons, I would have this Form
employed in ſome of <hi>Tullies Epiſtles,</hi>
(either thoſe collected formerly by <hi>Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>
or thoſe of late made uſe of in
<hi>Weſtminſter Schoole)</hi> but <hi>Sturmius</hi>'s I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prefer as more eaſie to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,

together with <hi>Textors Epiſtles.</hi> And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I would have them be exerciſed in
double tranſlating theſe Epiſtles, ſo as
to render many of them into good Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and after a while to turn the ſame
again into Latine, and to try how near
they can come to their Authour in the
right choice, and orderly placing of
words in every diſtinct Period. And
becauſe the Authours ſtyle and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61977:109"/>
will in many particulars ſeem hard
to thoſe that have not formerly read
ſome of his Epiſtles, I have thought good
at firſt to give my Scholars a taſte of an
Epiſtolary ſtyle, by tranſlating <hi>a Century
of ſelect Epiſtles,</hi> out of <hi>Tully</hi> and other
choice Authours, making the Engliſh
anſwer to the Latine, Period, by Period.
And theſe I cauſe them to write over,
and in ſo doing, to take notice of the
placing of every word, and its manner
of ſignification. By this means they both
better themſelves in Orthography, and
eaſily become ſo acquainted with <hi>Tullies</hi>
expreſſions, that they can adventure to
conſtrue any of his Epiſtles of themſelves,
and turn them into Engliſh, as they ſee
I have done the like before them.</p>
                  <p>2. Then do I cauſe them (as I ſaid)
to make double tranſlations of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
one while writing down both
the Engliſh and Latine together, as they
conſtrue it, (which ſome call Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis,
an example or two whereof
you may ſee in Merchant Taylors School
Probation) and another while, and
moſt frequently, writing the Engliſh out
of the Latine by it ſelf, which within
ten dayes after, they try how to turn
into the like good Latine again. And
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61977:110"/>
this is the way that <hi>Mr Brinſley</hi> ſo much
commendeth, and <hi>Mr. Aſeham</hi> was
moved to think to be onely, or chiefly
the fitteſt, for the ſpeedy and perfect at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of any Tongue.</p>
                  <p>3. After they are grown pretty quick
in tranſlating both wayes, you may
write them down a little Engliſh Epiſtle
of like matter &amp; words to that in their
book, directed to ſome of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
which they may turn into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
Period after Period, by themſelves.
To begin therefore with the firſt Epiſtle
in <hi>Sturmius,</hi> which may be writ down
tranſlated thus.</p>

It were neceſſary for them, as they
proceed in reading Epiſtles, to pick out
all ſuch familiar expreſſions, as are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to be uſed in writing letters, and
to note them in a paper book, kept for
the purpoſe, digeſted into certain places,
that they may help themſelves with
them as they have occaſion, you may
ſee a Preſident hereof in <hi>Fabritius's Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantiae
Pueriles.</hi> And becauſe the ſame
phraſe, is not often to be repeated in
the ſame words, they ſhould now ſtrive
to get more liberty of expreſſing their
mindes by learning to vary one and the
ſame phraſe both in Engliſh and Latine,
ſometimes <hi>ex tempore,</hi> before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and ſometimes amongſt themſelves
by writing them down, &amp; then appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Maſter to judge, who hath
done the beſt. To enter them upon
this work, you may firſt begin with Mr.
<hi>Clarks Dux oratorius,</hi> and then make
uſe of that excellent book of <hi>Eraſmus de

ſomewhat for inditing Epiſtles, you

pleaſing to young Scholars.</p>
                  <p>1. Ask one of your boyes, to whom,

you an anſwer, give him ſome general
inſtructions how to do it.</p>
                  <p>2. Then bid him and all his fellows
let you ſee which of them can beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
an Engliſh letter upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and in how ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p>3. Let them every one bring his own
letter fairly written, that you may ſhew
them how to amend the imperfections
you finde in it</p>
                  <p>4. Take his, that hath done the beſt,
and let every one give you an expreſſion
of his own gathering, for every word
and phraſe that is in it, and let it be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
(if it may be) from that which
another hath given already before
him.</p>
                  <p>5. As they give in their expreſſions,
do you, or an able Scholar for you, write
them all down in a paper, making a note
that directeth to the place to which they

lofty and mean.</p>
                  <p>After this Form is once well entered
to write Epiſtles of themſelves, they may
make two Epiſtles every week, (one in
anſwer to the other) to be ſhewed fair
on Saturdaies, ſo they do not exceed a
quarter of a ſheet on one ſide, becauſe
great heed ſhould be taken in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
of them.</p>
                  <p>And let this Rule be obſerved in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
theſe and all manner of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes;
that they never go about a new

began. It were better for Scholars ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to do one and the ſame exerciſe
twice or thrice over again, that in it
they may ſee and correct their own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,

                  <p>8. Their afternoon Leſſons on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61977:115"/>
which they ſhould firſt repeat <hi>memoriter</hi>
as perfectly as they can poſſibly, becauſe
the very repetition of the verſes, and
much more the having of them by heart,
will imprint a lively pattern of Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters
and Pentameters in their minds,
and furniſh them with many good <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</hi>
                  </p>

if their Leſſon be harder then ordinary,
let them write it down conſtrued.</p>
                  <p>3. Let them parſe every word moſt
accurately, according to the Gramati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
order.</p>
                  <p>4. Let them tell you what Tropes
and figures they finde in it, and give you
their Definitions.</p>
                  <p>5. Let them ſcan every verſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have told you what feet it hath
in it, and of what ſyllables they conſiſt,
let them give the Rule of the quantity
of each ſyllable, why it is long or ſhort;
the ſcanning and proving verſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the main end of reading this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
ſhould more then any thing be
inſiſted upon, whilſt they read it. And
now it will be requiſite to try what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
your young Scholars have
towards Poetry: you may therefore let
them learn to compoſe Engliſh verſes,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61977:116"/>
and to inure them ſo to do, you ſhould
1. Let them procure ſome pretty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
and honeſt Engliſh Poems, by
peruſal whereof they may become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Harmony of Engliſh
Poeſie. <hi>M. Hardwicks</hi> late Tranſlation
of <hi>Mantuan,</hi> Mr <hi>Sandys</hi> of <hi>Ovid,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Ogleby's</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> will abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them with Heroick Verſes; which
after they can truly and readily make,
they may converſe with others, that take
liberty to ſport it in Lyrick verſes.
Amongſt all which, Mr. <hi>Herberts</hi> Poems
are moſt worthy to be mentioned in the
firſt place, and next to them (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Mr. <hi>Quarles divine Poems, and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Fanſies;</hi> beſides which, you may
allow many others full of wit and
elegancie; but be ſure you admit of
none which are ſtuff't with drollary or
ribauldry, which are fitter to be burnt,
then to be ſent abroad to corrupt good
manners in youth</p>
                  <p>2. After they are thus become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with variety of meeter, you
may cauſe them to turn a Fable of
<hi>Aeſop</hi> into what kinde of verſe you
pleaſe to appoint them; and ſometimes
you may let them tranſlate ſome ſelect.
Epigrams out of <hi>Owen,</hi> or thoſe collected
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61977:116"/>
by Mr. <hi>Farnaby</hi> or ſome <hi>Emblemes</hi> out of
<hi>Alciat,</hi> or the like Flouriſhes of wit,
which you think will more delight them
and help their fanſies. And when you
ſee that they begin to exerciſe their
own wits for enlargement, and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you may leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to make verſes upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or ſubject; yet to furniſh them with
Rhymes, Epithites, &amp; varietie of elegant
expreſſions, you may let them make
uſe of the pleaſant <hi>Engliſh Parnaſſus,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>by</hi> the true lover of the Muſes, Mr.
<hi>Joſuah Poole,</hi> my <hi>quandam</hi> School-fellow
at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> who like another <hi>Daphnis,</hi>
may truly be ſaid (what I now ſigh to
write) to <hi>have</hi> been at the <hi>Blew houſe
in Hadley</hi> Pariſh, now daily in my
ſight,
<q>Formoſi pecoris cuſtos, formoſior ipſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you have taugt them truly
to ſcan and prove any kinde of Latine
verſe, and made them to taſte the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of poetizing in Engliſh; you may
prepare them them further for making
Latine verſes out of their preſent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
thus;</p>
                  <p>1. Take a Diſtick or two, which they
know not where to finde, and tranſpoſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61977:117"/>
the words, as different as may be from
a verſe, and when you have made one
to conſtrue them, diſmiſſe them all to
their ſeates, to try who can return them
firſt into true verſes, without one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſuggeſting. When they have all
diſpatched, cauſe him whom you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be the weakeſt, to compare
what he hath done with his Authour,
and to prove his verſes by the Rules of
<hi>Proſodia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. You may ſometimes ſet them to
varie one and the ſame verſe, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the ſame words, as many
ſeveral wayes as they can. Thus this
verſe may be turned 104. waies.</p>
                  <q>Eſt mea ſpes Chriſtus ſolus qui de cruce pendet.</q>
                  <p>And ſometimes you may cauſe them
to keep the ſame ſenſe, and alter the
words. Thus this Diſtick is found in Mr.
<hi>Stockwoods Progymnaſma Scholaſticum</hi> to
be varied 450. waies.</p>
                  <q>Linque cupido jecur, cordi quoque parcito, ſi via
Figere, fige alio, tela cruenta loco.</q>
                  <p>To direct and encourage your young
Scholars in turning verſes, you may
make uſe of the book laſt mentioned,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61977:117"/>
and for further inſtructions concerning
making verſes, I refer you <hi>to Mr. Clerks
Dux Poeticus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. To enable your Scholars yet more
to write good Latine in proſe, and to
prepare them further for verſes by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Poetical books, which abound with
rich expreſſions of fanſie, I would have
them ſpend the next halfe year in <hi>Ovids
Metamorphoſis;</hi> out of which Authour you
may make choice of the moſt pleaſing
and profitable Arguments, which it is
beſt for you your ſelf to conſtrue and
explain unto them, that they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
the more at a Leſſon, and with
more eaſe. When they come to ſay,</p>
                  <p>1. Let them repeat four or ſix ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
(which you judge moſt worthy to be
committed to memory) by heart.</p>
                  <p>2. Let them conſtrue the whole leſſon
<hi>venbatim,</hi> minding the proprietie of the
words, and the elegancie of every
phraſe.</p>
                  <p>3. Let them parſe every word Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically,
as they have uſed to do in
other Authours.</p>
                  <p>4. Let them give you the Tropes and
Figures, the Derivations and Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſome words, and relate ſuch Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
as the proper names will hint at,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61977:118"/>
which they may peruſe before hand in
their Dictionarie. And let them not
forget to ſcan and prove every verſe,
and to note more difficult quantities of
ſome ſyllables.</p>
                  <p>5. Let them ſtrive (who can beſt) to
turn the Fable into Engliſh proſe, and to
adoru and amplifie it with fit Epithetes,
choice Phraſes, acute Sentences, wittie
Apophthegmes, livelie ſimilitudes, pat
examples, and Proverbial Speeches; all
agreeing to the matter of moralitie
therein couched; all which they ſhould
divide into ſeveral Periods, and return
into proper Latine, rightlie placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rules of Rhetorical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>6. Let them exerciſe their wits a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in trying who can turn the ſame into
moſt varietie of Engliſh verſes.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Sandy</hi>'s Tranſlation of this book,
in Folio, and Mr. <hi>Roſſe's Engliſh Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt,</hi>
will be very delightfull helps to
your Scholars for the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof; and if to theſe you adde

uſe in the Schoole-librarie) it will invite
them like ſo many bees to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſucking up matter and words to
quicken their invention and expreſſion;
And if you would have thoſe in this
form acquainted with variety of Latine
verſes, and how to change them one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, you may ſometimes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
them in <hi>Buchan's Pſalms,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
out of <hi>Voſſius's,</hi> partlie out of Mr.
<hi>I loyd's Grammar</hi> latelie printed, you ſhall
find ſufficient ſtore, and ſeveral kinds
of verſes to delight and profit them
withall.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Wits Common-Wealth</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
impoſed upon young Scholars to
tranaſlte out of Engliſh into Latine, and
I obſerve it very difficult to be done by
reaſon of the many uncouth words and
meere Angliciſmes that are in it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which they cannot any way
help themſelves by common Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or phraſe-books; I have thought
good to frame <hi>an Alphabetical Index</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Engliſh word and phraſe therein
contained, with figures pointing to the
Chapter and verſe where it is uſed, and
ſhewing what Latine or Greek expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is moſt proper to be made in that
place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:61977:119"/>
And this I would have annexed to
that uſeful book, that by help thereof
the Scholars may of themſelves be able
to tranſlate thoſe pretty Sentences out
of Engliſh into Latine orderly compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and afterwards with the ſame eaſe
out of Latine into Greek. If the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
do not accord, that they may be
printed together, know, that the Index
may be had ſingle by it ſelf, as well as
the book, and he that buyeth one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well be without the other; they are
both ſo neceſſary and neerly related to
one another.</p>
                  <p>They in this Forme may learn the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then in ſhort, I would have
them employed. 1. In reading out
of the <hi>Latine Teſtament</hi> every morning,
till they be able to go on with the <hi>Greek</hi>
which may then take place. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating

when they have done that. 4 <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens

Tueſdaies, Wedneſdaies and

parts on Mondaies and Wedneſdaies.
7. In ſome of <hi>Sturmius,</hi> or <hi>Textor's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles,</hi>

on Mondaies and Wedneſdaies in
the after-noons for the firſt, and in <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
Metamorphoſis</hi> for the ſecond half

every night out of <hi>Wits Common-wealth,</hi>
and ſay leſsons on Saturdaies in the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
Catechiſme;</hi> and by the diligent
improvement of theſe books to their

2. They may get Coppy of words
and learn to know their derivations and
differences, as alſo how to varie phraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
3. They may gain the right way
of double tranſlating and writing a
pure Latine ſtile. 4. They may be
helped in their invention, and eaſily
taught to make all ſorts of Engliſh and
Latine Verſes, and to write familiar
and elegant Epiſtles upon all occaſions;
for the performance of all which works
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61977:120"/>
though more then ordinary care and
pains may ſeem to be required in the
Maſter, and a great deal of ſtudie and
diligence may be thought to be exacted
of the Scholars, above what is uſual in
many Schools; Yet a little experience
will evidence that all things being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and ſeaſonably done, will become
eaſie and pleaſing to both after a very
little while. And if the maſter do but
conſider with himſelf, and inform his
Scholars, that they ſhall all ere long

by a delightful and profitable peruſal of

Latine, whom as they muſt ſtrive to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate,
ſo they may hope to aequalize in
the moſt noble ſtile and lofty ſtrains of

prompt them to, either concerning Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or Poetry: Yet I think it requiſite for
me to go on as I have begun, and to ſhew
what courſe I have conſtantly kept with
theſe two forms, to make them exactly
compleat in the Greek &amp; Latine Tongues,
and as perfect Orators, and Poets in both
as their young years and capacities will
ſuffer; and to enter them ſo in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
as that they may be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of themſelves in that holy Language,
whether they go to the Univerſity, or are
otherwiſe diſpoſed on to ſome neceſſary
calling, which their Parents or Friends
think fitting for them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I moſt heartily intreat thoſe
(eſpecially that are my loving Friends
and acquaintance) of my profeſſion,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61977:121"/>
whoſe years and experience are far beyond
mine, that they would candidly peruſe
and kindely interpret what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
ſeeing I deſire not by any means to
impoſe any thing too magiſterially upon
them or others, but freely to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to all men what I have for many years
kept private to my ſelf, and hath by ſome
(whoſe ſingle judgement may ſufficiently
ſatisfie me) been importunately thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Preſs; and if in any particular
I ſeem to them to deviate from, or fall
ſhort of what <hi>I aime</hi> at, viz. <hi>a facilitating
the good old way of teaching by Grammar, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and exerciſes;</hi> I ſhall take it as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
token of love, that they acquaint me
with it, and if by this ruſh-candle of mine,
they pleaſe to ſet up their own Tapers, I
ſhall rejoyce to receive greater light by
them, and be ready to walk in it more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.
In the interim, I go on with my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
touching the fifth Forme, which I
would have employed in this manner;</p>
                  <p>1. Let them and the forme above them
read daily a dozen verſes out of the <hi>Greek
Testament</hi> before the ſaying of parts.</p>
                  <p>2. Let them reſerve <hi>the Latine and
Greek Grammars and Elementa Rhetorices</hi>
for weekly parts, to be ſaid only on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
mornings, and ſo divided that they
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61977:122"/>
may be ſure to go over them all once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
quarter. By this means they will
keep them in conſtant memory, and have
more time allotted them for peruſing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
and diſpatch of exerciſes. You muſt
not forget at every part to let them have
your help of explication of the moſt obſcure
and difficult places before they ſay, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have ſaid to make ſuch diligent
examination, as that you may be ſure they
underſtand what they learn.</p>
                  <p>And to make them more fully acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Accents and Dialects of the
Greek Tongue, you may (beſides thoſe
few Rules in their <hi>Grammar)</hi> let them
daily peruſe a Chapter in Mr. <hi>Franklin's</hi>
little book <hi>De</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
helpful to young Graecians, and when
they grow ſtronger, that <hi>Appendix de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alectis</hi>
at the end of <hi>Scapula,</hi> will be
worth their reading and obſerving. It
would be good ſometimes to make them
compare the Latine and <hi>Greek Grammar</hi>
together, and to ſee wherein they agree,
&amp; wherein they differ, but eſpecially in the
Rules of Syntaxis, and for this purpoſe
<hi>Vechneri Hellonexia</hi> wil be of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p>And as I have directed before, how
Scholars ſhould have a <hi>Common-place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book</hi>
for the Latine Grammar, ſo I do here
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61977:122"/>
alſo for the Greek, deſire, that after it is
learnt, it may be drawne into a Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
and that digeſted into Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
heads, to which they may eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
what ever they read worth noting,
out of any Greek Grammar they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe.
And that they may more freely
expatiate in ſuch Books, it were good if
they had <hi>Mr. Busbie's Grammar, Cleonard,
Scotus, Chryſolora, Ceporinus, Gaza, Vrba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Caninius, Gretſerus, Poſſelii Syntaxis,</hi> &amp;
as many as can be gotten both ancient and
modern, laid up in the Schoole Librarie,
to collect Annotations out of, as their
leiſure will beſt permits, &amp; you will ſcarce
imagine to what exactneſſe a boy will
attain, and what a treaſure of good notes
he will have heaped up in theſe two years
time, if he be moderately induſtrious, and
now and then imploy himſelf in collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his own accord; and I may adde,
that Scholars of any ordinarie ingenuitie,
will delight more to be doing ſomething
at their book, which they well underſtand,
then to be trifling and rambling up and
down about idle occaſions.</p>
                  <p>3. Foraſmuch as it is uſual &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to bring on children towards perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Greek Tongue, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in Oratorie and Poetrie in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61977:123"/>
I think it not amiſſe to exerciſe theſe
two Forms in ſuch Authours as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
received, and may prove moſt
advantagious to them in all theſe; yet
herein I may ſeem to differ from ſome
others, that in ſtead of Grammar parts,
(which I reſerve to be conſtantly repeated
every Thurſday) I would have this Form
to learn ſome lively patterns of Oratory,
by the frequent and familiar uſe whereof,
and the knowledge of the Hiſtories them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to which they relate; they may at laſt
obtain the Artifice of gallant expreſſion, &amp;
ſome skil to mannage future affairs, It being
requiſite <hi>for a Scholar,</hi> more then any man,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
to be expert in ſpeaking, and doing.</p>
                  <p>At firſt therefore for morning parts on
Mondaies, Tueſdaies, and Wedneſdaies, I
would have them exerciſed in <hi>Apththonius</hi>
(if it can be gotten, as I deſire it may be
reprinted) both in <hi>Greek and Latine.</hi> Out
of which book, I would have them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Fables and Themes (ſo as to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
at leaſt every week one) into pure
Engliſh, and to repeat them (being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated)
in both Languages, that by that
means they may gain the Method of theſe
kinde of exerciſes, and inure themſelves
to Pronunciation. When they have gone
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61977:123"/>
over them, they may next tranſlate <hi>Tullies</hi>
ſix <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> and pronounce them alſo in
Engliſh and Latine, as if they were their
own-And afterwards they may proceed in
thoſe pithy <hi>Orations</hi> which are purpoſely
collected out of <hi>Saluſt, Livy, Tacitus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Curtius,</hi> having the Hiſtories of their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
ſummarily ſet down before them.
And of theſe I would have them conſtantly
to tranſlate one every day into Engliſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with thoſe that are the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and once a week to ſtrive amongſt
themſelves, who can beſt pronounce
them both in Engliſh and Latine. I know
not what others may think of this Task,
but I have experienced it to be a moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
mean to draw on my Scholars to
emulate one-another, who could make the
beſt exerciſes of their own in the moſt
Rhetorical ſtyle, and have often ſeen the
moſt baſhfull, and leaſt-promiſing boyes,
to out-ſtrip their fellowes in pronouncing
with a courage, and comely geſture; and
for bringing up this uſe firſt in my School,
I muſt here thank that modeſt and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentleman <hi>Mr. Edward Perkins,</hi> who
was then my Uſher, for adviſing me to
ſet upon it. For I found nothing that I
did formerly to put ſuch a ſpirit into my
Scholars, and make them, like ſo many
Nightingales, to contend, who could
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61977:124"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> moſt melodiouſly tune his
voyce and frame ſtyle, to pronounce and
imitate the forementioned Orations.</p>
                  <p>4. Their forenoon Leſſons on Mondays
and Wedneſdays, may be in <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> and
to make them more attend the Greek,</p>
                  <p>1. Let them (at firſt eſpecially) tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
every Leſſon by way of interlineary
writing according to the Grammaticall
order.</p>
                  <p>2. Let them parſe the whole Leſſon in
that order, and give you the Variation
and derivation of the moſt difficult Nouns
and Verbs throughout, and the Rules of
Syntaxe, and of the Accents.</p>
                  <p>3. Let them pick out the phraſes, and
more elegant words as they go along, and
write them in a Paparbook; and tranſcribe
what Sentences they meet withall into
their Common-place-book. After they
are well entered, you may cauſe them to
tranſlate the Greek into elegant Latine,
and on Fridayes, when they come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat,
to render their own Latine into
Greek, which they ſhould endeavour to
write down very true and fair without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
help of their Authour, who is then to
be thrown aſide, but afterwards compared
with what they have done.</p>
                  <p>Three quarters of a year (I conceive)
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61977:124"/>
will be ſufficient to exerciſe them in <hi>Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
till they get a perfect knowledge
of <hi>Etymologie</hi> and <hi>Syntaxe</hi> in Greek; which
they will more eaſily attain to, if out of
this Authour (eſpecially) you teach them
to tranſlate ſuch examples moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as may ſerve to explicate thoſe Rules,
which are not to be found in their Latine
Grammar, and very ſeldom occurre in the
Greek one, which they commonly read.
And then you may let them tranſlate a
Pſalme out of Engliſh into Latine, and out
of Latine into Greek, and compare them
with the Septuagint Pſalter. Afterwards
you may give them ſome of <hi>Demosthenes's
Sentences</hi> or <hi>Similies</hi> (collected by <hi>Loinus)</hi>
or of <hi>Poſſelius Apophthegmes</hi> in Latine only;
and let them turn them into Greek, which
when they have done, you may let them
ſee the Authours, that by them they may
diſcover their own failings, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to amend them.</p>
                  <p>Their Leſſons then for the fourth quarter
on Mondaies and Wedneſdaies ſhould be in
<hi>Theognis,</hi> in which moſt pleaſing Poet, they
may be taught not onely to conſtrue and
parſe, as formerly, but alſo to minde the
Dialects, and to prove and ſcan, and to
trie how to make Hex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Greek verſes, as they formerly did
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61977:125"/>
Latine ones, out of <hi>Ovid de Triſtibus.</hi> And
here I muſt not forget to give notice to all
that are taken with this Authour, that Mr.
<hi>Castilion</hi>'s <hi>Praelectiones</hi> (which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
read at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in <hi>Magdalene</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and Mr. <hi>Langley</hi> late School-Maſter
of <hi>Pauls</hi> tranſcribed, when he was Student
there) are deſirous to ſee the light, were they
but helped forward by ſome Stationer, or
Printer, that would a little conſider the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
paines. I need give the work no more
commendations then to ſay, that (beſides
<hi>Mr. Langley</hi> that writ it long agoe) Mr.
<hi>Busbie,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Singleton,</hi> and
ſome others of note, have ſeen the Book,
and judged it a moſt excellent piece, not
onely to help young Scholars in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of <hi>Theognis,</hi> but alſo to furniſh
them with abundant matter of invention,
and to be a Preſident to Students in the
Univerſities, whereby they may learne to
compoſe ſuch kind of Lectures upon other
Poets, either for their own private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
or more publick reading. <hi>Scre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velii
Lexicon Manuale,</hi> will be very uſefull
to this Form for parſing their <hi>Leſsones</hi>
and <hi>Garthii Lexicon</hi> (which is annexed to
it) <hi>Rulandi Synonymia, Morelii Dictionari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
Billii Locutiones, Devarius de Graecis
particulis, Poſſelii Calligraphia,</hi> for tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61977:125"/>
Latine into Greek, but nothing is
more availeable to gain a good ſtyle, then
frequent imitation of ſelect pieces out of
<hi>Iſocrates</hi> and <hi>Demostenes,</hi> and tranſlating
one while out of the Greek into Latine, and
another while out of Latine into Greek.</p>
                  <p>5. For forenoon Leſsons on Tueſdayes
and Thurſdayes, I make choyce of <hi>Juſtin</hi>
as a plain Hiſtory, and full of excellent
examples, and morall obſervations, which
for the eaſineſs of the ſtyle the Scholars
of this Form may now conſtrue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and as you meet with an Hiſtorical
Paſsage that is more obſervable then the
reſt, you may cauſe every one of them to
write it down in Engliſh, as well as he
can poſſibly relate it without his book,
and to return it again into good Latine.
By this meanes they will not onely well
heed the matter, but alſo the words,
and phraſes of this ſmooth Hiſtorian.
And after halfe, or three quarters of
a yeare, you may make uſe of <hi>Caeſars
Commentaries,</hi> or <hi>Lucius Florus,</hi> in this
manner; intermixing ſome of <hi>Eraſmus
Colloquies</hi> now and then, for varieties
ſake.</p>
                  <p>6. Their afternoones Parts on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
and Wedneſday<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, may be in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua
Linguarum Graeca,</hi> tranſlated out
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61977:126"/>
of Latine by <hi>Theodorus Simonius,</hi> which
they may uſe as they formerly did the
<hi>Janua Latinae Linguae; viz.</hi> after they
have conſtrued a Chapter, and analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſome harder Nounes and Verbes,
you may let them try who can recite
the moſt Greek names of things, and
tell you the moſt Greek words for one
Latine word, and ſhew their Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and differences, and the Rules of
their ſeverall Accents. And to acquaint
them the better with all the Greek and
Latine words, comprized in that book,
you may cauſe them at every part to
write out ſome of the <hi>Latine Index</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Greek, and ſome of <hi>the Greek Index</hi>
into Latine, and to note the manner of
declining Nouns and Verbes, as the
Dictionaries, and Lexicons will ſhew
them.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Virgil</hi> the Prince and pureſt of all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Poets doth juſtly challenge a place in
Schoole-teaching, and therefore I would
have him to be conſtantly and throughly
read by this form on Mondaies and Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
for after-noon leſſons. They may
begin with ten or twelve verſes at a leſſon
in the <hi>Eclogues,</hi> which they may firſt
repeat <hi>memoriter,</hi> as well as they can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:61977:126"/>
2. Conſtrue and parſe, and ſcan and
prove exactly.</p>
                  <p>3. Give the Tropes and Figures with
their definitions.</p>
                  <p>4. Note out of the Phraſes and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,
and other Elegancies.</p>
                  <p>5. Give the Hiſtories or deſcriptions
belonging to the proper Names, and
their <hi>Etymologies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after they are well acquainted with
this excellent Poet, let them take the
quantity of an Eclogue at once, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much to con their leſſons by heart,
as to underſtand and examine them well
and often over, according to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> gives <hi>de modo repetendae
lectionis,</hi> which <hi>Mr. Langley</hi> cauſed to be
Printed at the end of <hi>Lillies Grammar</hi> by
him corrected, and <hi>Mr. Clark</hi> hath wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
inſerted in his <hi>Dux Grammaticus.</hi>
There are ſeveral <hi>Tranſlations of Virgil</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Engliſh verſe, by the reading whereof
young Scholars may be ſomewhat helped
to underſtand the Latine better, but of all
the reſt <hi>Mr. Ogilby</hi> hath done it moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly,
and if his larger book may be
procured to the Schoole-Library, the
lively pictures will imprint the Hiſtories
in Scholars Memories, and be a means to
heighten their phanſies with conceits an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61977:127"/>
to the Authors gallant expreſſions.
After they have paſſed the <hi>Georgicks</hi> by
the Maſters help, he may leave them to
read the <hi>Aenead's</hi> by themſelves, having
<hi>Cerda,</hi> or <hi>Servius</hi> at hand to reſolve them
in places more difficult for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue;
though <hi>Mr. Farnabies notes upon
Virgil</hi> will aſſiſt them ever and anon.</p>
                  <p>As they read this Author, you may cauſe
them ſometimes to relate a pleaſing ſtory
in good Engliſh proſe, and to try who
can ſooneſt turn it into elegant Latine,
or into ſome other kinde of verſes which
you pleaſe for the preſent to appoint them,
either Engliſh or Latine, or both.</p>
                  <p>8. On Tueſdaies in the after-noones
you may cauſe them ſometimes to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
one of <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> and ſometimes
one of <hi>Aelians Hiſtories,</hi> or a Chapter in
<hi>Epictetus</hi> out of Greek into Engliſh, and
then to turn its Engliſh into Latine, and
out of Latine into Greek. And on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
in the after-noons they may turn
ſome of <hi>Mr. Farnabies Epigrammata ſelecta</hi>
out of Greek into Latine and Engliſh verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and ſome of <hi>Aeſops Fables</hi> or <hi>Tullies
Sentences</hi> into Latine and afterwards into
Greek verſes.</p>
                  <p>You need not alway let your Scholars
have theſe Greek Books, but ſometimes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61977:127"/>
dictate to them what you would have
them write, and afterwards let them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their own doings with their author,
to eſpie their own failings, and this will
be a means to help them to write Greek
truly of themſelves; you may ſometimes
dictate a Colloquie, or Epiſtle, or a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or a ſhort Hiſtory in Engliſh, and
let them write it in Latine or Greek as you
ſpake it, and by this you may try their
ſtrength at any time, and ready them for
extemporary exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>9. Now foraſmuch as this form is to
be employed weekly in making Theams
and Verſes, which they can never well
do, except they be furniſhed with matter
aforehand; I would have them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a large <hi>Commox-place book,</hi> in which
they ſhould write at leaſt thoſe heads
which Mr. <hi>Farnabie</hi> hath ſet down in his
<hi>Index Rhetoricus,</hi> and then buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

which, together with all that can be got
of this nature, ſhould be laied up in the
Schoole Library for Scholars to pick what
they can out of; beſides what they read in
their own Authours,</p>
                  <p>Now the manner I would have them

                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:61977:128"/>
Having a Theme given then to treat of,
as ſuppoſe, this;</p>
                  <p>Non aeſtas ſemper ſuerit, componite nidos.</p>
                  <p>Let them firſt conſult what they have
read in their own Authours, concerning,
<hi>Tempus, Aetas, occaſio,</hi> or <hi>opportunitas,</hi>
and then,</p>
                  <p>2. Let every one take one of thoſe books
forementioned, and ſee what he can finde
in it for his purpoſe, and write it down
under one of thoſe heads in his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
book; but firſt let the Maſter ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will ſuit with the Theme.</p>
                  <p>3. Let them all read what they have
written, before the Maſter, and every one
tranſcribe what others have collected, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own book; and thus they may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
have ſtore of matter for invention
ready at hand, which is far beyond what
their own wit is able to conceive. Now to
furniſh themſelves alſo with copy of good
words and phraſes, beſides, what they
have collected weekly, and what hath
been already ſaid of varying them, they
ſhould have theſe and the like Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the Schoole-Library; <hi>viz. Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Synonymorum, Calliepia. Huiſſe's phraſes,

Willis Angliciſmes, Barrets Dictionary, Hulaet,</hi>
or rather <hi>Higgins Dictionary; Drax Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca,
Parei Calligraphia, Manutii phraſes,
A little Engliſh Dictionary,</hi> 16<hi rend="sup">0</hi>. and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Particles:</hi> and if at any time they
can wittily and pithily invent any thing of
their own brain; you may help them to
expreſs it in good Latine, by making uſe
of <hi>Cooper's Dictionary,</hi> either as himſelfe
directeth in his preface, or <hi>Phalerius</hi> will
more fully ſhew you, in his <hi>Supplemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
ad Grammaticam</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to draw their words and matter
into the Form of a Theme with eaſe, let
them have ſound Patterns to imitate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they in every thing prevaile to do it
ſooneſt, and ſurelieſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore let them peruſe that in
<hi>Merchant Taylors School Probation book,</hi> and
then thoſe at the end of <hi>Wincheſters phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and thoſe in <hi>Mr. Clarks Formulae Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae;</hi>
and afterwards they may proceed to
thoſe in <hi>Aphthonius, Rodulphus Agricola,
Catineus, Lorichius,</hi> and the like; and
learne how to proſecute the ſeverall parts
of a Theme more at large, by intermixing
ſom of thoſe <hi>Formulae Oratoriae,</hi> which
<hi>Mr. Clark</hi> and <hi>Mr. Farnaby</hi> have collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which are proper to every part; ſo as to
bring their matter into handſome and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61977:129"/>
plain order, and to flouriſh and adorne
it neatly with Rhetorical Tropes and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
alwayes regarding the compoſure
of words; as to make them run in a pure
and even ſtyle, according to the beſt of
their Authours, which they muſt alwayes
obſerve, as Preſidents.</p>
                  <p>But the beſt way (as I conceive) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
children at the firſt, againſt any
ſeeming difficulty in this exerciſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Themes, is this; After you have
ſhewed them how to finde matter, and
where to help themſelves with words, and
phraſes, and in what order they are to
diſpoſe the Parts, and what <hi>Formula's</hi> they
are to uſe in paſſing from one to another;
propound a Theme to them in Engliſh and
Latine, and let them ſtrive who can ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
return you the beſt <hi>Exordium</hi> in Engliſh,
and then who can render it into the beſt
Latine, and ſo you may proceed to the
<hi>narration,</hi> and quite thorow every part of
a Theme, not tying them to the words of
any Authour, but giving them liberty to
contract, or enlarge, or alter them as they
pleaſe; ſo that they ſtill contend to go
beyond them in purity of expreſſion. This
being done, you may diſmiſſe them to
adventure to make every one his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
in Engliſh and Latine, and to bring
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61977:130"/>
it fair written, and be able to pronounce
it diſtinctly <hi>memoriter</hi> at a time appointed.
And when once you ſee they have gained
a perfect way of making Themes of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
you may let them go on to attain
the habit by their own conſtant practice,
ever and anon minding them what places
in their Authours (as they read) are moſt
worthy notice and imitation, and for
what purpoſes they may ſerve them.</p>
                  <p>10. Touching learning to ſcan and
prove, and make all ſorts of verſes, I have
ſpoken in the former Chapter; now for
diligent practiſe in this kind of exerciſe,
they may conſtantly compriſe the ſum of
their Themes in a Diſtich, Tetraſtich,
Hexaſtich, or more verſes, as they grow
in ſtrength. For invention of further mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon any occaſion or ſubject they are
to treat upon, they may ſometimes imitate
places out of the pureſt Poets, (which <hi>Mr.
Farnabies Index Poeticus</hi> will point them to,
beſides what they finde in <hi>Flores Poetarum,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Sabinusde Carminibus ad veterum imitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
artificioſe componendis,</hi> at the beginning
of <hi>Textors Epistles,</hi> will further direct them)
and ſometime paraphraſe, or (as ſome
term it) metaphraſe upon a piece of an
Hiſtorian or Oratour, endeavouring more
lively to expreſs in verſe what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61977:130"/>
hath written in proſe, and for this
<hi>Mr. Horne</hi> hath furniſhed you with two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in his excellent <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>For variety and copy of Poetical phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
there are many very good helps; <hi>viz:
Phraſes Poeticae,</hi> beſides thoſe of <hi>Mr. Farna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies.
Aerarium Poeticum, Enchiridion Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,
Res Virgiliana, Artis Poeticae compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,

<hi>Textor</hi> will ſufficiently ſupply choyce Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites,
&amp; <hi>Smetii Proſodia,</hi> will afford Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities;
(which is lately comprized, and
printed at the end of <hi>Lilies Grammar)</hi> But
for gaining a ſmooth way of verſifying,
and to be able to expreſſe much matter in
few words, and very fully to the life, I
conceive it very neceſſary for Scholars to
be very frequent in peruſing and rehearſing
<hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and afterwards ſuch kind
of Poete, as they are themſelves delighted
with all, either for more variety of verſe,
or the wittineſſe of conceit ſake. And the
Maſter indeed ſhould cauſe his Scholars to
recite a piece of <hi>Ovid</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> in his
hearing now and then, that the very tune
of theſe pleaſant verſes may be imprinted
in their mindes, ſo that when ever they
are put to compoſe a verſe, they make it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61977:131"/>
glide as even as thoſe in their Authours,
<hi>Mr. Roſse</hi> his <hi>Virgilius Euangelizans</hi> will
eaſily ſhew how a young Scholar may imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>Virgil</hi> to the life.</p>
                  <p>From this little that hath been ſaid, they
that have a natural aptneſs &amp; delight in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,
may proceed to more exquiſite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that Art, then any rules of teaching can
reach unto: &amp; there are very few ſo meanly
witted, but by diligent uſe of the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
now given, may attain to ſo much
skill, as to be able to judge of any verſe,
and upon a fit occaſion or ſubject, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a handſome copy; though not ſo
fluently or neatly as they that have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſharpneſſe and dexterity in the Art
of Poetry.</p>
                  <p>11. When they in this Form have
gone thrice over the <hi>Aſsemblies Catechiſme

                  <p>And now to ſumme up all concerning
the fifth Form.</p>
                  <p>1. Let them read conſtantly twelve
verſes at leaſt in <hi>the Greek Teſtament,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>2. Let them repeat the <hi>Latine and

                  <p>4. Let their fore-noons Leſſons on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes

for three quarters of a years ſpace, and
for the fourth quarter in <hi>Theognis.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>How to enter the Scholars of the ſixth Forme
into Hebrew; How to employ them in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best and most difficult Authours in
Latine and Greeke, and how to acquaint
them with all manner of Schoole-Exerciſes,
Latine, Greek, or Hebrew.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis ſixth Form is looked upon as the
main credit of a Schoole, &amp; the Maſter
commonly delighteth moſt in teaching it,
becauſe therein he ſeems to reap the fruit
of thoſe labours, which he hath beſtowed
formerly. His care therefore is to exerciſe
them in every thing that may compleat
a Scholar, that whether they be privately
examined, or upon any publick ſolemnity
required to ſhew their parts, they may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
them that deſire an account, and gain
to themſelves applauſe. And whereas I
obſerve more variety in teaching this
Form then the reſt, becauſe every Maſter
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61977:132"/>
almoſt obſerves a ſeveral Method in
reading ſuch Authours as himſelfe beſt
liketh, I will not much trouble my ſelf
to declare what others do, but as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as I can diſcover what courſe I have
hitherto taken to enable theſe higheſt
Scholars to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>1. Make them read (at leaſt) twelve
verſes out of the <hi>Greek Teſtament,</hi> into
Latine or Engliſh; or out of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
or <hi>Latine Teſtament</hi> into Greek eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
morning, before they ſay parts.</p>
                  <p>2. Let them repeat Parts (as they did
before) out of the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greeke
Grammars,</hi> and <hi>Elementa Rhetorices,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Thurſday morning, and give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what Grammatical or Rhetorical
notes, they have collected and writ fair
in their <hi>Common place Bookes</hi> for thoſe
Arts. Beſides the Bookes which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned, I deſire that <hi>Goclenii
obſervationum ling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ae Latinae Analecta &amp;
Problemata Grammatica,</hi> may he made
uſe of for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>3. Their parts on Mondaies, Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
and Wedneſdaies, may be to
learn the Hebrew tongue, which is very
neceſsary for all ſuch as would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Original of the Bible,
and is not very difficult to attain to,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61977:133"/>
becauſe it goeth word for word with
our Engliſh, and is not ſo copious in
words as the Greek and Latine. And
whereas many defer the Hebrew to be
learned at the Univerſity, I may ſay it
is rarely attained there by any that
have not gotten (at leaſt) the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it before hand, at a Grammar
Schoole.</p>
                  <p>Now for the entering of them upon
this holy Language, I conceive <hi>Buxtorf's
Epitome</hi> is the beſt Introduction of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Grammar; partly becauſe it is the
moſt uſed in Schooles, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
moſt eaſie for young Scholars to
apprehend. Though ſome prefer <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius</hi>
others <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> others <hi>Amoma,</hi>
others <hi>Blebelius,</hi> and others <hi>Horologium
Hebreae linguae,</hi> before it. Now in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Buxtorfe,</hi> you may read your Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
a part of it, and cauſe them againe
to read it over perfectly in your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and then let them get it by heart,
as they did other parts, and when they
ſay, be ſure to examine how well they
underſtand it. As they go over this
Grammar, they ſhould write out the
letters, and chiefeſt Rules; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the declining of Nouns and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounes,
and all the Paradigmes, of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61977:133"/>
Conjugations both in Hebrew and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Characters, with their proper ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications;
and this will cauſe them to
minde the different ſhape of the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and Vowels, and Accents, and
help to ſtrengthen their memory in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Rules by heart. They may get
every day a certain number of Hebrew
roots, together with their Grammar
Parts out of ſome <hi>Nomenclator</hi> or <hi>Lexicon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After they have learnt the Grammar,
you may exerciſe them in thoſe Texts
of Scripture annexed as a Praxis at the
end of it, which they muſt exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue
and parſe, and write faire, by
way of <hi>interlineary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they go over the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> they may
ſometimes tranſlate their leſſons into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
and read them out of Latine into
Hebrew in a Paper-book. Then they may
with facility run along the Pſalter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Toſſani ſyllabus geminus,</hi> to help
them in every word. Afterwards they
may proceed in the <hi>Proverbs, Eccleſiaſtes,
Job,</hi> of themſelves; but be ſure they be
well acquainted with the Rules of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Radix</hi> in <hi>Buxtorfe,</hi> or <hi>Pagnine,</hi> or
the like uſeful <hi>Lexicon,</hi> which are fit to
be reſerved in the Schoole-Library.
Though it be found a thing very rare,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61977:134"/>
and is by ſome adjudged to be of little
uſe, for School-boyes to make Exerciſes
in Hebrew; yet it is no ſmall ornament,
and commendation to a Schoole, (as
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Schoole at pteſent can evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
that Scholars are able to make
Orations and Verſes in Hebrew, Arabick,
or other Oriental Tongues, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
of moſt of their hearers, who
are angry at their own ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they know not well what is then
ſaid or written. As for Orations, they may
be tranſlated out of Latine into Hebrew
by help of <hi>Schind leri Pentaglotton, Buxtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,
Pagnine Crineſius,</hi> or <hi>Troſtius</hi>'s <hi>Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con;</hi>
and for Verſes <hi>Buxtorf</hi>'s <hi>Theſaurus</hi>
will afford ſome Rules and Preſidents,
and <hi>Aviani Clavis Poeſeos Sacrae,</hi> all ſorts
or Rithmes.</p>
                  <p>They that are more induſtriouſly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in the Hebrew, may profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very much by tranſlating <hi>Janua
Linguarum,</hi> into that language.</p>
                  <p>This that I have ſaid may ſeem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be learnt at Schoole, but if
one deſire to learne thoſe Oriental
Tongues, in which the great Bible is

as are full of excellent matter, and

                  <p>When they have gone this over, they
may proceed in like manner to <hi>Homer,</hi> in
which they may help themſelves out of

acquainted with this Father of Poetry,
(which will be after they have read two
Books, either of his <hi>Iliads,</hi> or <hi>Odiſſeus)</hi>
you may let them proceed to <hi>Pindar,</hi>
and after they have teſted ſome of his
Odes, by the help of <hi>Benedictus</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary;
you may at laſt let them make
uſe of <hi>Lycophron,</hi> which they will better
do, having <hi>Canterus</hi> or <hi>Zetzius</hi> to unfold
his dark meaning; and <hi>Longolii Lexicon</hi>
to interpret and analyſe moſt of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
words.</p>
                  <p>5. Their forenoone Leſſons on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies

in ſome of <hi>Euripides,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi>
Tragedies, which you pleaſe to
pick out, to enable them for the reſt;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61977:135"/>
and if to theſe you adde a few of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes
Comedies</hi> which they may better
underſtand by the help of <hi>Biſetus</hi> upon
him, I ſuppoſe, you may turn them to
any other Greek Authour, and they will
give you a reaſonable account thereof,
having but a little time allowed them, to
deliberate upon it, and neceſſary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiaries
at hand to help themſelves
withall, in caſe they be put to a ſtand.</p>
                  <p>6. Their afternoons parts on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
and Wedneſdayes, may be in <hi>Ant.
de Laubegeois Breviarium Graecae Linguae,</hi>
partly becauſe the peruſal of that
book will help them to retain all the
Greek Vocabula's in minde, and partly
becauſe thoſe excellent Sentences being
pickt out of many Authours, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with moſt of the hard
words, that they are like to find in them.</p>
                  <p>7. Their afternoons Leſſons may be in
<hi>Horace,</hi> wherein they ſhould be emploied.</p>
                  <p>1. In commiting their Leſſons to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
as affording a rich mine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
                  <p>2. In conſtruing and parſing, and
giving the Tropes and Figures.</p>
                  <p>3. In ſcanning and proving verſes.</p>
                  <p>4. Sometimes in turning an Ode,
or Epiſtle, into other kind of verſes, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61977:136"/>
Latine, or Greek; ſometimes in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſing
or enlarging the words in an
Oratorial ſtyle, as <hi>Mr. Horne</hi> doth give
ſome Examples in his little golden book
<hi>De uſu Authoris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Farnabie</hi> or <hi>Mr. Bonds Notes</hi> upon
this Poet will encourage your Scholars
to proceed in him: And after they have
read what you beſt approve (for he that
feeds cleanly, will pare his apple) in this
Authour, you may let them proceed to
<hi>Juvenall,</hi> and read ſome ſelect Satyres,
by help of <hi>Farnabies notes,</hi> or <hi>Lubines Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie,</hi>
and then let them read <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
quite through, which beſides the
notes upon him, <hi>Mr. Holydaies</hi> Engliſh
Tranſlation will help them well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
As for <hi>Lucan, Seneca's Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies,
Martiall,</hi> and the reſt of the fineſt
Latine Poets, you may do well to
give them a taſte of each, and ſhow
them how and wherein they may imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
them, or borrow ſomething out
of them. <hi>Mr. Farnabies Notes</hi> upon them
will be helpful to underſtand them, and
<hi>Pareus,</hi> or <hi>Taubman</hi> upon <hi>Plautus,</hi> will
make that ſome merry Comedies of
his, may be eaſily read over.</p>
                  <p>8. They may read ſome of <hi>Luciani ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecti
mortuorum dialogi,</hi> on Tueſdaies in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61977:136"/>
the afternoons, and if thoſe printed at
<hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Sebaſtian and Gabriel Cramoiſy,
cum interpretatione Latinâ &amp; Grammaticâ
ſingularum vocum explanatione</hi> were to be
had, they might eaſily run them over,
but (I ſuppoſe) they will now be able
to go on of themſelves in peruſal of
thoſe lately printed by Mr. <hi>Dugard.</hi>
After Leſſons ended, they may benefit
themſelves by reading <hi>Jacobi Pontani Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymnaſmata
Latinitatis,</hi> which will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them with good expreſſions for
ſpeaking Latine, and acquaint them
with ſome patterns for exerciſes, which
are not elſew here uſually found.</p>
                  <p>9. On Thurſdaies they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in reading ſome of <hi>Tullies Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
eſpecially thoſe <hi>pro Archia contra

<hi>Quintilian's Declamationes.</hi> After Leſſons
ended, they may buſie themſelves in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing
<hi>Goodwin's Antiquities,</hi> or the like.
And here I do heartily wiſh, as Mr. <hi>Horne</hi>
hath done formerly, that ſome of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
leiſure and abilities, would make an
<hi>Index Oratorius,</hi> like that <hi>Index Poeticus</hi> of
Mr. <hi>Farnabies,</hi> which may point at the
marrow of matter &amp; words, in all the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Orators that are extant, either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61977:137"/>
or modern, &amp; that thoſe Authours
might be reſerved in the Schoole Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
whereunto Scholars may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
touching any ſubject, whereof
they have occaſion to treat in their
Schoole Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>10. In the meane time this Forme
ſhould continue to make <hi>Themes</hi> and
<hi>Verſes,</hi> one week in Greek, and another
in Latine; and ever and anon they may
contend in making <hi>Orations</hi> &amp; <hi>Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
for which exerciſe the may find
Helps and Patterns in <hi>Mr. Clerks Formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Oratoriae,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Horne de uſu Authoris.</hi>
Likewiſe to bring themſelves to an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated
perfection of a good ſtyle, they
ſhould be frequent in peruſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpting
paſſages that may ſerve for
their occaſions out of <hi>Tully, Quintilian,
Livie, Saluſt, Tacitus, Quintus Curtius,</hi> or
the like ancient Orations; and acquaint
themſelves with thoſe moderne Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
whoſe eloquence we admire; <hi>viz.
Turnerus, Baudius, Muretus, Heinſius, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reanus,
Rainoldus, Lipſius, Barclaius, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matius,</hi>
and others, to be laid up in the
Schoole Library. <hi>Teſmarus,</hi> and <hi>Orator ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaneus,</hi>
will ſhew them how to diſpoſe
their matter ſo, as to make an Oration
of any ſubject in Latine, <hi>ex tempore;</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:61977:137"/>
and <hi>Aphthonius,</hi> and <hi>Libanius Sophiſta,</hi> will
furniſh them with patterns in Greek.
For learning to write <hi>Greek Epiſtles,</hi> they
may conſult <hi>Iſocrate</hi>'s Epiſtles, and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſhould often alſo vie wits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, and ſtrive who can
make the beſt <hi>Anagrams, Epigrams, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphes,
Epithalamia, Eclogues, Acroſticks,</hi>
and <hi>golden verſes,</hi> Engliſh, Latine, Greek,
and Hebrew; which they will eaſily do,
after a while, having good patterns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them to imitate, which they may
collect out of Authours, as they fanſie
them, for their owne uſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                  <p>11. When they have done with <hi>Now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi>
they may proceed to <hi>Birkets Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme</hi>
in Greek, or our common Church-Catechiſme
in Hebrew, which was
printed for the company of Stationers
in four Languages, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1638.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I at laſt done with my <hi>School-Diſcovery,</hi>
in which I have proceeded
ſo far as to make any Authour ſeem eaſie
to young Scholars, in their future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
at the Univerſities, where I would
adviſe them (that have purſes eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
to provide themſelves of all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
and Greek Orators, and Poets, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61977:138"/>
what they cannot underſtand without a
Commentary or Scholiaſt, to procure
thoſe whereby they may beſt help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to have <hi>Stephani Theſaurus,</hi>
Greek and Latine; <hi>Suidas, Heſychius, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi>
Commentaries, and the like, ever
at hand; that they may be ſure to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themſelves in the Latine and
Greek Tongues, as well as to minde the
daily ſtudy of Arts and Sciences, which
are delivered in them.</p>
                  <p>1. And would ſome able Tutour
take the paines to deſcribe <hi>a Right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of ſtudy</hi> and in what Authours Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
may beſt beſtow their time for the
firſt four years; it would doubtleſſe be
a means to encourage them to go on to
that height of perfection, which we ſee
few attain to, and thoſe not untill
they he ready to drop into their graves;
and then they wiſh they could once run
over again their former ſtudies, and
tell how eaſily they could cope-gaine
that little meaſure of knowledge, which
they have ſo induſtriouſly ſought
for all their life.</p>
                  <p>The conſtant employment of this
ſixth Form is,</p>
                  <p>1. To read twelve verſes out of the
<hi>Greek Teſtament</hi> every morning before
Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:61977:138"/>
2. To repeat <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
Parts, and <hi>Elementa Rhetorices</hi> every
Thurſday morning.</p>
                  <p>3. To learn the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue on
Mondaies, Tueſdaies, and Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,
for morning Parts.</p>
                  <p>4. To read <hi>Heſiod, Homer, Pindar,</hi> and
<hi>Lycophron,</hi> for forenoon leſſons on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,
and Wedneſdaies.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Zenophon, Sophocles, Euripides,</hi> and
<hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> on Tueſdaies, &amp; Thurſdaies.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Laubegeois</hi>'s <hi>Breviarium Graecae lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae,</hi>
for afternoons Parts on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,
and Wedneſdaies.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Horace, Juvenal, Perſius, Lucan, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s
<hi>Tragedies, Martial</hi> and <hi>Plautus,</hi> for
afternoons leſſons on Mondaies, and
Wedneſdaies.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Lucian</hi>'s ſelect <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tani
Progymnaſmata Latinitatis,</hi> on Tueſday
afternoons, and</p>
                  <p>9. Tullies Orations, Plinies Panegryicks,
Quintiſians Declamations <hi>on Thurſday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoons,
and</hi> Goodwins Antiquities <hi>at
leiſure times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Their exerciſes for <hi>Oratory,</hi> ſhould
be to make <hi>Themes Orations,</hi> and <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi>
Latine, Greek, and Hebrew; and
for Poetry, to make <hi>Verſes</hi> upon ſuch
Themes, as are appointed them every
week.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:61977:139"/>
11. And to exerciſe themſelves in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagrauis,
Epigrams, Epitaphs, Epithalamia's,
Eclogues,</hi> and <hi>Acroſticks,</hi> Engliſh, Latine,
Greek, and Hebrew.</p>
                  <p>12. Their Catechiſmes are <hi>Nowell,</hi>
and <hi>Birket,</hi> in Greek, and the Church
Catechiſme in Hebrew. So that in ſix
(or at the moſt ſeven) yeares time
(which children commonly ſquander
away, if they be not continued at the
Schoole, after they can read Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and write well) they may eaſily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to ſuch knowledge in the Latine,
Greek, and Hebrew Tongues, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to furniſh them for future ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in the Univerſities, or to enable
them for any ingenuous profeſſion or
employment, which their friends ſhall
think fit to put them upon, in other
places.</p>
                  <p>But having ſomewhat to ſay further,
touching <hi>the well-ordering of a Grammar
Schoole,</hi> (for I have here inſiſted chiefly
concerning <hi>Teaching)</hi> I ſhall endeavour
to proceed in my next Treatiſe, <hi>with
Schoole-Diſcipline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time you may obſerve,
that <hi>the Method</hi> which I have here diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<hi>is</hi> for the moſt part contrived <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what</hi> is commonly <hi>practiſed</hi> in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61977:139"/>
England and foreign countries; <hi>and</hi> is
in ſundry particulars <hi>proportioned to the
ordinary capacities of children</hi> under fifteen
yeares of age. <hi>The</hi> ſubject <hi>matter</hi> which
<hi>is</hi> taught, is the ſame with that which is
generally uſed by <hi>Grammars, Authours,
and Exerciſes:</hi> Touching Grammars, I
prefer <hi>Lilies</hi> for Latine, <hi>Camdens</hi> for
Greek, and <hi>Buxtorf's Epitome</hi> for Hebrew,
not excluding any other that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the compleating of Grammar
Art. The <hi>Authours</hi> which I preſcribe to
be uſed, <hi>are</hi> partly <hi>claſſical</hi> which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Scholar ſhould provide for himſelfe;
and becauſe theſe are conſtantly learnt
in moſt Grammar Schooles, I appoint
them to be read at ſuch times as are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſpent in Leſſons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Subſidiary</hi> Books are thoſe which
are helpful to children in performing
their tasks with more eaſe and benefit;
and, becauſe all the Scholars will not
have like need of them, and they are
more then any one will deſire to buy:
theſe ſhould be laid up in the Schoole
Library, for every Form to make uſe
on, as they ſhall have occaſion. Some
of theſe ſerve chiefly to the explication
of Grammar, and are applyed to it;
ſome are needful for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61977:140"/>
of claſſical Authours, and are
appropriated to them; and others are
very requiſite for the gaining of words,
and phraſes, and an ability for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or writing elegantly, and ſuch times
are ſet apart for peruſing of them, as are
commonly truanted away in idleneſſe,
or needleſſe ſport. Now by the joynt
uſing of theſe together, I endevaour that
a Scholar may have a pretty knowledge
of the Language which he learneth, as
well as of his bare Grammar Rules,
which without it ſignifie nothing. And
therefore to help children more eaſily
to gain the Latine, I have tranſlated
ſuch books as they learn whileſt they
get the Grammar, into their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue,
that by comparing, and
uſing both together, they may be able
after good acquaintance with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
to waine themſelves quite from
Engliſh. He that deſires further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
concerning the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> which
I have already made, may peruſe that
<hi>Advertiſement,</hi> that I cauſed to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before <hi>Cato's Diſtichs Engliſh and
Latine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if any man ſhall think to tell
me, that I ſeem to trouble my Scholars
with too many books at once, becauſe a
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61977:140"/>
few, if well learned, will ſuffice to make
a Grammarian; I will give him here to
conſider;</p>
                  <p>1. That I have to deale with children
who are delighted and refreſhed with
variety of books, as well as of ſports,
and meats.</p>
                  <p>2. That a Schoolmaſters aim being
to teach them Languages, and Oratory,
and Poetry, as well as Grammar, he
muſt neceſſarily employ them in many
Books which tend thereunto.</p>
                  <p>3. That the claſſical Authours are the
ſame with other Schooles, and Subſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
may be provided at a common
charge, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew.</p>
                  <p>The Scholars in a Grammar Schole
may be fitly divided into ſix formes,
whereof the three loweſt, which are
commonly under an Uſher, may be
termed.</p>
                  <p>1. Rudimentaries, that learne the
Grounds.</p>
                  <p>2. Practitioners, that exerciſe the
Rules.</p>
                  <p>3. Proficients, that can ſpeak and
write true Latine. The three higheſt
Formes, are employed by the Maſter to
learne the Greek and Hebrew Tongues,
together with the Latine, and to gaine
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61977:141"/>
ſome skill in Oratory and Poetry, and
matters of humanity; and of theſe I
may name the loweſt <hi>Tertiani,</hi> the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt
<hi>Secundani,</hi> and the higheſt <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi>
becauſe they ſeem to differ one
from another in ability of learning, as
theſe Roman legionary ſouldiers did in
ſtrength and uſe of Armes.</p>
                  <p>This diviſion I have purpoſely made,
that whether one Maſter alone be put to
teach the whole, or have one, two, or
more Uſhers to aſſiſt him, he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
train up his Scholars by one
and the ſame Way of teaching, (altering
now and then onely ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as his own Diſcretion ſhall better
direct him,) and, that every Scholar
may from his firſt entrance to the
Schoole, proceed with cheerfulneſſe in
learning when he ſeeth plainly what he
is to do from year to year, and how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before him in a playing manner,
overskip thoſe ſeeming difficulties, which
he imagineth in his minde. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it will be no ſmall ſatisfaction to
Parents, and a mean to ceaſe the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
clamors of ſome againſt School-maſters,
to ſee what method they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in teaching, and how their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
profit by degrees, according to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61977:141"/>
their preſent apprehenſions, and growth
in years.</p>
                  <p>And now the God of heaven &amp; earth,
in whoſe alone power it is to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;
vouchſafe to beſtow ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon our planting and watering,
that our young plants may grow up in
all godlineſſe and good learning, and
abound in the knowledge of our Lord
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom onely to know, is
eternal life. <hi>Amen.</hi>

of in <hi>England,</hi> are <hi>of two ſorts;</hi>
The firſt I may call <hi>mixt
Schooles,</hi> where a ſtructure is
made, and an allowance given of ten,
twenty, or thirty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi>
onely to one man to teach children
freely, that inhabit within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
of one Pariſh, or of three or four
neighbouring Hamlets, adjoyning. And
ſuch Schooles as theſe very ſeldom or
never improve Scholars further, then to
teach them to read and write, and
learne ſome little (they know not what
it meaneth) in the common Grammar;
partly becauſe the Maſter is overburden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with too many petty Scholars, and
partly becauſe many parents will not
ſpare their children to learne, if they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61977:144"/>
can but finde them any employment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their domeſtick or rureall affairs,
whereby they may ſave a penny. In
ſome places more populous, an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is made to a Maſter of about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<hi>per annum</hi> to attend Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
onely, and ten pounds to an Uſher,
whoſe work it is to teach the Petties: in
ſuch Schooles as theſe, I have knowne
ſome boyes more pregnant witted then
the reſt, to have proved very good
Grammarians, and to have profited ſo
in the Latine and Greek Tongues, as to
come to good maturity in Univerſity
ſtudies, by a Tutors guidance. But the
Maſters of ſuch Schooles for the moſt
part, either weaken their bodies by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
toyle, and ſo ſhorten their dayes;
or as (ſoon as they can fit themſelves
for a more eaſie profeſſion, or obtain a
more profitable place) after a few years
quit their Schoole, and leave their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
to anothers charge, that either hath
his method to ſeek, or elſe traines
them up in another, quite different from
that which they had been uſed to. And
thus thorow the change of Maſters the
Scholars are either diſperſed, or hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from going on with that alacrity and
profit, which otherwiſe they might.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:61977:144"/>
The ſecond ſort of <hi>Schooles</hi> are thoſe
which are <hi>purely Grammatical,</hi> being eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
converſant in teaching the Art of
Grammar. Now ſome of theſe have
yearely ſalaries for a Maſter and one
Uſher, where the Maſter is employed in
perfecting thoſe Scholars, which the
Uſher hath already grounded. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe Schooles, (eſpecially if they
be ſituate in places where accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be had for Tabling) do happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
train up many Scholars, which about
ſixteen or ſeventeen years of age, are fit
to beſent to the Univerſity. But in regard
there is no preferment attending theſe
Schooles, the moſt pregnant witted
children are commonly taken thence,
after they are well grounded, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on to other places, where they
may gain it. So that of all others our
<hi>collegiate Schooles</hi> or thoſe that come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
them, have the greateſt advantage
of making moſt Scholars. For theſe
having commonly large revenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to them, do not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
ſufficiently for a Maſter and one
Uſher at leſt, but alſo for a certaine
number of Scholars, which being for
the moſt part of the choyceſt wits, pickt
out of other Schooles, and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61977:145"/>
upon hopes of advancement, do
induſtriouſly beſtirre themſelves to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what learning they can, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves orderly to ſuch Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
as is there exerciſed. But foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as theſe greater Schooles rather
intend the forwarding of ſuch children
as are already grounded, then buſie
themſelves about meere Rudiments; it
ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſeth many parents to diſperſe their
little ones abroad to Tabling-Schooles,
where (for the moſt part) there is but
one man to teach a few promiſcuouſly
hand-over-head, without any ſetled
Method, and theſe changing and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ever and anon, as cauſe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
do ſeldome attain any ſtable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie
in Grammar-learning. Yet in
ſome of theſe, where an able Schoole-Maſter
is well ſeated, and provided with
all fitting accommodations, ſo as to
entertain many Gentlemens ſonnes of
good quality, and an able Uſher to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
him in Teaching. I have obſerved
children to make double profiting, in
reſpect of other Schooles, becauſe they
have the advantage to ſpend much of
that time at their bookes, which others
triſle away, in running up and down
about home; not to ſay, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61977:145"/>
eye of the Maſter is an eſpeciall
means to regulate them in point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                  <p>Now comparing all the Schooles
which we have in <hi>England,</hi> with ſome
that I read of in other countries, (that
I may ſpeak freely, and without offence
to any man, ſubmitting my ſelf herein
alſo to the judgement of thoſe of my
Profeſſion) I do not know one that is
ſo compleated, as (perhaps) many might
eaſily be, with all neceſſary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations,
and advantages to improve
children to what they are capable of,
in their playing years, and wherein we
evidently ſee, how many places of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
beyond the Seas, do quite out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip
us.</p>
                  <p>And therefore from what I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
read in <hi>Mr. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leaſters Poſitions
concerning the training up of children, in ch.
40.</hi> (which he writ when he had been
twenty years Schoole-maſter at <hi>Merchant
Tailors Schoole,</hi> which was erected 1561.
being afterwards head Maſter of <hi>Pauls,</hi> in
1600.) and what I have been informed
touching Mr. <hi>Farnabies</hi> improvement of
a private Grammar Schoole in <hi>Gold-Smiths
Alley,</hi> now called <hi>New ſtreet,</hi> alſo
<hi>Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n Street;</hi> and what I my ſelf have
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61977:146"/>
experienced for about fourteen years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both in that place, and in <hi>Lothbury
Garden,</hi> I am induced to think, that it
is a matter very feaſeable to raiſe many of
our Grammar-Schooles to a far higher
pitch of learning, then is ordinarily yet
attained to in <hi>England.</hi> For whereas in moſt
of our Grammar-Schooles (as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
there is but one, two, or three Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
beſides a Maſter, imployed in teaching
the Latine and Greek Tongues, and ſome
ſmattering of the Hebrew, together in one
room, to ſix or ſeven Forms of Scholars,
who by reaſon of the noiſe of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(not to mention the clamour of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
and the multiplicity of their Work,
with ſeveral boyes in each Form, do both
over-tire themſelves, and many times
leave things to the halves; I conceive a
courſe may be taken (eſpecially) in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Townes of greater concourſe, to
teach a great multitude of Scholars (as
<hi>Corderius</hi> profeſſeth to have taught 500.
and I have been informed, that in ſome
places beyond Seas, 2500. are taught in one
Schoole) without any noiſe, in a pleaſing &amp;
profiting manner, &amp; in their playing years;
not onely the Engliſh, Latine, and Greek
Tongues, (together with the Duties of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and civil behaviour) but alſo the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61977:146"/>
and other needful forreign Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
beſides fair writing, Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
Muſick, and other Preparatory Arts
and Sciences, which are moſt obvious to
the Senſes; and whereof their younger
yeares are very capable; that thereby
they may be throughly fitted for ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Trades, or to proſecute higher ſtudies
in the Univerſities, and ſo be able (when
they come to mans eſtate) to undertake
the due management of private or publick
Affaires, either at home, or in other
countries.</p>
                  <p>He that ſhall but conſider the low ebbo
that learning was brought to (by reaſon
of the Daniſh barbariſme) in <hi>England,</hi>
in King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s dayes, who could not
finde a Maſter in all his dominions, to
teach him the Latine Tongue, (which he
began to learn at thirty ſix years of age,
having begun to read Engliſh at twelve,
which his elder brethren, becauſe leſs ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
could not attain to) and the paucity
of them that underſtood Greek, not much
above threeſcore yeares agoe, when a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
yet living of thirteen years old from
the Schoole, was owned as a better Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
then moſt of the Fellowes of the
Colledge to which he went; he that, I
ſay, ſhall conſider the former rareneſs of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61977:147"/>
the Latine and Greek Tongues in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and now ſee how common they are
(eſpecially ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes,
in whoſe time, more Schooles were
built, then there were before in all her
Realm) and withall, take notice what an
excellent improvement that noble-ſpirited
Mr. <hi>Busbie</hi> hath of late made at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
Schoole, where the Eaſterne Languages are
now become familiar to the higheſt ſort
of Scholars, will undoubtedly think (as I
do) that our children may be brought on
to far more knowledge of Language and
things, then hitherto they have been, and
that alſo in a more eaſie manner.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as I obſerve it as a
great Act of Gods mercy towards his
Church, that, in this jangling age of ours,
wherein too many decry learning, he hath
raiſed up the Spirit of ſome, that know
better what it is, to endeavour heartily to
advance it, I ſhall here addreſſe my words
to ſuch whoſoever they are, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the Honourable and Reverend
Truſtees for the maintenance of Students.
And as before I have hinted ſomewhat
touching the erecting of Petty-Schooles
(whereof there is great need, eſpecially) in
<hi>London;</hi> ſo I will here preſume (and I hope
it will prove no offence) to publiſh what I
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61977:147"/>
have often ſeriouſly thought, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſpoken with ſome mens approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
touching the moſt convenient found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Grammar-Schoole; that if it ſhall
pleaſe God to ſtirre up any mans ſpirit to
perform ſo pious a Work, he may do it,
to the beſt advantage for the improvement
of Piety and learning. For when I ſee in
many places of this land, what vaſt ſummes
have been expended (even of late) in ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
ſtately houſes, and fencing large par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of ground for Orchards and Gardens,
and the like; and how deſtitute for the
moſt part they ſtand, and remain without
inhabitants; I am too too apt to think, that
thoſe perſons which have undergone ſo
great a charge, to ſo little purpoſe, would
willingly have disburſed as much money
upon a publick good, did they but rightly
know how to do it; ſince thereby their
name and memory will be more preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
eſpecially, if they have no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or poſterity of their own to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the contrivance of a
Schoole, which is to be in many things
(as I have mentioned) above the ordinary
way of Schooling, yet gradually diſtant
from, and ſubordinate to Univerſity Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
which would thence alſo take a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61977:148"/>
further riſe towards perfection in all kinds
of Study and Action, For the better groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Scholar is in the principles of uſeful
matters, when he comes to the Univerſity,
the greater progreſs he will make there in
their ſuperſtructures, which require more
ſearch and meditation; ſo that at laſt he
will be able to diſcover many particulars,
which have not yet been found out by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who (perhaps) have not gone ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
to work, as he may do, having
obtained the whole <hi>Encyclopoedia</hi> of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to help him in all ſorts of Books.</p>
                  <p>Such a Schoole then as may be fit for
the education of all ſorts of children (for
we have ſeen the very pooreſt to have come
to dignities of preferment by being learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
ſhould be ſituated in a City or Town
of great concourſe and trading, whoſe
inhabitants are generally addicted, and
ſufficiently accommodated to entertain
Tablers, and are unanimouſly well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
towards Piety, Learning, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
The place ſhould be healthfully and
pleaſantly ſeated in a plentifull country,
where the wayes on all ſides are moſt
commonly faire, and convenient paſsage
to be had from remoter parts, both by
land and by water.</p>
                  <p>The Schoole-houſe ſhould be a large
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61977:148"/>
and ſtately building, placed by it ſelfe
about the middle of the outſide of a Town,
as near as may be to the Church, and not
far from the fields, where it may ſtand in
a good aire, and be free from all annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
It ſhould have a large piece of
ground adjoyning to it, which ſhould be
divided into a paved Court to go round
about the Schoole, a faire Orchard and
Garden, with Walks and Arbors, and a
ſpacious green cloſe for Scholars recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and to ſhelter the Scholars againſt
rainy weather, and that they may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
the Schoole in times of play, it were
good if ſome part of the Court were ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or cloyſtered over.</p>
                  <p>This Schoole-houſe ſhould be built
three ſtories high, whereof the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
for more freedome of the aire, ſhould
be the higheſt above-head, and ſo ſpacious,
that it may contain (at leaſt) 500. Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
together, without thronging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
It ſhould be ſo contrived with
folding doors made betwixt every Form,
as that upon occaſion it may be all laid
open into one roome, or parted into ſix,
for more privacie of hearing every Form
without noyſe, or hinderance one of
another. There ſhould be ſeats made in
the Schoole, with Deskes before them,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61977:149"/>
whereon every Scholar may write, and
lay his book, and theſe ſhould be ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that a good ſpace may be left in the
middle of the Schoole, ſo as ſix men a
breaſt may walk up and down from Form
to Form. The Uſhers Pues ſhould be ſet
at the head ends of every Form, ſo as they
may beſt ſee and hear every particular
boy. And the Maſters Chaire ſhould be ſo
raiſed at the upper end of the Schoole, as
that he may be able to have every Scholar
in his eye, and to be heard of all, when he
hath occaſion to give any common charge,
or inſtruction. There may be ſhelves
made round about the Schoole, and boxes
for every Scholar to put his books in, and
pins whereon they may hang their hats,
that they be not trodden (as is uſual) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
feet. Likewiſe every Form ſhould
have a Repoſitory near unto it, wherein to
lay ſuch Subſidiary books as are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for its uſe. The loweſt ſtory may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into ſeveral rooms, proportioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the uſes for which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
whereof one ſhould be for a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Schoole,
another for ſuch Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as are to be taught at ſpare houres; and
a third as a Petty-Schoole for ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as cannot read Engliſh perfectly, and
are intended for the Grammar-Schoole.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61977:149"/>
A fourth room may be reſerved for laying
in wood and coales, aud the reſt made uſe
on for Uſhers or Scholars to lodge in, or the
like occaſion, as the Maſter ſhall think beſt
to diſpoſe of them to the furtherance of
his Schoole. In the uppermoſt ſtory, there
ſhould be a faire pleaſant Gallery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to hang Maps, and ſet Globes, and to lay
up ſuch rarities as can be gotten in preſſes,
or drawers, that the Scholrs may know
them. There ſhould likewiſe be a place
provided for a School-Library, and the reſt
may be made uſe of as Lodging roomes,
for Uſhers and Scholars. But the whole
Fabrick ſhould be ſo contrived, that there
may be ſufficient lights and chimneys to
every Form and roome. As for an houſe
of Office, it ſhould be made a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
from the Schoole, in ſome corner of
the cloſe, where it may be moſt out of
ſight, and leaſt offenſive.</p>
                  <p>The Maſters dwelling-houſe ſhould be
high the Schoole, and ſhould contain in it
all ſorts of roomes convenient for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
and lodging, and neceſſary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that pertain to a great family. It
ſhould have a handſome Court before it,
and a large yard behind it, with an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
and Garden, and ſome incloſure of
paſture ground. And there ſhould be two
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61977:150"/>
or three roomes made a little remote from
the dwelling houſe, to which Scholars
may be removed and kept apart, in caſe
they be ſick, and have ſome body there to
look to them.</p>
                  <p>Now that every Scholar may be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the utmoſt of what he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the whole Grammar Schoole ſhould
be divided into ſix Forms, and thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
orderly in one roome, which (as I
have deſcribed) may be ſo divided into
ſix, that the noyſe of one form may not
at all diſturb or hinder another. There
ſhould alſo be ſix able Uſhers, for every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
form one, whoſe work ſhould be to
teach the Scholars according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
appointed by the Maſter, and (that
every one may profit in what he learneth)
to be ſure to have reſpect to the weakeſt,
and afford them the moſt help.</p>
                  <p>The Maſter ſhould not be tyed (as is
ordinary) to a double work, both to
teach a main part of the Schoole himſelfe,
and to have the inſpection and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over all; but his chief care ſhould be
(and it wil be buſineſſe enough for one) to
preſcribe Taskes, and to examine the
Scholars in every form, how they profit,
and to ſee that all exerciſes be duely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and good order conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61977:150"/>
and that every Uſher be dexterous
and diligent in his charge, and moderate
in executing ſuch correction, as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
at any time to be inflicted for vitious
enormities, but ſeldome or never, for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
committed at their Books.</p>
                  <p>As for the maintenance of ſuch a School,
it ſhould be ſo liberal, that both Maſter
and Uſhers may think their places to be
preferment ſufficient, &amp; not to be enforced
to look for further elſewhere, or to direct
their ſpare houres ſtudies towards other
Callings. It were to be wiſhed therefore,
that a conſtant Salary of (at leaſt) 100. l.
<hi>per annum</hi> might be allowed to the Maſter,
and 30. l. 40. l. 50. l. 60. 70. l. 80. l. <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
to his ſix Uſhers. The raiſing of
which maintenance, (to uſe Mr. <hi>Mulcaſters</hi>
words) as it will require a good minde,
and no meane purſe; ſo it needs neither the
conference of a countrey, nor yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of a Romane Emperour. Beſides, the
Maſter for his encouragement, ſhould have
liberty to make what benefit he can by
tabling in ſtrangers; and every of the abler
ſort of inhabitants in the Town, ſhould
pay him (at leaſt) 10. s. <hi>per</hi> quarter, for a
ſons teaching, but all the poorer children
ſhould be taught <hi>gratis,</hi> on condition they
be ſent conſtantly to the Schoole, and that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61977:151"/>
their Parents do engage they ſhall keep
good order, and be cleanly and neat in
their apparel; that they may not ſeem to
diſgrace their fellowes, or to be diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them for their poverty.</p>
                  <p>It would withall be a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to theſe poorer ſort of children to
learn, if ſome whom God hath enriched
with more then enough, would ſpend the
<hi>ſupererrogation</hi> of their wealth, (as <hi>Mr.
Mulchaſter</hi> terms it) in affording exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of 8. or 10. l. <hi>per annum</hi> towards keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them at the Schoole, or ſending them
abroad as they are fit, to Trades, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities.
They that go thither, ſhould
have larger exhibitions allowed them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition that they employ more time
then others in the ſtudy of Tongues, and
critical learning; for the promoting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I ſhall onely propound <hi>Mr. Mulcaster's</hi>
queſtion in his own words, which are
theſe; <hi>If there were one Colledge, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould be profeſsed but Languages one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(as there be ſome people which will proceed
no further) to ſerve the Realme abroad, and
studies in the Vniverſitie, in that point excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
&amp; abſolutely were it not convenient? nay,
were it not most profitable,</hi> &amp;c. As for what
he writes further, (in Chap. 41. of his <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)</hi>
touching the <hi>diviſion of Colledges by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61977:151"/>
profeſſions and faculties;</hi> And <hi>Mr. John
Drury</hi> hath lately publiſhed (in his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Schoole) and his <hi>Supplement</hi> thereto,
concerning the <hi>bringing together into one
Society, ſuch as are able to exerciſe themſelves
in any, or all kinde of Studies, that by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Aſſociation, Communication, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in reading, meditating, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
about profitable matters, they may not
onely profit their own abilities, but advance
the ſuperſtructures of all learning to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which by ſuch meanes is attainable;</hi>
I refer the more judicious to their Books,
and leave it to the conſideration of thoſe
that endevour to promote Schoole-teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether ſuch a Schoole as I have now
delineated, would not be of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to the Church and Common-wealth,
where-out to pick more able
Schoole-maſters, that by degrees have
been exerciſed in teaching all ſorts of
Scholars, for (at leaſt) ſeven years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then many men that have ſcarce ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
or are newly come from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
can ſuddenly prove to be. For I
think it one thing to be a good Schoole-maſter,
and another thing to be a good
Scholar, though the former cannot well do
his duty as he ought, except he be alſo the

I might here bewayle the unhappy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertment
of <hi>Jeſus Colledge</hi> in <hi>Rotherham,</hi>
in which Town, one <hi>Thomas Scot, alias Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therham,</hi>
(a poor boy in <hi>Ecclesfield</hi> Pariſh)
having had his education, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>York,</hi> in
the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, did out of
love to his country and gratitude to the
Town, erect a Colledge as a Schoole, for a
Provoſt who was to be a Divine, and to
preach at <hi>Ecclesfield, Laxton,</hi> and other
places (where the Colledge demeanes
lay;) and three Fellowes, whereof one
was to teach <hi>Grammar,</hi> another <hi>Muſick,</hi> and
the third <hi>Writing;</hi> beſides a number of
Scholars; for ſome of whom he alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Fellowſhips in <hi>Lincolne Colledge</hi> in
<hi>Oxford.</hi> But in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, the Earle of <hi>Shrowesbury</hi> (who as I
have heard, was the firſt Lord that gave his
vote for demoliſhing of Abbies) having
obtained <hi>Roughford Abbey</hi> in <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
(to the <hi>Prior</hi> whereof the Lordſhip
of the Town of <hi>Rotherham</hi> belonged) took
advantage alſo to ſweep away the Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of <hi>Rotherham Colledge,</hi> (which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to a rentall that I have ſeen, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to about 2000. l. <hi>per annum)</hi> and after
a while (having engratiated himſelf with
ſome Townſmen, and Gentlemen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61977:152"/>
by erecting a Cock-pit) he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Schoole out of the Colledge into a
ſorry houſe before the gate, leaving it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of any allowance, till <hi>Mr. Weſt</hi> (that
writ the <hi>Preſidents)</hi> in the time of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> (and when <hi>Mr. Snell</hi> was School-maſter)
obtained a yearely Salary of tenne
pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> which is ſince Paid out
of the Exchequer, by the Auditor of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.
I remember how often, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<hi>Mr. Francis West,</hi> who had been
Clerk to his Uncle, would declaime againſt
the injury done to that Schoole, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
(as he ſaid) ought ſtill to have been
kept in the Colledge, and how when I
was a Schoole-maſter there, he gave me a
Copy of the Foundation, and ſhowed me
ſome rentalls of Lands, and told me where
many Deeds and Evidences belonging
thereunto were then concealed, and other
remarkable paſſages, which he was loth
to have buried in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>But I onely mention thus much touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that worthy Foundation, to ſhew how
charitably ſome men have been addicted to
cheriſh the roots of learning, and how co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſly
others have been bent to deſtroy
the whole body of it, even in former ages;
And I hope none will be diſcouraged
from Pious undertakings, for feare leaſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61977:153"/>
his benevolences ſhould in theſe, or after
times be perverted, when he conſidereth
that God looketh upon the ſincerity of his
ends, and will accordingly reward him,
though what he religiouſly intended, may
unhappily be abuſed by others, contrary
to his minde.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now to end this Chapter, recite
ſome <hi>remarkable paſsages of Mr. Mulcaſters</hi>
out of his <hi>Poſitions (Ch. 40.)</hi> which I leave to
the conſideration of others, to think how
far they concurre with what I have ſaid, as
well concerning the foundation of a Petty,
as a Grammar-Schoole. </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>If any well-diſpoſed
wealthy man, for the honour that
he beareth to the murthered infants (as all
our erections have ſome reſpect that way)
would begin ſome building, even for the
little yong ones which were no increaſe to
Schooles, but an help to the elementary
degree, all they would pray for him, and
he himſelf ſhould be bound to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the young infants, which put him in
remembrance of ſo vertuous an act.</p>
                     <p>The opportunity of the place, and the
commodity of able Trainers, whereof a
ſmall time will bring forth a great many,
will draw many on, and procure good
Exhibitours, to have the thing go forward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:61977:153"/>
I could wiſh we had fewer Schooles, ſo
they were more ſufficient, and that upon
conſideration of the moſt convenient ſeats
for the Countries, and Shires, there were
many put together, to make ſome few
good.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of under-teachers is not, as we
now practiſe it in Schooles, where indeed
Uſhers be Maſters of themſelves, but to
aſſiſt the Maſter in the eaſier points of his
charge, which ought to have all under
his own teaching, for the chief points,
and the ſame under the Uſhers, for the
more uſual, and eaſie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>AVthority is the true mother of all due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
which the Maſter muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

he may command what he pleaſeth, but
withall, he muſt give the Scholars liberty
to do what they liſt. Which what an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61977:154"/>

in point of behaviour, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
torment to the painful Maſter, and
his Uſhers, and what unavoydable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
it bringeth upon a Schoole, let them
that are Actors, or Spectators thereof, give
teſtimony. 1. That therefore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
may have all his lawful commands
put in execution with due alacrity, and his
decent <hi>orders</hi> deligently obſerved, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it requiſite, that,</p>
                  <p>1. He be ſure in all things to <hi>behave as
a Maſter over himſelf,</hi> not only by refraining
thoſe enormities and groſſer faults, which
may render him ſcandalous to every one,
but <hi>checking his own Paſſions, eſpecially</hi> that
of <hi>Anger;</hi> and if at any time he ſeem to
have cauſe to be provoked to it, and feel
it to come too violently upon him, let
him rather walk aſide a while out of the
Schoole to divert it, then expreſſe it openly
amongſt his Scholars by unſeemly words
or geſturs. He ſhould indeed endeavour
to behave himſelf unblameably in all
Chriſtian-like converſation before all men,
but ſo amongſt his Scholars, that they may
have much wherein to imitate him, but
nothing whereby to diſgrace him. And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his neighbours, his affability ſhould
be ſuch, as to win their love and reſpects,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61977:154"/>
ſo that they may be ready at all times to
countenance the Maſters well-doing, and
to vindicate the credit of him and his
Schoole, when they hear it unjuſtly
traduced.</p>
                  <p>2. When he commands, or forbids any
thing to be done, he ſhould acquaint his
Scholars with the end intended, and the
benefits or inconveniences which attend
ſuch, or ſuch a courſe. For <hi>children</hi> have
ſo much uſe of reaſon as to <hi>delight to heare
perſwaſive arguments of reaſon, though the
declivity of corrupt nature makes, that they do
not much minde them,</hi> where there is no
feare or a rod for doing amiſſe. Yet
ſometimes it may be beſt to ſay onely,
<hi>Do this,</hi> or <hi>do it not,</hi> where you think it of
no concernment to them to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and would make trial of their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to obey, without asking <hi>why or
wherefore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. One main way to bring Scholars to
a loving and awfull reſpect of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
is for him to ſhew himſelfe at all
times pleaſing and chearful towards them,
and unwilling to puniſh them for every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
but withall to carry ſo cloſe an eye
upon all their behaviour, that he can tell
them privately, betwixt himſelf and them
alone, of many faults they commit, when
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61977:155"/>
they think he knowes nothing, and
let them ſee how he dare correct them for
the like offences when they preſume to
commit them again, and eſpecially if
they behave themſelves ſtubbornely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their fellowes. Yet to win a boy of
a more ſtubborne ſpirit, it is better ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to forbeare blowes, when you have
him ſubmit to the rod, then to puniſh
him ſo for a fault, as to make him to
hate you, and out of a deſpight to you to
do the like, or a worſe miſchiefe. And
when any general miſdemeanour is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
the Maſter ſhould ſhew himſelfe
impartial towards all, ſo as either to
pardon or puniſh all. Bu in afflicting
puniſhments, as he ſhould let none eſcape,
ſo he ſhould let the moſt untoward feele
the moſt ſmart; but beware he deal not
rigorouſly, much le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e cruelly with any;
for that will cauſe an utter diſlike in all
the Scholars towards the Maſter, fearing
he will deale ſo with them, in caſe they
ſo offend, and thinking it to be no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of love, where ſeverity of correction
is uſed.</p>
                  <p>4. But nothing works more upon good
natured children, then frequent encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
and commendations for well-doing;
and therefore, when any taske
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61977:155"/>
is performed, or order obſerved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his minde, the Maſter ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
all his Scholars, but eſpecially
the moſt obſervant, and encourage the
weak, and timerous, and admoniſh the
perverſeſt amongſt them to go on in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
their example, in hopes of finding
as much favour at his hands, as they ſee
them to have.</p>
                  <p>5. In ſome places a Maſter is apt
to be moleſted with the reproachfull
clamours of the meaner ſort of people,
that cannot (for the moſt part) endure to
have their children corrected, be the fault
never ſo heinous, but preſently they muſt
come to the Schoole to brave it out with
him; which if they do, the Maſter
ſhould there in a calme manner admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them before all his Scholars, to
ceaſe their clamour, and to conſider how
raſh they are to interrupt his buſineſſe,
and to blame him for doing that duty
to which he is entruſted by themſelves,
and others, their betters: But if they
go about to raiſe ſcandalous reports
upon him, he may do well to get two
or three judicious neighbours to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the matter, and to rebuke the
parties for making ſo much adoe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
little or no occaſion. Thus we
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61977:156"/>
ſhall ſee Scholars abundantly more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the Maſter, when they know how
groſſely he is apt to be wronged by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
perſons, and that wiſe men
are ready to vindicate his cauſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if they once ſee their Maſter liable to
every bodies cenſure, and no man take
his part whatever is ſaid of him, they
themſelves will not care what tales they
make to his utter diſgrace, or ruine;
eſpecially, if he have been any whit
harſh towards them, and they be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to out-ſlip the reines of his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Government.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Schoole-times. Of Scholars going forth
of the Schoole, and of Play dayes.</head>
                  <p>THough in many Schooles I obſerve ſix
a clock in the morning to be the hour
for children to be faſt at their Book, yet
in moſt, ſeven is the conſtant time, both
in Winter and Summer, againſt which
houre, it is fit every Scholar ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at the Schoole. And all they that come
before ſeven, ſhould be permitted to play
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61977:156"/>
about the Schoole, till the clock ſtrike,
on condition they can ſay their parts at
the Maſters coming in; elſe, they are
not to play at all, but to ſettle to their
books, as ſoon as they come.</p>
                  <p>But here the Maſter is to take heed,
that he be neither too rigorous with
thoſe of weaker age or conſtitution for
coming ſomewhat tardy; nor indulgent
towards thoſe, who through manifeſt
ſloth, and frequent loytering, neglect
the houre. For in the one it will breed
a daily timerouſneſſe, and in the other
it will make way to licentiouſneſſe;
and on the one ſide Parents will cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
on the other ſide the Schoole
will receive diſgrace. However the beſt
is to be as ſtrict as poſſibly may be, in
ſeeing that every Scholar come at the
juſt houre, and to note it as a puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fault in him that cometh late; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he bring a note of excuſe from his
Parents, or Hoſt's hand, and a promiſe
withall, that he ſhall not offend often
in that kind.</p>
                  <p>It is not amiſſe for every Scholar in
every Form to put down his name in a
book (kept common for that purpoſe)
ſo ſoon as he comes to Schoole every
day, that it may be upon record, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61977:157"/>
he uſed to come with the foremoſt
or the hindmoſt, and how often he was

Scholars name ſhould be called over
according to the Bill every Schole hour,
and they that are preſent ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for themſelves, by ſaying <hi>Adſum,</hi>
and his next fellow ſhould give notice
of him that is abſent, by ſaying <hi>Abeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The common time of diſmiſſing Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
from Schoole in the fore-noons, is
eleven a clock every day, and in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noons,
on Mondaies, Wedneſdaies,
and Fridaies, five a clock, but on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
after-noons, foure; and on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
three. Touching which, a care
would be taken that the taskes of every
Form may be fully diſpatched rather a
little before thoſe houres then after;
that then the Scholars which intend
writing or cyphering, or the like, may
go to the Writing-ſchoole, as they yet
uſe to doe about <hi>London.</hi> Neither
would I have the Scholars to be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
obſervant of the clock, as juſt upon
the firſt ſtroke of it to ruſh out of the
Schoole: but notice being given to the
Maſter that it is ſtricken, and he having
given the word for diſmiſſing the
Schoole, all the Scholars ſhould come
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61977:157"/>
one by one orderly out of their ſeats ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Forms (the loweſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
firſt, becauſe they are commonly
next the doore) and ſalute him with
their hats in their hands, and ſo quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depart out of the Schoole without
thruſting, or ſtriving one to get out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
another. It were good if there were
hour-glaſſes in the School, to give notice
how the time goes on.</p>
                  <p>And for their ready going home, or
to the writing Schoole, there ſhould be
private Monitors appointed to inform
the Maſter, ſo ſoon as they return to
the Schoole again, who they are that
neglected their duty therein.</p>
                  <p>That ſpace of intermiſſion about nine

Schoole,</hi> and ſome others, and is
ſo much commended by Mr. <hi>Brinſley
(Chap. 33. of his Grammar Schoole)</hi> cannot
ſo well be obſerved, nor is it ſo requiſite
in thoſe Schooles, in which Scholars
meet not till ſeven in the morning; for
the variety of their ſeveral tasks,
will take away that tediouſneſſe that
ſeems to accurre by the length of time,
and thoſe <hi>Subſidiary Books</hi> provided for
the lower Formes, will prevent the
over-toyling of themſelves by their

preſent work. And that thoſe diſorders
which uſually befall in Scholars running
forth in Schoole-time, may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
remedied, this or the like courſe
may be taken.</p>
                  <p>1. Let it not be lawful for above one
boy in twenty to go forth at once; and
at his going forth, let every one come
to the Maſter, or that Uſher to whoſe
charge he belongs, and in his hearing
repeat four or ſix Vocabula's or phraſes,
which he hath not ſaid before, and then
lay down his book, with his name writ
in it in a place appointed within the
Maſters view, that ſo it may be knowne
at once, both how many, and who are
out of doores, and how long they tarry
abroad. At their coming in, they ſhould
again repeat the like number of Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula's

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th.</p>
                  <p>The Maſter ſhould do well now and
then to ſend a privie ſpie, who may
truly obſerve and certifie him, how
every ſcholar ſpendeth his time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and if any be found to go forth
upon no occaſion, or to truant it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doors, let him be cenſured or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
according to his demerits.</p>
                  <p>3. The granting of a Play-day, is to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61977:158"/>
be referred wholly to the diſcretion of
the Maſter, who muſt in this be as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to work his Scholars hinderance,
and the Schooles diſcredit, as willing
by ſuch a courteſie to gratify his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
friends; who if they be any whit
reaſonable, will be eaſily ſatisfied with a
juſt excuſe of denial; but if they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably
importunate, they ought to
be ſerved with as unreaſonable a nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay;
ſo that Play-dayes ſhould be rarely
granted, except to ſuch as may ſeem to
claime more then ordinary intereſt in
the Schoole, and to whom the Maſter is
bound to ſhew his due reſpects, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
before his Scholars.</p>
                  <p>In places of great reſort, and where
often ſollicitation is uſed to be made
for play (eſpecially by mothers that
come to viſit their children which are

piece of an afternoon were deſigned
conſtantly afore-hand, on which (in caſe

might have leave to play; but if not, that

propound to his Scholars, that in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61977:159"/>
caſe they performe all their Tasks very
well and orderly, ſo as to diſpatch them
by ſuch an hour on ſuch a day, they
ſhall play the remainder thereof, &amp; then
(as at other times alſo when a Play-day
is intended) ore of the upper Form (at
leaſt) ſhould make a Petitory Oration to
the Maſter, or them that come to crave
play; and another, a Gratulatory ſpeech,
after leave is obtained.</p>
                  <p>Where both Thurſdayes and Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
in the afternoons are halfe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-dayes,
I think Tueſdayes the fitteſt,
on which to grant play; in other places,
Thurſdayes may ſeem the beſt. But this
I leave to the diſcretion of the Maſter,
who knoweth what is moſt convenient
for his own Schoole.</p>
                  <p>Now in granting a Play-day, theſe
directions may be uſeful.</p>
                  <p>1. That there be never more then
one Play-day granted in one week, and
that onely when there is no Holy-day in
that week, and when the weather alſo is
clear and open, and the ground ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
dry.</p>
                  <p>2. That no Play be granted till one a
clock (at the ſooneſt) when all the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are met, and Orations have been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>3. That all the Scholars be diſmiſſed
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61977:159"/>
orderly into ſome cloſe (or other place
appointed for ſuch a purpoſe) near the
Schoole, where they may play together,
and uſe ſuch honeſt and harmleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
as may moderately exerciſe
their bodies, and not at all endanger
their health.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſome boyes are apt to
ſneak home, or ſtraggle from the reſt of
their fellowes out of their bounds, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
them to play in; you may do
well to give order to him that hath the
Bill of all the names, to call it over at
any time amid their ſport, and to take
notice of all ſuch as have abſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
&amp; to give you an account of them,
when they return into the Schoole;
which ſhould be upon Play-daies before
five of the clock, that they may bleſſe
God for his provident hand over them
that day, and ſo go home. And that
the Maſter may ſometimes ſee into the
various diſpoſition of children, which
doth freely diſcover it ſelfe by their
company, and behaviour at play; he
may now and then take occaſion to
walk at a diſtance from them, or (if he
come nearer) to ſtand out of their ſight,
ſo as he may behold them in the throng
of their recreations, and obſerve their
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61977:160"/>
geſture and words, which if in any thing
they be not as becometh them, he may
afterwards admoniſh them in private to
behave, or ſpeak otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But an eſpecial care muſt be taken,
and a charge accordingly often given,
that your Scholars do at no time play
with any but their own Schoole-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
or other ingenuous children
about home; which their Parents or
Friends know, and whom they are
willing ſhould be admitted into their
company; for beſides the evil which may
be contracted by learning corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and imitating them in many
ſhrewd turns: boyes that are under little
or no command, will be very ſubject to
brabble and fight with Scholars, and
the rather becauſe they know the Maſter
will not allow his Scholars at all to
quarel, and if they can do them any
maime, they will attempt it, that the
Maſter may have occaſion to call them
to account for it. So perverſe is our
corrupt nature (eſpecially) where edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
hath no ſway.</p>

beſt to try, in the preſence of their
Parents or friends that bring them,
what they can do, by cauſing them to
read or write if they can) before them,
that themſelves may be Judges of their
preſent ſtrength or weakneſſe, expect
proficiencie from them according as
they ſee their capacity, not haſtening
them on too faſt, and rating at them
daily, becauſe (perhaps) in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they do not learn ſo well as their
neigbours children</p>
                  <p>The beſt is to admit of young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61977:161"/>
onely once every year, and then
to take in all that can be gotten from
the Petty-Schooles; for company will
encourage children to adventure upon
an uncouth courſe of learning, ſeeing
the more the merrier; and any diſcreet
Parent will be eaſily perſwaded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
his ſon a while, when he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it will be more for his profiting to
have company along with him, as he
learneth, and he may be daily better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in reading Engliſh, and forwarded
by learning to write, before he come
from the Petty-Schoole.</p>
                  <p>The fitteſt ſeaſon of the year for ſuch
a general admiſſion of little ones into
the Grammar-Schoole, doth ſeem to be
about Eaſter; partly becauſe the higher
boyes are uſually then diſpoſed of to
Trades, or the Univerſities, and partly,
becauſe moſt children are then removed
from one Schoole to another, as having
the Summer coming on for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</p>
                  <p>When you have thus admitted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of boyes together, you may let
thoſe that can read beſt, obtain the
higher places, till they come to get the
Rudiments of Latine without book,
and then you may ranke them into a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61977:161"/>
Form. Becauſe,</p>
                  <p>2. It is a main help to the Maſter, and
a furtherance to all the Scholars, that
the whole Schoole be reduced into
Formes, and thoſe alſo as few as may
be, reſpecting the different years, and
capacity of each Scholar. And if there
were ſix hundred Scholars or more in a
Schoole, they might all ſitly be ranked
into ſix Forms, by putting thoſe of
equal age and abilities together, and
the toyle in hearing Parts, or Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and peruſing Exerciſes, (as I
will ſhew anon) would not be much
more with an hundred orderly placed,
and well behaved in a room to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
apart, then with three or foure
ſingle boyes in ſeveral employments.
Not onely becauſe the Maſter or Uſhers
do thus at once impart themſelves to all
alike, and may beſtow more time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them in examining any Task;
but alſo becauſe by this means Aemula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as a main quickner of diligence)
will be wrought amongſt them, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the weakeſt Scholar amongſt
them will be loth to lagge alway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
the reſt; and there is none ſo
ſtupidly blockiſh, but by help of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
will learn that which he would not
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61977:162"/>
obtain being alone, and I have ſeen the
very hindmoſt oftentimes to help all his
fellowes at a dead lift. The Teachers
conſtant care ſhould be in every Form,
as to direct and examine every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
boy, ſo to help forward the weakeſt,
that in every thing he doth, he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
himſelf, and it is not to be ſaid,
with what alacrity they will all ſtrive to
out-doe one another, ſo that ſometimes
he that cometh behinde all the reſt, will
be as fit to make a leader of the Forme,
as thoſe that are the foremoſt in it.</p>
                  <p>To provoke them all therefore to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
and that none may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
or think himſelf injured by being
left behinde; uſe conſtantly once at the
end of a moneth, and when all your
Scholars are together to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e a free
new choyce in every Forme, after this
manner.</p>
                  <p>1. Let every Scholar in the Forme
give his own voyce, concerning which
boy he thinketh to be the beſt profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and ableſt for the preſent to lead
the company; and having ſet him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
let them all paſſe their voyces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
concerning whom they judge fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to ſtand the next to him.</p>
                  <p>2. Then ſet theſe two oppoſite
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61977:162"/>
one to another, ſo as the better Scholar
may take the leading of the upper ſide,
on your right hand, and the other, the
leading of the lower ſide, on your left
hand.</p>
                  <p>3. And that there may not be much
inequality in the ſides, let the lower
leader have the firſt call, and liberty to
take what boy he thinketh the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
out of all the reſt, and then let the
higher leader have the next call, and
liberty to take whom he liketh; and ſo
let them proceed to call by courſe, till
they have (like ball players) ranked all
their fellowes to their ſides, and ſo
ſtrongly and evenly ſet themſelves in a
poſture one ſide againſt another, that it
may be hard for any one to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>By thus chooſing amongſt themſelves,
they will be all ſo well pleaſed, that the
Maſter ſhall never be blamed for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to preferre one boy before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or keeping of any back, that would
ſeem to go faſter then his fellowes at his
Book. And indeed I have ſometimes
admired to obſerve the impartiality and
judgement of children in placing one
another according to their abilities and
parts, waving all other by-reſpects by
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61977:163"/>
which men would be inclined to ſet one
higher, and another lower. Yet if
ſometimes they ſeem to miſtake in their
judgement concerning a boy, that is
but newly come amongſt them; or to be
too partial againſt any other upon ſome
general ſplene, which is but very rare;
The diſcreet Maſter may after the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
correct the error by giving ſuch a
one a place to his own liking, which he
may keep till the next choyce, except
ſome of his inferiours have a liſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with him for his place, and then
he muſt put it to the hazard, having a
lawful time given him to provide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
for the conteſt.</p>
                  <p>3. Let all the Scholars take their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Schoole, according to their
ſeveral Formes, and let every one ſit in
his Form in that order in which he was
elected. It were good that the ſeates
were ſo equally ſet on both ſides the
Schoole, as that the higher ſide of each
Form, might keep the higher ſide of the
School, I mean, that on the Maſters right
hand; and the lower ſide of the Form,
the lower ſide of the Schoole, which is
that on the Maſters left hand. However,
let the upper ſide take alwayes the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the lower, the lower ſeats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:61977:163"/>
This placing of Scholars in an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
manner, ſide againſt ſide, is good in
many reſpects, as,</p>
                  <p>1. To know on a ſuddain who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
in, or abſent out of his place.</p>
                  <p>2. To have them ready paired at all
times for Examinations, Diſputations, or
Orations, or the like.</p>
                  <p>3. To keep order in going in and
out of their ſeats to ſay, or in going
home from Schoole, or the like.</p>
                  <p>4. To increaſe courage in the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
who are delighted to let their
friends ſee, what place they keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, when they come to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
them.</p>
                  <p>As they ſit in their ſeats, be ſure to
keep them continually imployed, by
proportionating every taske to the time
and their ſtrength, with reſpect to the
capacity of the weakeſt; for by this
means, the ſtrongeſt boyes will have
more leiſure to help, and ſee the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
can do their work, for which purpoſe
they ſhould be appointed ſometimes to
ſit in the middle amongſt the reſt, that
they may more readily be conſulted
with, &amp; heard of all. Theſe ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
conſtrue, and ſometimes examine
over their Leſſons, having their Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61977:164"/>
and Dictionaries, and other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiary
books to help them, out of which
they ſhould appoint others to find what
they enquire after; and this will be ſo far
from hindering their own progreſſe,
that it will-encourage them to go faſter
onward, when they ſee how readily
they can lead the way, and incite their
fellowes to follow after them.</p>
                  <p>When in getting Leſſons, the whole
Form ſhall be at a <hi>Non-plus,</hi> let one of
the leaders have recourſe to the Maſter
or Uſhers, or to whom they ſhall appoint
him to go for reſolution. But I have
found it a continual provoking of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
to ſtrive who ſhould learn the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
to let both the ſides of one Form,
as they ſit a part, ſo to look to provide
their Leſſons apart; and when they
come to ſay Parts or Leſſons, or
to perform Exerciſes, to bicker one
with another, and propound thoſe
things to be reſolved in by their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,
which they obſerve the Maſter to
have omitted, and they think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell. And let it be conſtantly noted
which ſide hath the better all the week,
that when afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they come to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
diſpute at the weeks end, for places
or ſides, it may be conſidered.</p>

children may take the opportunity over

But foraſmuch as <hi>Vocabula's</hi> are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie

exerciſed in ſaying them for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons
parts at one a clock, before which
hour they may prepare themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
(even) amid their play.</p>
                  <p>After parts ſaid, the Maſter or his
Uſhers ſhould immediately give Leſſons
to every Form, or appoint a boy out of
an upper Form to give Leſſons to that
which is next below him, in his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which he ſhould diſtinctly conſtrue
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61977:165"/>
once or twice over, and note out all the
Words, wherein the moſt difficulty of
parſing ſeems to lye, and name the
Tropes and Figures, the Phraſes, and
other elegancies that are to be found
(eſpecially) in higher Authours.</p>
                  <p>The Leſſons ſhould be got ready to
be ſaid againſt ten a clock in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
and four in the after noon; at
which time the Scholars ſhould come all
orderly and quietly out of their Form,
and taking their places where they
ought to ſtand, (ſo as one ſide may be
oppoſite to another) they ſhould all
make their ſalutes, and then ſay one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, except they be appointed
otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>For ſometimes when you have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to make more haſtie diſpatch with
a Form, you may cauſe any one or more
to ſay the whole Leſſon, or by pieces;
but be ſure that they all come very well
provided, and that every one be intent
upon what another is ſaying, for which
purpoſe you may note him that hath
been moſt negligent in his ſeat, and ask
him ever and anon, what it was that his
fellow ſaid laſt.</p>
                  <p>To ſave your own lungs in asking
many queſtions, and telling Rules, or
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61977:165"/>
the like, you may let every two boyes
examine one another, and your ſelf
onely help them, when they are both
at a miſtake.</p>
                  <p>You may eaſily amend that common
and troubleſome fault of indiſtinct and
muttering ſpeaking, by calling out a
bold ſpirited little boy, that can ſpeak
with a grace, and encouraging him to
give the other an higher note for the
elevation of his voyce: for this will at
laſt enforce the boy you are troubled
with, to ſpeak louder, and with a better
grace; and to ſtrive to pronounce his
words more diſtinctly, then the other
did before him.</p>
                  <p>After Leſſons are ended, you may let
every one propound what queſtions he
pleaſeth, for his oppoſite to anſwer, and
this will be a means to whet them on to
more diligence in getting them, before
they come to ſay.</p>
                  <p>In the three loweſt Forms, or in
others, where all have the ſame Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or Dictates, you may cauſe onely
him whoſe performance you moſt doubt
of, to read what he hath written both
in Engliſh and Latine, and help him, as
you finde his errour, to correct it, and
ſee that all the reſt amend their own
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61977:166"/>
faults accordingly. Afterwards, you
may let one parſe it both in Engliſh and
Latine, and order them all to write it
over again fair in a Paper-book for
themſelves, and to give you alſo a copy
of it neatly written in a looſe paper,
every Saturday. And thus you ſhall
have every one begin to leane to his
own ſtrength, a thing very neceſſary in
all kinde of Exerciſes, though they doe
the leſſe. If you once take notice of
any boyes ſtrength, you may eaſily
judge of what he bringeth, whether it
be his own, or anothers doing.</p>
                  <p>But in the upper Formes, and where
they have all ſeveral Exerciſes, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that you peruſe what every
Scholar hath done. And for this work,
you may ſet apart Saturday fore-noons,
after Grammatical Examinations are
ended, and before they ſay their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes.
And that they may write them
fair, you ſhould ſometimes compare
them with their Copy-Books, or ſuch
pieces as they writ laſt, at the Writing-Schoole.
Before they bring them to
you to read, let them peruſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Exerciſe amongſt themſelves, and
try what faults they can finde in it; and
as you read them over, where you ſee a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61977:166"/>
groſſe miſtake, explode it; where you
eſpie any over-ſight, note it with a daſh,
that they may amend it; but where you
ſee any fault, which is beyond their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to avoyd, or remedy, do you mildely
correct it for them, and adviſe them to
obſerve it for the future. However, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
not to commend him moſt that hath
done the beſt, and for his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to make him read over his exerciſe
aloud, that others may heare it, and
then to hang it up in an eminent place,
that they may imitate it; and if any one
can afterwards out-doe it, let his exerciſe
be hanged up in its ſtead. But if any
one hath lazily performed his exerciſe,
ſo that it be worſe then all the reſt, let it
be cut in faſhion of a leg, and be hanged
up by the heel, till he make a better, and
deſerve that that may be taken down.
It is not amiſſe alſo, to ſtirre them up to
more diligence, to have a <hi>Common-paper-Book,</hi>
wherein the names of all in every
Form that have <hi>optimè</hi> and <hi>peſſimè</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

priviledge to beg a Play-day once a

what they have tranſlated out of any
Authour in Proſe, ſhould be read out

                  <p>Let that ſide which appeareth to be the
Victor have the upper ſeat in the Schoole,
till a new choice be made, except the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can win it from them before, and
bring them back with a hiſſing diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>Amid theſe diſputes, the Maſter muſt
have a great care to ſuppreſſe noiſe and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
clamour, and ſee that no boy
ſtirre out of his appointed place. For
they are apt to heighten their ſpirits he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
moderation, if the Maſters diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doe not ſettle them.</p>
                  <p>Let it be now lawful for any lower boy
in a Form, to diſpute with one above him
for his place. Mr. <hi>Stockwoods</hi> Diſputations
will be helpfull to the upper Scholars.</p>
                  <p>Now, that all your Scholars may be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
grounded in their Grammar, ſo as
not to be apt to forget what they have
learnt in it; let them all be exerciſed in
the examination of a part of it every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday
morning thus;</p>
                  <p>1. Let the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt and loweſt Form exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the two next above them out of the
examination of the Accidents, asking
them the Queſtions as they are in the
Book, and cauſing them to anſwer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
book, and according to the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:61977:169"/>
2. Then let all thoſe three Forms run
over the Examples of the Declenſions
and Conjugations, as I formerly ſhewed, &amp;
try, who can puſle one another in declining
any hard Noun, or Conjugating and Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Verb, and give the Rule of the
Genders of the one, or Preterperfect tenſe,
or Supin of the other; when theſe have done,</p>
                  <p>3. Let the fourth Form examine the
two higheſt Forms in <hi>Examinatio Latinae
Grammaticae,</hi> and ſometimes in <hi>Elementa
Rhetorices,</hi> and then</p>
                  <p>4. Let all theſe three Forms run over
the Paradigmes of the Greek Declenſions
and Conjugations.</p>
                  <p>5. Afterwards the two upper Forms may
bicker with one another touching Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
niceties, either Latine or Greek, which
they have taken notice of, and collected
into a <hi>Common-place-book,</hi> as I mentioned
before. But a principal care muſt be had to
bring all your Scholars to an habit of
ſpeaking Latine, and therefore a ſtrict
Law ſhould be made and obſerved, that
every Scholar (eſpecially after he hath
been one quarter of a year at Schoole)
ſhould either learn to ſpeak in Latine, or
be enforced to hold his tongue. And to
help the little ones in ſo doing, beſides
thoſe <hi>Phraſiuncula</hi> at the end of <hi>the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61977:169"/>
Grounds of Grammar,</hi> they ſhould have
<hi>Formulae loquendi quotidianae,</hi> ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as are every day uſed (eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Schoole) writ down in a little
book, that they may get them by heart
at by-times. As for the other boyes,
they will be better guided how to ſpeak
by the Rules of Grammar, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
uſe and imitation of approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours.
I conceive, the penury of proper
words and good phraſe, with many Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
is a main reaſon why children are not
as well trained up to ſpeak Latine in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as they are in many places beyond
Seas, and the ready &amp; frequent uſe of their
Mother-tongue cauſeth, that they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reclaimed from it to make uſe of another
Language. Whereas, if whileſt they are
at the Schoole, they might hear little or
no Engliſh ſpoken, nor be ſuffered to
ſpeak it, they would quickly conforme
themſelves to diſcourſe in Latine. As I
have known French boyes that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not a word in Engliſh, to be able in
two or three moneths to talk it as readily,
as they that were Engliſh borne. Onely
at the firſt, one muſt wink at their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprieties,
and harſhneſſe in pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of ſome words and phraſes, and
take their meaning by what they ſpeak,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61977:170"/>
and after a while by cuſtome and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of others, they will ſpeak in Latine,
as properly as the beſt; eſpecially after
they have gained the knowledge of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
accuſtomed themſelves to obſerve
the ſtyle of Latine Authours.</p>
                  <p>No day in the week ſhould paſſe on
which ſome Declamation, Oration, or
Theme ſhould not be pronounced, about
a quarter of an hour before the Schoole
be broken up, and after Leſſons are all
ended in the forenoon. That by aſſiduity
in theſe exerciſes, the Scholars may be
emboldened to perform them with a
grace before whomſoever, and upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of any ſolemnity, or coming of
Friends into the Schoole. There ſhould
be two ſtanding desks ſet oppoſite in the
midſt of the Schoole, for boyes to ſtand

                  <p>1. BEſides that courſe which we have
preſcribed afore to every Form, of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61977:170"/>
reading part of a Latine or Greek Chapter
before parts; it is neceſsary for childrens
more profiting in the Scriptures, to cauſe
that an Engliſh Chapter he read every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the beginning, and every night at the
giving over Teaching. And in this, every
boy throughout the Schoole ſhould take
his turn, that it may be known how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
he is in reading Engliſh readily, and
diſtinctly. Let him that is to read, take
his place at a desk in the middle of the
Schoole, and be ſure he ſpeak aloud, and
let every one reverently attend to what is
read, the lower boyes looking upon their
Engliſh, and the higher upon their <hi>Latine
Bibles.</hi> Thoſe alſo that are able to make
uſe of the <hi>Septuagint in Greek,</hi> may doe
well to procure them to look upon, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſeeing they are now to be had at a far
cheaper rate then formerly, bring but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
printed. When the Chapter is ended,
you may demand of one in each Form
what he obſerved, and let any one that is
diſpoſed, take the liberty to ask his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
a queſtion or two concerning ſome
paſsage in it. <hi>Mr. Pagets Hiſtory of the
Bible</hi> will aſſiſt them herein, ſo they look
upon it, before the Chapter be read; you
your ſelf may do well ſometimes to tell
them what things are moſt remarkable in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61977:171"/>
that preſent Chapter. The Scholars of
the upper Formes may do well to carry <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriale
Biblicum</hi> conſtantly in their pocket,
by which they may be put in minde at all
times, what paſsages they may finde in
any Chapter.</p>
                  <p>2. After the Chapter is ended, they
may ſing the firſt, threeſcore and ſecond,
the hundred, or hundreth and thirteenth
Pſalm in Latine out of a little book for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which one of the
head Scholars ſhould diſtinctly read unto
them.</p>
                  <p>3. When the Pſalm is done, the ſame
Scholar ſhould repeat thoſe admonitions
at the end of <hi>Nowels</hi> Catechiſme, and then
the whole Schoole ſhould rehearſe thoſe
Hymnes, which are there, the higher ſide
of the Schoole ſaying one verſe, and the
lower the next <hi>alternatum &amp; conjunctis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus;</hi>
and at laſt conclude with one of
thoſe prayers for a bleſſing upon your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Pſalmes</hi> would be all
writ together both in Engliſh and Latine
in a little book, which would be neceſsary
to be kept in the Schoole, for continuall,
and daily uſe.</p>
                  <p>Some courſe would be taken that the
Maſter may have notice what Scholars o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61977:171"/>
the reading of a Chapter at home eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night after ſupper; but for this pious
exerciſe (I hope) every Chriſtian Parent
will be ready to call upon and encourage
their own Children, or others that are
under their charge, as Tablers.</p>
                  <p>Now that the good Schoolmaſter may
more fully diſcharge his duty towards
God and his Church (who have both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
him with the education of their
children) to nurture and bring them up in
the fear of the Lord; it were expedient,
if a courſe could be taken, that he might
meet them all at the Schoole every Lords
day in the morning, about an hour afore
Church-time, where he may take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
to inſtruct them in <hi>Catecheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
doctrines,</hi> according to what he may
read in many excellent Books, that are as
<hi>Expoſitions of the Lords prayer, the Creed,
and the ten Commandements,</hi> and not wilde
it in a tedious, unmethodized diſcourſe,
concerning things unneceſsary to be taken
notice of, and unmeet for children to be
puſled with. And after a Pſalme ſung,
and a Prayer ſaid, he may ſee them go all
before him orderly by two and two to the
Church, where it is requiſite that they
ſhould have a convenient place appointed
to ſit in together by themſelves, and all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61977:172"/>
within the Maſters view. This would be
an eſpeciall means to prevent that unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
behaviour in the Church, which is too
uſuall amongſt Scholars, when they are
glad to wander into by-corners to ſit
down to reſt (or rather chat) in, or are
ever and anon moleſted with quarrelſome
lads, or unmannerly fellowes, that are apt
to diſquiet them, and thruſt them out of
their places. I have heretofore obſerved
how <hi>the ninth Canon</hi> of our Church religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
enjoynes every Schoole-maſter <hi>to
ſee his Scholars quietly and ſoberly behave
themſelves in the Church, and examine them
at times convenient after their return, what
they have borne away of any Sermon,</hi> which
he cannot well doe, except he have them
all confined to one place, where himſelf
may ſit near them.</p>
                  <p>After Church-time ended in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
the Maſter may doe well to ſee all
his Scholars go before him in like order to
the Schoole, where he ſhould examine
them, what they have heard or writ
at the Sermon. Now in repeating Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
this courſe may be taken;</p>
                  <p>1. Let every one of the lower Scholars
repeat the Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, or a Proof, or ſome little
pious Sentence, which was then delivered.
And theſe he ſhould get either by his own
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61977:172"/>
attention at the Church, or by the help of
his fellowes afterwards. For there ſhould
be no ſtirre made in the Church, upon
pretence of getting notes there.</p>
                  <p>2. Thoſe in the four middle moſt Forms
ſhould mind to write the Text, Doctrines,
Reaſons, Uſes, Motives, and Directions,
with the Quotations of Scripture places,
as they are beſt able.</p>
                  <p>3. Theſe in the higheſt Form ſhould
ſtrive to write as much, and in as good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as poſſibly may be; your ſelf now and
then hinting to them ſome direction, what
method they ſhould obſerve in writing
Sermons, and that may diſgeſt what
they have written into that order, wherein
they heard it deliver'd; let them have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time of reſpit amongſt themſelves, to
compare their notes one with another, and
to ſupply their defects, and amend what
they have miſtaken. Then</p>
                  <p>4. You may firſt cauſe one of your higher
Scholars to read diſtinctly what he hath
written, and afterwards two or three of
other Forms, whom you pleaſe to pick out;
and laſt of all, let every one of the loweſt
Form tell you what he hath obſerved of
the Sermon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being orderly done, you
may enlarge a little upon what point you
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61977:173"/>
think moſt neceſſary for them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and practiſe, and conclude this
holy dayes exerciſe, with ſinging of a
Pſalm and devout prayers, and charging
your Scholars to ſpend the reſt of the time
in reading the Scriptures, and ſuch reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
books as tend to their farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
in Chriſtian piety, you may comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably

Wherein you ſee the letters above deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the dayes of the week, the letters on
the ſide ſhew the place where every Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
name ſhould be written, and the pricks
within the lines, how every default may
eaſily be marked with a pin, or a pen.
So that,</p>
                  <p>1. This Bill may ſerve as a Catalogue
to be called over every day at Schoole-houres
to know who are abſent, and may
ſave a deale of trouble in making little
notes of Scholars frequent miſdemeanours.</p>
                  <p>2. If you cauſe every Bill to be dated,
and keep them by you, you may know at
any time who is the ſhrewdeſt, or moſt
orderly boy amongſt the reſt, and give
publick notice accordingly, that the one
may be admoniſhed to amend his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the other encouraged to go on in
well-doing.</p>
                  <p>3. Beſides, it will work the greater
awe among all the Scholars, when they
ſhall know every fault they commit whilſt
they are at the Schoole will be upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
though the Maſter doth never pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
it.</p>
                  <p>4. You ſhall finde it a meanes of much
eaſe to your ſelfe, when you ſhall need
onely to bid the Monitor t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a neglect, or fault committed
and let it ſo remaine, till ſome fitter
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61977:174"/>
opportunity or juſt occaſion invite or
or (rather) enforce you to call to a
reckoning.</p>
                  <p>5. For when you perceive any generall
diſorder, or ſome groſſe thing is done,
which ought not to eſcape correction.
you may call for the Bill, and then
cenſure thoſe onely for example, whom
you finde to be moſt often, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
peccant, ſuffering the reſt (that you
called forth) to eſcape with an admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to beware for the future.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſhall gain your Scholars affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
when they ſhall ſee you unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to puniſh any without great cauſe; &amp;
avoid that common out-cry which is wont
to be made againſt a Schoole-maſter, upon
report of a multitude of boyes being whipt
at once.</p>
                  <p>6. So many pricks as are found upon
any boyes name, may be ſaid to deſerve ſo
many jerks; but herein much diſcretion is
to be uſed, that you ſeem not too ſevere, nor
prove too partial. You may ſometimes tell
your Scholars what faults deſerve more or
fewer pricks; as idleneſſe one, wandring
forth one, fighting three; ſwearing, four,
or the like: which are to be noted in the
Bill more or leſſe, according to the nature
of the faults themſelves.</p>
                  <p>He that is publick Monitor in one of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61977:175"/>
two higheſt Forms may appoint two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Monitors to himſelf in every other
Form, which may give him ſecret infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of every miſmedeanour committed
in any place; and this will be an eſpecial
meanes to keep all in very good order,
with <hi>ſeldome and moderate correction; a thing
to be deſired</hi> by every Schoole-Maſter for
his own e{aſe, and his Scholars better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Scholars in every Form, which
are indeed the moſt ſtudious and diligent
in their taskes, and conſtantly obſervant
to keep good order, ſhould often be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to their fellowes, as patterns for
them to imitat; and when any one hath
performed any task or exerciſe better then
ordinary, he ſhould receive ſome ſmall
gift at his Maſters hand, as a new
pen-knife, or a paper-book, or the like
ſignal Teſtimony of the Maſters appproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what he hath done. Thoſe Parents
which are of more ability, may do well
to allow the Maſter a ſmall ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to reward their ſonnes diligence now
and then, and to excite them to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
performances of their taskes and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
which will invite them to go faſter

                  <p>As for inflicting puniſhments even upon
the meaneſt &amp; worſt of children, it ſhould
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61977:175"/>
ever be the moſt unwilling piece of work
that a Maſter can take in hand; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſhould not be haſty to puniſh any
fault, whereof the Scholar hath not been
praemoniſhed, except it be ſuch a notorious
crime, as a boy cannot but know before-hand;
that he ought not to have done it.
As for the <hi>Ferula,</hi> I wiſh (&amp; as I have already
done) for many reaſons, which it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to commit to paper, that it might be
utterly baniſhed out of all Schooles. A good
ſharp birchen rod, and free from knot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>;
(for willow wands are unſufferable, and
fitter for a Bedlam then a School) as it will
break no bones, nor endanger any limbs,
ſo it will be ſufficient wherewith to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
thoſe that ſhall deſerve it in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
forms, and for the higher Scholars, that
will not behave as they ought to do,
without blowes; a good ſwitch about their
ſhoulders would (in <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
ſeem fitter then a rod elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
and his reaſon is ſo modeſtly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to nature, that as I am loth to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, ſo I wonder that it hath not more
prevailed with many diſcreet Schoole-Maſters,
who (I perſwade my ſelfe) have
often read it, &amp; cannot but approve of it as
moſt Chriſtian, however it dropt from a
Heathens pen, But <hi>Nobilis equus umbra
virgae regitur.</hi> Ingenuous and towardly
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61977:176"/>
Scholars will not need ſo much as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a rod. And towards others that
ſeem to extort a rod from the Maſter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will or not, and (as I may ſay)
will enforce him to fight, he ſhould gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
uſe ſuch clemency in his hand, as not
to exceed three laſhes; in the laying on of
which, he may contribute more or leſs
weight, with reſpect to the demerits of
the fault. But of this he ſhould alway
make ſure, that he never let the offender
go from him with a ſtubborn look, or a
ſtomachful geſture, much leſs with a ſqueal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out-cry, or muttering to himſelfe; all
which may be eaſily taken off with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſmart jerk or or two: but you ſhould
rather let him ſtand aſide a little, and ſee
how his ſtomach will ſettle.</p>
                  <p>That a boy may at once know you dare
adventure to whip him, and withall, how
little you delight in his skin; you may at
ſome time, when he hath cauſe to think
that he hath well deſerved a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and when you have him ready for
the rod, paſs him over with an admonition
to beware another time; and if he again
be peccant in the ſame kinde, you may
give him more cauſe at preſent to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
both his faults together, and for the
future to avoid them.</p>
                  <p>This even and indifferent carriage in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61977:176"/>
rewards and puniſhments, will make theſe
Scholars that have any ingenuity in them,
leſs willing to offend, and incline the reſt
to behave more dutifully, becauſe they ſee
their Maſter beare ſuch a loving minde
towards them all, and to be ſharp in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
none, but thoſe that know they
well deſerved what blowes they had.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe boyes that do ſlight good
order, and are apt to ſtirre up others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
them, (which are uſually thoſe of big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

without any cauſe love to truant it abroad,
or by other licentious demeanor bring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to your Schoole, or offer any affronts
to your ſelfe; I conceive your beſt way is
(at a fitting opportunity) to ſend for their
Parents, or friends, with 1 or 2 Judicious
neighbours to be by (where there are no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the School) &amp; to let them juſtly
know the fault, and adjudge what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſuch a boy deſerveth; but if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
be unwilling to have him corrected
for his peremptory diſorders, chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſend him home with them, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him any longer to the diſturbance of
the Schoole or your own unquiet. This
you ſhall finde as an eſpecial remedy to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61977:177"/>
prevent ſuch clamorous out-cries of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Tyranny, when every jerk that is
given to a notorious unhappy boy for his
inſolent misbehaviour, ſhall chance to be
multiplyed in the relating, (like <hi>Scoggins</hi>

obloquie and miſ-report, what hinderance
it bringeth to the flouriſhing of a Schoole,
and what unſeemly diſgrace to a worthy
Maſter, I need not mention.</p>
                  <p>But, becauſe ſuch boyes as theſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are apt to take it as an argument of
the Maſters puſillanimity, thus to ſend for
their <hi>Parents,</hi> who <hi>generally do not love to
heare of their childrens faults;</hi> the Maſter
may take an occaſion, where he ſees ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonitions
will not prevaile, to watch
them more ſtrictly at every turn, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found them to have committed ſome
groſſe enormity, to chaſtiſe them more
ſmartly then ordinarily, yet ſo as to ſhew
no rigour. And if after that he perceive
them wilfully to ruſh into the ſame acts of
lewdneſſe, let him fairly turne them out
of his Schoole, and ſignify the cauſe to their
friends: at whoſe entreaties he ſhould
never take them again, except they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to forfeit a ſum of money to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
in publick Books, in caſe they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in that nature again.</p>
                  <p>As for the leſſer ſort of children, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61977:177"/>
are apt to reiterate the ſame fault too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
for which they have ſometimes been
already corrected; your ſureſt way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
them is, after you have once given
them warning, to whip them for a fault,
and if that will do no good, to double your
ſtrokes the ſecond time; but if a third time
they come under the rod, and beg heartily
for pardon, (as commonly then they will
do, fearing leſt their puniſhment ſhould be
tripled) you ſhould not let them paſs, except
they can procure two of your more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
boys, or one that is in your favour for
his conſtant well-doing, to give their words
for them, and to engage to be whipt for
them, if ever they do the like. If you ſee
they get ſureties to your likeing, you may
let them eſcape ſo; but if they cannot, you
may adventure to take their own ſingle
words; and the care of their ſureties, and
fear to diſpleaſe you again, will ſo work
upon them, that they will ſeldom or never
do the like afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Such faults as are vitiouſly enormous,
are to be duely puniſhed with a rod, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the obliquity of the will appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in them, more or leſs; as for ſuch as
are committed for want of underſtanding,
they are to be remedied by due inſtruction,
but thoſe that ſeem to offend through lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and careleſs neglect, ſhould be abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61977:178"/>
of deſired liberty, when others have
leave to play. The ſhutting of children
up for a while into a dark room, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
them of a meals meat, or the like
(which are uſed in ſome Tabling Schools)
as they are not of good report, ſo they
cannot be commendably or conveniently
uſed in our greater Schooles.</p>
                  <p>But theſe things I leave to the diſcretion
of every prudent Maſter, who is able to
judg of every particular action by its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

that, and alſo ſhew what heed is to
be taken about keeping their Books.</p>
                  <p>The uſual way for Scholars learning to
write at the Country Grammar-Schooles,
is to entertain an honeſt and skilful Pen-man,
that he may conſtantly come and
continue with them about a moneth or ſix
weeks together every year, in which time
commonly every one may learn to write
legibly. The beſt ſeaſon for ſuch a mans
coming is about <hi>May</hi>-day, partly becauſe
the dayes are then pretty long, and partly
becauſe it will be requiſite for ſuch as are
then getting their Grammar Rudiments,
to learne to write before they come to
Tranſlations. The Parents of all other
children would be adviſed to let them take
that opportunity to improve their hands,
foraſmuch as the benefit thereof will far
exceed the charge, &amp; it will be a means of
better order to have all employed together
about a thing ſo neceſſary. The Maſter of
the Schoole ſhould often have an eye upon
them, to ſee what they do, and how they
profit, and that they may not ſlack in their
other learning, he may hear them a part at
morn, and a leſſon at noon before their
Copies be ſet, or their books can be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for them; and proportion their week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſes accordingly, And that the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61977:179"/>
ſtock which they then get, may be better
increaſed againſt the next year, the Pen-man
ſhould cauſe them to write a piece,
a day or two before he leave them, as fair
as they can, with the date above it, and
their names ſubſcribed underneath, which
the Schoole-Maſter may ſafely keep by him
as a Teſtimony of what they can perform,
&amp; take care to ſee that their writing for the
future be not much worſe, This Pattern or
Copy I formerly received from that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
pen-man <hi>Mr. Roger Evans,</hi> who had

                     <hi>John Tradeſcants,</hi> or the like houſes or

a <hi>Collection of Rarities;</hi> could
Parents at home but halfe ſo well look to
their behaviour, as the Maſters do to their
learning at Schoole) it is ordinary for
Scholars at eleven and five a clock to go to
the Writing-Schooles, and there to benefit
themſelves in writing. In that City there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
having the opportunity of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of my ſingular loving friend
<hi>Mr. James Hodder,</hi> (whoſe <hi>Coppy bookes</hi> of
late printed, do ſufficiently teſtify his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the profeſſion he hath undertaken,
and of whoſe care and pains I have had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
triall by his profiting of my Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
for (at leaſt) twelve years together;
who had moſt of them learned of him to
write a very fair hand; not to ſpeak of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,
or Merchants Accounts, which
they gained alſo by his teaching at ſpare
times) <hi>In the Token-houſe garden in Loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
ſomewhat near the <hi>Old-Exchange;</hi> I
ſo ordered the buſineſs with him, that all
my lower Scholars had their little Paper-books
ruled, wherein they writ their leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
fair, and then their Tranſlations, and
other Exerciſes in looſe papers in his
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61977:180"/>
ſight, untill they were able to do every
thing of themſelves in a handſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
And afterwards it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsed,
what pleaſure they took in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and flouriſhing their Exerciſes, all
the while they continued with me at the
Schoole. This or a better courſe (perhaps)
may be taken at other Schooles, where
they have a Writing-Maſter conſtant and
ready to attend them every day through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the year, as I have heard <hi>Mr. Farnaby</hi>
made uſe of <hi>Mr. Taylor</hi> a famous Pen-man,
for the teaching his Scholars to write. If
at any time a Scholar doth not write his
Exerciſes in the faireſt manner that he is
able, his puniſhment may be to write them
over again, whileſt others play. I have
been told of a Porter, that could neither
write nor read, who if at any time he had
ſeen his ſon write his Exerciſes at home,
in a worſe hand then he thought he was
able to do, would teare them to pieces,
and thus at laſt enforced the young Scholar
upon a very good hand of writing; which
rude kinde of dealing with a childe,
though I would have no Parents to imitate,
yet I would adviſe them ſometimes to look
upon their childrens writing at home, and
to encourage them to do it in the neateſt
faſhion. For as it will be an ornament to
them in their learning, and an eſpeciall
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61977:180"/>
furtherance of their Studies, or future
employments elſewhere, ſo it will be
a great eaſe to the Maſter in the peruſal
of what they have written; I, with ſome
others, have bin ſorry to ſee ſome of that
reverend and learned <hi>Mr. Hookers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
come <hi>in manuſcript</hi> to the preſſe,
and not to have been poſſible to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
becauſe they were ſo ſcriblingly
written, that no body could read three
words together in them. It is commonly
objected to the beſt Scholars in any of
the three Profeſſions, that they write the
worſt hands, and therefore I wiſh that
care may be taken to prevent that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
at the Schoole, to a future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>Now to train up Scholars as well in

                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:61977:181"/>
2. To make every <hi>Comma, Colon, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micolon,

and notes of <hi>Admiration,</hi> &amp;c. in
their due places.</p>
                  <p>3. To write all their words in an even
line with the tops, bellies, and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
of the letters of an even ſize, and
when they have an occaſion to divide
any word, to part it by its juſt ſyllables,
making this mark Hyphen (-) at the end
of the line. And</p>
                  <p>4. In Latine to give an Adverb, or
other word its note of difference, &amp; the
like, as the Grammar will further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them. But for directions in fair wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
I refer him to that ſheet which <hi>Mr.
Hodder</hi> hath cauſed to be printed before
his <hi>Copy-book,</hi> which will ſufficiently
commend its Authour.</p>
                  <p>After they have once got an habit of
theſe things, they wil more eaſily obſerve
them in future Exerciſes, the neglect
whereof will be harder to remedie after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which I have ſeen too groſſe in
ſome mens letters that have come from
the Univerſities.</p>
                  <p>As for Books; a care would be firſt had
to procure thoſe of a faire print in good
paper, and ſtrongly bound; then the
Maſter may more eaſily ſee that his
Scholars keep them all fafe and cleanly,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61977:181"/>
and free from ſcribling or rending, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them at a time unexepcted to bring
all their books before him, and to ſhew their
names, together with a note of the price, fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
writ in the middle of every one of them,
as well as at the beginning or end. And that
none may ſquander his own or pilfer away
anothers book, or have it careleſly thrown
about, or to ſeek, when he ſhould uſe it, the
Maſter may do well to make every Scholar
once a quarter to deliver him <hi>a Catalogue of
his Books,</hi> with the day of the moneth and
his name ſubſcribed, which he may lay by
him, ſo as at any time to call him whom he
ſuſpecteth to be negligent of his books, to a
private and particular account of them.
That the Schoole may be furniſhed with all
kind of <hi>Subſidiary books</hi> for the general uſe of
all the Scholars (to be laid up in <hi>Repoſitories</hi>
or Preſſes, as ſo many little Libraries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to every Form, and to be ſafely kept
under lock and key) whereof the headſt boy
in each Form ſhould take the charge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them out, and ſee they be brought in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
night without being abuſed; it would
not be amiſſe, that every Scholar which is
admitted into the Schoole, ſhould give 12.
pence (beſides what is accuſtomed to be paid
to the Maſter) and every one at his removeal
into a new Form ſhould give 12. pence lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
towards the procuring of common
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61977:182"/>
books. The Maſter alſo may do well to ſtir
up his friends that come to viſit the Schoole,
or eſpecially ſuch as prevaile with him for
a Play-day, to contribute ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the furtherance of childrens learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as well as to be earneſtly importunate for
that which may hinder it. But where a
Schoole is liberally endowed, it would be
good that a conſiderable ſtock of mony were
appointed to be laid out yearly in all kinde
of Schoole-books, whereby the poorer ſort
of children may have whereon to learn, and
they, &amp; all other Scholars, wherewith to help
themſelves in their Leſſons and Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>And might I become a Petitioner to the
forementioned <hi>Truſtees, for the maintenance of
Students,</hi> or any that are both willing &amp; able
to promote the growth of good learning, I
ſhould deſire, that <hi>towards the better compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Library well furniſhed with all ſorts of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,
Phraſe-books Lexicons, Dictionaries, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Poets, Hiſtories, Herbals, Commentators,

in any thing that ſhall be neceſſary for
them to know. For <hi>every new Maſter cannot
at the firſt be provided of a good study of books,</hi>
for his own private uſe, and his Scholars
benefit, neither indeed at any time can he
procure them, without great trouble and
charge, eſpecially, if he live at a place far
diſtant from <hi>London.</hi> I have obſerved it
therefore as a great point of diſcretion, as
well as a matter of charity, in <hi>Mr. Calfe,</hi> that
in founding his Grammar-Schoole at <hi>Lewin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
he provided a Library for the Maſters
uſe, as well as a houſe for him to dwell in.
And I took notice of that charitably diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Gentleman, and Citizen Deputy <hi>Adams;</hi>
that when he went about to erect a School in
his native country of <hi>Shropſhire</hi> (if I miſtake
not) he conſulted with <hi>Mr. Langley,</hi> and
brought him along with him to <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi>
to ſee what books he judged moſt convenient
to furniſh a Library withall for the Schoole-Maſters
uſe, and I heard ſince he beſtowed
(at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>) 100. l. in choice books for that
purpoſe. I onely mention theſe two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
perſons (the <hi>former</hi> whereof is dead,
and the <hi>latter</hi> living in <hi>Lawrence</hi> Lane
<hi>London)</hi> to let others ſee, that in this
preſent age of ours, we want not patterns
of well doing, if any be deſirous to imitate
them in their pious actions; and I hope God
hath already inclined the hearts of many, as
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61977:183"/>
he hath given them ſtore of riches, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to diſtribute and do good in this
kind, even now whileſt they live, in their
generation.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude this Chapter with that
which I heard lately related, of a cheap, eaſy,
profiting, and pious work of charity, which
one did, in beſtowing 40. 8. <hi>per annum,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
buying <hi>Engliſh Bibles,</hi> which were to
be given to thoſe children in the Pariſh, that
were beſt able to read in them; and I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe, that were an annuall ſumme laid
out in procuring a certain number of books,
for ſuch as ſhould beſt deſerve them in every
Form at a Free Schoole, it would be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
incitement to provoke children to learn,
then any perſwaſions or enforcements which
are commonly yet uſed.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Excluſion, and breaking up Schoole,
and of Potations.</head>
                  <p>I Should here adde ſomething touching
thoſe uſual cuſtomes which are yet on
foot in moſt places, of Scholars excluding,
or ſhutting out the Maſter once a year, and
capitulating with him about orders to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
or the like; but foraſmuch as I ſee they
differ very much, and are of late diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61977:183"/>
in many Schooles, I will onely mention
how they may be carried on, where they
yet remain, without any conteſt, or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
till at laſt they dye of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore there ſhould be no <hi>Excluſion,</hi>
till after <hi>Saint Andews</hi> day, and that the
Maſter know of it before-hand, that all
things may be ordered handſomely to the
credit of the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>2. That at the time of Excluſion, the
Scholars behave themſelves merrily and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
about the Schoole, without injuring
one another, or making uſe of any weapons,
whereby to endanger themſelves, or doe
harm to any thing in the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Heads of each Form conſult
with their fellowes, what things they would
deſire of the Maſter, and that they bring their
ſuites to the higheſt Scholar in the Schoole,
that he may prefer them to the Maſter writ
fairly in Latine, to receive his approbation
or diſlike of them, in a milde way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>4. That the Maſter doe not moleſt, or
come amongſt his Scholars, all the while
they are drawing up their Petition about
Schoole-orders, nor trouble himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, more then to hear that they
keep good rule.</p>
                  <p>5. That every Scholar prepare all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
according to his Form, to be ready
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61977:184"/>
to be hanged out before the Schoole doors,
or windowes (or rather to be hanged over
his place within the Schoole, againſt the
Maſters coming.</p>
                  <p>6. That the Maſter upon notice that all
things are prepared for his coming, goe
quietly to the Schoole, being accompanied
with ſome of the Scholars Parents, and after
he have before witneſſe ſubſcribed to their
Petition at the door, to enter into the School
in a peaceable and loving manner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from his Scholars, (and alſo make to
them) a ſhort congratulatory Oration, and
ſo diſmiſſe them to play.</p>
                  <p>By thus doing, a Maſter ſhall both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his Scholars, behaving themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, in ſuch rude and tumultuous
manner, as hath formerly been uſed; and
give them and their Parents no occaſion to
grudge at him, for ſeeming to take upon him
too abruptly to break <hi>old uſe and custome;</hi>
which ſo long as it becometh an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their learning, may the better be
indulged to young Scholars, whileſt no evill
conſequences attend it. It is yet a cuſtome
retained in ſome Schooles in the Countrey,
for Scholars to make <hi>a Potation</hi> or generall
Feaſt once a yeare; (and that commonly
before <hi>Shrovetide)</hi> towards defraying the
charge whereof, every one bringeth ſo much
money, as his Parents think good to allow
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61977:184"/>
him, and giveth it to the Maſter to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in a dinner orderly provided for
them, or in ſome kinde of banquetting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which children are commonly more
delighted withall; and for this there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no further direction then to ſay, that it
concerneth the Maſter at ſuch times to be
cheerfull and free in entertainment of his
Scholars (whether at his own houſe or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)
and to ſee that they keep ſuch order
and moderation (eſpecially in drinking)
that it may rather be a refreſhment and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to them (as it is indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
then any occaſion of diſtemper or
debauched behaviour amongſt them. And
after thanks given to God for his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, in that particular expreſſion of
joy and rejoycing one with another, the
Scholars ſhould all goe together into the
fields to take a little more liberty of Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
then ordinary; yet with an eſpecial
regard had, that they catch no cold, or
otherwiſe endanger their bodies.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>London,</hi> and moſt other places, the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
manner remaineth of <hi>Breaking up Schooles</hi>
(for a time of intermiſſion of Studies, and
viſiting of friends) about a week before
<hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> till the
week following thoſe holy dayes begin, at
which time every Scholar bringeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Maſter as a token of his own,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61977:185"/>
and his Parents gratitude, for his care and
love towards him. Now that the Maſter may
alſo then teſtify his forwardneſſe to requite
their courteſies, and encourage his Scholars,
he ſhould every <hi>Breaking up day,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Provide ſome fitting Collation to
be imparted and diſtributed by himſelfe
to his Scholars, who will thankfully take a
ſmall gift, as a token of more ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at his hands, then anothers.</p>
                  <p>2. Invite his Scholars Parents, together
with ſuch Gentlemen and Miniſters, as he is
better acquainted withall, as well to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what his Scholars in every Form are
able to doe, as to grace him with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>3. Let the Scholars in each Form be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with ſuch Exerciſes as belong to
them, in looſe papers, and have all their
Tranſlations writ fairly in their books, to be
ready to ſhew to any one that ſhall deſire to
look upon them. The higher Forms ſhould
entertain the company with ſome elegant
Latine Comedy out of <hi>Terence</hi> or <hi>Plautus,</hi>
and part of a Greek one out of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi>
as alſo with ſuch Orations, and Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Coppies of ſeveral ſorts of verſes,
as are moſt proper for celebrating the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of the time at hand, and to give
ſatisfaction to the preſent meeting. The leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
boyes ſhould remain orderly in their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61977:185"/>
formes, to be ready to give anſwer to any
one that ſhall examine them in what they
have learnt, or would know what they are
able to perform.</p>
                  <p>This, as it will be an encouragement to
the Scholars to go on cheerfully at their
books, ſo will it be an endearment of their
friends to the Maſter, and a meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the credit of the Schoole againſt all
virulous aſperſions, that are apt cauſeleſly,
and too often to be caſt upon it, by unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and illiterate perſons.</p>
                  <p>It were neceſſary that ſuch orders as you
would have your Scholars duely to obſerve,
and the mulct to be undergone for every
particular default, were fairely written in a
Table, and hanged up in ſome eminent
place in the Schoole, that every one may at
any time take notice of them, and learn
more readily to conform to your Diſcipline.
I had thought here to have added another
ſheet or two concerning <hi>Schoole-orders,</hi> and
Scholars more decent <hi>Behaviour;</hi> but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the preſent haſte of the preſs in finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I chooſe rather to deferre them till another
opportunity. For, whileſt I intended onely
to give a few directions to the leſſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
for the better ordering of Grammar
Scholars; I have run over moſt of the moſt
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61977:186"/>
conſiderable matters which concern the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of a Schoole. Which, a man that is
conſtant to his employment, loving towards
children, diſcreet in his behaviour, a well
grouuded Scholar, and an honeſt Chriſtian,
deſirous to ſerve God cheerfully in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a Schoole Maſter, may undoubtedly
perform without any extraordinary toyle or
diſturbance, either of minde or body. God
in mercy enable me, and all that labour in
this neceſſary profeſſion to perſevere in our
duty, <hi>whatever diſcouragements may ſeem to
attend it.</hi>

                  <p>THat none may cenſure <hi>this Diſcovery</hi>
which I have made to be an uncouth
way of Teaching, or contrary to what had
been aforetime obſerved by my Predeceſſors
at <hi>Rotherham</hi> Schoole (which is the ſame
that moſt Schoole-Maſters yet uſe) I have
hereto annexed their method, juſt as I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it from the mouth of ſome Scholars, who
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61977:186"/>
had been trained up therein all their time
at that Schoole, and thence ſent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity;
before I came thither to be Maſter,</p>
                  <p>The cuſtome was,</p>
                  <p>1. To enter boyes to the Schoole one by
one, as they were fit for the Accidents, and
to let them proceed therein ſeverally, till ſo
many others came to them, as were fit to be
ranked with them in a form.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were firſt put to read the Accidents,
and afterwards made to commit it to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
which when they had done, they
were exerciſed in conſtruing and parſing the
examples in the Engliſh Rules, and this was
called the firſt form: of which it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſay four Leſſons a day; but of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forms, a part and a Leſson in the fore-noons,
and a Leſson onely in the after.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond form was,</p>
                  <p>1. To repeat the Accidents for Parts.</p>
                  <p>2. To ſay fore-noons Leſsons in <hi>Propria
quae maribus, quae genus,</hi> and <hi>As in praeſenti,</hi>
which they repeated <hi>momoriter,</hi> conſtrued
and parſed.</p>
                  <p>3. To ſay an after-noons Leſson in <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae
Pueriles,</hi> which they repeated by
heart, and conſtrued and parſed.</p>
                  <p>4. They repeated their tasks every Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<hi>memoriter,</hi> and parſed their Sentences
out of the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>3. The third form was enjoyned firſt to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61977:187"/>
repeat two parts together every morning, one
out of the Accidents, and the other out of
that forementioned part of the Grammar,
and together with their parts, each one was
made to form one perſon of a verb Active in
any of the four Conjugations.</p>
                  <p>2. Their fore-noons Leſsons were in
<hi>Syntaxis,</hi> which they uſed to ſay <hi>memoriter,</hi>
then to conſtrue it, and parſe onely the words
which contain the force of the Rule.</p>
                  <p>3. Their fore-noons Leſsons were two
dayes in <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> and other two dayes

perſed, and ſaid <hi>Cato memoriter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Theſe Leſsons they tranſlated into
Engliſh, and repeated all on Fridayes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing
out of their Tranſlations into Latine.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth forme having ended <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxis,</hi>

which they tranſlated into Engliſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
on Fridayes, as before.</p>

                  <p>3. Their after-noons Leſsons were 2 days

both which they tranſlated into Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>4. They learned to ſcan and prove ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in <hi>Flores Poetarum,</hi> and repeated their
weeks works on Fridayes, as before.</p>
                  <p>6. The ſixth forme continued their parts
in the <hi>Greek Grammar,</hi> and formed a verb

                  <p>2. They read the <hi>Greek Teſtament</hi> for
fore-noones Leſsons, beginning with Saint
<hi>Johns Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Their after-noones Leſsons were two

They conſtrued the <hi>Greek Teſtament</hi>
into Latine, and the reſt into Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>7. The ſeventh forme went on with the
<hi>Greek Grammar,</hi> forming at every part a
verb Paſſive, or Medium.</p>
                  <p>2. They had their fore-noones Leſsons
in <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> which they tranſlated into Latin.</p>
                  <p>3. Their after-noon leſsons were 2 dayes
in <hi>Horace,</hi> and 2 days in <hi>Seneca's Tragedies;</hi>
both which they tranſlated into Engliſh.</p>

                     </gap>nued their
parts in the <hi>Greek Grammar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. They ſaid fore-noones Leſsons in
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61977:188"/>
                     <hi>Heſiod;</hi> which they tranſlated into Latine,
and afternoones Leſsons in <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in <hi>Perſius,</hi> which they tranſlated
into Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>9. The ninth and higheſt forme ſaid
morning parts in the <hi>Hebrew Grammar,</hi>
forenoons Leſsons in <hi>Homer,</hi> and afternoons
Leſsons in ſome <hi>Comical Authour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus when I came to <hi>Rotherham,</hi> I found
two or three ſorts of boyes in the Accidents,
and nine or ten ſeveral formes, whereof
ſome had but two or three Scholars in it;
and one of theſe formes alſo was not very
far from that which was below it. So that I
being to teach all my ſelf alone, was neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to reduce them to a leſser number, and
to provide ſuch helps for the weaker boyes,
as might enable them to go on with the
ſtronger. Beſides, obſerving how barren the
Scholars were of proper words and good
phraſes, with which their preſent Authours
did not ſufficiently furniſh them for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or writing Latine, I was enforced to
make uſe of ſuch books amongſt the reſt, as
were purpoſely made for that end, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at laſt brought the whole Schoole into
a good method and order, ſo as the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
learned with profit, and I taught them
with much eaſe and delight; I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to write over what I had done, that
I might leave it as a pattern for him that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61977:188"/>
ſucceeded me; and this was the ground-work
of my Diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>The manner of giving Lectures before I
came was,</p>
                  <p>1. For the two higheſt boyes in the
eighth forme, to give Lectures to all the
lower formes, each his week by turnes.</p>
                  <p>2. The higheſt Scholar in the Schoole,
gave Lectures to the ſecond form.</p>
                  <p>3. Thoſe in the higheſt form were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
left to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The manner of the Maſters hearing Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
was this;</p>
                  <p>1. The higheſt boy in the form at their
coming to ſay, conſtrued his Leſson two or
three times over, till he was perfect in it,
that his fellowes might all learn by him, to
conſtrue as well as he; then every one
conſtrued according to the order in
which he ſtood.</p>
                  <p>2. They parſed their Leſsons in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that they had conſtrued it in.</p>
                  <p>3. They tranſlated every day after the
Leſson, and ſhewed it altogether fair writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on Fridayes.</p>
                  <p>Their Exerciſes were theſe;</p>
                  <p>1. The four loweſt formes tranſlated at
vacant times, out of ſome Engliſh book.</p>
                  <p>2. The higher formes, having a ſubject
given them every Saturday, made Themes &amp;
Verſes upon it, againſt that day ſeven night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:61977:189"/>
The manner of collecting phraſes was
that every Friday in the afternoon, the boyes
in the higheſt form collected phraſes for the
loweſt formes, out of their ſeverall Authours,
which they writ, and commited to memory
againſt Saturday morning.</p>
                  <p>The ſet times for Diſputations, were
Fridayes, and Saturdayes at noon, and the
manner thus; one boy anſwered his day by
courſe, and all his fellowes poſed him out of
any Authour, which he had read before.</p>
                  <p>A part of Thurſday in the afternoon, was
ſpent in getting <hi>the Church Catechiſme,</hi> and
the <hi>ſix principles of Chriſtianity</hi> made by <hi>Mr.
Perkins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finding this method (which is uſed alſo
in moſt Grammar Schooles) to concurre
in the main grounds with that which I had
been taught at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> but not to be ſo
plain and eaſie, as that was to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of meaner capacities: I began to
ſeek (not ſo much to alter any thing, as)
to ſupply what I ſaw defective in it; having
theſe and ſuch like conſiderations often in
my mind,</p>
                  <p>1. Though every man liketh his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
beſt, yet none ought ſo far to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
of his own, as not to ſearch after a
better for the profiting of his Scholars.</p>
                  <p>2. Though one conſtant method muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
be obſerved, yet triall may be made
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61977:189"/>
of another at fit times, ſo it be done without
any diſtraction to the Maſter, or hinderance
to his Scholars.</p>
                  <p>3. A new courſe of teaching muſt not be
brought in ſuddenly upon Scholars, that
have been long trained in a worſe, but by
degrees.</p>
                  <p>4. Some modern Schoole-maſters, ſeem to
have gained a far more eaſie, and nearer way
of teaching, then many of the more ancient
ſeemed to have.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Mr. Brinſley</hi> ſeemeth to have made a
Diſcovery of a more perfect method, then
was in his time uſed, or is yet generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<hi>Mr. Farnaby, Mr. John Clerke</hi> and
ſome others, have facilitated the way fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but <hi>Mr. John Comenius</hi> hath lately
contrived a ſhorter courſe of teaching, which
many of late endeavour to follow; and
others have more contemplatively written
what they have thought of learning the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
tongue in the eaſieſt manner.</p>
                  <p>6. That for me it would not be amiſſe, by
imitating theſe and others, of whoſe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and dexterity in teaching I had got
ſome little experience, and obſerving the
ſeverall tempers and capacities of thoſe I
taught, to endeavour to finde out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
ſuch helps, as might make the moſt
generally received method of teaching by
Grammar, Authours, and Exerciſes, more
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61977:190"/>
briefe in it ſelf, and more eaſie and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Teacher and Scholar. And for
what I have done in this kinde theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were eſpeciall inducements. That,</p>
                  <p>1. It is not only poſſible, but neceſſary to
make children underſtand their tasks, from
their very firſt entrance into learning; ſeeing
they muſt every one bear his own burden,
and not rely upon their fellowes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in what they doe.</p>
                  <p>2. It is poſſible and meet for every teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſo to ground his Scholars, as that change
of Maſters may not much hinder their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in learning.</p>
                  <p>3. Things moſt familiar and obvious to
the ſenſes are firſt to be learned, and ſuch as
may be an eaſie ſtep towards thoſe which
are next to be attained.</p>
                  <p>4. The moſt vocabula's, and phraſes of
ordinary diſcourſe, may and ought to be
taught together with the Latine Grammar,
and the loweſt ſort of Schoole-Authours.</p>
                  <p>5. Boyes ought to know the meaning,
and how to make uſe of each Rule, as they
learne, yet ſo as not they be forced upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of it.</p>
                  <p>6. The moſt uſeful books ought to be
read, and may be taught after one manner
in every Grammar-Schoole.</p>
                  <p>7. Children muſt be furniſhed with ſtore
of matter, and able to write a good ſtyle,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61977:190"/>
and ſhewed how to imitate their Authours,
for making Exerciſes, before they be put to
uſe their own invention.</p>
                  <p>8. It is tyranny in the Maſter to beat a
Scholar for not doing that which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not how to goe about; ſo that he muſt
firſt know him to be well able, and then he
may more juſtly puniſh his neglect.</p>
                  <p>9. Many young Schoole-maſters are
more puſled about frameing to themſelves
a good method, then toyled in the exerciſe
of teaching Schoole.</p>
                  <p>10. No man ever had ſuch an acute and
direct method, but another able Scholar
might obſerve and follow it.</p>
                  <p>11. Many Maſters that are excellent in
perfecting Scholars, have not the patience
to ground them, and many that have the
skill to ground a Scholar well in his Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are not of ability to bring him on to
perfection in Grammatical Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>12. In many Schooles, one Maſter alone
beareth the whole burden of teaching, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any help of an Uſher.</p>
                  <p>13. Every one that teacheth a Grammar
Schoole, is not able to make a right choyce,
nor knoweth he the true uſe of our beſt claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Authours.</p>
                  <p>14. It is a prime part of a Schoole-maſter,
to inſtruct his Scholars well in
the principles of Chriſtian Religion, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61977:191"/>
to make them acquainted with the holy
Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>15. It is an utter undoing to many Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
to be ſent ungrounded to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities;
and Parents are generally unwilling
to have their children tarry long at the
Schoole, and therefore it is good for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to make uſe of the ſhorteſt and ſureſt
way of teaching.</p>
                  <p>16. It is very neceſsary, and hath been
ever wiſhed, that ſome of our moſt famous,
and beſt Schoole-maſters, would for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of others ſet themſelves on work, to
finde out, and publiſh the exacteſt method
of teaching, which might be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
till a better were knowne; for
by that meanes they ſhould doe much
good to the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and ſomewhat herein advantage
themſelves, ſeeing every Parent will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have his ſon taught, by one whom
he knoweth to be conſtantly diligent in a
good way of teaching.</p>
                  <p>And the hopes that I conceived hereby
to provoke my betters, hath eſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
me (at laſt) to yield to my friends
importunity, in ſetting down this <hi>Method of
Teaching,</hi> and writing down alſo this for me
of <hi>Schoole-Government,</hi> which I heartily
commend to Gods heavenly bleſſing, and
the candid cenſure of the more judicious,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61977:191"/>
hoping that as I intend chiefly the generall
good, ſo none will requite me with malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
obtrectation, which if any ſhall doe, I
charitably pray for them before hand, that
God would for Chriſts ſake forgive them,
and grant that I may not <hi>heed what they
write or ſay concerning me, or my labours, ſo as
to be diſcouraged in my honeſt endeavours for
the publick ſervice.</hi>
