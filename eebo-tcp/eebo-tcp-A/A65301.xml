            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Psal. 112. v. 4.</bibl>
               <q>Unto the Upright there ariseth Light in the Darkness.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Scripture (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> says) is a <hi>Spiritual Paradise.</hi> The Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> is placed in the <hi>midst</hi> of this <hi>Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalms</hi> are not only for <hi>Delight,</hi> but for <hi>Use:</hi> like those <hi>Trees of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which were both for <hi>Food,</hi> and for <hi>Medicine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> are commensurate and exactly fitted to every Christians condition; If his <hi>Affections</hi> are <hi>frozen,</hi> here he may fetch <hi>Fire;</hi> if his <hi>Grace</hi> be <hi>weak,</hi> here he may fetch <hi>Arniour;</hi> If his <hi>Spirits</hi> are ready to <hi>faint,</hi> here he may fetch <hi>Cordials</hi> for his <hi>Soul:</hi> Amongst other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Consolations,</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> is not the least,—</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106549:3"/>
Unto the Upright there ariseth Light in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>
            <p>Which words are calculated for the <hi>Comfort</hi> of the <hi>Godly,</hi> in all Ages and Centuries of the Church.</p>
            <p>This Text is like <hi>Israel's Pillar of Fire</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness:</hi> or, like the <hi>Mariners Lanthorn,</hi> that gives <hi>Light</hi> in a <hi>Dark Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto the Upright there ariseth Light in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me Explain the Words e're I come to the <hi>Proposition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To the Upright.]</hi> Who are here meant by the <hi>Upright?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for <hi>Upright,</hi> signifies <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heart.</hi> The <hi>Upright Man</hi> is without <hi>Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> or <hi>Fraud; In whose Spirit there is no Guile,</hi> Psal. 32. 2. He that is <hi>Upright,</hi> his <hi>Heart</hi> and his <hi>Tongue</hi> go together, as a well-made <hi>Dial,</hi> goes exactly by the <hi>Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words following in the Text, may serve for a short <hi>Paraphrase</hi> to shew us, who this <hi>Upright Man</hi> is, the Text sayes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Upright Man</hi> is <hi>Gracious:</hi> That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his <hi>Holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is <hi>Full of Compassion:</hi> That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his <hi>Charitableness.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He is <hi>Righteous:</hi> That implies his <hi>Justness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is <hi>Gracious,</hi> therefore he <hi>fears God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is <hi>Full of Compassion,</hi> therefore he <hi>feeds the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is <hi>Righteous,</hi> therefore he <hi>does to others as he would have them do to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Upright Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short; He is one that does act from a right <hi>Principle,</hi> and that is <hi>Faith:</hi> By a right <hi>Rule,</hi> and that is <hi>Scripture:</hi> To a right <hi>End,</hi> and that is, <hi>God's glory.</hi> Here's a man <hi>downright Upright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second thing in the Text is, There ariseth <hi>[Light]</hi> to the Upright. What's meant by <hi>Light</hi> here?</p>
            <p>By <hi>Light</hi> metaphorically is meant <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> or <hi>Joy.</hi> That's here meant by <hi>Light.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106549:4"/>
Esther 8. 16. <hi>The Jews had</hi> Light, <hi>and</hi> Gladness, <hi>and</hi> Joy. <hi>Light</hi> when it springs in, doth much <hi>revive. Light is sweet. Joy</hi> is to the <hi>Heart,</hi> as <hi>Light</hi> is to the <hi>Eye, Exhilarating</hi> and <hi>Refreshing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That's the second Word: There ariseth <hi>[Light]</hi> that is, <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There ariseth Light in <hi>[Darkness]</hi> What's meant here by <hi>Darkness?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Darkness</hi> is meant <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Sorrow, Res adversae.</hi> In <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>They shall look unto the Earth, and behold</hi> Trouble, <hi>and</hi> Darkness. By <hi>Darkness</hi> is meant <hi>Trouble.

            <p>So much for the <hi>Explaining</hi> of the Words.</p>
            <q>To the Upright ariseth Light in the Darkness.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Observation</hi> that results from the Words is this; (Pray observe it:)</p>

1. There is an <hi>Outward Light</hi> shines; that is, God does oftentimes cause a <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Prosperity</hi> to arise upon his People: that's a <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>Darkness.</hi> When God by his Providence alters the Face of things, and causes <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> in the Tabernacles of the Righteous, here's <hi>Light</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in <hi>Darkness.</hi> In Psal. 29. 3. <hi>When his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle shined upon my Head.—</hi>What was this <hi>Candle?</hi> It was nothing else but the <hi>Candle</hi> of <hi>Prosperity</hi> that shined upon him. And in Psal. 132. 17. <hi>I have ordained a Lamp for mine Anointed:</hi> That is, <hi>Outward Blessings, Gracious Prosperity,</hi> shall shine as a <hi>Lamp</hi> upon <hi>David's</hi> Successor. <hi>I have ordained a Lamp for mine Anointed;</hi> I will give <hi>outward Glory</hi> in the Kingdom; Here's an outward Light. The Lord can on a sudden alter the Scene of Providence, and turn <hi>the shadow of Death, into the Light of the Morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God causes an <hi>Inward Light</hi> to arise upon the Upright, when they are in the dark,—</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:106549:7"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Light of <hi>Grace,</hi> he makes that shine. In the midst of <hi>Darkness,</hi> let the <hi>Darkness</hi> be what it will, a dram of <hi>Faith</hi> in the Soul, is a spark of <hi>Light.</hi> When the Tree has no <hi>Leaves</hi> nor <hi>Blossoms</hi> to be seen, but seems dead in <hi>Autumn,</hi> yet there may be <hi>sap</hi> in the <hi>Root</hi> of the Vine: When our <hi>Outward Comforts</hi> are as it were <hi>dead,</hi> there may be a <hi>Seed of Grace</hi> preserved in the <hi>Heart:</hi> and this <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>darkest</hi> condition, it is the dawning of <hi>Light</hi> in the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God causes a <hi>Light</hi> of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> to arise upon his Saints. And truly, this <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Joy,</hi> it is somewhat of the glimmering of the Light of <hi>Heaven,</hi> this is some glimpse of the Light of <hi>Paradise.</hi> In Isa. 12. 1.<hi>—Thine Anger is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away, and thou comfortedst me.</hi> The Light of <hi>Divine Joy</hi> in the Soul, it is <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing:</hi> it makes all <hi>dark Shadows flee away. Spiritual Joy,</hi> causes a <hi>Jubilation,</hi> and does as far exceed all <hi>earthly Comforts,</hi> as <hi>Heaven</hi> does <hi>Earth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106549:7"/>
Thus you see, that in <hi>Midnight,</hi> in the <hi>darkest Cloud</hi> of Providence, God causes some <hi>Light</hi> or other to arise upon the <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Brethren, 'tis <hi>only God</hi> can make it <hi>lightsome</hi> in a <hi>dark troubled</hi> Soul As when the Sun is set, none can make it rise again but God: So, (My Beloved,) when 'tis <hi>Sun-set</hi> in the Soul, and the Dew of Tears fall from the Eye, none can make <hi>Day-light</hi> in the Soul but only God. <hi>Ministers</hi> they may <hi>Preach</hi> Comfort to us, but God only can make us <hi>feel</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; <hi>Ministers</hi> they may bring a Cordial to us, and set it by us, but none but God can pour this Cordial into the <hi>Heart;</hi> in Psal. 4. 7. <hi>Thou hast put Gladness in my Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I come to the Application, here's a Question arises,—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why does God make Light to arise to his People, in an hour of Darkness?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer: for three Reasons,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God may hereby fulfil his Promise:</hi> He <note place="margin">Reasons of the Point.</note> has <hi>said it,</hi> that <hi>he will enlighten his People</hi> In
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106549:8"/>
Isa. 42. 16. <hi>I will make</hi> Darkness Light <hi>before them.</hi> God's <hi>Honour</hi> lies upon it, to make good his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and to cause <hi>Light</hi> to arise to his People in <hi>Obscurity.</hi> The Lord's <hi>Promise,</hi> it is his <hi>Bond.</hi> When one has given <hi>Bond</hi> to another, he cannot go back. Though sometimes God's Promise may be <hi>long in Travail,</hi> yet at last it <hi>brings forth</hi> Deliverance.</p>
               <p>Two things in God never fail,—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> His <hi>Compassions</hi> fail not, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>Faithfulness</hi> fails not, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 33. God may sometimes <hi>delay</hi> a Promise, but he will not <hi>deny</hi> his Promise: God may sometimes <hi>change</hi> his <hi>Promise,</hi> turn a <hi>Temporal</hi> Promise into a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and so pay us in a <hi>better Coin,</hi> but will never <hi>break</hi> his Promise. He has <hi>said</hi> he will cause a <hi>Light</hi> to go before his People in all their <hi>Darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God may cause <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> to arise to his People, because <hi>they help to enlighten others.</hi> When o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christians are in the <hi>dark</hi> of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> they enlighten them with <hi>Knowledg;</hi> when they are in the <hi>dark</hi> of <hi>Affliction,</hi> ready to <hi>perish,</hi> they <hi>feed</hi> them, and they <hi>relieve</hi> them, and their Almes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106549:8"/>
minister <hi>Light of Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> to the Poor; when they are in <hi>Desertion,</hi> why God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they speak a word of <hi>Comfort</hi> to their Hearts: They <hi>enlighten</hi> those that sit in <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and therefore surely God will not let those want <hi>Light,</hi> who help to <hi>enlighten others;</hi> if they should come to be <hi>benighted</hi> with <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> why God will be sure to spring in with some <hi>Light</hi> to them, who have given <hi>Light to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God</hi> will cause <hi>Light</hi> to arise in <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to his People, either he will <hi>support them in Trouble,</hi> or <hi>deliver them out of Trouble,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God sees that <hi>they have great need of some dawnings of Light,</hi> they <hi>need some Morning-Star</hi> now to appear; they would <hi>faint away,</hi> they would be <hi>discouraged in serving God,</hi> if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did not turn the <hi>Shadow of Death</hi> into the <hi>Light of the Morning.</hi> Should the sick Patient always have <hi>purging Physick</hi> given him, why surely if he had no <hi>Cordials</hi> he would soon <hi>faint away. God knows our frame,</hi> he sees our <hi>Spirits would fail before him,</hi> if he did always let a dark <hi>Cloud</hi> dwell upon us; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106549:9"/>
therefore, <hi>in Judgment he remembers Mercy,</hi> and causes the <hi>Day-Star</hi> of Comfort and Joy to spring up in a Gracious Soul. God will not fuffer it always to be <hi>dark</hi> in the Hearts of his People, lest they should touch upon the Rock of <hi>Despair.</hi> The <hi>Musician,</hi> he will not stretch the Strings of his <hi>Viol</hi> too hard, left they should chance to break.</p>
               <p>Thus you see why the wise God sees it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to cause <hi>Light</hi> to arise unto his People, in the midst of all their <hi>Clouds</hi> of <hi>Darkness.</hi>

                  <p>What's this <hi>Red Wine</hi> in the <hi>Cup?</hi> 'Tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the <hi>Fiery Wrath of God:</hi> that's the <hi>Red Wine;</hi> Wine <hi>burnt</hi> with his Wrath. And (the Text saies) this Cup is <hi>full of mixture,</hi> it's a <hi>mixed Cup</hi> the sinner must drink. What's the <hi>mixed Cup?</hi> The <hi>Worm of Conscience,</hi> and the <hi>Fire of Hell:</hi> here's a <hi>mixed cup;</hi> and the wicked shall be <hi>ever</hi> drinking of this Cup: God will never say, <hi>Transeat—Let this Cup pass away from</hi> the <hi>Damned:</hi> No, they must be <hi>ever</hi> drinking the dregs of this Cup of Wrath.</p>
                  <p>Methinks this Scripture should be a <hi>Cooling Card</hi> unto all wicked men, and damp all their <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Jollity: Doomsday Darkness</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them. It was sad news brought to <hi>Saul</hi> (and no wonder when the <hi>Devil</hi> brought

(saies the Angel to <hi>Lot,</hi> Haste thee to <hi>Zoar) escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. q. d.</hi> Thou holdest my hand, I cannot strike till thou art gone. The Saints of God, though others look upon them with a contemptible eye, they are the Safety of the Land, God will do much for their sakes. The <hi>Upright,</hi> they are <hi>the Excellent of the Earth,</hi> Psal. 16. 3. Others are but the <hi>Lumber,</hi> God knows bad <hi>Lumber:</hi> These are the <hi>Jewels.</hi> Mal. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>The Saints of God, they are the <hi>Chariots and Horsmen of Israel:</hi> They are the very <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Cream</hi> of the Creation; they are the <hi>Glory</hi> of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23.

               <p n="2">2. Another Spark of <hi>Light</hi> arising in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Darkness,</hi> is this, That yet God is pleased wonderfully to keep up in his People a Spirit of Prayer; They cry mightily: Certainly God will not say to us, <hi>Seek ye me i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spartans Walls</hi> were their <hi>Spears.</hi> The 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106549:15"/>
Wall and Bullwark of a Land is Devout Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Whole Vollies of Sighs and Groans are every day sent up to Heaven for Mercy; here's a Spark of <hi>Light</hi> in our <hi>Darkness:</hi> God hears these Sighs.</p>
               <p>Pray observe, when the Lord intends to pour out the Vial of his Indignation, and to bring wrath upon a People, he presently stops all the sluces of Prayer, no more Prayer to be made. In <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>Pray not for this People.</hi> God has not said so yet concerning <hi>England.</hi> Prayer is a powerful Orator for Mercy, and may cause Light to spring up yet. The Key of Prayer, oyled with Tears, and turn'd with the Hand of Faith, unlocks God's Bowels. Prayer, when 'tis importunate, it staves off Wrath from a Land. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10. Saies God to <hi>Moses, Let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot against them.</hi> Why, what did <hi>Moses</hi> do? He only Prayed. <hi>Fervent Prayer it overcomes the Omnipotent,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> saies. Prayer it finds God <hi>Free,</hi> but it leaves him <hi>Bound. Haec Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina Mundi fructuat Solum.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prayer ties God's Hands: It staves off Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This (my Brethren) lets in some dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106549:15"/>
of <hi>Light</hi> to this <hi>Land</hi> this day, in the mid'st of all our <hi>Clouds of Obscurity:</hi> Prayer is made for the Church. This gives us some ground to hope, that God will not wholly leave us.</p>
               <p>Especially when we consider, Christ is our Advocate; He prays over our Prayers again, sprinkles them with his Blood, and perfumes them with his blessed Odours: and so they go up to Heaven as sweet Incense. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 4. <hi>The smoke of the Incense which came with the Prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God, out of the Angels hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And lastly, Another spark of <hi>Light</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising in our <hi>Dark</hi> Hemisphere, it is this, God's Compassions, his Bowel-Mercies. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it is God's Darling Attribute, that he loves most of all to magnifie: <hi>Mercy pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him,</hi> Micah 7. 18. Though <hi>We</hi> don't please God, yet <hi>Mercy</hi> pleases him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Justice</hi> is God's <hi>strange Work,</hi> Isa. 28. 21. He is not so much used to that: But <hi>Mercy</hi> it is his <hi>proper Work,</hi> it flows <hi>naturally</hi> from him, as the Honey from the Bee, or as the Myrrhe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106549:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drops from the Myrrhe-tree. While God so delights in this Darling Attribute of Mercy, why should we despair? Why may not Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy give the casting Voice for this Nation? In <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In his Love and in his Pity he Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</hi> O! <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> will do great things.<hi>—In his Love and in his Pity he Redeemed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God's Mercy 'tis not only <hi>Free,</hi> sending out Pardons where it pleases; but here's the Comfort, God's Mercy can as well <hi>Heal</hi> as it can <hi>Save:</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Healing</hi> Mercy. In <hi>Hosea</hi> 14. 4. <hi>I will heal their Backslidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray observe: Mercy, what can't it do? it can <hi>reclaim</hi> the <hi>Stubborn:</hi> it can <hi>soften</hi> the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent:</hi> it can <hi>bring back</hi> those that are <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray</hi> from God. God's Mercy, it can as well give <hi>Repentance</hi> to a Nation as <hi>Deliverance;</hi> Mercy can <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>Sins</hi> of the Nation, and yet <hi>save</hi> the Nation. 'Tis a <hi>Healing</hi> Mercy:<hi>—I will heal their Backslidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, these are then some Dawnings, some sparks of <hi>Light,</hi> that God causes to arise in the midst of all our <hi>Darkness.</hi>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here's a Question, (and so I hasten to an end.) <hi>You will say unto me, But things they still look very</hi> bad <hi>and</hi> dark, <hi>and we would have more</hi> Light; <hi>now what must we do, how must we carry our selves, till God makes</hi> Light <hi>to arise to us in our</hi> Darkness? <hi>till Mercy comes riding to</hi> England <hi>in the Chariot of Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer in these two or three things:—</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this time of our <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Cloudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the first thing we do, let us go into our Chambers. In Isa. 26. 20. <hi>Come, my People, enter thou into thy Chambers, and shut thy doors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee:</hi> hide thy self.</p>
               <p>There are two <hi>Chambers</hi> that we must now go into:—</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106549:17"/>
                  <item>1. The Chambers of our <hi>Hearts.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The Chambers of the <hi>Promises.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let us go in this time of <hi>Darkness</hi> into the <hi>Chambers</hi> of our <hi>Hearts,</hi> by serious <hi>Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Self-examination.</hi> Let us in the first place search our Evidences for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, cast up our Accounts, see how the case stands between God and our Souls. Let's bring our Graces to the Touch-Stone: What <hi>Faith</hi> have we? are we hid by <hi>Faith</hi> in the bleeding Wounds of Christ? What <hi>Love</hi> to God have we? does Conscience witness that we not only <hi>serve</hi> him, but <hi>love</hi> him? <hi>Our Heart and Flesh cry out for the Living God?</hi> Are we carried every day up to Heaven in a fiery Chariot of <hi>Love?</hi> Is it thus with us? O let us enter into these Chambers of our <hi>Hearts,</hi> set our House in order, our <hi>Souls:</hi> that's our great work now. My Beloved, when things are dark <hi>without,</hi> we had need have all clear <hi>within,</hi> to have <hi>Conscience</hi> smile.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106549:17"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us go into the <hi>Chambers</hi> of God's <hi>Promises,</hi> and there let's a while hide our selves, during this black <hi>Cloud</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. O the <hi>sweet Promises</hi> of God, where our Souls may take Sanctuary! God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Comfort</hi> to all his <hi>Mourners, Matth.</hi> 5. 4. God has promised that he will <hi>strengthen</hi> the <hi>infirm;</hi> Isa 40. 29. <hi>to them that have no might, he increases strength.</hi> God has promised a <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> to the <hi>Conqueror, Rev.</hi> 2. 10. He has given it under Hand and Seal, <hi>he will never leave us, nor forsake us.</hi> Heb. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>O my Brethren, here's our Wisdom: let us now by Faith go and hide our selves, in the <hi>Chambers</hi> of these Divine <hi>Promises.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that's the first thing we must do in this <hi>Dark Hour: Go into our Chambers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Having done this, if you ask me yet further, what we must do in this time of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, till God makes Light spring up to us? I answer: having got into our <hi>Chambers,</hi> let us
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106549:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Commit our selves and our Case to God,</hi> that he would safe-guard and keep us. And this I ground upon that Scripture, in Psal. 37. 5. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord; he will bring it to pass.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <hi>Roll</hi> thy way upon the Lord. This is now our work: Even as the <hi>Client</hi> commits himself and his Cause to his <hi>Counsel</hi> that he imploys, to plead for him: or as the <hi>Orphan</hi> commits himself unto the Care and Tutilage of his <hi>Guardian;</hi> so should we commit our selves to God, and devolve all our cares upon him.<hi>—Commit thy way unto the Lord.</hi> Let us do our Duty, and trust God with our Safety. Brethren, it is our work to <hi>cast Care:</hi> it is God's work to <hi>take Care.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In this time of <hi>Darkness,</hi> having got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>Chambers,</hi> and <hi>committed</hi> our selves unto God; let us now patiently <hi>wait God's time,</hi> till he shall make a <hi>Light</hi> to arise in our <hi>Horizon:</hi> wait on God, till he turns our <hi>Darkness</hi> into the <hi>Light of the Morning.</hi> God can on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with a word of his Mouth, scatter and disperse the blackest Clouds that do appear; God can <hi>create Light.</hi> God can strike a <hi>streight</hi>

                  <hi>stroke</hi> with a <hi>crooked Instrument:</hi> He can bring <hi>Good</hi> out of <hi>Evil.</hi> God can deliver his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by means <hi>unthought of:</hi> nay, he can <hi>deliver</hi> them that very way that they think he will <hi>destroy</hi> them in. Who would ever have thought that God should have made a <hi>Caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> way</hi> for his People to have marched through on, in the midst of the <hi>Sea?</hi> that God should have made Heaven a <hi>Grainary,</hi> to drop down <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> for his People to feed on? O <hi>wait</hi> till <hi>Light</hi> spring up. God he can make use of the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to do <hi>his Work:</hi> he can play <hi>his Game</hi> by his <hi>Enemies hand.</hi> In short: God is able to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> the Mountains that lie in our way, or else (if he please) he can <hi>leap over</hi> the Mountains: In Cant. 2. 8. <hi>He cometh leaping upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> Therefore, my Brethren, till <hi>Light</hi> spring up, let us <hi>wait with Patience: Light will arise unto the Upright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Brethren, I will say but this: The Mercies we pray for, and are in expectation of, they are worth waiting for. To see the <hi>Golden Fleet</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> come home laden with large and rich returns of Mercy: to see the

                  <hi>Lilly</hi> and the <hi>Rose</hi> united, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> To see <hi>Popery abandoned,</hi> and not one Stone left upon another: To see <hi>Prophaneness discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced</hi> and <hi>disgraced:</hi> to see the <hi>Beauty of Holiness shine forth in our Hemisphere:</hi> To see <hi>Jesus Christ ride in Triumph in the Chariot of his Gospel:</hi> To see the <hi>Righteous</hi> had in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Renown,</hi> and be <hi>like the Wings of a Dove covered with Silver;</hi> Surely these are Mercies so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that they are well <hi>worth waiting for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, let not Patience be out of breath. Having got into your <hi>Chambers,</hi> and <hi>committed your Cause</hi> to God, now get into a <hi>waiting</hi> posture: <hi>wait</hi> till some <hi>Light</hi> spring up to God's Church. I will shut up all with one Scripture, (which may encourage hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble waiting:) In Isa. 30. 18. <hi>The Lord is a God of Judgment; Blessed are all they that wait for him.</hi>
