         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to do that which is <hi>lawful, just, right</hi> in the sight of the <hi>Pure Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God,</hi> in whose presence you are all naked and bare, to whom
you must all <hi>give</hi> up your <hi>accompts,</hi> and the time is <hi>near</hi> at <hi>hand;</hi>
for behold Heaven and Earth is the <hi>Lord God</hi> Almighty <hi>calling</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to <hi>witness</hi> against <hi>you,</hi> and all the blood of his Holy <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
Saints and Servants that hath been shed from the beginning
of the world, until this very <hi>day,</hi> ever since the blood of Righteous
<hi>Abel,</hi> until the blood of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> with <hi>Iames Parniel, Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
Stevenson, William Robinson, Mary Dyer,</hi> (one of which was
most <hi>barbarously</hi> imprisoned until <hi>death</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the other
three were <hi>hanged</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> the stain of whose innocent
<hi>blood</hi> will never be wiped <hi>away,</hi> except you deeply <hi>repent</hi> and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
return to the Lord who is able to <hi>forgive</hi> the chiefest of <hi>sinners</hi>)
the which innocent Lambs dyed for the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
and for no other thing: And farthermore, let all <hi>Goals</hi> and <hi>Prisons</hi>
witness against you for ever; how many of the <hi>Righteous Servants</hi>
of the Lord have bin <hi>imprisoned</hi> until <hi>death</hi> in them, whose innocent
<hi>blood</hi> cries very loud to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth for
<hi>vengeance</hi> against you all: And do you not think the weight of all
the <hi>innocent blood</hi> will not be too <hi>heavy</hi> for you to bear? yes verily,
it will be too <hi>heavy</hi> for you all, and shall for evermore lie as a <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensom</hi>
stone upon your <hi>heads,</hi> until it hath <hi>pressed</hi> &amp; weighed you
down into the nethermost <hi>Pit</hi> of eternal <hi>destruction,</hi> which is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33456:3"/>
               <hi>burning fiery flaming Lake</hi> prepared for the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Angels,</hi>
even <hi>Tophet,</hi> which was <hi>prepared</hi> of old; yea verily, it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the <hi>King</hi> (as saith the Scriptures, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 33.) and it is
deep and very large, the <hi>burning</hi> thereof is <hi>fire</hi> and much wood,
and the <hi>breath</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> like a <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Brimstone</hi> doth set it on
<hi>fire.</hi> Mark well, and <hi>behold</hi> where the portion of all <hi>wicked Kings</hi>
and <hi>Rulers</hi> is (and for ever shall be) that <hi>leave</hi> this world without
<hi>repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>hear,</hi> O hear and give ear ye foolish <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
all, yea I say, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what
the Spirit saith,</hi> I that am the <hi>Lords Faithful Servant and True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
to you all, whose face he hath set as a <hi>flint</hi> against you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteousness;</hi> hath also made my Life strong
as a walled <hi>City,</hi> even double walled, like walls of <hi>steel,</hi> with <hi>gates</hi>
of <hi>brass,</hi> hath <hi>commanded me</hi> to <hi>cry</hi> aloud; yea verily, as loud as
ever I can call and cry, to <hi>set before</hi> you your <hi>sins</hi> and great <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi>
which are all come in remembrance before God; yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
the <hi>stinking savour</hi> of them hath reached <hi>Heaven,</hi> and are so
<hi>loathsom</hi> in the nostrils of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he hath prepared in his
<hi>wrathful indignation,</hi> a way to <hi>destroy</hi> you all, and there shall be no
way found for you to <hi>escape</hi> the stroak of his heavy hand, but by
<hi>turning</hi> every <hi>man</hi> of you from the <hi>evil</hi> of his <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>doings,</hi> and
so live to do that which is <hi>equal,</hi> lawful, just and right in the <hi>sight</hi>
of the pure <hi>God,</hi> and with <hi>speed</hi> put a full <hi>stop</hi> to all the <hi>wickedness</hi>
that is in your hearts and hands, to do <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<hi>People</hi> and Children that fear him, and tremble at his Word,
and dare not break the least of his Commandments; or else this
know assuredly, <hi>you</hi> shall be <hi>dashed</hi> and <hi>scattered</hi> all to pieces, and
your names shall be <hi>rooted</hi> out, both root and branch for <hi>evermore,</hi>
(in the Name of the <hi>Lord</hi> I have spoken it, who have stayed so long
that I can stay no longer, and have borne so long that I can bear
no longer, my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> having <hi>charged</hi> all your <hi>blood</hi> upon
me, except I <hi>warn</hi> you betimes) and now do you think you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>withstand</hi> God, or are you <hi>able</hi> to joyn <hi>battel</hi> with <hi>him,</hi> and
over throw him; well if you judge you are of <hi>ability</hi> thus to do, then
go on and gather your Armies together, <hi>prepare</hi> your <hi>Chariots,</hi> and
make ready your <hi>Horse-men,</hi> arm your selves as well as you may,
get <hi>ready</hi> as soon as you can, and <hi>come</hi> forth with all the <hi>strength</hi>
and might you <hi>have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet, <hi>wo,</hi> and alas for you, poor foolish <hi>vain men,</hi> ah, what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33456:4"/>
will all this avail you; why <hi>know</hi> this from <hi>God,</hi> that liveth for
ever and ever, all them things will be but in vain for you to put
confidence in; for strong and mighty is He, even the wonderful
Conqueror (<hi>Iehovah</hi> by name) who can subdue and overcome all
his Enemies, whensoever he pleaseth, who is the <hi>Mighty God,</hi>
the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Host,</hi> and God of <hi>Battels</hi> that you are going to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
withal, yea, he will be too strong for all his <hi>Enemies</hi> who
presume to <hi>fight</hi> against him; therefore leave off your work, <hi>vain</hi>
men, and cease striving any farther in your own wicked Wills and
vain Imaginations, against him who is too mighty for you, <hi>all,</hi>
and can, and will <hi>over-turn</hi> you, whensoever he pleaseth. Now
therefore consider it (O ye sons of men) yea, weigh it in the due
consideration of your minds, even the deep Cry of the guiltless
innocent Blood, that is all charged upon you, ever since the Blood
of righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> to this very day, who are found persecuting
the Innocent about Religion and Worship; and with speed repent
and turn every one of you, from the evil of your wayes (or else
reade your portions, as God hath before proclaimed it by me in his
own eternal Spirit) and <hi>think</hi> not to escape the <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Wrath</hi> and <hi>Vengeance</hi> of the <hi>Almighty God:</hi> for certainly it
will come upon you, except you speedily repent: for I have heard
the <hi>dreadful terrible</hi> Cry of all the guiltless innocent <hi>Blood</hi> of the
slain Martyrs, Prophets, Saints and Servants of the Most High
God, that have been slain for the Testimony of Jesus Christ, from
under the Altar, saying, <hi>How long, O Lord, righteous, holy, just,
and true, will it be, ere thou arise and revenge our Blood upon them that
dwell upon the face of the Earth?</hi> and there is a voice in secret hath
answered, Wait but a very little longer, until the rest of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
be gathered unto you (and it be all fulfilled) that must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
also for the Testimony of Jesus, and then shall it be fulfilled
and wholly accomplished: And will you not yet hear, O ye <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious</hi>
ones, who are like <hi>fat</hi> full-fed <hi>Horses,</hi> each one of you
<hi>naying</hi> after his neighbours <hi>wife,</hi> not having the <hi>Fear</hi> of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your <hi>eyes,</hi> who are drinking wine in <hi>bowls,</hi> and making mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
over God's <hi>Witness</hi> in you (that which you have slain and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified;)
and yet in this thing, I charge no man, or men, but this
<hi>I proclaim</hi> (and that from God, who searcheth all hearts, and trys
all reins, and shall be exalted over all his Enemies, <hi>Whoremongers</hi>
and <hi>Adulterers, Swearers, Lyars, Drunkards, Chamberers, Wantons,</hi>
and all manner of vain light persons, whatsoever, their guilty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33456:4"/>
Conscience needs no other accuser.) So thou that reads this, if
thou art guilty, thou wilt be accused in thine own heart, mind and
conscience, if thou art not seared as with a <hi>Fire-brand</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi>
and sealed down in the deep <hi>Pit</hi> of eternal <hi>destruction,</hi> where thou
shalt never see the light any more; and when thou art judged and
condemned within, then there is no man or men can be able to
save or justifie thee without. So this pure Light (wherein there is
Life to be found (that is able to bring all out of Death and the
Fall) that discovers all the dark deeds of iniquity, and rips up the
heart, and layes open all thy wickedness that ever thou hast done,
even that which lighteth every man that is come into the world, so
that none can be hidden or hide any thing from it: Unto this, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all are to be turned that desires to be saved, which is indeed
the way of Life and Salvation, and leads to know peace with God,
for their immortal Souls, which is, and will be, the desire of all
nations, people, kindreds, countries, tongues and languages, upon
the face of the whole Earth, one time or other, whether Kings,
Rulers or Governours, or whosoever else, the Light only is the
true Saviour, to all that want or seek after a Saviour, for their
poor Souls, even that which checks and reproves, and also convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the worst of Sinners, pricking you in your hearts after you
have dnoe wickedly: O do not kick against those pretious pricks,
but alwayes turn in your minds to its gentle reproofs, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same is he, that is come to be Salvation to the ends of the
Earth, to as many as lay hold of Him by a true and lively Faith,
without any wavering, and there is not any other Saviour: So
when any one amongst you, is pricked to the heart, by the <hi>Witness</hi>
of God in your own particulars, O then you are to take good heed
to that, which pricks you within, and not to turn away from it, but
alwayes wait upon God in it. And again, when you are checked,
then you are to take heed to that which checks you; and when you
are secretly reproved, <hi>within,</hi> you are not to be high minded, but
fear, and bow low down to that which doth reprove you, and of
that learn at all times how to deny your selves, and so take up the
Cross against your own selves, and wills, and thus forsake all the
vanities of this present evil world, or else you can never have any
part in Christ Jesus, or in the Kingdom of Heaven: and here is
the true and perfect way for you all, to hate the evil, and come out
from amongst it, and so to chuse that which is good, and do it
all times, even to every man, as you would all men should do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33456:5"/>
you; that so God may shew mercy unto you, and deal favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
with you.</p>
            <p>And here in the deep sence of this thing, you cannot but love
God above all things, and your neighbour as your own selves, and
the same measure of Grace being received in each Particular, even
as it is freely given of God (so that all may thereby be profited to
life Eternal) when obedience is yielded thereto; in singleness, and
uprightness of heart, will lead all men to love mercy, and do just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and walk humbly before the Lord all the dayes of their lives.
So here all men may come and deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,
and walk soberly and righteously before God, and so live Godly
in Christ Jesus, in this present evil world; so now when you are
sufficiently warned, I shall be clear of all your blood, and can leave
you to your own Master, and if you will not hear, but still forbear,
your blood be upon your own heads for evermore.</p>
            <p>All Glory, and Honour, and Power, and Dominion, with Majesty and
Everlasting Renown to the Noble, Worthy Honourable Name of our
Powerful Lord God; World without end, <hi>Amen.</hi> Halelujah.</p>
            <p>So then all <hi>Emperours, Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> with all other <hi>Rulers</hi>
whatsoever, upon the face of the whole earth, shall be bowed down,
and then God alone shall be exalted in the highest, and reign over
all, who only is Worthy, worthy, worthy; World without end.
Even so be it, saith the Spirit in</p>
