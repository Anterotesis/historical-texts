            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Once more unto our Nation, for to ſway</l>
               <l>His Golden Scepter, and us Rule each Day,</l>
               <l>In Peace and Love, as we all ought to be,</l>
               <l>Govern'd and Led by his Great Majeſty;</l>
               <l>And here our Hopes they do begin to be</l>
               <l>Renewed to us in Felicity,</l>
               <l>Expecting Trading, now he is come to Land</l>
               <l>To Rule and Govern with a wiſe Command,</l>
               <l>Great Man of God, whom God doth Call and Chuſe,</l>
               <l>On Earth his Great Lieutenants place to uſe,</l>
               <l>We Bleſs the time, wherein the threefold Crown,</l>
               <l>And Diadem with Peace and great Renown,</l>
               <l>In that ſo long foretold and ſtately Chear,</l>
               <l>Thou on thy Brave and Royal Brow didſt bear,</l>
               <l>As from that time thy Abſence bred us bain,</l>
               <l>Thy preſence now Reſtores us joys again,</l>
               <l>Thou wents away to <hi>England</hi>'s deep Diſpleaſure,</l>
               <l>But thy Return Brings Mirth beyond all meaſure:</l>
               <l>Now all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, come give the Praiſe,</l>
               <l>To God above, who to us him did raiſe,</l>
               <l>Who drove <hi>Rome</hi>'s ſwarming, Plotting Vermine clear,</l>
               <l>Out of our Land, all in a happy Year.</l>
               <l>Juſt as Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Crew with one accord,</l>
               <l>With Bloody Minds, they could nought elſe afford,</l>
               <l>Unto her Subjects, but the Fire and Sword.</l>
               <l>No leſs would theſe have done, had not he came,</l>
               <l>For which we bleſs Heroick <hi>Naſſan</hi>'s Name:</l>
               <l>Oh may that God, who does aſſiſt all Men,</l>
               <l>Direct me here with my unlearned Pen,</l>
               <l>To ſpeak of him and his moſt Nobler ways</l>
               <l>Great Monarch, here I'll iſſue forth his Praiſe,</l>
               <l>And nought but what was always his juſt due</l>
               <l>Conſidering what he did for us go through,</l>
               <l>So let him Rule in Honour and great Fame,</l>
               <l>Who with his Sword, unto our Reſcue came;</l>
               <l>Come now ye Nations, all prepare to Ring</l>
               <l>For the Return, of this our Mighty King,</l>
               <l>Who in the Field, his Foes did dread to ſee,</l>
               <l>Becauſe they took him for their Enemy,</l>

               <l>But they it was who gave the chiefeſt cauſe,</l>
               <l>Who broke at firſt our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> good Laws,</l>
               <l>And thou moſt willingly like <hi>Alexander</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Come over here, and prov'd a great Commander,</l>
               <l>And certain 'tis, no <hi>Lewis</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> Peer,</l>
               <l>Would venture as thou did'ſt, when you came here,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>England</hi> before, had no ſuch one as thee,</l>
               <l>Who with great freeneſs, came this Land to free:</l>
               <l>From our great Thraldom, which we were then in</l>
               <l>Till thou with Romiſh Locuſt did begin,</l>
               <l>Juſt as the <hi>Macedonians</hi> Swords and Shields,</l>
               <l>With Terrour went clear through the <hi>Perſian</hi> Fields,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Alexander,</hi> then <hi>Darius</hi> yeilds.</l>
               <l>So did the Romiſh Crew, to you great Prince,</l>
               <l>Who was ſo willing us to come and free,</l>
               <l>That they dare not once more attempt to come,</l>
               <l>For fear with Shame you make them back return</l>
               <l>To where they were, in their own Native Land,</l>
               <l>Thou makes them know that you do here Command;</l>
               <l>And will, till Death, be our great <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>King,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For which our Nation may Exalt and Sing,</l>
               <l>Praiſes on high for this your ſafe Return,</l>
               <l>Without which you had cauſed all to Mourn:</l>
               <l>But that's all over, we our Joys obtain,</l>
               <l>Since that in Safety You are come again,</l>
               <l>To be amongſt Your loving Subjects here:</l>
               <l>Happy's the Day, when you firſt did appear,</l>
               <l>To ſave this Land, whom <hi>France</hi> would fain invade,</l>
               <l>And cut us off from all ſort of good Trade;</l>
               <l>But thou appeard'ſt here with Flaming Sword,</l>
               <l>And to our Enemies thou didſt afford</l>
               <l>A civil Uſage, though they would betray,</l>
               <l>Thy Kingly Perſon, and thy Crown away.</l>
               <l>But they were out, thou keeps thy own, and will,</l>
