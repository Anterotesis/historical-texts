            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>VP sluggard Muse from <hi>Leathe's</hi> lazy Lake,</l>
            <l>And in plaine tearmes, a true Description make,</l>
            <l>Of toyles, of dangers, and excessiue paines,</l>
            <l>That Sea-men suffer for the Land mens gaines.</l>
            <l>The one doth liue: Shore, in wealth and ease,</l>
            <l>The other surrowes through th'vncertaine Seas.</l>
            <l>The one in pleasure liues, and lyes at home,</l>
            <l>The other cuts the raging salt-Sea fome.</l>
            <l>The one aduentures onely but his goods,</l>
            <l>The other hazards all, both goods and bloods.</l>
            <l>Mongst Pirates, tempests, rocks, fogs, gulfes, and shelues,</l>
            <l>The Sea-men ventures all, and thats themselues.</l>
            <l>The Land-man (dangerlesse) doth-eate and sleepe,</l>
            <l>The Sea-man slems and plowes the Ocean deepe.</l>
            <l>The one fares hard, and harder he doth lye,</l>
            <l>The other lyes and faires, soft, sweete, and dry.</l>
            <l>The one with dauntlesse vnrebated courage,</l>
            <l>Through greatest perils valliently doth forrage,</l>
            <l>And brings home Iewels, Siluer Gold, and Pearles,</l>
            <l>Tadorne both Court and Citie Dames, and Girles.</l>
            <l>They set whole Kingdomes both at wars or peace,</l>
            <l>They make wealth flowe, and plentie to encrease.</l>
            <l>The Countries farre remote, they doe vnite,</l>
            <l>They make vs sharers in the worlds delight:</l>
            <l>And what they get with paine, they spend in pleasure.</l>
            <l>They are no Mizers, boorders vp of treasure.</l>
            <l>The oldest man aliue, did neuer see</l>
            <l>A Sailer and a Niggards minde agree.</l>
            <l>No, if their paines at Sea were ten times more,</l>
            <l>Tis all forgotten when they come a shore.</l>
            <l>And this much I dare publish with my pen,</l>
            <l>They are the best of Seruiceable men,</l>
            <l>The wals of Kingdomes, Castles of defence,</l>
            <l>Against Inuasion of each forreigne Prince.</l>
            <l>A torch lights not it selfe, yet wastes and burnes,</l>
            <l>So they their liues spend, seruing others turnes.</l>
            <l>The Marchant sits at home, and casts vp sums,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:2777:8"/>And reckons gaines and losse, what goes, what comes:</l>
            <l>To what his whole aduentures may amount,</l>
            <l>He Ciphers, numbers, and he casts Account.</l>
            <l>And euery angy boystrous gust he heares</l>
            <l>Disturbs his sleepe, and fils his heart with feares.</l>
            <l>His goods at Sea awakes and startles him,</l>
            <l>For with them, his estate doth sinke or swim.</l>
            <l>But yet for all this heart tormenting strife,</l>
            <l>He's in no daunger of the losse of life</l>
            <l>By cut throate Sea-theeues, or a world of woes,</l>
            <l>Which many a Sailers life and state or'throwes.</l>
            <l>The Mariner abides the desperate shocks</l>
            <l>Of winde and weather, Pirates, sands and rocks</l>
            <l>And what they get, they freely spend away,</l>
            <l>A whole months wages, in a night, or day.</l>
            <l>Their labours on the Sea, they leaue a shore</l>
            <l>And when all's spent then to't againe for more:</l>
            <l>And pitty tis there should be such neglect</l>
            <l>Of such, whose seruice merits such respect.</l>
            <l>Whole spawnes of Land-sharks, and of guilded Guls,</l>
            <l>Of painted Mammets, and ilfauourd truls,</l>
            <l>Will hold their noses and cry sogh and sye,</l>
            <l>When seruiceable Marriners passe by:</l>
            <l>And then (their stomacks somewhat more to ease)</l>
            <l>What stinking tarlubbers (quoth they) are these.</l>
            <l>Then Mistris Fumpe troubled with the stitch,</l>
            <l>She's poysned with the smell of tarre and pitch.</l>
            <l>Some Frankinsence, or Iuniper, oh quick,</l>
            <l>Make haste I say, the Gentlewoman's sicke.</l>
            <l>And Mounsier Puffepast with the sattin slop,</l>
            <l>That sits in a Tobacco-sellers shop,</l>
            <l>And makes a stinke worse then a brace of Beares:</l>
            <l>When with a whiffe his witlesse worship sweares,</l>
            <l>How Sailers are Rude fellowes, and doe smell,</l>
            <l>Of pitch and tarre worse then the smoke of hell.</l>
            <l>But were the case now, as I erst haue knowne,</l>
            <l>That vse of men should haue their seruice showne,</l>
            <l>One Marriner would then doe much more good,</l>
            <l>Then twentie of these Sattin Milksop brood</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:2777:9"/>Of all men then the Nauigator can,</l>
            <l>For King and Countries cause, best play the man:</l>
            <l>And howsoere they smell of tarre and pitch,</l>
            <l>Their painefull toyles doe make great Kingdomes rich.</l>
            <l>I we by soraine Warre should be annoyed,</l>
            <l>Then chiefly Marriners must be imployed,</l>
            <l>They on the Sea must bide the fiercest brunt,</l>
            <l>Grim death and danger they must first affront.</l>
            <l>One fight at Sea, with Ships couragious mand,</l>
            <l>Is more then three great battels on the Land.</l>
            <l>There men must stand to 't, theres no way to fly,</l>
            <l>There must they Conqu'rers liue or Conquerd die.</l>
            <l>And if they dye not by some launching wound.</l>
            <l>They are in hazard to be sunke and drownd.</l>
            <l>The murdring bullets, and the brinish waues,</l>
            <l>Are many a valliant Sea-mans death and graues.</l>
            <l>And tis a lamentable case to thinke,</l>
            <l>How these mens seruiceable number shrinke,</l>
            <l>Decreasing and consuming euery day,</l>
            <l>Where one doth breede, at least sowre doe decay,</l>
            <l>Some the Sea swallowes, but that which most grieues.</l>
            <l>Some turne Sea-monsters, Pirates, roauing theeues:</l>
            <l>Imploying their best skill in Nauigation,</l>
            <l>Gainst their owne Prince, and kin, and natiue Nation,</l>
            <l>By which meanes many a Marchant is vndone,</l>
            <l>And Pirates nere the better for whats won.</l>
            <l>For if (like <hi>Mosse</hi> his Mare) they be catcht napping.</l>
            <l>They bid the world their last farewell at Wapping.</l>
            <l>Which fatall Hauen, hath as many slaine,</l>
            <l>As could disturbe and shake the power of Spaine:</l>
            <l>And want of meanes, but (chiefly want of grace)</l>
            <l>Hath made so many perish in that place.</l>
            <l>But to conclude my Ryme, with heart and speach.</l>
            <l>I doe my God (for Iesus sake) beseech,</l>
            <l>That he for Sailors will vouchsafe to please,</l>
            <l>To graunt them good imployment on the Seas.</l>
            <l>So honest salt-Sea-watermen adiewe,</l>
            <l>I haue bin, am, and will be still for you.</l>
