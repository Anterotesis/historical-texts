            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ſhort <hi>ACCOUNT</hi> of the late <hi>NEWS</hi> from <hi>DARIEN,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Welcome News of our <hi>African</hi> Ships ſafe Arrival at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>
being come, I know no better Way to ſatisfie the
Curious, then by giving the Contents of ſome Letters
writ from the Place where they are Settled, dated about the End
of <hi>December</hi> laſt from <hi>New Edinburgh.</hi> A Captain of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
whom I know to be an Intelligent Perſon writes thus.</p>
            <p>We are here Settled in a very Pleaſant Soyl upon a Bay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
one of the Pleaſanteſt in the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> In the Diviſion of
the two Kingdoms of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> where a Thouſand of the
greateſt Ships in <hi>Europe</hi> may Ride at Anchor ſafe from Storms.
We are juſt now making a Fort upon the Point of the Mouth of
the Bay, which will defend us againſt all Attempts whatſoever.
Upon the ſecond of <hi>November</hi> laſt, our Ships came to Anchor in
the Bay, and in two Days all our Men were ſet on Shore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Oppoſition. The Natives received us very Kindly, there
not being many of them, and their Plantations but a few: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
from thence they come dayly to us with <hi>Plantaines, Yams,
Potatoes, Sugar Canes,</hi> Cocks and Hens, and ſuch things as the
Countrey affords. Several of our People have been abroad at their
Plantations, and have been very Kindly Entertained by them.
Show all my Friends and Comrades, that I have no leſs Thoughts
of the Undertaking now then ever, but rather, upon good Ground,
far bigger. Both our Miniſters are dead, and their Deaths very
much Lamented by us all: Our Officers are all Alive, ſave Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<hi>James Inglis,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Hugh Hay.</hi> Our Paſſage was
very good, but ſomewhat Longſome. We had not near ſo
great Loſs of our Men, as was expected. we have no Reaſon to
doubt, but that there are Gold Mines in this Place, for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
have Plenty of Gold Duſt, and Rock Gold amongſt them,
altho they dare not open the Mines, for fear of the <hi>Spainiard.</hi>
They do not know the true Value or Uſe of it, for I ſaw one give
<pb facs="tcp:36582:4"/>
for an Old Coat, not worth above Twenty Shilling <hi>Sterlin,</hi> to the
Value of Twenty Guineas of Gold. The next Occaſion I ſhall
tell you of a Cargo, ſhal be worth your while to come over with.</p>
            <p>Other Letters are much of the ſame Import, As that they Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
them upon the ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> Sounded the Coaſts on
the third, and Landed on the fourth. That the Rains were over,
before they Arrived there. The Men wear a Plate of Silver or
Gold hanging over their Lip (ſome whereof ar come Home, and
I have ſeen one of them) That the Inhabitants live to a great
Age, ſome to a Hundred and Twenty Years. That the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
have ſome Quantity both of Duſt and Rock Gold: And
that after Falling of the Rains, the Rivers have a Scum upon
them, of the Colour of Gold: And ſome of the Clay that they
find, ſeems to have a Mixture of ſomething like Gold. But they
are not ſo buſie in Felling of Trees, and Clearing of the Ground,
and Fortifying themſelves, that they have had no Leaſure yet
to try Experiments: And that they do not doubt, but that they
have Gold Mines near to them.</p>
            <p>That it would Rejoyce any <hi>Scots</hi> Heart, in coming in to that
Bay, to ſee two <hi>Scots</hi> Flags Flying, one upon their Main Fort,
which is pretty well advanced, and another upon a Redoubt,
from whence they have a great Proſpect.</p>
            <p>My Scale being ſo ſmall, I hope the Intelligent will not expect
it ſhould Anſwer to a Nicety, or that there is ſo great a Diſtance
between the Flags.</p>
            <p>I hope theſe who underſtand the Expenſes of Cutting of Copper
Plates, will not Quarrel the Price of my Book.</p>
            <p>There being ſuch Abundance of Letters ſpread over the Countrey,
I hope it will not be expected, I ſhould inſiſt much in Repeating of
them, ſo I proceed to Mr. <hi>Dampier</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi>'s Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>THE Project of our <hi>Scots African Company,</hi> being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of ſo great Import, That upon the Succeſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Honour and Happineſs of the Nation, does
in a great Meaſure depend:</p>
            <p>Me thinks there will be few True <hi>Scots</hi> Men but will be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to know ſomething of their Succeſs, and where they Deſign to
Settle, and what is the Climate, Air, Soil, People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that
place: I have therefore undertaken this ſmall work for publick
Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>It is generally agreed to, by the moſt Relations we have had,
That they are Settled, or Deſign to Settle, at the <hi>Iſthmus of Darien,
Golden Iſland,</hi> or <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Darien:</hi> Of which I ſhall give you
a ſhort account; which that I may do to the better Satisfaction.
I do not inſiſt upon what theſe Places have been, nor Conſulted
ſome Old Map or Geographer about it: For I know there are
great Changes, within theſe few Years, upon ſome of theſe Parts,
by the <hi>Pirats</hi> or <hi>Buccaneers.</hi> As for Inſtance, That remarkable
Town of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> is nothing now but the Name of a
Town, the Place and Town being deſolate.</p>

               </gap>, if not all, of what you have

late Books: <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dampier</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1698, and Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> this
ſame Year. Which Books, being of a conſiderable Price, and
treating of ſeveral other Parts of the World, and containing ſome
Digreſſions; I have thought it would be no unacceptable Work
to Extract what relates more particularly to Our <hi>Scots African</hi>

This <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> is that narrow Neck of Land, or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt

               <p>It is moſtly comprehended, (as Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays) betwixt the
Latitudes of 8 and 10 North. But its Breadth in the narroweſt
part, is much about One Degree, or Threeſcore Miles.</p>
               <p>It is bounded on the North and South, by the North and South
Oceans; and is of a very ſingular Situation, very Pleaſant and
Agreeable.</p>
               <p>A great many valueable Iſlands ly ſcattered along each Coaſt,
the <hi>Baſtimento's,</hi> and others; but eſpecially the large range of

cauſed by the bending of the <hi>Iſthmus;</hi> and for the Bigneſs of it,
there is not (it may be) a more Pleaſant and Advantagious one
any where to be found.</p>
               <p>The Land of this Continent is almoſt every where of an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
Surface, diſtinguiſhed with Hills and Valleys, of great
variety for Heigth, Depth, and Extent: They are generally wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with Rivers, Brooks, and Perennial Springs, with which
the Countrey very much abounds, and do moſt of them come
from a Ridge or Chain of High Hills, in a manner paralel
to the North ſhore; from whence you may have a fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the North-Sea, and its various making of the Shore.</p>
               <p>Betwixt theſe Hills and the Shore, it is moſt part covered

Reported our <hi>African</hi> Company deſign to Settle) it is a ſmall Iſland,
with a fair deep Channel between it and the Main: It is Rocky &amp;
and Steep; all round to the Sea (and thereby Naturally Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
except only the Landing Place, which is a ſmall Sandy-Bay
on the South ſide, towards the Harbour, from which it gently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36582:6"/>
riſes. It is moderatly High, and covered with ſmall Trees or
Shrubs. The Land of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> oppoſite to it, is excellent fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Land, of a black Mold, with Sand intermixed, and is pretty
levell, for 4 or 5 Miles, till you come to the foot of the Hills.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays, He has been a ſhore, and in the Harbour near
it, for a Fortnight together. Near the Eaſtern-point of the Bay,
which is not above 3 or 4 Furlongs diſtant from <hi>Golden Iſland;</hi>
there is a Rivulet of very good Water. To go to <hi>Golden Iſland</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
you moſt enter by the Eaſt-end of <hi>Golden Iſland,</hi> between that,
and the Main.</p>
                  <p>To the South of <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> and the River of <hi>Congo,</hi> is the
<hi>Gold River,</hi> affording Gold Duſt in great plenty: For hither
the <hi>Spainards</hi> of <hi>Panama,</hi> and <hi>Sancta Maria</hi> Town, bring up their
Slaves to gather up the Gold Duſt.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays, That during his aboad with <hi>Lacenta</hi> (their
King or Chief Perſon) he often accompained him a Hunting,
wherein he took great Delight: And that one time accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, they paſſed by a River where the <hi>Spainards</hi> were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gold.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dampier</hi> takes this River to be one of theſe which comes
from the South-eaſt, &amp; runs into the Gulf of St. <hi>Michael.</hi> When they
came near the place where they wrought, they ſtole ſoftly throw
the Woods, and placing themſelves behind the Great Trees, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on them a good while, the Gold-Gatherers not ſeeing them.</p>
                  <div type="text">
                     <head>The way of gathering GOLD</head>
                     <p>The manner of their Getting Gold is as follows: They have
little wooden Diſhes, which they dip ſoftly into the Water, and
and take it up half full of Sand, which they draw Gently out
of the Water, and at every Dipping they take up Gold mixed with
the Sand, and Water, more or leſs. This they ſhake, and the Sand
riſeth, and goes over the brims of the Diſh with the Water; but
the Gold ſettles to the Bottom. This done they bring it out, and
dry it in the Sun, and then Pound it in a Mortar. Then they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36582:6"/>
take it out and ſpread it on Paper; and having a Load ſtone, they
move that over it, which draws all the Iron from it; and this they
bottle up: If they meet with good Succeſs, and a favourable Time,
They carry with them, by Report (for Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He Learnt

                  </head>
                  <p>There are a ſort of the <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Moskito,</hi> Men, Dexterous at
ſtricking of this, or other Fiſhes. The way is this, They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a ſmall <hi>Canoa</hi> for their uſe, which they keep very Neat and
Clean. They uſe no Oars, but Padles the broad part of which,
doth not go Tapering towards the Staff or Handle of it, as in the
Oar, nor do they uſe it in the ſame manner, by laying it on the
Side of the Veſſel, but hold it Perpendicularly, Gripping the
Staff hard with both Hands, and putting back the Water by main
Strength, and very quick Stroaks. One of the <hi>Moskitoes</hi> (for
there go but Two in a <hi>Canoa</hi>) Sits in the Stern, the other Kneels
down in the Head, and both Padle, till they come to the Place
where they expect their Game, then they ly ſtill, or Padle very
ſoftly, looking well about them; and he that is in the Head of
the <hi>Canoa,</hi> lays down his Padle, and ſtands up with his Striking
Staff in his Hand: This Staff is about Eight Foot long, almoſt
as big as a Mans Arm at the Great End, in which there is a Hole
to place his Harpoon in, at the other end of his Staff, there is a
piece of Light Wood called <hi>Bobwood,</hi> with a Hole in it, throw which
the ſmall end of the Staff comes, and on this piece of <hi>Bobwood,</hi>
there is a Line of 10 or 12 Fathom wound neatly about, and the
end of the Line made faſt to it. The other end of the Line is
made faſt to the Harpoon, which is at the great End of the Staff,
and the <hi>Moskito</hi> Man keeps about a Fathom of it looſe in his Hand.
When he ſtrikes, the Harpoon preſently comes out of the Staff,
and as the Manatee ſwims away, the Line runs off from the Bob;
and although at firſt, both Staff and Bobb may be carried under
Water, yet as the Line runs off, it will riſe again. Then the
<hi>Moskito</hi> Men Paddle with all their might, to get hold of the Bob
again, and ſpend uſually a Quarter of an Hour before they get
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36582:8"/>
it. When the Manatee begins to be tired, it lyeth ſtill, and then
the <hi>Moskito</hi> Men Paddle to the Bob, and take it up, and begin
to hale in the Line. When the Manatee feels them, he ſwims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
again, with the Canoa after him: Then he that Steers, muſt
be Nimble, to turn the Head of the Canoa that way that his
Conſort points, who being in the Head of the Canoa, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Line, both ſees and feels which way the Manatee is
ſwimming. Thus the Canoa is Towed with a Violent Motion,
till the Manatees Strength decays. Then they gather in the Line,
which they are often forced to let all go to the very End. At
length, when the Creatures Strength is ſpent, they hale it up to
the Canoas Side, and knock it on the Head, and Tow it to the
neareſt Shore, where they make it faſt, and ſeek for another;
which having taken, they go on Shore with it, to put it into
their Canoa: For 'tis ſo heavy, that they cannot lift it in, but
they hale it up in Shoal-Water, as near the Shore as they can,
and then Overſet the Canoa, laying one Side cloſe to the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.
Then they Roll it in, which brings the Canoa upright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and when they have Heav'd out the Water, they faſten a
Line to the other Manatee that lyeth Afloat, and Tow it after
them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Dampier</hi> ſays, He has known two <hi>Moskito</hi> Men for a Week,
every day bring abroad 2 <hi>Manatee</hi> in this manner, the leaſt of
which hath not weighted leſs than 600 Pound, and that in a very
ſmall <hi>Canoa,</hi> that 3 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men would ſcarce adventure to go in.
When they ſtrick a <hi>Cow</hi> that hath a young one, they ſeldom miſs
the Calf, for ſhe commonly takes her Young under one of her Fins.
But if the Calf is ſo big, that ſhe cannot carry it, or ſo frightned
that ſhe only minds to ſave her own Life; yet the Young never
leaves her till the <hi>Moskito</hi> Men have an opportunity to ſtrick
her.</p>
                  <p>The manner of ſtricking <hi>Manatee</hi> and <hi>Tortoiſe,</hi> is much the
ſame, only when they ſeek for <hi>Manatee,</hi> they padle ſo Gently,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36582:8"/>
that they have no Noiſe, and never touch the ſide of the <hi>Canoa</hi>
with their Padle; Becauſe it is a Creature that hears very well. But
they are not ſo Nice where they ſeek for <hi>Tortoiſe,</hi> whoſe Eyes
are better than his Ears. They ſtrik the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe</hi>
with a ſquare ſharp Iron peg, the other
with a Harpoon. The <hi>Moskito</hi> men make their
own ſtriking Inſtruments, as Harpoons, Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks,
and Tortoiſe-Irons or Pegs. Theſe Peggs
or Tortoiſe-Irons are made 4 ſquare, ſharp at
one end, and not above an inch in length, of ſuch
a figure as you ſee on the Margin.

The ſmall
ſpike at the broad end hath the Line faſten'd
to it, and goes alſo into a hole at the end of the Stricking ſtaff,
which when the Tortoiſe is ſtruck, flies off, the Iron and end or
the Line faſtned to it going quite within the Shell, where it is ſo
buiried that the Tortoiſe cannot poſſibly eſcape.</p>

(whereof there are but few) whiter in collour then any <hi>Europeans,</hi>
much like that of a white Horſe, their-bodies beſet all over with
a white Down, throw which the Skin appears it is ſo thin ſet,
Their Eye-lids bend and open in an oblong-Figure, forming an
Arch, or Figure of a creſcent: with the points downwards. From
hence, and from their ſeing ſo clear as they do in a Moon-ſhiny
night, they uſed to call them <hi>Moon eyed:</hi> For they ſee not very
well in the Sun; ſo that in the Day-time they care not to go abroad.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36582:9"/>
But notwithſtanding their being Sluggiſh in the Day-time; yet
when Moon-ſhyny Nights come, they are all Life and Activity,

(their Prince, or chief Perſon) told him, That it was throw
the force of the Mothers imagination, looking on the Moon at

leaves this to others to judge of.</p>
               <p>Both theſe &amp; the Copper coloured <hi>Indians,</hi> uſe painting their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
even of the ſucking Children ſome times. They make Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of Birds, Beaſts, Men, Trees, or the like, up and down in
every part of the Body, more eſpecially in the Face. The Women
are the Painters. The Collours they uſe, and like moſt, are Red,
Yellow, and Blew. Finer Figures they imprint thus; they prick
all over with a ſharp Thorn, till the Blood guſhes out, then they
rub the place with their Hands firſt dip'd in the colour they deſign,
and the Picture ſo made is indelible; but ſcarce one in Fourty of
them is painted this way.</p>
               <p>They wear no Cloaths ordinarly, but only the Women have a
Clout or peece of Cloth about their Middle, tyed behind
with a Threed, and hanging down to their Knees, or their Ankles
if they can get one large enough: They make theſe of Cotton:
Nothing will oblige the Women more, than to give them Cloaths,
eſpecially of Gaudy Colours,</p>
               <p>The Men go ordinarly quite naked, and have only a ſmall
Veſſel of Gold or Silver, or Plantain leaf, of a Conick Figure,

               <p>Both Sexes are a Modeſt and cleanly people; when they
would go to Stool they choiſe always to go into the River, having
a great Senſe of Shame as to that particular.</p>
               <p>Yet the Men alſo have a value for Cloaths, and if any of them
had an old Shirt given him by any of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> he would
be ſure to wear it, and ſtrut about at no ordinary rate. Beſides
this, they have a ſort of long Cotton Garments, which they wear

at Great Occaſions, as attending the King, or at a Feaſt: The
Women carry thoſe after them, and they put them on when they

               <p>The Men wear a piece of Plate hanging over their Mouths
at all times, generally of Silver; it's of Ovall Figure, covering
their Mouth from Corner to Corner; the plate is like the figure of

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36582:10"/>
This is their Choiſe Drink; for ordinarly they Drink <hi>Miſlaw,</hi>
which Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> deſcribes at large.</p>
               <p>The Women are, in general, the Drudges of the Family; Yet
they do it Cheerfully, and are Well Conditioned, Pitiful, and
Courteous to one another, but eſpecially to Strangers; They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Husbands, with all Profound Reſpect and Duty upon all
Occaſions: And on the other Side, their Husbands are very Kind
and Loving to them.</p>
               <p>When a Woman is Delivered of a Child, another Woman takes
it in her Arms, within half an Hour or leſs after it's Born, and
takes the Lying-in Woman upon her Back, and goes with both
of them into the River, and Waſhes them. The Child, for the
firſt three Moneths, is Tyed upon a Board, and this Piece of
Board, or <hi>Maccaw</hi>-Wood, is Suathed to the Back of the Child, and
their Children generally grow very Streight. The Mother takes
up the Child to give it Suck, Board and all.</p>
               <p>As the Children grow up, the Boys are Bred to their Fathers
Exerciſes, eſpecially Shooting with the Bow and Arrow, or Throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Lance. Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays, he has ſeen a little Boy about Eight
Years Old, would ſet a Cane up upon one End, and going about
Twenty Paces from it, would Split it with a Bow and Arrow,
and not miſs once in ſeveral Eſſays.</p>
               <p>They have a Severe Puniſhment, if a Man Debauches a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
But the Fact muſt be proved by Oath, which is by their
Tooth.</p>

               <head>Their MARRIAGE.</head>
               <p>When they Marry, the Father of the Bride, or next Man of Kin,
keeps her privatly in ſome Apartment with himſelf, the firſt ſeven
Nights, and ſhe is then delivered to her Husband.</p>
               <p>When a Man Diſpoſes of his Daughter, he Invites all the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
within Twenty Miles round to a Great Feaſt. which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
for them. The Men who come to the Wedding, bring their
Axes along with them, to Work with: The Women bring
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36582:11"/>
about half a Buſhel of <hi>Maiz:</hi> The Boys bring Fruit and Roots:
The Girles, Fowles and Eggs; for none come Empty Handed.
They ſet their Preſents at the Door of the Houſe, and go away
again, till all the reſt of the Gueſts have brought theirs, which
are all Received in, and Diſpoſed of by the People of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Then the Men return firſt to the Wedding, and the Bridegroom
preſents each Man with a Calabaſh of Strong Drink, and Conducts
them through the Houſe one by one, into ſome open Place behind
it: The Women come next, who likeways receive a Calabaſh of
Liquor, and March throw the Houſe: Then come the Boys; and
laſt of all the Girles, who all Drink at the Door, and go after
the reſt. Then come the Fathers of the Young Couple, with
their Son and Daughter. The Father of the Bridegroom leads his
Son, and the Father of the Bride leads his Daughter. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
makes a Speech to the Company, and then Dances about with
many Antick Geſtures, till he is all on a Sweat. Then Kneeling
down, he gives his Son to the Bride, whoſe Father is Kneeling
alſo, and holds her, having Danced himſelf into a Sweat as the
other. Then the Young Couple take each other by the Hand,
and the Bridegroom returns the Bride to her Father: And thus ends
the Ceremony.</p>
               <p>Then all the Men take up their Axes, and Run, Shouting and
Hollowing, to a Tract of Wood-Land, which is before laid out
for a Plantation for the Young Couple. There they fall to Work
as faſt as they can, Cutting down the Woods. Thus they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
about ſeven Days. As they clear the Ground, the Women
Plant <hi>Maiz,</hi> or ſomething elſe. They Build an Houſe for the
new Married Couple.</p>
               <p>Then they Feaſt, and Drink <hi>Chicha Co-pah,</hi> Drinking Night and
Day, till all the Liquor is ſpent, which laſts uſually three or four
Days, ſome always Drinking, while others are Drunk and Slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
And when all the Drink is out, and they have recovered
their Senſes, they all return to their own Homes.</p>

               <p>This Houſe is Situat on a Fine little Hill, on which grows a
Stately Grove of Cotton Trees, the Bodies of theſe Trees were
generally ſix Foot in Diameter, nay ſome eight, nine, ten, eleven:
For (Mr. <hi>Wafer,</hi> who gives the Relation, ſays) four <hi>Indians</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36582:14"/>
his ſelf, took Hand in Hand round a Tree, and could not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom

of other ſmall Trees, that would make a Pleaſant Artificial Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
if Induſtry and Art were beſtowed on it.</p>
               <p>The Circumference of this Pleaſant little Hill, contains at leaſt
a Hundred Acres of Land, and is a Peninſula of an Oval Form,
almoſt Surrounded with two great Rivers, one coming from the
Eaſt, the other from the Weſt, which, approaching within fourty
Foot of each other at the Front of the Peninſula, ſeparat again, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
the Hill, and meet on the other Side, making there one
pretty large River, which runs very Swift. There is therefore but
one Way to come in to this Seat, which, as is before obſerved, is
not above fourty Foot Wide between the Rivers on each Side:
And its Fenced with Hollow <hi>Bamboes, Popes-Heads,</hi> and <hi>Pricle-Pears,</hi>
ſo thick ſet from one Side the Neck of Land to the other,
that its impoſſible for any Enemy to approach it.</p>
               <p>On this Hill live fifty principal Men of the Countrey, all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>There is only one <hi>Canoa</hi> belonging to it, which ſerves to Ferry

                  <hi>Lacenta</hi> having deſired Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> and his Companions to ſtay

               <head>The <hi>INDIANS</hi> WAY OF LETTING BLOOD.</head>
               <p>It ſo hapned, that one of <hi>Lacenta</hi>'s Wives, being Indiſpoſed, was
to be let Blood: Which (Mr <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays) the <hi>Indians</hi> perform in this
Manner: The Patient is Seated on a Stone in the River, and one,
with a ſmall Bow, Shoo's little Arrows into the Naked Body of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36582:14"/>
the Patient, up and down, Shooting them as faſt as he can, not
miſſing any part. But the Arrows are Gagged, ſo that they can
Penetrat no further than we generally Thruſt our Lancets: And
if by Chance they Hit a Vein which is full of Blood, and the
Blood Spurts out a little, they will Leap and Skip about, ſhewing
many Antick Geſtures, by Way of Rejoycing and Triumph.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays he was by, while this was performing on <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa</hi>'s
Lady: And perceiving their Ignorance, told <hi>Lacenta,</hi> that
if he pleaſed, he would ſhew him a better Way, without putting
the Patient to ſo much Torment; ſo, at <hi>Lacenta</hi>'s Allowance or
Command, Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> Bound up her Arm with a piece of Bark, and
with his Lancet Breathed a Vein: But this Raſh Attempt (he ſays)
had like to have coſt him his Life; for <hi>Lacenta</hi> ſeeing the Blood
Iſſue out in a Stream, which uſed to come only Drop by Drop,
got hold of his Launce, and Swore by his Tooth, that if ſhe did
otherwiſe then well, he would have Mr. <hi>Wafers</hi> Hearts Blood.
Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſays, he deſired him to be patient, and drew off about
twelve Ounces, and Bound up her Arm, and deſired ſhe might
reſt till the next Day; by which Means the Fever Abated, and
ſhe had not another Fit.</p>
               <p>This gained Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> ſo much Reputation, that <hi>Lacenta</hi> came
to him, and before all his Attendants, Bowed and Kiſſed Mr. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi>
Hand: Then the reſt came thick about him, and Kiſſed his
Hand, others his Knee, and ſome his Foot: After which he was
taken up into a Hammock, and carried on Mens Shoulders, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa</hi>
himſelf making a Speech in his Praiſe, and Commending
him as much ſuperior to any of their Doctors. Thus he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
from Plantation to Plantation, and lived in great Splendor
and Repute, Adminiſtring both Phiſick and Phlebotomy to theſe
that wanted; for tho he had loſt his Salves and Plaiſters, by a
<hi>Negro</hi>'s running away with his Knapſack: Yet he preſerved a Box
of Inſtruments, and a few Medicaments wrapt up in an Oyl Cloath,
by having them in his Pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:36582:15"/>
He lived thus ſome Moneths among the <hi>Indians,</hi> who in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Adored him: Some of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> had been Slaves to the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and had made their Eſcapes, which he ſuppoſes, was
the Cauſe of their expreſſing a Deſire of Baptiſm: But more to

that they have but little Proviſions; and when they ſee
a Sail, they hide themſelves; otherwiſe Ships that come here
would take them, and make Slaves of them; and I have ſeen
ſome of them that have been Slaves. They are People of a mean
Stature, yet ſtrong Limbs; they are of a dark Copper Colour,
black Hair, full round Faces, ſmall black Eyes their Eye-brows
hanging over their Eyes, low Foreheads, ſhort thick Noſes, not
High, but Flattiſh; full Lips, and ſhort Chins. They have a
Faſhion to cut Holes in the Lips of the Boys, when they are
Young, cloſe to their Chin; which they keep open with little
Pegs, till they are fourteen or fifteen Years Old: Then they wear
Beards in them, made of Turtle or Tortoiſe-ſhell, in the Form you
ſee in the Copper-plate. The little Notch at the upper End, they
put in through the Lip, where it remains between the Teeth and
the Lip; the under part hangs down over their Chin. This they
commonly wear all Day, and when they Sleep, they take it out.
They have likewiſe Holes bored in their Ears, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
when Young; and by continual Stretching them with long
Pegs, they grow to be as big as a Mill'd Five Shilling piece Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
