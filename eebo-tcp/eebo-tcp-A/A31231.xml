         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving conſidered with great admiration, how
it could poſſibly happen, notwithſtanding ſo
many legal Trials, (and thoſe alſo publiſht
by my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> and others in Authority) to
ſhew the World how Guilty the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been,
That the Diſpute ſhould yet continue, and that each
Champion keeping ſtill his ground, ſhould think the
other extreamly willful and unreaſonable. I ſay,
having conſidered this with admiration, I at laſt
found, That one main matter, beſides Prejudice,
was, That People had never well examined the
ſaid Trials; and therefore I took the pains (and
truly it is no little pains) to preſent you with a
<hi>Compendium,</hi> by which at the firſt glimps, you ſhall
ſee both how well the Witneſſes have made good
their part, and how the Accuſed have defended
themſelves. I have been exact to a tittle, defying
any Man to ſhew me that I have leſſened the
force either of the Charge or Anſwer: nor does
the one party, or the other, alledge any thing
here, but that the <hi>Margent</hi> gives the very Page where
it is in the original Treatiſe; for as to mine, and
other Spectators's Reflexions, they are by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb facs="tcp:98466:3"/>
ſo that every Reader may preſently judge,
whether they are juſt or no.</p>
            <p>But now my Lords and Gentlemen, before I
end, I muſt acquaint you; That Yeſterday, as I
was ſending this to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> I found that Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
had ſo far jumpt with me in my Deſign, as
to abbreviate all the late Judicial Proceedings, by
the Title of <hi>the Hiſtory of the Plot;</hi> which upon
conſideration, has not hindred me from publiſhing
this; Becauſe the Author of the ſaid Hiſtory has
on the one ſide paſt by, or ſluber'd over, ſeveral
things which the Parties concern'd may juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
upon to be of great force in their buſineſs, as
you will here plainly ſee; and on the other ſide,
my bare <hi>Compendium</hi> is not much more than a Fifth
Part of his, as his is about the Fifth of the Whole.
Peruſe then, what I preſent you with, and by and by,
I ſhall again Kiſs your Hands.</p>

(through his late Fatigue and Watchings) that <hi>upon his Salvation,

Nor could Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> witneſs any thing new,<note place="margin">pag. 40.</note> to <hi>Oates</hi>'s
Advantage, more than that he did in <hi>Council</hi> ſay; <hi>That if Mr.</hi> Coleman's
<hi>Papers were ſearcht, there would be Matter (he believ'd) found in
them, that would coſt him his Neck:</hi> Which, on the one ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt
People deemed an eaſie Surmiſe, ſeeing <hi>Coleman</hi> was generally known
to be a great Intriguer; and on the other ſide, they imagin'd, <hi>Oates</hi>
might as well have then Charged him with down-right <hi>Treaſon,</hi> if
what he here alleadged, had not been a Fiction of a later Date:
For 'twas impoſſible to ſay, He thought there was Hanging matter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98466:4"/>
in a Man's Letters, and through Laſſitude, or any other Pretence,
not to be able to tell the <hi>King,</hi> That the ſame Perſon had Contriv'd
his Death, if it were really Deſign'd. But as for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
on the 21<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> (as before) the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> told him,
<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 80.</note> 
               <hi>That if the Cauſe did turn on that Matter, he would ſtay 'till his
Book were brought;</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> urg'd, could prove his ſaid
Abſence) <hi>but that he doubted, the Cauſe would not ſtand on that Foot;
and yet, if that were the Caſe, it would do him little Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Sum of the Reply to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Plea, in relation
to <hi>Oates:</hi> But Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> (who was one of the Clerks of
the <hi>Council)</hi> atteſted in <hi>Court,</hi> not only, that<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Oates</hi> ſaid at the Board,
<hi>He knew not Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>well; and (to the beſt of his Remembrance)
That he had no Acquaintance with him,</hi> but alſo, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>was Examin'd before</hi> Oates <hi>ſpake:</hi> Which evidently ſhews, that
<hi>Oates</hi> knew him no better after his ſpeaking, than before.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Charge, 'twas to this Effect: That Sir<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 41.</note> 
               <hi>Henry
Tichbourn</hi> told him, That he brought a Commiſſion for Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi>

               <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> Dated <hi>April</hi> 75. That
he Delivered the ſaid Letters to <hi>La Chaiſe,</hi> and brought Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and Anſwer: That he did not underſtand what was in it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was in a<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> ib.</note> 
               <hi>Language</hi> he did not well <hi>underſtand; but it was
about carrying-on the Plot.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Hartcourt</hi> went to Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
with Letters, and took him (the ſaid <hi>Bedlow)</hi> along with him;
but <hi>made him ſtay over the Way:</hi> That <hi>Hartcourt</hi> afterwards beckon'd
him in; and there he heard Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſay,<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 43.</note> 
               <hi>If he had a
Hundred Lives, and a Sea of Blood, to carry on the Cauſe, he would
ſpend it all for the Eſtabliſhment of the Church here; and if there were
a Hundred</hi> Heretical Kings, <hi>he would ſee them all Deſtroy'd.</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 44.</note> That
Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſaw him in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe-Gallery,</hi> coming from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,

make the Bottom of the Plot to tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> made little Anſwer to him, beſides proteſting, that
he never<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 72.</note> ſaw him before: Nor was there any of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s
Family, that had ever ſeen him, which had been Morally impoſſible,
had he received and brought Letters, as he pretended. Beſides,
few of the Auditory could comprehend, how <hi>Bedlow</hi> did know, that
the <hi>Letter,</hi> which (he ſaid) he brought from <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not, was about carrying on the Plot;</hi> or why Mr. <hi>Hartcourt</hi>
ſhould juſt call him in from over the way, for no other Reaſon, (for
<hi>Bedlow</hi> gives not the leaſt) but to hear Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Treaſonable
Expreſſions, in his Zeal for the Church: But more eſpecially, how

               <hi>Expreſſions would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> being then found Guilty <hi>upon the account of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
(for my <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> told him, (as I already mention'd)

to be believed better now, than formerly; if ſo, <hi>I do here

ſtirring up the People to Rebellion, altering the known Laws, and
Contriving the Death of the King, <hi>I am wholly Ignorant of it; Nor
did ever I think to advance that Religion</hi> (which People think I am
ſo Zealous of) <hi>hereby.</hi> I thank God I am of it, and declare I dye
of it; nor do I think it prejudicial to King or Government: But

contrary, he concluded with theſe few words following; I do ſay
I had no intention to ſubvert the Government, or to act any thing
contrary to Law, but what every Man of a contrary Religion,
would do in a peaceable manner, if he could. And if I may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>WE are come hither as on the laſt Theater of the World, and

here obliged, if we were Guilty our ſelves of any Treaſon, to declare
it, and that if we knew any Perſon faulty therein, (although he
were our Father) we would detect and diſcover him; and as for our
ſelves, we would beg a Thouſand and a Thouſand Pardons both of
God and Man; but ſeeing we cannot be believed, we muſt beg
leave to commit our ſelves to the Mercy of Almightly God, and

hope to find Pardon of him through Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Here one of the Sherifs told him he would do well to make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

No body would believe him; Not that they thought much fo their
time, for they would ſtay; but ſuch kind of words did arraign the
proceedings of the Court by which they were tryed.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> proceeded, and ſaid, I do here beg of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to Showr down a Thouſand and a Thouſand Bleſſings upon

<hi>Catholicks</hi> that are here, we deſire their Prayers for a happy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
into a better World, and that he would be Merciful to all
Chriſtian Souls. And as for all our Enemies we earneſtly deſire,
that God would Pardon them again and again, for we pardon them
heartily from the bottom of our Hearts; And ſo I beſeech all good

(Rector of <hi>London)</hi> Mr. <hi>Gaven,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> (two

               <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> 78. where 'twas agreed upon, That the King ſhould be-Kill'd by <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering,</hi> and upon their failure by <hi>Four</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

                  <hi>p.</hi> 4. &amp; 5.</note> told the

of laſt <hi>December)</hi> been Indicted, the <hi>Jury</hi> Empanell'd, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
call'd, and he Examin'd during many Hours, and that he
humbly conceiv'd, he could not by Law be put again in Jeopardy
of his Life for the ſame Fact; for otherwiſe a Man might be Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
100. times. To which the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> Anſwered, That it was
ſuppoſed, when he was Endited, there would have been <hi>Two</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
but that fell otherwiſe; that he was not in Jeopardy, being
diſcharged before the <hi>Jury</hi> went together, and that his Caſe was
no more, than if a Witneſs were taken Sick, and ſhould that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
it would not be reaſonable a Malefactor ſhould therefore
eſcape. <hi>Chief Juſtice North</hi> affirm'd the ſame, and ſaid, that he
knew this often done, and beſides that his Plea was not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was no <hi>Record</hi> of it extant; which ſurpris'd many of

Mr. <hi>White</hi> demanded <hi>Counſel</hi> as his right, as alſo, whether
he ought not at his former Trial to have been Condemn'd or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted;
but the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> Anſwering, that it lay in the Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Court, and that he muſt plead; He did it at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo did Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> (whoſe caſe was the ſame with his) after he

had urg'd in his own, and in Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> behalf, this reaſon;<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 6.</note> 
               <hi>That
not being formerly proceeded againſt, becauſe the</hi> Second <hi>Witneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
he had nothing againſt them, it follow'd that his Silence ought
to have then diſcharged them, ſince his Evidence would certainly have
Condemn'd them;</hi> which not ſatisfying the <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> he reply'd,
that this lay in the Breaſt of the Court, for it was unreaſonable
that a Man accus'd of a Capital Crime by the expreſs Oath of
one Witneſs, ſhould go Scot-free for want of a Second. Now
the Conſequence of Mr. <hi>Fenwick's</hi> Argument tended to this, that
if the Law were ſo, a Man thus accus'd might poſſibly never be
freed, though Innocent; ſeeing he might be remanded from one
Trial to another, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> on pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Diſpute thus ended, and the Priſoners having all pleaded <hi>Not

               <hi>Hartcourt</hi> askt him
earneſtly thus; Can you ſay, that I ever ſpoke to you about ſuch

enough for him and others, in <hi>Church-Work:</hi> That he going to Mr.

Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> would have had him come to Confeſſion to him,<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 32.</note> and
enjoyn'd him Secreſie once or twice.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Bedlow</hi> was call'd, who ſaid, That he queſtion'd not, but
Mr. <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> would now object his <hi>former, ſlender Evidence</hi>
againſt them; <hi>but that it was then Convenient;</hi> for otherwiſe, it
would have ſtopt a Deſign; there being a Treaty with Mr. <hi>Reading</hi>
about them two, as well as the Lords in the <hi>Tower:</hi> So that, Mr.
<hi>Reading</hi> depended on him, as to the favouring the ſaid Lords, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he dealt with theſe; which made him then Apologize
in <hi>Court,</hi> (as ſome of the <hi>Juſtices</hi> he believ'd, did remember) That
he could not then ſafely declare all he had to ſay; and in <hi>truth, he
was ſo far from ſaying all, that he did not ſay half of it.</hi> Now, as
to the Particulars of his then Evidence, it was (he affirm'd) thus:
That he had ſeen Mr. <hi>White</hi> at ſeveral Conſults; but this he ſaid
with a Caution, viz. <hi>That he never heard Mr.</hi> White <hi>was ſo very
much concern'd in the Plot, becauſe he had no reaeſon to ſay otherwiſe,
ſince he heard of it from Mr.</hi> White <hi>himſelf, and ſo could not well ſpeak
it from a Hear-ſay.</hi> And for Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> he never heard him ('tis
true) give in any Anſwer; but yet he had ſeen him at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults.
This was <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Prelude; but whether Satisfactory or not,
the <hi>Auditors</hi> then, and the <hi>Readers</hi> now, can beſt judge; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98466:13"/>
eſpecially ſince his former Charge was not as he would now have
it to be; it being without any <hi>Apology</hi> or <hi>Advertiſement</hi> to the <hi>Court,
that he had more to ſay againſt them;</hi> as it moſt manifeſtly appears

His Anſwer was, <hi>That he had the leaſt Acquaintance with him,
of any of all the Society; yet both he, and Mr.</hi> Fenwick <hi>had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

After this, two <hi>Letters</hi> were produc'd, taken among Mr. <hi>Hartcourt</hi>'s
papers; The firſt being from Mr.<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Peters</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> in which
the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> was mention'd, as the day of the meeting. Now
becauſe it was there enjoyn'd, <hi>that they ſhould not appear much about
Town till the meeting were over, leſt their Deſign ſhould be ſuſpected;</hi> and
becauſe of the word <hi>Deſign,</hi> as alſo that <hi>Secrecy was much recommended,
as in its own nature neceſſary,</hi> The <hi>C. Juſtice</hi> thought it extremly
conduc'd to the making out of the Plot. As for the<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 41.</note> ſecond, it
was from Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> bearing date the 5th. of <hi>February</hi>
was Twelve month, where mention being made of <hi>Patents</hi> that
were ſent, and <hi>Patents</hi> being in the Plural number, 'twas thought
that theſe were the <hi>Commiſſions</hi> ſo often ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>The Charge being finiſh'd, it became ſoon very dubious as to <hi>Gaven</hi>
and <hi>Turner,</hi> becauſe <hi>Oates</hi> knew them not at their Apprehenſion; and his
own words in Court make it good; for firſt<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 14.</note> 
               <hi>He confeſt, that</hi> (when he
met <hi>Gaven</hi> after his apprehenſion in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> and was askt by a
Gentleman about him) <hi>he did not well know him, nor could ſay any
thing againſt him then, becauſe being under an ill favour'd Perriwig,
and being a man he knew had a good Head of Hair, he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the MYSTERY of it, and ſo ſpar'd his Evidence, and informing the
Councel againſt him.</hi> Again, <hi>Gaven</hi> produc'd ſeveral <hi>Staffordſhire
Witneſſes,</hi> and among others<note n="*" place="margin">p. 63, &amp; 64.</note> 
               <hi>Sir John Winford's Neece,</hi> and her
Maid, where he ſojourned, who atteſted that they were very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his being with them (beſides other moneths) all <hi>June</hi> and
<hi>July,</hi> 'till the 23th. becauſe they remember not his abſence; yet
they would not<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 65.</note> poſitively ſay, that 'twas impoſſible for him to be
away ſome days, ſince they had no particular Circumſtances in
readineſſe; but both they and the reſt of his<note n="‖" place="margin">p. 68. &amp; 69.</note> witneſſes did averr,
<hi>that he was in Wolver-Hampton, from the 23th. to the end of July;</hi> for
then to their knowledge, he was in the Spiritual Exerciſe; which in
truth included the very time of <hi>Oates</hi> his Accuſation; for by his
ſaying, that <hi>Gaven</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> either in<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 14.</note> 
               <hi>July</hi> or <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and
then abſolutely agreeing that it was in<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>July,</hi> it in manner follows,
that the time in diſpute was in the latter end of the ſaid moneth;
and beſides in the<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 15.</note> beginning of his Charge, He himſelf ſayes, <hi>That
he believ'd it to be in the latter part of it;</hi> but when once <hi>Oates</hi> came
to be preſt with it, and eſpecially with a counter-evidence, he flew
back, taking the utmoſt extent and Compaſs for his Plea that he
could. Now for Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> He inform'd the Court, That <hi>Oates</hi>
not only, <hi>did not know him at</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Whitehall, but call'd him there
by another</hi> name; nor could <hi>Oates</hi> give the Court any better reaſon
for it, <hi>than that Turner was at that time in a diſguiſed habit, and a naſty
Perriwig;</hi> when as the Poor man was in his ordinary Cloaths and
Accoutrements; neither had he (and the voluntary ſurrendry of
himſelf moſt evidently proves it) the leaſt aim or deſign of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98466:14"/>
himſelf from any body. Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> further urg'd, that
though<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> ib.</note> 
               <hi>Oates</hi> depoſed now, <hi>That he ſaw him at a Colloquy in</hi> Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick's
<hi>Chamber, yet by his former Evidence, it was at</hi> Wild-houſe;
to which <hi>Oates</hi> had nothing to reply, but this; <hi>That becauſe the chiefeſt
part of the Conſult Sat at</hi> Wild houſe, '<hi>twas call'd by them the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of</hi> Wild-houſe. As for <hi>Dugdale,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Turner</hi> proteſted that
he had not been in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> theſe<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Four</hi> Years, which made no
little impreſſion upon many preſent; Since No body in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
could ſeem a more unfit man for intrigues than He; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
had <hi>Dugdale</hi> nam'd any of my <hi>Lord Aſtons</hi> Family, as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the ſaid <hi>Turner's</hi> being there later, than the time he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt,
it would have been to his Confuſion, not only in that point,
but in all things elſe for the future. Nor were many leſs ſurpris'd
with Mr. <hi>Hartcourt's</hi> Anſwer to <hi>Dugdale;</hi> for though he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
he had written<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 27.</note> ſeveral Letters to Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> directed to him,
yet he affirm'd he had left off correſponding divers Years; for <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
you muſt know, that about <hi>Three</hi> Years ago, he was from <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator
of the Province</hi> (which keeps a general and frequent correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency
with all the principal Members) made <hi>Rector</hi> of <hi>London.</hi>
Now <hi>Dugdale</hi> to prove Mr. <hi>Hartcourt's</hi> later correſpondency with
him, to wit, with <hi>Evers;</hi> for <hi>Prieſts</hi> have generally their Letters
directed to others, ſo that Mr. <hi>Hartcourt</hi> never took notice at <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi>
mentioning the receipt of Letters from him; I ſay <hi>Dugdale,</hi>
to prove a later correſpondence, urges this wild and unheard of
Circumſtance:<note n="*" place="margin">

<hi>two of them made mention of Mr.</hi> Edward Aſtons <hi>Death at</hi> Paris,
<hi>which</hi> Dugdale <hi>intercepting, pretended to Conjure, by telling the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,

Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>chid Mr.</hi> Hartcourt, <hi>for not acquainting him ſooner; who
reply'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had ſent him word of it;</hi> and yet it ſeems Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> were ſo far from queſtioning <hi>Dugdale</hi> about
this ſilly <hi>Interception and Treachery,</hi> that he was a greater Confident than
ever, <hi>as choſen to Murther his Majeſty himſelf.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hartcourt</hi> alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhew'd, how little this fellow had knowledge either of him or his
Letters; for firſt, <hi>He came</hi> (and ſeveral of theſe Witneſſes <hi>Reader,</hi> have
under falſe names ſerved other Priſoners thus) to the <hi>Gate-houſe</hi> to
<hi>entrap him;</hi> and then he (the ſaid <hi>Dugdale)</hi> did not ſo much as know his
hand before the <hi>Committee, when they made him write there for a
tryal;</hi> to which the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> reply'd, that <hi>Hartcourt</hi> might write
more hands, as well as have more names than one: but people thought
there could then be no cheat in that, ſince the many papers which
had been taken from <hi>Hartcourt,</hi> would preſently have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
But above all, how incredible is it, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> (who was ſo

after ſomething was brought in,<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 36.</note> which <hi>Chief Juſtice North</hi> took and
look't upon, but no further words were made of it; and without
any manner of doubt, 'twas a Paper of his own making; <hi>for we

            </p>
            <p>As for the two <hi>Letters</hi> produc'd againſt the Priſoners, and firſt as
to that from Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> it was Anſwered by Mr. <hi>Hartcourt,</hi> Mr. <hi>White,</hi>
and the reſt,<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 37.</note> that it was a Summons to their <hi>Triennial Congregation;</hi>
there being a meeting of the <hi>Society</hi> every <hi>Three</hi> Years in <hi>France,
Spain, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. as all the World knows. That the <hi>Secreſy</hi>
enjoyn'd was neceſſary; for ſince every body's eye was upon them,
they ought to be cautious of appearing in ſuch numbers as might
give offence, and eſpecially at a time, when the <hi>Parliament</hi> was
meeting. That as to the word<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Deſign</hi> (which the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> did
ſo much inſiſt upon) it was a hard thing to bring mens lives into
danger upon the meer nicety of a Word, and eſpecially when it
was proper in it ſelf, for they had a <hi>Deſign</hi> to chooſe a <hi>Procurator</hi>
for <hi>Rome,</hi> and to conſult about the whole Concern of the <hi>Engliſh
Jeſuits.</hi> Now as to the<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Roman</hi> Letter of <hi>February</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> Mr.
<hi>White</hi> Anſwer'd, That the <hi>Patents</hi> there mentioned were the <hi>Literae
Patentes,</hi> that conſtituted him (on the <hi>Fourteenth</hi> of the preceding
<hi>January) Provincial,</hi> That the expreſſion (though in the <hi>Plural)</hi>
was genuine and applicaple to any ſingle man; nor did Mr. <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
the Writer, know at the ſending of them, whether he the ſaid
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98466:15"/>
Mr. <hi>White</hi> would accept the <hi>Office</hi> or no; which Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> much
doubting of, (as being a too ſelf-denying Action for a <hi>Jeſuit) Oates</hi>
preſently affirm'd, <hi>That He was bound on pain of Damnation, not to
diſobey his ſuperior, and if he chooſe him or others to a place, they muſt
take it upon them;</hi> and yet every body knows (that knows any thing)
that nothing is more frequent, than for a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in theſe Caſes to

            <p>After this, the Priſoners call'd for Witneſſes to prove Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
Abſence out of <hi>London, from the</hi> 3d. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt <hi>to the</hi> 14th. <hi>of</hi>

that there were two Mrs. <hi>Giffords</hi> Witneſſes in this Affair, which
confounds the <hi>Reader</hi> at the firſt ſight, when he peruſes the <hi>Printed

ſight of God declare, that I never did learn, or teach, or believe,
nor can as a Catholick believe, that it is lawful upon any occaſion
or pretence whatſoever, to deſign or contrive the Death of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
or any hurt to his Perſon; but on the contrary, all are bound
to obey, defend, and preſerve his Sacred Perſon, to the utmoſt of
their power. And I do moreover declare, that this is the true and
plain ſence of my Soul, in the ſight of him who knows the Secrets
of my Heart, and as I hope to ſee his bleſſed Face, without any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation,
or mental Reſervation. This is all I have to ſay concerning
the matter of my Condemnation; that which remains for me now
to do, is to recommend my Soul into the hands of my bleſſed
Redeemer, by whoſe only Merit and Paſſion I hope for Salvation.</p>

               <p>BEing now, good People, very near my End, and ſummon'd by a
violent Death to appear before God's Tribunal, there to render
an account of all my thoughts, words, and actions, before a juſt Judge,
I conceive I am bound in Conſcience to do my ſelf that Juſtice, as to
declare upon Oath my Innocence from the horrid Crime of Treaſon,
with which I am falſely accuſed: And I eſteem it a Duty I owe to
Chriſtian Charity, to publiſh to the World before my death, all that I
know in this point, concerning thoſe Catholicks I have converſed with
ſince the firſt noiſe of the Plot, deſiring from the bottom of my
heart, that the whole Truth may appear, that Innocence may be clear'd,
to the great Glory of God, and the Peace and Welfare of the King
and Country. As to my ſelf, I call God to VVitneſs, that I
was never in my whole life preſent at any Conſult or Meeting of
the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> where any Oath of Secrecy was taken, or the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a Bond of ſecreſy, either by me or any one of them, to
conceal any Plot againſt His Sacred Majeſty; nor was I ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at any Meeting or Conſult of theirs, where any propoſal was
made, or Reſolve taken or ſigned, either by me or any of them,
for taking away the Life of our dread Soveraign; an impiety of ſuch a
nature, that had I been preſent at any ſuch Meeting, I ſhould have been
bound by the Laws of God, and by the Principles of my Religion,
(and by God's Grace would have acted accordingly) to have dicove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſuch a deviliſh Treaſon to the civil Magiſtrate, to the end they
might have been brought to condign puniſhment. I was ſo far,
good people, from being in <hi>September</hi> laſt at a Conſult of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
at <hi>Tixall,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Ewer</hi>'s Chamber, that I vow to God, as I hope
for Salvation, I never was ſo much as once that year at <hi>Tixall,</hi>
my Lord <hi>Aſtons</hi> Houſe. 'Tis true, I was at the Congregation of the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> held on the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> was twelve month, but in that
meeting, as I hope to be ſaved, we meddled not with State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
but only treated about the Concerns of our Province, which

               <p>I am, good People, as free from the Treaſon I am accuſed of, as
the Child that is unborn, and being innocent I never accuſed my ſelf
in Confeſſion of any thing that I am charged with, Certainly, if I
had been conſcious to my ſelf of any Guilt in this kind, I ſhould
not ſo franckly and freely, as I did, of my own accord, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
my ſelf before the Kings Moſt Honourable Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
As for thoſe Catholicks which I have converſed with ſince the

that I never heard any one of them, either Prieſt or Layman, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

               <p>DEarly beloved Countrey-men, I am come to the laſt Scene of
Mortality, to the hour of my Death, an hour which is the
Horizon between Time and Eternity, an hour which muſt either
make me a Star to ſhine for ever in heaven above, or a Firebrand
to burn everlaſtingly amongſt the damned Souls in Hell below; an
hour in which if I deal ſincerely, and with a hearty ſorrow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my Crimes, I may hope for mercy; but if I falſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
them, I muſt expect nothing but Eternal Damnation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what I ſhall ſay in this great Hour, I hope you will believe. And
now in this hour I do ſolemnly ſwear, proteſt, and vow, by all
that is Sacred in Heaven and on Earth, and as I hope to ſee the
Face of God in Glory, that I am as innocent as the Child unborn
of thoſe Treaſonable Crimes, which <hi>Mr. Oates,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi>
have Sworn againſt me in my Trial; and for which, Sentence of
Death was pronounced againſt me the day after my Trial. And
that you may be aſſured that what I ſay is true, I do in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
proteſt, vow, and ſwear, as I hope to ſee the Face of God in
Glory, that I do not in what I ſay unto you, make uſe of any
Equivocation, or mental Reſervation, or material Prolation, or
any ſuch like way to palliate Truth. Neither do I make uſe of any
Diſpenſations from the Pope, or any body elſe; or of any Oath of
Secreſy, or any Abſolutions in Confeſion or out of Confeſſion to
deny the Truth; but I ſpeak in the plain ſence which the words
bear; and if I do ſpeak in any other ſence, to palliate or hide the
truth, I wiſh with all my Soul that God may exclude me from his
Heavenly Glory, and condemn me to the loweſt place of Hell Fire:
and ſo much to that point.</p>
               <p>And now dear Country-men, in the ſecond place, I do confeſs
and own to the whole World, that I am a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi>
and a Prieſt, and one of that ſort of Prieſts called <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and
now becauſe they are ſo falſly charged for holding King-killing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98466:20"/>
Doctrine, I think it my duty to proteſt to you with my laſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words, that neither I in particular, nor the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in general, hold
any ſuch opinion, but utterly abhor and deteſt it: and I aſſure
you, that amongſt the vaſt number of Authors, which among the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> have Printed Philoſophy, Divinity, Caſes, or Sermons, there
is not one to the beſt of my knowledge, that allows of King kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Doctrine, or holds this poſition, That it is lawful for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſon to kill a King although an Heretick, although a Pagan,
although a Tyrant: there is, I ſay, not one <hi>Jeſuit</hi> that holds this,
except <hi>Mariana,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuit, and he defends it not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but only problematically, for which his Book was called in, and
that opinion expunged and cenſured. Aud is it not a ſad thing,
that for the raſhneſs of one ſingle Man, whilſt the reſt cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and hold the contrary, that a whole Religious Order
ſhould be ſentenc'd? But I have not time to diſcuſs this point at
large, and therefore I refer you all to a Royal Author, I mean the
wiſe and victorious King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> the Royal
Grandfather of our preſent gracious King, in a publick Oration which
he pronounced, in defence of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> amongſt other things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that he was very well ſatisfied with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Doctrine
concerning Kings, as being conformable to the beſt Doctors in the
Church. But why do I relate the teſtimony of one ſingle Prince,
when the whole Catholick World is the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Advocate therein?
Does not <hi>Germany, France, Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> truſt the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their Youth to them in a very great meaſure? Do not they
truſt their own Souls to be governed by them, in the adminiſtration of
the Sacraments. And can you imagin ſo many great Kings and
Princes, and ſo many wiſe States ſhould do, or permit this to be
done in their Kingdoms, if the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were men of ſuch damnable
principles as they are now taken for in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, dear Countrey-men, I do proteſt, that as I
never in my life did machine, or contrive either the depoſition or
death of the King, ſo now at my death, I do hartily deſire of God
to grant him a quiet and happy Reign upon Earth, and an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Crown in Heaven. For the Judges alſo, and the Jury, and
all thoſe that were any ways concern'd, either in my Tryal, Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
or Condemnation, I do humbly beg of God, to grant
them both Temporal and Eternal happineſs. And as for Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> I call God to witneſs, they by falſe Oaths have
brought me to this untimely end. I hartily forgive them, becauſe
God commands me ſo to do; and I beg God for his infinite Mercy
to grant them true Sorrow and Repentance in this World, that
they may be capable of Eternal happineſs in the next. And having
diſcharged my Duty towards my ſelf, and my own Innocence; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my Order, and its Doctrine; to my Neighbour and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98466:21"/>
World, I have nothing elſe to do now, my great God, but to caſt
my ſelf into the Arms of your Mercy. I believe you are One
Divine Eſſence and Three Divine Perſons, I believe that you in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Perſon of the Trinity became Man to redeem me; and I
believe you are an Eternal Rewarder of the Good, and an Eternal
Chaſtiſer of the Bad. In ſine, I belive all you have reveal'd for
your own infinite Veracity; I hope in you above all things, for
your infinite Fidelity; and I love you above all things, for your
infinte Beauty and Goodneſs; and I am heartily ſorry that ever I
offended ſo great a God with my whole heart: I am contented to
undergo an ignominious Deth for the love of you, my dear Jeſu,
ſeeing you have been pleaſed to undergo an ignominious Death
for the Love of me.</p>

had ſaid againſt him at another Tryal; which was thought very hard
After this, came the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the <hi>White-Horſe,</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> alſo,
<note n="†" place="margin">pag. 46.</note> who ſaid ſhe had kept that <hi>Tavern Seven</hi> Years, that ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> before. That it was a ſmall inconſiderable Houſe,
that there was no room would hold above a dozen, and that ſhe
remembers not ſo great a company at one time, <hi>unleſs at a Pariſh</hi>
Jury,<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 47.</note> who were divided into three  rooms: Now <hi>Oates</hi> fearing much
this Witneſs at firſt inſiſted on his priviledge of not anſwering to any
queſtion relating to a former <hi>Tryal,</hi> and therefore would not tell
the <hi>Priſoner</hi> how many <hi>Jeſuits</hi> met here; but the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
him to ſpeak<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 46.</note> he anſwer'd at laſt, <hi>about Eighteen</hi> or <hi>Twenty</hi>
(and not <hi>Fifty</hi> Reader, as formerly) <hi>and that theſe were alſo, in two or
three ſeveral rooms;</hi> which not a few deem'd non-ſenſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Nature of a <hi>Conſult;</hi> for that requires that the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
ſhould be together; and beſides the <hi>Meeting</hi> according to this rate
comes but to about three <hi>Clubs</hi> or <hi>Colloquies</hi> (as he calls them) which were
ſtill kept (according to his uſual ſtory) in other places, the general
<hi>Randezvous</hi> being only here. But <hi>Oates</hi> was ſoon comforted; for
upon the womans Evidence there ſtood up one that atteſted, that
there were Rooms there, that would hold <hi>Thirty;</hi> and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he was at a Wedding there, where Dined above <hi>Twenty,</hi>
and ſo ſhe made her <hi>Exit</hi> like the reſt, and retir'd. But this ended not
thus; for after the <hi>Tryal,</hi> ſeveral went to view this ſo much talkt
of <hi>Tavern,</hi> and though it's back part be rebuilt ſince <hi>April</hi> 78.
yet the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> famous Room ſtill remains, being <hi>about four Yards

and a half ſquare,</hi> and conſequently not able with any convenience
to contain above a dozen; no wonder therefore, if people can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

why they ſhould chooſe the pooreſt <hi>Tavern</hi> in all <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
and where every extraordinary company, muſt neceſſarily
be taken notice of; I ſay people cannot comprehend this, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they that knew Mr. <hi>White's,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hartcourt's,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> being found Guilty, was Condemned with the five

or ſpeak any thing which I know to be untrue; or to commit any

in the Power of any Prieſt, or of the Pope, or of God himſelf,

And Almighty God, who is perfect Truth, cannot give me a Licenſe
to commit a ſin againſt his own Eſſence.</p>
               <p>And I do ſolemnly in the preſence of God, Profeſs, Teſtify and
Declare, That as I hope for Salvation, and expect any benefit by the
Blood and Paſſion of my deareſt Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, I do make
this Declaration and Proteſtation and every part thereof in the Plain
and Ordinary Senſe, wherein the ſame ſtands Written, as they are
commonly underſtood by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants and the Courts of
Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> without any Evaſion, or Equivocation, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
or Mental Reſervation whatſoever. And without any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
or Pardon, or Abſolution already granted to me, for this
or any other purpoſe by the Pope or any other Power, Authority
or Perſon whatſoever, Or, without any hope, expectation or deſire
of any ſuch Diſpenſation; and without thinking or believing that
I am or can be acquitted before God or Man, or abſolved of this
Declaration or any part thereof, although the Pope or any other
Perſon or perſons, or Power or Authority whatſoever ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence
with, Or take upon him or them to diſpence with, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
the ſame, Or declare that it was, or is, or ought to be Null
or Void in part, or in the whole, from the beginning, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
howſoever.</p>
               <p>Having made this Declaration and Proteſtation in the moſt plain
Terms that I can poſſibly imagin to expreſs my ſincere Loyalty and
Innocency, and the clear intention of my Soul, I leave it to the
Judgment of all Good and Charitable perſons whether they will
believe what is here in this manner affirmed and ſworn by me in my
preſent Circumſtances, or what is ſworn by my Accuſers.</p>
               <p>I do now farther declare, That I die a member (though an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
one) of that Holy Catholick and Apoſtolick Church of
Chriſt, mentioned in the Three Holy and publick Creeds of which
Church our Lord Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt is the Inviſible Head of Influence,
to illuminate, guide, protect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and govern it by his Holy Spirit and
Grace, and of which Church, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Succeſſor
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, is the viſible Head of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Unity.</p>
               <p>I take it to be clear, That my Religion is the ſole cauſe, which
moved my Accuſers to charge me with the Crime, for which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Evidence I am adjudged to die, and that my being of that
Religion, which I here proſeſs, was the only ground which could
give them any hope to be believed, or which could move my Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I have had not only a Pardon, but alſo great Advantages, as to
preferments and Eſtates offered unto me, ſince this Judgment was
againſt me, in caſe I would have forſaken my Religion, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf guilty of the Crime charged againſt me, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the ſame Crimes upon others: But bleſſed be my God, who
by his Grace hath preſerved me from yeilding to thoſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſtrengthened me rather to chooſe this death, than to ſtain
my Soul with ſin, and to charge others, againſt truth, with Crimes,
of which I do not know that any perſon is guilty.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid what concerns me to ſay as to my ſelf, I now humbly
beſeech God to bleſs the Kings Majeſty with all temporal and eternal
Bleſſings, and to preſerve Him and His Government from all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Traitors whatſoever, and that his Majeſty may never fall
into ſuch hands, as His Royal Father of Glorious Memory fell

               <p>I alſo humbly beſeeh thee (O God) to give true Repentance and
Pardon to all my Enemies, and moſt particularly to the ſaid
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and to all who have been any ways
acceſſary to the taking away of my Life, and the ſhedding of my
Innocent Blood, or to the preventing the King's Mercy from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extended unto me; and likewiſe to all thoſe who rejoyced at
the Judgment given againſt me, or at the Execution of the ſaid
Judgment; and to all thoſe who are or ſhall be ſo unchriſtianly
uncharitable, as to disbelieve, and to refuſe to give credit unto my
now Proteſtations.</p>
               <p>And I beſeech thee (O my God) to bleſs this whole Nation, and
not to lay the guilt of my Blood unto the charge of this Nation,
or of any other particular perſon or perſons of this Nation. Unite
all (O my God) unto thee and thy Church, by true Faith, Hope,
and Charity, for thy mercies ſake.</p>
               <p>And for all thoſe who have ſhewed Charity to me, I humbly
beg (O my Jeſus) that thou wilt reward them with all Bleſſings
both temporal and eternal.</p>

               <hi>Narrative,</hi> where he declares, that all that He lays

<hi>for 'tis all he can tell, as he hopes for the forgiveneſs of his ſins,

in the leaſt, <hi>the damnable Doctrine of, Depoſing Kings,</hi> which made
him have no ill opinion then of the Expreſſions. One Circumſtance
(he ſays) there is more, which has (conſidering the times) an ill
ſound with it,<note n="‖" place="margin">Nar. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>and then he will have clear'd his Soul;</hi> The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
is, That Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaid 'Twice or Thrice at their parting, <hi>that
he had ſome buſineſs to Communicate to him,</hi> but when he urg'd him
to tell it, he anſwer'd, he would take ſome other occaſion to do it,
<hi>but never did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, is ſeen, what this Witneſs has ſaid, or can credibly ſay as
to this buſineſs; for he that in a <hi>Letter</hi> or otherwiſe, will with <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98466:30"/>
and Oaths</hi> declare, <hi>he has no more to ſay to a thing,</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any further Evidence as much a perjur'd man in Conſcience,
(and conſequently as little to be believed) as he that deviating
from his <hi>Recorded Deſpoſitions</hi> in a Court of Judicature, has been
therefore puniſh'd with his Ears as the Law orders and awards.
Now that you may alſo know what this perſon is, I muſt tell you
his Father is a Gentleman in <hi>Durham</hi> of about 500 a year at moſt;
he is the Eldeſt Son as to the Eſtate, in caſe his <hi>Brother Thomas</hi> (who
they ſay is a <hi>Prieſt)</hi> turns not <hi>Proteſtant</hi> after his Example; ſo that
his Temporal Gain depends wholly on the Spiritual loſs, and Popiſh
blindneſs of the other; who (by the way) is reputed a very notable
and quick ſighted Scholar in all learning, and yet is as unfit a man,
(I'le aſſure you) for a <hi>Plot</hi> of this nature, as ever was; and truely
ſo moſt of the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> have been. His <hi>Father</hi> ſent the aforeſaid
<hi>Robert</hi> a while agoe (with a ſmall Allowance) to <hi>Greys Inn</hi> to ſtudy
the Law, but inſtead of it, he has learn'd to run in Debt, and is a
Proficient to that Degree (as all that know him can teſtifie), that
no body would longer truſt him, and therefore was forc'd to pawn
all the little Neceſſaries he had. Beſides he has had a <hi>Mother in
Law,</hi> by whom his Father has a very plentifull ſtock of Children,
and Conſequently want's no Heirs; Nay there is a third <hi>Brother,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>daughters</hi> by the firſt <hi>venter,</hi> ſo that conſidering his late life and
other Accidents, neither <hi>Oates</hi> nor <hi>Bedlow</hi> had more need of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
employment and profeſſion than he. As for his knowledge of
the <hi>Plot,</hi> or of Mr. <hi>Ireland's</hi> being here, take this ſhort Account;
That at <hi>Eaſter</hi> laſt, (the <hi>Lords</hi> providing for their <hi>Tryal)</hi> ſummon'd
by an order of the Houſe ſeveral perſons of quality out of <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>

often viſited, and ſhow'd them alſo <hi>Letters</hi> newly received from his
Brother <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>New-Gate,</hi> which mention'd ſeveral Witneſſes
that could prove him in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and elſe where in the Countrey,
<hi>whilſt Oates in his Narrative ſays he was at Conſults here in London:</hi>
nor did Mr. <hi>Robert</hi> fail of railing at the ſaid <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and
the reſt of the Cabal for their Villainy; and was ſo far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
then, <hi>That</hi> Mr. <hi>Ireland was in Town on the</hi> 19th <hi>of</hi> Auguſt,
that he knew his ſaid Relations were come purpoſely to prove him
with them that very day; Nay (on the 13 of <hi>June,</hi> or the <hi>Jeſuits Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al)</hi>
He came to the three <hi>Cranes</hi> among the Crow'd of Witneſſes,
and even Uſher'd into Court his young <hi>Couſin Harwell</hi> to that

<hi>the time he returned to Tixhal.</hi> Let the world therefore judge,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98466:30"/>
what a Witneſs he is; and moreover it can, and ſhall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by two and Twenty perſons (many of them of quality, and
many alſo <hi>Proteſtants) that</hi> Mr. <hi>Ireland was on the ſaid</hi> 19th <hi>with his

<hi>Sarah Paine,</hi> who pitch't (as you have ſeen) on the 12 of this Month,

            <p>Here it was, that the <hi>King's Council</hi> admoniſh'd the Priſoners,

at the firſt onſet with the moſt Stupendious Circumſtance that ever

<hi>St Omers</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> order'd him to go to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and
ſending him a <hi>Letter of Phyſical Inſtructions</hi> how to govern himſelf
(viz <hi>to take a Pint of Milk every Morning, and as much at night,
and</hi> 100 <hi>ſtroakes of the Pump)</hi> He (the ſaid Sir <hi>George)</hi> mention'd

               <hi>but that the Queen would alſo
aſſiſt him in it.</hi> Then he proceed's ſaying, that he knew this to be
Sir <hi>George's</hi> hand by another Letter a day or two after, which could
not be but his, for Sir <hi>George</hi> had it before him in a Writing poſture,
and he ſaw him put by the Pen, and found the Ink not yet dry, nor
was there any body elſe to write, Mr. <hi>Aſhby</hi> being Lame. That
<hi>Oates</hi> heard <hi>Aſhby</hi> talk to him of the <hi>Commiſſion he had received of
being Phyſitian to the Army;</hi> That preſently there came one Sir
<hi>Richard</hi> or Sir <hi>Robert</hi> (a brisk man, about 45 years old) to call Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Keines, Langworth, Fenwick, Hartcourt,</hi> and another to wait on
<hi>her Majeſty</hi> at <hi>Somerſethouſe;</hi> That <hi>Oates</hi> accompany'd them, and
ſtaying in the <hi>Anti-Chamber</hi> whilſt they went into her <hi>Room,</hi> he
heard a Woman, (after expreſſing much zeal for her Religion
and the violation of her Bed) ſay, <hi>That ſhe would aſſiſt</hi> Sir <hi>George in
poyſoning the King;</hi> That when the <hi>Fathers</hi> came out, He <hi>(Oates)</hi>
deſir'd to ſee the <hi>Queen, who gave him a gracious Smile,</hi> and ſpoke
to Mr. <hi>Hartcourt</hi> in the former voice about 1000<hi>l.</hi> nor did he ſee
there any other Woman; and <hi>Reader</hi> you may eaſily imagine how
ridiculous this ſtuff ſeem'd to every body; That a <hi>Lady</hi> eminent in
vertue, ſhould not only make ſuch a declaration in a <hi>publick Conſult,</hi> (for
the reſolves of all Conſults are known at one time or other) but alſo in
the hearing of ſuch a pittiful Wretch as <hi>Oates,</hi> who could help neither her
nor any body elſe in any part of the <hi>Plot</hi> more than the firſt <hi>Kennel raker</hi>

               <hi>Harangue</hi> ſo pathetical,
weighty, and moving, <hi>concerning the death of the former priſoners, and
their preſent Caſe,</hi> that it affected the whole Aſſembly; but it being
thought at laſt reflecting, the C. <hi>Juſtice</hi> gave him a Reprimand, and
then ſumming up the whole Evidence he told the <hi>Jury</hi> in ſhort,
<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 83.</note> 
               <hi>That if they were ſatisfyd that Oates and Bedlo ſwore true, they would
do well to find them Guilty; if otherwiſe to acquit them; for they ought

The <hi>Jury</hi> then went out, reſolving at the very firſt not to condemn
them; but two or three being Timorous propos'd this expedient <hi>viz:
to find it miſpriſion,</hi> which they thought might ſatisfy the Clamorous,
and yet be no ſuch great inconvenience to the priſoners, eſpecially ſince
the <hi>King</hi>'s merciful Temper was known to every body. But the Court

they preſently brought them in, <hi>Not Guilty;</hi> for <hi>Prance</hi>

<hi>Bedlo</hi>'s Impudent perjury, by his new and ſecond evidenced) was

of them, (and in <hi>England</hi> we know there are many) can aſſure it

our Tranſcendent <hi>Loyalty</hi> and ſervice to the <hi>Crown (which two
of our great</hi> Monarchs <hi>have amply own'd)</hi> there was a time when
<hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was as much hated as <hi>Popery,</hi> and a time too, when <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>

and Chances of time are ineffable: <hi>And therefore, let him that
thinketh that he ſtands, take heed leaſt he falls;</hi> nor is the Caution
unneceſſary, when we conſider the Precipice on which every good

Fallacious without doubt is the World in general, but moſt
fallacious are ſuch particular ſervants; yet how unconceivable is it,
that theſe ſhould impoſe or put the Dice on any man, ſince their
abandond and proſtituted Reputation was like a <hi>ſmoke</hi> by day,

Teſtimony of ten Travellers, though of ſome ordinary Credit,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98466:35"/>
               <hi>That the grand SEIGNIOR did not ſend the VISIER here to Kill
this Knight;</hi> becauſe, <hi>his Death being of no import to him,</hi> he would
never order ſo vain a thing; and certainly the confirmation of it
would be yet greater, <hi>were the Witneſſes of different ſtories among
themſelves?</hi> If then <hi>(my Lords and Gentlemen)</hi> this be enough to
ſhow the falſity of ſuch an Evidence, we have it in our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
and infinitely more, which demonſtrates the unſpeakable wrong,
that has been done us, or rather the poor nation in general. For
does not every body know, that Sir <hi>Edmund-bury-Godfrey</hi> was ſo
far from being our Enemy, that he was a <hi>friend</hi> to all, <hi>a moſt kind
one</hi> to many, and in this affair, ſo <hi>extraordinary</hi> and particular, <hi>That
he no ſooner receiv'd</hi> Oates <hi>his Depoſitions, but he preſently acquainted
Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>with them, who went to</hi> Windſor <hi>and divulg'd the whole
matter to all he knew.</hi> If no <hi>Turk</hi> then can be thought (with Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
and in cool blood) to kill another, that has neither done
him harm, nor can bring him the leaſt Emolument by his Death,
what Chriſtians can be imagin'd ſo nonſenſically ſtupid, as to lay their
heads together, in relation to the Murther of a Perſon, who was
ſo far even from accidentally provoking, that he had perform'd the
utmoſt ſervice on our Behalf, that Friendſhip it ſelf could ſuggeſt?
But how unconceiveable is it now, that there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and <hi>Rabble of Conſpirators,</hi> and that they ſhould execute this
Deſign, when not only his <hi>Death</hi> would <hi>(in the Judgment of any
Fool)</hi> infallibly ruin us all, if known, but when his <hi>Life</hi> alſo was
ſo infinitely uſeful to us? For he was able, and he had alſo courage
to confront <hi>Oates,</hi> and conſequently to Witneſs how impudently,
and beyond all meaſure he had now deviated from his former <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No wonder then, that the Wits of our Enemies every where
have been on the Rack to find pretences for this <hi>Murther;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

when as in the firſt place his Kindneſs to us was (as I have already

an Innocence, which was never queſtion'd or blaſted, but by
the now Teſtimony of <hi>four</hi> Execrable Perſons, who did not urge
the leaſt circumſtance, matter or thing againſt them, that depends
not wholly on their bare Word and Credit. Nay was there ever
Imputation more weak and ſilly than this, <hi>that the Expreſſion in

which our weak Enemies deem ſo ſtrong, and pertinent to

who being condemn'd (they ſay) in his Countrey for <hi>Burglary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
it with great Aſſeverations at his Execution;</hi>

the Fact,</hi> and then (in ſpight of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> great Interceſſion)
was again hanged by the <hi>Judge's</hi> ſpecial Order and Command. The
next is of the before mention'd <hi>Treſham, who proteſted,</hi> (as they will have
it) <hi>in writing upon his Salvation, and this juſt before his death, That
he had not ſeen Garnet in</hi> 16 <hi>years,</hi> whereas <hi>Garnet</hi> and Mrs <hi>Vaux</hi>
did both confeſs, that they had been often ſince that time together. As
to <hi>Curphy</hi> then (though truly I know not why any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,

give me leave to ask firſt, how our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> can think
this ſo Nicking a Blow? for ſince they themſelves muſt acknowledge
him already to have been an impudent <hi>Lyar</hi> and an <hi>ill man,</hi> why may
it not be as <hi>poſſible,</hi> nay as <hi>probable</hi> alſo (and then how is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
convincing) <hi>that ſeeing he could not ſave his Life by aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH, he now hop'd to work on the Judge, by attacking him

as to the number of years in queſtion. But <hi>(my Lords and Gent)</hi> if
both the <hi>Examples</hi> were as our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> would have them, what
Reſemblance or Analogy has the Action (I beſeech you) of a <hi>ſingle
man</hi> once in a Century to <hi>Twelve</hi> that dyed together, who were
not only free from the leaſt matter or Circumſtance, that could make
them ſuſpected, beſides the Teſtimony of moſt nefarious Perſons,
<hi>but had alſo LIFE add PREFERMENT offer'd them upon their
bare CONFESSION.</hi> Beſides do they that thus charge us think
their <hi>Religion</hi> ſo harmleſs, or us ſo ignorant, that we can ſhow no
<hi>Precedents</hi> againſt them of this nature? <hi>Certainly we can, and</hi> (as I
ſuppoſe) <hi>much more to the purpoſe, Nay witneſt alſo by Proteſtants
themſelves.</hi> For does not firſt that moſt learned <hi>New-Gate-Divine</hi>
declare in the before mention'd<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 30.</note> Treatiſe, <hi>That in his late Experience
(as Ordinary there) he knew ſome Malefactors condemn'd for Murther

their Integrity, although they had twice or thrice confeſt to him,
with ſome ſeeming remorſe, that theywere juſtly condemn'd for the ſaid Crimes;</hi>
ſo that here <hi>Reader</hi> we have not only <hi>Proteſtant Penitents deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth at their death,</hi> but a <hi>Proteſtant Confeſſarius revealing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets;</hi>
and ſuch another, or one at leaſt very like him, <hi>Hind</hi> (the
famous <hi>Robber)</hi> met with at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> being there convicted and
hang'd by the evidence of his ſpiritual Guide. But what do you
think of a far more eminent Example, to wit that of my <hi>Lord Caſtle
haven,</hi> who (as all the Writers of <hi>King Charles</hi>'s <hi>Reign</hi> will tell you)
was after a Netorious ill life Charg'd and condemn'd at laſt, <hi>for
proſtituting his Daughter in Law; for holding his own Wife whilſt his
ſervant forc'd her; and laſtly for Sodomy it ſelf;</hi> and yet though theſe
<hi>Crimes</hi> were proved by ſeveral plain Circumſtances, by his wife and
daughters Teſtimony, and laſtly by <hi>Brodway</hi> and <hi>Patrick,</hi> his abus'd
Patizans (who were both hang'd for the facts, and own'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of them to the laſt) <hi>he at his Execution moſt ſolemnly deny'd
all,</hi> dying (as<note n="*" place="margin">K. I. p. 160.</note>

our ſelves, but that the <hi>Proteſtant Doctrine</hi> is guilty of it,
if the Actions of ſome few men are ſufficient to determine and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge

which was but three or four days, as he ſwore in his Narrative

            </p>
            <p>And ſince I have mention'd this <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Dignity,</hi> it is truly ſo
prodigiouſly odd and ſimple, that I cannot paſs it by, without ſome
few Reflexions: For if he were thus graduated, <hi>it was either out of

Affairs, Or upon the ſcore of his Learning.</hi> As for the firſt, Can any
one believe, (if there had been a <hi>Plot,</hi> and he employ'd it) that he
would have been ſuffer'd, in the midſt of his Negotiation and Buſineſs,
to go out of his way, not only to loſe time on ſo fooliſh an Errand,
but to render himſelf ſuſpected by ſo unuſual a Grace? Nor could
he himſelf hope to make any Advantage by a Dignity, ſince it was
to be conceal'd (you may be ſure) 'till after the Succeſs of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful

               <hi>to his Majeſty.</hi> On the other ſide, If we conſider the various Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and the Number of Perſons concern'd, 'twas impoſſible for him,
and Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> to digeſt and methodize the Whole under a <hi>Moneths</hi>
time; ſo that we may ſuppoſe it to be begun about the XII. of
<hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LY:</hi> Nor can we allow leſs than a <hi>Fortnight</hi> between his firſt <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi>
about the <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> and his falling to work on the ſaid <hi>Narrative;</hi>
ſo that his Head was full of it, and conſequently more <hi>particularly nice
and obſerving,</hi> from the End of <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NE</hi> at leaſt, and eſpecially in
<hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LY, A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST,</hi> and <hi>SEPTEMBER;</hi> For then <hi>Proteſtants</hi> knew
of the <hi>Treaſor</hi> as well as himſelf. But now, when he comes to be preſt
about <hi>Time, Circumſtances, Papers,</hi> and the like, in relation to what he
urges againſt the Priſoners, He is ſo far (though the Matter happens
within the ſaid <hi>Moneths)</hi> from producing any one <hi>Note,</hi> (as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he might have done, had his <hi>Charge</hi> been true) that he will come
to no <hi>poſitive Day,</hi> when the Accuſed at the <hi>Bar</hi> require it of him;
and yet in his Flouriſhes, throughout his ſaid <hi>Narrative,</hi> he is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,

come to no <hi>poſitive Day:</hi> And thus he has notoriouſly done in every
<hi>Trial.</hi> For, in Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s, he ſhuffles you ſee, about the 21<hi>th.
of Auguſt,</hi> as ſoon as he perceiv'd, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

about the time of his being in Town that Moneth.</hi> As for the
<hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s <hi>Trial,</hi> he abſolutely Hang'd (you ſee) Mr. <hi>Gavan,</hi> by not ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as he firſt Accus'd him) to the <hi>Latter End of July, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Auguſt,</hi> when he underſtood, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi>
could prove himſelf then at <hi>Hampton.</hi> And here alſo he would fain
have gotten off (you ſee) from the 2<hi>d. of</hi> September, <hi>the Day po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
he pretended to have received Twenty Shillings from</hi> Ireland <hi>in</hi>
London. In Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s, (beſides other Particulars) he was not
certain, (though on ſo remarkable an occaſion, and ſo little a while
ago) <hi>Whether he came from</hi> Dover <hi>by Coach, or on Horſe-back.</hi> And
in the <hi>Laſt Trial,</hi> he had not only the Impudence to tell Mr. <hi>Marſh,</hi>
(when the Diſpute was about a Day in <hi>Auguſt) That it was a great
priviledge, that he nam'd the Month;</hi> but flew alſo (as I ſhew'd
you) from the <hi>Fifteenth,</hi> (though he once granted it) as ſoon as
he began to ſuſpect that there would be Counter-Witneſſes. Is not
this then (as I ſaid) <hi>a clear Demonſtration of their VILLAINY, and
LYING all along?</hi> for was it poſſible for him, who had now Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
all to the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, and was to make it good at a <hi>Bar,</hi>
to go afterwards to <hi>Conſults</hi> with the <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> and not know
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98466:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Time preciſely; and to ſee and peruſe ſeveral of their <hi>Papers</hi>
and <hi>Letters,</hi> without being able to produce the leaſt <hi>Scrip</hi> or <hi>Scroll,</hi> or
to have any <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> that has not been moſt evidently diſprov'd?
Whenas, on the contrary, notwithſtanding the ſtrict <hi>Searches,</hi> that
have been made in all our <hi>Houſes,</hi> and the <hi>Reading of our ſecret Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and notwithſtanding our <hi>Examinations</hi> before <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and our
<hi>Impriſonments</hi> afterwards; and by the way theſe <hi>Wretches</hi> have had
a Sight of every private Writing, by which they came not only to
know our <hi>Hands,</hi> but had oftentimes <hi>Hints,</hi> the better to frame their
Accuſations: I ſay notwithſtanding all theſe Accidents, there has not
been found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any ill <hi>Letter,</hi> any <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> any <hi>Bill of Exchange,</hi> any
<hi>Money,</hi> any <hi>Arms,</hi> any <hi>Horſes,</hi> or any <hi>Thing elſe ſuſpicious;</hi> but to
the Confuſion of our Enemies, an <hi>Innocency,</hi> a <hi>Patience,</hi> and a <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Zeal</hi> beyond Example.</p>
            <p>I have been <hi>(my Lords and Gent:)</hi> the more particular with <hi>Oates</hi>
(though as I ſaid, I have not half done) to the end you might ſee not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how impoſſible it was, <hi>That he ſhould have any knowledge of a Plot, had
there been one; but that his whole Information alſo is a moſt vain Fiction; and
conſequently, if 100 Men (and all of them of ſome repute) ſhould vouch and
juſtify his Fopperies, it could but ſhow us, what Encouragements and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
will do;</hi> For ſince he has moſt evidently <hi>Lyed</hi> all along, how can
their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> make him to have ſpoken Truth? If therefore upon force
you muſt judge thus of all, that ſhall witneſs for him, though their Credit
ſhould be a little Tollerable (of which I'le aſſure you, we have no Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion)
what are we to think of his declared <hi>Coadjutors</hi> and <hi>Partizans,</hi>
who are ſo known, and not one whit behind him in any impudent or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
falſity! As for <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s part, nothing can be a greater proof of
it, than that he ſhould at firſt ſolemnly profeſs to the very <hi>Secretaries</hi> in his
Examination upon Oath, <hi>That he knew nothing of the Plot further than of
Sr.</hi> Edm. Godfreys <hi>Murther.</hi> Beſides when he was askt, <hi>where they laid his
Corps in Somerſet houſe,</hi> he mention'd the Room next to that where the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Albemarle</hi> lay in ſtate; but being caught Tardy there, becauſe it
belong'd to my <hi>Lord Oſſory's Proteſtant Servants,</hi> he went and ſhow'd
them another, in which he was yet more unfortunate, it being the
common place for <hi>Pages</hi> and other <hi>forraign Attendants,</hi> and had to
boot (during the Queens ſtay) <hi>Centinells</hi> ſtill by it. <hi>Prance</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
you ſee (for I muſt be very brief in my Inſtances) acquaints
us of <hi>God</hi> knows how many, <hi>that menton'd the killing the King to
him,</hi> and this (as a trivial matter) even, <hi>whilſt they were buying Spoons,
Candleſticks, and the like.</hi> And to confirm the raiſing an <hi>Army</hi> by
us, he come's to the very number of men it was to conſiſt of, to
wit, <hi>Fifty</hi> Thouſand, and yet there are not ſo many <hi>Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
and <hi>Children</hi> of our Religion in <hi>England;</hi> nor were we to
expect much help from abroad ſeeing the <hi>Kings Navy</hi> was not
only then in a good forwardneſs, but all forraign Princes were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the Eares, and wanted Recruits as they ſtill do, who
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98466:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are in an actual War. But conſidering <hi>Dugdale</hi> is the <hi>Junior</hi> of

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall only add this at preſent to what I
have ſaid<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 57.</note> before, <hi>That he has already demanded a</hi> PENSION <hi>for
his Services;</hi> which ſhews both his plentiful Condition, and his Aim;
I ſay as to <hi>Dugdale,</hi> he is no ill Proficient (I'le aſſure you) in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedures
of this Nature, <hi>Having had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the luck</hi> (as well as the reſt
of the Fraternity) <hi>to be proved in Open Court a Villain;</hi> For at the
laſt <hi>Staffor'd Aſſizes, Mr. Sambige a Proteſtant Gent,</hi> together with
Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> the <hi>Parſon</hi> of the Pariſh, repreſented to the Court,
<hi>That</hi> Dugdal <hi>never mention'd to them the</hi> killing of a Juſtice of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,
<hi>as he depoſes in</hi> Sir George Wakeman's <hi>Trial; and leaſt
ſuch a Teſtimony ſhould endanger the ſpilling of Innocent blood, they
were willing to ſwear to the Truth of this Averment;</hi> nor could this
ill man ſay any thing then to it, only (after ſome days ſearch) he
got two wretched fellows of his Gang, who privately made Oath,
<hi>That Dugdal had told them, the ſaid Deponents that Story;</hi> which
contradicts nothing (had their Depoſitions been true) of what
<hi>Sambige</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philips atteſted</hi> to his Confuſion; and how
