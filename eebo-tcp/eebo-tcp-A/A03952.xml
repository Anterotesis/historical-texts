            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERCVLES to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
and will of IVNO,
busied himselfe to overthrow the
most famous monsters of his
time, his Armes were a bagge
and a club. A most worthie Ladie, and, if I durst
say so, the very IVNO of our Ile hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to destroy some monstruous Diseases,
so that to imitate the most chiualrous Chiftan
of the worlde, I haue armed my selfe with a
boxe for his bagge, and a pipe for his club: a
boxe to conserue my <hi>Tabacco,</hi> and a pipe to
vse it, by those two Godwilling, to ouercome
<pb facs="tcp:4710:4"/>
many maladies. If the hostes of such Diseases
doe not betray my endeuoures to their hating
and hated guests by not vsing or abusing my
weapons. But before I enter in the list, I must
whet as it were my wits with these two points,
First why doe I treat of a matter so often han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
by so many, so odious to Princes, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to sundrie, and so costly to all?</p>
            <p>Secondly why doe I as another CLODIVS
reueale <hi>mysteria bonae Deae,</hi> and prophane the
secrets of Physicke? I answere that a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not the worse to be maintained by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
and <hi>Plus vident oculi quam oculus.</hi>
As concerning the hatred of Princes, one mans
meate is another mans poyson. The wine
prince of liquors hateth vehemently colworts,
and yet beere, aile, sider water, oyle, honey, &amp;
all other liquors doe well agree with colworts.
The king of <hi>France</hi> drinketh neuer <hi>Orleans</hi> wine
notwithstanding his subjects do loue it well.</p>
            <p>I know sundrie men that haue such Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
with butter that they dare not smell it. It
hath beene pernicious to sundrie I grant it, so
hath wine, so hath bread, so hath gold, so hath
land, and what so wholsome thing is that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:4710:4"/>
be turned to abuse? If it be costly vse the
lesse of it. What? is not Rheubarbe coastly? is
not Muske coastly? is not <hi>Ambergreese</hi> coastly?
As touching the second point of my reuealing
this secret of Physicke, I answere, I meane but
to reforme the harme which proceedeth of the
abuse, and to shew to my countrey men that I
am more willing to pleasure them then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
my selfe, neither did I sweare to conceale
that point when in a robe of purpure I wedded
the metamorphosed DAPHN<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. It resteth now
to vnfold what moued me to entitule this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
<hi>Nepenthes,</hi> because it hath certaine melliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
delicacie, which deliteth the senses, &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of man with a mindful obliuion, insomuch
that it maketh &amp; induceth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the forgetting of all sorrowes &amp; miseries. And
there is such hostilitie betwene it &amp; melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that it is the only medicament in the world
ordained by nature to entertaine good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
insomuch that it worketh neuer so well, as
when a it is giuen from man to man, as a pledge
of friendshippe and amitie</p>
            <p>The countrey which God hath honoured
and blessed with this happie and holy herbe,
<pb facs="tcp:4710:5"/>
doth call it in their natiue language <hi>Petum,</hi> the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> who haue giuen it the right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalitie,
in their soyle terme it <hi>Tabacco,</hi> the
<hi>Frenchmen</hi> which haue receiued it in their
countrey as in a colonie call it <hi>Nicotian,</hi> in this
our Ile of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as in all other maritime
parts, we vse the Spanish name of <hi>Tabacco.</hi> But
esteeming it worthie of a more loftie name, I
haue chosen for gossip the faire and famous
<hi>Helena,</hi> and giuen to her the honour to name
this most profitable plant <hi>Nepenthes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Albeit this herbe disdaines not to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in many Gardens in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> in
<hi>France, Flanders, Germanie</hi> and <hi>Brittaine,</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
only that which is fostred in <hi>India,</hi>
and brought home by Mariners and Traffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
is to be vsed, as after you shall heare the
reason is.</p>
            <q>Non omnis fert omnia tell us.</q>
            <p>But auarice and greedines of gaine haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Marchants to apparell some <hi>European</hi>
plants with <hi>Indian</hi> coats, and to enstall them in
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ops as righteous &amp; legittime <hi>Tabacco.</hi> Some
others haue <hi>Tabacco</hi> from <hi>Florida</hi> indeede, but
because either it is exhausted of spiritualitie, or
<pb facs="tcp:4710:5"/>
the radicall humor is spent, and wasted, or it
hath gotten moysture by the way, or it hath
bene dried for expedition in the Sunne, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
too negligently, they sophisticate and
farde the same in sundrie sortes with blacke
spice, <hi>Galanga, aqua vitae,</hi> Spanish wine, Anise
seedes, oyle of Spicke and such like.</p>
            <p>So that the most fine, best, and purest is that
which is brought to <hi>Europe</hi> in leaues, and not
rolled in puddings, as the English Nauigators
first brought home.</p>
            <p>The finest <hi>Tabacco</hi> is that which pearceth
quickly the odorat with a sharpe aromaticke
smell, and tickleth the tongue with acrimonie,
not vnpleasant to the taste, from whence that
which draweth most water is most vertuous,
whether the substance of it be chewed in the
mouth, or the smoake of it receiued. Skillie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of wine, <hi>Bacchus</hi> butlers, know the wine
<q>Odore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fapore colore.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So they which traffique dayly with <hi>Tabacco</hi>
doe know it by these same three senses. In a
Goose there is nothing which doth not serue
either for meat or medicine, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o not so much as
the doung: But in <hi>Tabacco</hi> there is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:4710:6"/>
which is not medicin, the root, the stalke, the
leaues, the seeds, the smoake, the ashes, &amp; to be
more particular, <hi>Tabacco</hi> may serue for the vse
of man either greene or dry, of greene <hi>Tabacco</hi>
may be made Syrups, waters, oyles, vnguents,
plasters, or the leafe of it selfe, may bee vsed
mortified at the fire to cure the asthma, or
shortnesse of breath, dissolue obstructions,
heale the olde cough, burning vlcers, wounds,
migraim, Colicke, suffocation of the mother:
and many other diseases, yea almost all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
If the Romanes durst haue wanted so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares the helpe of Physick, vsing for all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
only Colwoorts. Truelie I think the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
might want now all Physitians eternally,
if they knew the vertue of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> seeing the
spring of al their diseases is defluxio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; cathars
for which the only antidot is <hi>Tabacco.</hi> I intreat
here the Lector of this treatise, to haue me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
if I do not set down in special the forme
and maner to prepare such remedies of green
<hi>Tabacco,</hi> as I haue mentioned, for I wold wish
to do with <hi>Tabacco</hi> as Aristoteles did with his
Physicks, for he wrot to his scholler <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that he had published &amp; not published his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
<pb facs="tcp:4710:6"/>
Philosophie: So I must assay to say, that
I haue revealed and not reuealed the quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of <hi>Tabacco.</hi> As concerning the dry <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi>
it may be vsed in infusion, in decoction,
in substance, in smoke, in salt. Touching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
&amp; decoction, because they are as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
&amp; more, than <hi>Elleborus albus,</hi> or antimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
I will forbeare to particularize, remitting
the practise of that part to the presence of some
prudent Physician, except it be in some despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
case of vnknown poyson. As for <hi>Tabacco</hi> in
substance holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the mouth, as an apophleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matisme,
or medicin to draw fleame out of the
head by the mouth, I avow it to be one of the
best &amp; surest remedies in the world against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralisie,
epilepsie or apoplexie, that is, the falling
ill, &amp; <hi>Vertigo Idiopathica,</hi> the passion of dizzines
in the head by wind, that euer was found out.
These are foure of the most incurable diseases
that besiege the braine of man: for vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the which cure I must remember the
Lector, that since the dayes of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
and in his dayes there haue bene inuented fiue
sundrie sorts of vacuations to voyde this our
body of filthy corruption wherof it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb facs="tcp:4710:7"/>
harbinger, that is, phelebotomie, vmitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
purging by the stool, by vrins, &amp; by sweating.
Now in the latter dayes hath beene inuented
a sixt way or maner of purging, which is
also by the mouth, not vomiting, but spitting:
The onely medicament which was wont to
procure such spitting, or slavering, was <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drargyrum,</hi>
quicke-siluer: but now of newe is
found out this diuine <hi>Tabacco,</hi> which if it be
rightly vsed, is a soueraigne helpe, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purgation, and approoued preseruatiue
against the foresaid diseases, as also against <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thritis,</hi>
the gowt, <hi>Lithiasis,</hi> the stone in reines
or bledder, and Hydropisie. But because it is
said that <hi>Tabacco</hi> and <hi>Hydrargyrum,</hi> worke
both after one sort, It shall not be amisse to
speake somewhat of the one and the other:
First, there is no vegetall in the world, hath
such affinitie with any minerall, as hath <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi>
with <hi>Mercure,</hi> or quicke-siluer, for as
Mercure purgeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> aboue and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,
being taken at the mouth, so doth <hi>Tabacco,</hi>
and as Mercure being applyed exteriourlie,
purgeth all the body by slauering, so doeth
<hi>Tabacco</hi> being holden in the mouth. As the
<pb facs="tcp:4710:7"/>
best Physicians, Philosophers and Alchimists
that euer were, can not agree vpon the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
neither first nor second of Mercure, some
say it is both hote and colde, both drye and
moist, that it can binde and loose, that it can
rarifie and thicken, and in a word, that it is a
Protheus, or a Magician. So <hi>Tabacco</hi> is hote,
because it hath acrimonie, it is cold because it
is narcoticke and stupefactiue, it maketh drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and refresheth, it maketh hungrie and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
it maketh thirstie, and quencheth thirst:
Finallie to bring man to health, it changeth as
many formes as <hi>Iuppiter</hi> doeth shapes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
himselfe to his Mistresse: This difference
onely there is, that <hi>Mercure</hi> being applyed to
any part of the body, prouoketh spitting: But
<hi>Tabacco</hi> purgeth by slauer onelie, being taken
in the mouth in substance or in smoake. The
Alchimists vaunt that they are able to drawe
out of euery thing Mercure, sulphure and salt,
but truelie out of nothing can they be sooner
or better separated, then out of <hi>Tabacco:</hi> I
thinke that I durst be bold to say, that <hi>Tabacco</hi>
is the Mercure of vegetals, and Mercure is the
<hi>Tabacco</hi> of minerals. Now to returne to our
<pb facs="tcp:4710:8"/>
purpose, to wit, to the cure and preseruation
of an armie of maladies, <hi>Tabacco</hi> must be vsed
after this maner. Take of leafe <hi>Tabacco</hi> as
much as being folded together, may make a
round ball of such bignesse that it may fill the
patients mouth, and inclyne his face down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
towards the ground, keeping the mouth
open, not mouing any whit with his tongue,
except now and then to waken the medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there shall flow such a flood of water
from his brain and his stomacke, and from all
the parts of his body that it shall be a wonder.
This he must do fasting in the morning, and if
it be for preseruation, and the bodie very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cochyme,
or full of euil humours, he must take
it once a weeke, otherwise once a month: But
if it bee to cure the Epilepsie or Hydropisie
once euery day. Thus haue I vsed <hi>Tabacco</hi> my
selfe, and thus vsed <hi>Tabacco Iean Greis</hi> a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
old man at <hi>Nantes</hi> in the French Britain,
who liued whill he was six score yeares of age,
and who was known for the only refuge of the
poore afflicted souldiers of <hi>Venus</hi> when they
were wounded with the French Pickes, I
should haue said Pockes. Thus much for the
<pb facs="tcp:4710:8"/>
vse of <hi>Tabacco</hi> in substance. As concerning
the smoke, it may be taken more frequently, &amp;
for the said effects, but alwayes fasting, &amp; with
emptie stomack, not as the English abusers do,
which make a smoke-boxe of their skull, more
fit to be caried vnder his arme that selleth at
<hi>Paris dunoir a noircir</hi> to blacke mens shooes,
then to carie the braine of him that can not
walke, can not ryde except the <hi>Tabacco</hi> Pype
be in his mouth, I chanced in company on a
tyme with an English merchant in <hi>Normandie</hi>
betweene <hi>Rowen</hi> and <hi>New-hauen.</hi> This fellow
was a merrie man, but at euery house he must
haue a Cole to kindle his <hi>Tabacco:</hi> the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
wondered, and I laughed at his intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie.
But there is one <hi>William Anslop</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man dwelling in Bishops-gate street, hard
within the gate that selleth the best <hi>Tabacco</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> and vseth it most discreetly. Because
the matter of smoake taking is controuerted
and disputed, I will first decide this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of smoake before I enter to shewe
the commoditie which proceedeth of it.
Suffumigation or receauing of smoake, is
not a newe inuented remedie, it is an
<pb facs="tcp:4710:9"/>
old and well approoued forme of medicine in
many diseases, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his booke of the diseases of women teacheth many kindes
of smoake which women should receaue and
specially of many vnsauourie and stinking
things at the nose and the mouth, to represse
and thrust back the mother in the suffocation,
a fearefull and dangerous disease. The most
expert Physitians in our dayes admit with one
consent the smoake of <hi>tussilago</hi> to be receiued
at the mouth, by those which are ptisicke, or
asthmaticke or haue the cough of cold. <hi>Gordon</hi>
a learned olde Physitian, the <hi>Vade mecum</hi> of
practitians, ordaineth Trochisques of Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greis,
Muske, and other Ingredients to be vsed
after the forme as we take the smoake of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi>
for the Epilepsie. In the booke called
<hi>Aphorismi tonsorum,</hi> or <hi>Schola Salerni,</hi> there is
a suffumigation made of Leek seeds, and white
<hi>Insquia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> seeds for the tooth ache to be receiued
at the mouth. <hi>Leonardo Fioravanti</hi> an Italian
practitian commendeth for deafenesse a suffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation
made with cinaber, frankincense and
myrrhe, to bee taken at the mouth. Consider
now good Lector, and repeat againe, Shall
<pb facs="tcp:4710:9"/>
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> permit the smoake of stinking fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and of old rotten shooes from a Coab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
dunghill? shall other Physitians permit the
smoke of <hi>tussilago?</hi> shal <hi>Gordon</hi> prescribe the aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
smoke of <hi>musk &amp;</hi> ambre? shal <hi>Schola Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerni</hi>
permit Insquiam to bee incensed in the
mouth which is a venemous plant, shall FIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAVANTI
command the smoke of cinabre,
which is a present poyson to infect the braine?
and shall wee onely banish the poore <hi>Tabacco</hi>
which hath more vertue for all these foresaide
Diseases, then each of the forenamed things
hath for their seuerall sores. If the mother vexe
and torment a woman, the smoake of <hi>Tabacco</hi>
either aboue or vnder, shal ease her more, then
feathers or lether. If thou be ptisicke, if thou be
asthmaticke, if thou be vrged to cogh through
defluxion, the smoake of <hi>Tabacco</hi> is better then
<hi>tussilago:</hi> if the rage of toothache excarnificate
the goomes, <hi>Tabacco</hi> is better then <hi>Insquiam:</hi> if
there be sounding in the eares, it is fitter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabre.</hi>
I ad further, that amongst so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
which vse &amp; abuse <hi>Tabacco</hi> at al occasions
without obseruation of any physicall precept,
there are very sew found that can ascribe their
<pb facs="tcp:4710:10"/>
death to <hi>Tabacco:</hi> so that if <hi>Tabacco</hi> were vsed
physically and with discretion there were no
medicament in the worlde comparable to it.
Now to returne from whence I did digresse to
shew the commodities of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> I lay here as
a ground to build vpon, that by reason of the
situation of mans head, which is aboue al the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
members of the body, the most parte of
diseases flow from the head, as from a fountain,
so that <hi>Tabacco</hi> going immediatly to the brain,
it not only augmenteth and refresheth the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
spirites, but drieth the sourse of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diseases, and fortifieth the braine. So that
there is no man but may receiue commoditie
by the vse of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> except only those which
haue their braine dry &amp; hot, which is a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
vnnaturall to the braine, yea and a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
disease, and the next degree to reauing
to furie, to madnesse. I know that euery one
will be curious to aske me how he shall know a
hote &amp; dry braine. GALEN in his book which
he calleth <hi>ars parva,</hi> declareth at large the signes
of all intemperies, yet to satisfie the mindes o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
curious Lectors, it is euident that his braine <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
hot &amp; dry who sleepeth very litle or nothing
<pb facs="tcp:4710:10"/>
who reaueth waking, and formeth monstruous
dreames sleeping, and whose nose distilleth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
It were a world of worke to specifie in
particular all the diseases, and symptomes
that are helped or preuented by <hi>Tabacco,</hi> but I
will only set downe those which I know either
by mine own experience, or by the faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
of learned Physicians or of credible pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.
I will begin at the Epilepsie which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by HIPPOCRATES <hi>morbus sacer,</hi> the falling
sicknes, and this plant is called by some nations
<hi>herba sacra:</hi> then after legittime preparation, &amp;
such diet as a skilful Physician shal prescribe, let
the patient be purged with the infusion of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi>
in <hi>hidromel,</hi> in the strained liquor of this
infusion dissolue foure graines of the salt made
of <hi>Tabacco</hi> and giue it to the patient to drinke:
herafter, hauing a cauter in his neck, he shal take
euery day the smoke of a pipe of fine <hi>Tabacco</hi>
fasting in the morning, &amp; once euery third day
hee shall hold in his mouth the apophlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of <hi>Tabacco</hi> in substance.</p>
            <p>Now because this disease hath some occult
venome and maligne qualitie, the olde Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
by long experience haue found out some
<pb facs="tcp:4710:11"/>
things which helpe this disease by an indecla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vertue, and for this cause he shall take the
smoake of this confected <hi>Tabacco</hi> euery day.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>ambregreese,</hi> the seede of <hi>peonie,</hi> and
<hi>stirax,</hi> of every one halfe an ounce, of <hi>muske</hi>
twentie graines, of <hi>lignum aloes</hi> the weight of
three crownes, of <hi>magisterium cranii humani</hi> an
ounce, of the sowing thereof, halfe an ounce, of
fine <hi>Tabacco</hi> as much as of them all, make of all
these a grosse powder, and take the smoake of it
euery morning, and thus the epilepticke shall
attaine to his health rather then by the galls of
dogs &amp; superstitious characters vsed by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ignorant deboshed Vagabondes and
Montebanckes. The Hydropisie is one of the
ordinarie customers that commeth to craue
health at the shop of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> and specially if it
bee holden in the patients mouth in substance,
or if hee take now and then of the salt thereof,
and euery day a pipe or two. The Arthritis or
gowt, &amp; grauell are preuented prettily, because
the antecedent cause is taken away: it preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
from the toothach: it cureth the migraim,
the colicke, the cogh, the cold: It stayeth grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fatte: it is the antidote of Hypochondriacke
<pb facs="tcp:4710:11"/>
melancholie, it prepareth the stomacke for
meat: it maketh a clear voice, it maketh a sweet
breath, it cleareth the sight, it opneth the eares,
it putteth away the punaise, &amp; openeth the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of the nose, it is the nourse of the lights, it
comforteth nerues, and taken in sirupe there is
no obstruction that can abide it: it is present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
against the most part of poysons: And in
few words it is the princesse of physical plants.
To conclude this discourse I must excuse here
my plainnesse and simplicitie with this caveat
to the curious Lector, that albeit the neuer too
much commended <hi>Tabacco</hi> bee of sufficiencie
to cure many diseases: yet it is not of efficacie
in al persons, in all seasons, in al temperaments,
but it must bee vsed by the direction of some
expert and prudent Physician. There was
on a time a diseased Gentleman, who for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his health sent for a Physician, the which
vsing prudently &amp; artificially his cure, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
man became wel, &amp; because he was subject
to that disease often in the yeare, hee remarked
well how the Physician had prepared his poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what herbes hee had decocted, what sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
hee had infused, what electuaries hee had
<pb facs="tcp:4710:12"/>
dissolued, howe much of euery one, how long
they seethed, or steeped, at what a clocke he did
minister it, how long hee fasted therafter, &amp; at
the next assault of the sicknesse hee tooke the
same potion, obseruing all Circumstances, but
was nothing the better: he sent againe for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Doctor, and inquired what the matter
should be, seeing he was diseased with the same
maladie, hee had taken the same potion, he vsed
it very rightly with all the circumstances and
obseruations, he had not omitted one jote, No
said the Physician you lacked a principal point,
a very necessarie Circumstance &amp; an essentiall
Cause, that is, you receiued not the potion
from the hand of a Physician: for if the patient,
as experience teacheth beginneth to feele the
first hope of his health at the arriuall of his
Physician: how much more shall he be alleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
when he giueth him out of his owne hand
the Cuppe which conteineth the Couenant of
his restitution, the earnest of his Wellfare, and
the weapon to destroy his disease. Happy were
the land that had no need of Physicians, happy
the lande which hauing neede of them hath
of the best sorte, and happie were the Phy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sicians
<pb facs="tcp:4710:12"/>
whose lote were to come in the lande
where the Law of good King REVTHER were
curiously keeped, that no man vnder paine of
death should exercise physicke that could not
shew a publicke testimonie of his lawfull Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
But I must say of Physicke as a holy Father
saide of the holie Scripture, <hi>hanc delirus senex,
hanc garrula anus, hanc sophista verbosus</hi>
putteth in practise, and is not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
God saue the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
from diseases, and God
saue the diseased from
such Doctors</p>
