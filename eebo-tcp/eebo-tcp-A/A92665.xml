            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER SENT FROM THE
LEAGVER BEFORE
HULL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Put this Letter to the hazard of a quicke paſſage, leaving it to take its fortune at the Poſt-houſe. The
News moſt ſpoken of at this time, is, That Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> by his vigilancie hath obtained foure great
peece of Ord<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance from the Cavelliers, and taken the Lord <hi>Faulconbridge,</hi> a Peer of the Lords Houſe, and
Mr. <hi>Bellaſsis,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Commons, priſoners at the ſame time; both which perſons have
been moſt active in this their native Countie, by their example to draw on all the reſt of the Gentrie to engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the proceedings thereof; finding both horſe and men in this ſervice againſt <hi>Hull.</hi>
They were going over <hi>Humber</hi> in a Catch with theſe foure peeces of Ordnance, in hope to have landed them in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhire</hi>
ſide, and to have planted them there oppoſite to the Battery at Paul: there were certain great ſadle horſes in
the ſame Catche, and divers other gentlemen, young Mr. <hi>Hotham,</hi> as I hear, made out of <hi>Hull</hi> in a ſmall frigot, with
foure ſmall Peeces, and fifty Musketiers, and boarded them in their paſſage; If the Town hold out well till Friday
next, the Spring-tyde will make the Beſiegers leave their Trenches: Its pitie if they have no freſh ſupplies of men and
proviſion ſent unto them, whereof as yet we hear not, but are confident the <hi>Parliament</hi> will not be ſlow in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
it concerns them. We are troubled at the great reſort of Papiſts hither, we the more diſtaſte the proceedings,
becauſe of their forwardneſſe to intereſt themſelves: <hi>theirs,</hi> and the entertainment of <hi>Commanders out of Ireland, ſome
Popiſh from beyond Sea,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Lord Dillon,</hi> and <hi>Collonel Taffote</hi> (Rebels come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are all active
againſt <hi>Hull</hi>) much reflects upon his Majeſties often expreſſions, cools our affections, and fils us with doubtings.
One <hi>Thornton</hi> (a Proteſtant of the laſt edition) expell'd <hi>Hull</hi> by Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> is now made Captain of a Troop:
laſt day he with his Souldiers rode to <hi>Anlaby</hi> (a little way off <hi>Hull</hi>) there plundred and pillaged Lieutenant Collonel
<hi>Legards</hi> houſe; whereof <hi>Legard</hi> hearing, plunders <hi>Thorntons</hi> houſe at <hi>Hull:</hi> whereupon <hi>Thornton</hi> drives <hi>Legards</hi> grounds
of all his oxen, horſes, kine, ſheep, &amp;c. Then Captain <hi>Jefford</hi> with ſixtie Musketiers, makes after <hi>Thornton</hi> and his
prize, <hi>Thornton</hi> perceiving this, fled, and left his bootie: and becauſe his Troops would not looſe his company, they
rode after him: <hi>Jefford</hi> prayed him, if he were a gentleman, that the Souldiers on both ſides might be diſmiſſed, and
they two end the quarrell. But <hi>Thornton</hi> refuſed, declaring it was a vain propoſition. You ſhall hear further as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
