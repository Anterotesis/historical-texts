         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE
OF
THOMAS Lord Fairfax, and Katherine his Wife; And John Peſhall Eſquire,
and Charlotte his Wife.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3 &amp; 4 Octob. 4 Jac. 2.</note>
               <hi>THOMAS</hi> late Lord <hi>Culpeper,</hi> by Indentures dated (as in the Margent) Settles his Eſtate on divers Perſons
therein named to the Uſe of himſelf for Life, and after for the benefit of ſeveral Perſons for whom he had
reſpect, and took himſelf to be obliged to provide for, amongſt others, for the raiſing of Three thouſand
Pounds Portion for <hi>Charlotte,</hi> now the Wife of the ſaid <hi>John Peſhall,</hi> payable at her Attainment of the Age
of One and twenty, or day of Marriage.</p>
            <p>That by the ſaid Deed, there are divers Eſtates and Limitations made, and granted to and for the benefit
of the ſaid Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> ſubject to the ſeveral Charges by the ſaid Deed created, and amongſt others for the ſaid 3000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> In this Settlement a Power of Revocation is reſerved to the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> by Will or Deed, to Alter,
Change, or make Void any of the Eſtates, Uſes or Truſts; and the Reverſion in Fee is limited to the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peper</hi>
and his Heirs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">19 Jan. 1688.</note>
               <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> makes his Will and confirms the ſaid Settlement, and gives to the ſaid <hi>Charlotte</hi> the Reverſion of
ſome Farms in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> and to the Heirs of her Body; and for want of ſuch, to his own Right Heirs; and ſoon after
the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> Dies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> Marries the ſaid Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> who was Sole Daughter and Heir of <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper;</hi> and finding
by the ſaid Deed and Will a conſiderable part of the Eſtate was to go from his Lady and her Heirs, and what was to come to her was
Charged with ſo conſiderable a Sum as 3000 <hi>l.</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and ſeveral other great Payments; endeavoured to ſet aſide, and
avoid the ſaid Deed and Will, or the Effect thereof; and not only attempted it by Suits in the Ordinary Courts of Law, but
by a BILL in Parliament without Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, The ſaid Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> finding he could not prevail againſt the ſaid Deed of Settlement and Will, did refer the
Matter in difference between him and the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> his Wife, and the ſaid <hi>John Peſhall,</hi> and <hi>Charlotte</hi> his Wife, to ſeveral
Honourable and Worthy Perſons, who upon examining into the ſame, made an Agreement betwixt the Parties, That the ſaid
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſhould pay unto the ſaid <hi>John Peſhall 4000 l.</hi> and were of Opinion, That it was neceſſary to apply to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
for an Act, for the more eaſie and better Raiſing the Money Charged on the Eſtate for the ſaid <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Agreement in all its Parts.</p>
            <p>That accordingly a BILL was prepared and brought into the Honourable Houſe of Commons, who referred it to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee;
and the Right Honourable <hi>John,</hi> now Lord <hi>Culpeper,</hi> Petitioned againſt the Paſſing of the ſaid BILL, and was Heard by
his Counſel before the ſaid Committee, who having maturely conſidered of the Matter, paſſeth the BILL; and now the ſaid
Lord hath Petitioned to be Heard at the Bar of the Houſe before the BILL do Paſs.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Lord ſurmizes by his Petition, That there were ſeveral Settlements made in the Family, by which ſome Eſtate
is limited to him; he produced no ſuch, nor did make it Credible on any Reaſonable Grounds.</p>
            <p>But the ſaid Lord alleadges, That the Committee Ordered the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to produce a Deed of Settlement of the Eſtate in
1669: and he produced a pretended Copy.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> produced all he had, which was a Copy: But now one part of that Deed is obtained and ready to be
produced, which will juſtifie the Copy produced to the Committee to be True; and that my Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> can claim nothing by
Colour of that Settlement, the Eſtate being thereby limited to the Heirs Males of <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> by <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife;
and for want of ſuch, to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> and his Heirs for ever.</p>
            <p>As for the Settlement alledged to be made on the Marriage of <hi>Alexander Culpeper,</hi> Elder Brother to Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the
preſent Lord <hi>John;</hi> It does not ſtand to Common Reaſon there ſhould ever be any ſuch Settlement, and upon ſtrict Search no
ſuch Writing can be found: And for that <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Father of the late Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Petitioner, did out-live
his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> and was ſeized in the Fee-ſimple of his Eſtate at his Death; and by his Laſt Will charges and deviſes his
Eſtate as a Fee-ſimple to his Eldeſt Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> to diſpoſe of as he thought fit.</p>
            <p>As to the Pretence, That my Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> could prove a Suppreſſion or Concealment of Deeds, if my Lord <hi>Fairfaix</hi>
would wave his Priviledge; 'tis very ſurprizing to find it in the Petition, when no Evidence thereof was offered at the Committee;
And tho' the ſaid Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> did ask my Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> once to wave his Priviledge, he never would ſay to what end, nor did
my Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> deny it.</p>
            <p>'Tis likewiſe alleadged, That <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> was indebted to the ſaid Petitioner in 6000 <hi>l.</hi> and that his Eſtate is
Chargable with the Petitioners juſt Debt in Equity.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſuppoſed, That Matter (if lookt into) would prove an utter Miſtake, both as to the Debt and Remedy: For that the
Lands mentioned in the BILL are not liable to pay the ſame, as will appear by the Laſt Will of the Petitioner's Father.</p>
            <p>But beſides, in the BILL now before the Houſe, there is not only a general Saving Clauſe of all Perſons Right; but 'tis
Conſented, the ſaid Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> ſhall have a particular Saving of all ſuch Right, Title or Claim, as he hath, can or may have in
Law or Equity, to all or any part of the Eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This BILL doth not deſtroy or abridge, or in any ſort alter or prejudice any Ancient Settlement, if there was any ſuch;
nor concern any Perſon, but ſuch as were concerned in the ſaid Reference and Agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That great part of the Eſtate ſetled in 1669. was of <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi>'s Purchaſe, and with his Wives, his then
and yet living Wife <hi>Margarets</hi> Portion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> And that <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Culpeper</hi> in 1686. ſuffered a Recovery, and by Deed declared the Uſe to himſelf and his Heirs in Fee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> alſo, That the Petitioner, during the Conteſt between the Lord <hi>Fairfaix</hi> and <hi>John Peſhall,</hi> and others, touching the validity
of the ſaid Settlement of the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> and the ſaid Lord <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Will, never ſet on Foot any Pretence for himſelf, or
would aſſiſt my Lord <hi>Fairfax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> The Petitioners ſuppoſed Debt is of above Thirty years ſtanding, and his Demand which ſhould ariſe on the Fancied
Settlement is Eight years Old, and no Suit hath been commenced for either.</p>
            <p>Wherefore 'tis hoped, this Honourable Houſe will not retard the Paſſing this BILL, but look on the Objections thereto as
proceeding from the Memory of ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkindneſſes the Petitioner imagines were done to him by his late Brother; in which the
ſaid Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his Lady, and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Peſhall,</hi> were no ways concerned, and therefore can deſerve no Blame or
Reſentment.</p>
