            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SAtan's <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of his <hi>co-workers</hi> (in caſe of the Lambs attempts againſt his Kingdom) moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently appears in building <hi>Lyes</hi> as a Bulwark for their <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> as (amidſt the ſmoak of his hideous Furnace) he hath exquiſitely forged out <hi>divers Lyes</hi> to the hand of his <hi>Nameleſs,</hi> and (therefore ſomething the rather) <hi>ſhameleſs Servant,</hi> inſerted in his Writing to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In affirming, that I going to <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood nothing but <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for I then underſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Engliſh,</hi> both <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> the two moſt uſuall <hi>Roman Tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> In avouching the Pope's <hi>admitting me</hi> to his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> which he <hi>never did,</hi> but rather I believe was (in some certain reſpect) really <hi>afraid</hi> ſo to do: and conſequently the aſſerted <hi>particular paſſages</hi> intimated as acted in the <hi>Popes preſence,</hi> muſt alſo altogether, appear <hi>deceits</hi> and <hi>lyes;</hi> Who ſent me not firſt to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> as he ſaith; for I was in <hi>two Priſons</hi> before <hi>that, viz.</hi> in one of the <hi>New Priſons,</hi> and <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> whence alſo <hi>all the reſt</hi> may be <hi>judged</hi> from what <hi>Pit</hi> they aſcended, as being blown up of the <hi>old Lyar,</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> reſident as ſtably in <hi>Rome,</hi> as in <hi>any part elſe</hi> in the <hi>whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the mans intended <hi>laſcivious terms</hi> touching <hi>Jane Stokes,</hi> it ſtinks of ſome of his Fathers <hi>Fryeries, Convents,</hi> and <hi>Nunneries,</hi> and therefore I leave that <hi>dirt</hi> in his own <hi>diſh,</hi> which will not <hi>waſh</hi> but rather noyſomly <hi>beſmear</hi> his own <hi>face.</hi>

            <p>Touching his <hi>aſſertion,</hi> of <hi>one</hi> of our <hi>Friends</hi> FASTING himſelf <hi>to death,</hi> that is another Lye; for the <hi>Papiſts confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> to me, and divers of <hi>my Friends,</hi> that he was <hi>Hanged</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> being a <hi>Night-Work</hi> in that <hi>Black City</hi> of <hi>Murders,</hi> and <hi>Adulteries:</hi> And as for <hi>my Zeal,</hi> it is ſtill <hi>the ſame</hi> (in the true knowledge of God) as it <hi>was</hi> from <hi>firſt,</hi> to the <hi>laſt</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> which if the <hi>Popes Inquiſitors</hi> were men of <hi>Truth,</hi> muſt confeſs the ſame to the <hi>ſhame</hi> of <hi>him</hi> their <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>reſt of his Children,</hi> their <hi>Brethren,</hi> who from <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>laſt</hi> of my <hi>Captivity</hi> in that City, never ſtood to anſwer either by <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Writing</hi> my ſundry <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> (written in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> and <hi>Bedlam</hi>) which of late were publiſhed by me (here in <hi>London</hi>) in my Book entituled, BATTERING RAMS AGAINST ROME; for <hi>all</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of the <hi>Popes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Anſwer,</hi> in the behalf of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Children in Rome,</hi> which they ſtood not to anſwer for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here followeth a few Words in Anſwer to the purpoſe of the fiction, Printed in the name of the Pope of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>It cannot be underſtood <hi>by me,</hi> nor may be properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>by any rational Reader,</hi> but that the precited late publiſhed <hi>Tract</hi> is any other than <hi>a fee'd forgery</hi> to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the power of the <hi>Papiſts Iniquity,</hi> in ſome ſence <hi>criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally compoſed</hi> (according to the guile of the old ſubtile Serpent) that the neck of the <hi>Popes ſtrength</hi> might not be quite <hi>crakt</hi> with one <hi>twiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, conſidering how <hi>Often</hi> I propounded for the like <hi>Publick hearing</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Pope's Bondman,</hi> as may be read in my Book, BATTERING RAMS AGAINST ROME, in Pages 29, 36, 39, 41, 49, 54, 59, 83, 122, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>anſwered;</hi> which gives me to <hi>believe</hi> he would not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>anſwer</hi> that <hi>abroad,</hi> which he would not appear to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>at home,</hi> yea much leſs by <hi>Word abroad,</hi> which he would not by <hi>Writing at home;</hi> though I know in their <hi>boaſting parts,</hi> they would ſay rather <hi>in Publick</hi> than <hi>in Private,</hi> but the <hi>fruits</hi> ſhew it <hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſidering the <hi>Place appointed</hi> (viz. <hi>Amſterdam</hi>) without <hi>intimation</hi> of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> licencing ſuch a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſembly</hi> as was mentioned in mine to the Pope, which though he might preſume upon the <hi>priviledge</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples private <hi>adoration</hi> in that City; yet that is not an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that the <hi>States of Holland</hi> muſt ſubmit to his <hi>Will</hi> in ſo <hi>publick a thing</hi> as the other is, in caſe it were the <hi>Pope's Will,</hi> but as a <hi>craved kindneſs</hi> muſt <hi>firſt</hi> be granted <hi>by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſidering the <hi>manner of my Writing to the Pope,</hi> viz. in the <hi>Language</hi> that I did <hi>Write to him,</hi> with a <hi>ſubſcribed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> how he ſhould ſend his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to me, in order to the <hi>Meeting:</hi> So that were the ſaid <hi>Printed Tract</hi> the dictates of his Spirit, in his <hi>next</hi> he muſt in honeſty <hi>confeſs Oblivion,</hi> and bring himſelf under the <hi>conviction</hi> of the <hi>ſentence</hi> (which ſaith) <hi>Inſipientis eſt dicere, non putaram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I <hi>eſteem</hi> the ſaid <hi>Letter</hi> but as a <hi>Fiction</hi> which may be <hi>taking</hi> and <hi>tickling</hi> to certain <hi>airy Fancies,</hi> yet that a <hi>fooliſh Jeſt</hi> may not beguile <hi>all,</hi> I anſwer to the pretended <hi>argument</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> touching my <hi>temptations</hi> in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> which were firſt <hi>Irons,</hi> &amp; many <hi>Tortures,</hi> and next the <hi>offer of all Pleaſures</hi> which was no more <hi>Civility towards me,</hi> than was the <hi>Devils temptation</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>all theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me,</hi> Mat. 4.9. Nor was I more <hi>ungrateful</hi> towards <hi>them</hi> in <hi>denying them,</hi> than was <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Satan</hi> in the ſaid caſe, who renouncing him and ſaid, <hi>get the hence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. So if <hi>this</hi> were the <hi>Popes,</hi> he muſt yet plead <hi>ignorance</hi> of a <hi>Goſpel caſe;</hi> And who is meeteſt <hi>for Bedlam,</hi> the POPE or JOHN PERROT? let the rational <hi>Readers judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might alſo inſtance the <hi>pervertion</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> by him, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.24. where it is ſaid of <hi>Feſtus</hi> to <hi>Paul, Too much learning doth make thee mad;</hi> but he like <hi>a Roman</hi> turning it <hi>backward</hi> ſaith, <hi>too little learning, &amp;c.</hi> which is improper to ſay, <hi>too little</hi> in ſuch <hi>a caſe</hi> produceth the ſame effect of <hi>too much</hi> in the <hi>ſame caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I am ſo favourable and charitable as to think the <hi>Pope</hi> is not ſo much a nonſenſical perſon, as to percloſe his diſcourſe with a threat of Annunciating a young Jeſuite with the weapons of Excommunication with Bell, Book, and Candle, to Excommunicate me that was never in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, Fellowſhip, o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore with this latter conſidering the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned cauſes, I find no inducing Obligation on me to paſs to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where comings might from thence return again <hi>as one that ſought a pebble ſtone</hi> (but could not find it) <hi>in the deep Sea;</hi> ſeeing the certainty of meeting, nor means of finding the <hi>Pope's</hi> Champion is not ſtated by him: And therefore alſo neither is any thing of the ſaid Paper a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground of my ſtoping the courſe of the ſpreading my former <hi>Propoſitions.</hi> Yet with <hi>Solomon</hi> may finiſh my ſaying, <hi>Though thou ſhouldeſt bray a Fool in a Mortar among Wheat with a Peſtle, yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him,</hi> Prov. 27.22.</p>
