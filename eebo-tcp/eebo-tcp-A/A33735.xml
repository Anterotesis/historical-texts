            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe great Designe of that old and subtill Serpent in the latter dayes, doth eminently appeare to be, to over-turne the Faith of Soules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what else is the Reason of so many monstrous shapes, and varieties of appearances into which he transformeth himselfe, but that he may have somewhat more probably successefull, to intangle, according to the diversities of the temper of hearts? Yet such is the wise, and good dispensation of our God, that even when Satan would appeare most like an Angell of light; yet something ever doth breake forth in his closest contrivances, that makes the designe of the Serpent very visible.</p>
            <p>There is indeed something which pretends to holinesse in this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start Generation of men; as the meannesse of their Apparrell, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more then ordinary Abstinence, their forsaking the World (though to a sinfull neglect of their Callings and Families) and many triviall observances, which the Apostle calls, <hi>The rudiments of the World, Col. 2. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (in which they yet place a great part of their perfection) These things have indeed, as <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>A shew of Wisedome in Will-Worship and Humility, and neglecting of the Body;</hi> But alas, are narrower coverings then can conceale the wickednesse of the Blasphemies, Cursings, and Raylings, which under these are ushered in, to destroy the foundation of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore their folly is very fully, by the demonstration and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Scriptures, made manifest to our selves, and their Principles and practises (hereafter specified) undeniably known to some of us. We are as those that Watch for your soules, as those that must give account, Pressed in Spirit to Publish the ensuing Discourse; With our Prayers, that as their folly is made manifest herein, so it may proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>This is the Method of our proceeding in this Tractat. First, we lay downe their Doctrines. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prove them to be theirs from their own Words and Writings. Thirdly, confute them from the Scriptures.</p>

               <p>We could have given <hi>proofe</hi> sufficient, that these principles that follow, are clearely and fully owned by them; but they are so evidently the very markes and distinguishing badges of their Irreligion, so constantly practised by them, and so plainly known to all that know this sort of men, that we shall, once for all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Reader.

Those their <hi>chiefe Seats</hi> also were such, as they, out of a vaine affectation of honour, by reason of their extraordinary thoughts of their owne holinesse and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did assume to themselves, and is so yet further different from our case who use Pulpits as conveniences for the peoples hearing not for our owne vanity. 4. Those their Seats also were such as were places in the Synagogues, <hi>chiefe,</hi> or upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, as where the chiefest and more honourable persons sate, and such of these the Magistrates and persons of honour in our Congregations deservedly enjoy, and not the Ministers; for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now as to the second sort of trembling, arising from sight of sinne, and sense of the wrath of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ant, not onely the Scriptures, but the experiences of many doe witnesse the terrors of God sometimes upon the soule for sinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those workings of wrath upon the soule, we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are vastly different from the tremblings and quakings of these mens. For first, Some of us doe know, that very young<note place="margin">W. C.</note> children have been under these extasies amongst them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sense of sinne never caused foaming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and running naked in the streets, that we doe know of. Thirdly, By the Narration of <hi>Gilpin,</hi> you may clearely observe, that he was often under those <hi>quakings</hi> when he was purely possessed by Satan. Fourthly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it is looked upon by them (as we could instance in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in some that have been long <hi>quakers</hi>) as a great attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and they have exceedingly desired to be in these fits of trembling; not as to the terrifying of the conscience, but as to the trembling of the body. 5. Lastly, we propose this to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>m, How comes it to passe, that many of their partners and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, are owned by them as saints, and as brethren, who yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had those fits of <hi>quaking?</hi> For if their <hi>quaking</hi> doe proceed from a true sense of sinne, how come they to be saints before they have attained it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But thirdly, Let us put the case that these their <hi>quaking</hi> do proceed from sight of sinne, and sense of wrath (though truely we are convinced to the contrary) yet we say, that this, which they call their <hi>great perfection,</hi> First, Is nothing but the start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of a Legall conscience, farre short of the happy state of a soule made free by the blood of Jesus Christ. Secondly, Doe not the Devills beleeve and tremble by legall fights of sinne, and through sense of wrath, as also the damned soules in Hell; and shall we call this <hi>quaking</hi> their <hi>perfection?</hi> Thirdly, These <hi>quakings,</hi> under sense of sinne, can be at best, but an establishing of selfe-righteousnesse, while they are cryed up, and carried on


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105667:23"/>
to the neglect of the righteousnesse of Christ, imputed to the soule, through beleeving (not through working) as we have largely proved before, against their establishing of their owne righteousnesse. And so, what is <hi>Felix</hi> better for all his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings? And what are these <hi>quakings,</hi> but a fore-runner, and fore-taste of that eternall wrath of God, which is to fall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, who resteth under the convictions and actings of the Law, but embraceth not the righteousnesse of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, to be found in that at his appearing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is indeed a mention of trembling in a third sense in Scripture, as a <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. where the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are said to receive <hi>Titus with feare and trembling,</hi> which they grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply to their case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

These last we mention, lest they should charge us with passing over that which they presume to make so much for them.</p>
                  <p>In all this, Reader, we desire to professe, that our so large discovery of the nature of <hi>quaking,</hi> is not to discourage any poore soule, that under tremblings <hi>of spirit,</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. Is it the way of the Lord to call men immediately from Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on purpose to tell onely of an Houre-Glasse; and to have nothing to say, but to call a man Priest, with no other Message? Were ever the Prophets of God sent forth with such triviall messages as these? How fearefully is the glorious name of an holy God abused in this particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is not this to bely the all-knowing God, to say in the name of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That one of us was at home, when he was not? And that he had a Message, which presently after he denied againe, being demanded what it was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How emi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent is that judgement upon the followers of


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105667:24"/>
these men, that they are delivered up to strong delusions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve lyes themselves, and delude others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that they knew that <hi>Fox</hi> was so sent as he peetended by an immediate voyce from God, and yet upon enquiry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied they either saw shape, or heard voyce.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That this their pretence of being commanded, or sent forth immediately by God, is most wicked and vaine, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their way to get populer applause or acceptance, is plaine. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If they be with-held in publique from delivering their message there (as they may pretend) yet why doe they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it in private? or at other times? When they came to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and were with us before the Magistrates, they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered not their message there; and they might have had liberty with freedome to come to any of our Houses; nay, some of them were invited thither by some of us. How fully doe they<note place="margin">W. C.</note> contradict themselves, and are faithlesse messengers to their master, neither true to God nor Satan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they were under such powerfull impulses of the spirit to speake, (as they pretend they are) that they cannot hold; we desire to know how they can now of late forbeare till our publique worship and exercise be concluded? At their first breaking forth it was otherwise; but since they have found that their speaking in the time of our publique worke, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by Law, they can now be silent till we have closed up the worke. Certainely, such politique proceedings doe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently make plaine, that their pretence of an extraordinary command, and strong impulses of the spirit, are absolute coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, either against their owne consciences, or by the strong delusions of the Father of Lyes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their usuall charge in publique against us, is that we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
