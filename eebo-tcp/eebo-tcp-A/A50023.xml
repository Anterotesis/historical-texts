         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Reader, Thou ſhalt find in this
Treatiſe Reaſon, and Examples ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to convince thee of the
Truths therein aſſerted: howbeit
thou muſt be put in mind, (I find it
in my ſelf too true) that a curious
<pb facs="tcp:64170:4"/>
Garden neglected is not only very
troubleſom to bring into good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but to keep it well requireth a
skilful and diligent hand. Nature
will be carefully attended and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him that will reap her fruits:
Heaven it ſelf ſuffereth violence, and
the violent enter it by force. All
things yield to hard labor, Heaven
and Earth do favour the vertuous,
and hate the vicious man; and he, in
his right mind, is odious to himſelf.
What Peace, Content and Glory is
it then to be vertuous? What Shame,
Self-horror and Confuſion to be vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
If it be not in our power to
chooſe whether we will tell a lye,
commit Adulteries, Murders, Thefts,
Debaucheries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may fairly
plead to our Conſcience and the
Judg, before whom all fleſh muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that we could not avoid the
commiſſion of thoſe Crimes: Our
<pb facs="tcp:64170:5"/>
Laws were alſo horribly unjuſt, which
puniſh Tranſgreſſors, Parents ought
not to correct their Children, and
good men are guilty of folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in giving others wholſom Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;
and why ſhould not men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
as much content and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from a vicious as from a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
action? But if it be in our
Will to live vertuouſly, and we do
not well employ this excellent talent
of Nature, it is but juſt it be taken
from us, and to be denied the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Grace: thus we are left
without excuſe, and our deſtruction

            <p>THough truth be common to all
men, and her beauty create
no jealouſie; though ſhe be
reverenced of the blind, as
well as the clear-ſighted, and depend
as little on time to be made known, as
upon the Senſes to make herſelf the
beloved of many; albeit ſhe be infuſed
into the minds of all mortals, and the
change of Climates
alter not her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that ſhe be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable

Cuſtoms, which overtop
our Laws, be not able to aboliſh her
<pb facs="tcp:64170:6"/>
Maxims. Yet Experience teacheth that
nothing is leſs known upon Earth;
and that Philoſophy which ought to
conduct us to her, hath diſguiſed her,
turning all her Reſemblances to an
Idol, and confounding her ſhadows
with her ſubſtance, hath
cauſed received Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to paſs for ſo many
Truthes.<note n="*" place="margin">Judicia nullius Jus deterius, ſed fermius efficiunt. l. 87. ff. de Regul. juris.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Stoicks thought it no injuſtice
to be ſingular, nor the ſeverity of their
Doctrine an Opponent to Reaſon; and
though their Sentiments were raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the common pitch; that they were
not therefore leſs true: that Vertue
which they reverence in their wiſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick,
ſeemed to them too juſt to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
their Profeſſion. They are not
aſhamed to defend a party that had all
vertuous Men on their ſide; and they
feared they might ſhew a doubt of his
Merit, if they made difficulty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb facs="tcp:64170:6"/>
with that School, which protected
him. The Peripateticks built their
Science on the Multitude of their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
and, leaning on the Opinion of
the People, they affirmed that what was
generally received could not be faulty.
They ſay, that <hi>Zeno</hi> left them not, but
out of Caprice; that his Precepts differ
not from theirs but in mode of Speech;
and that he had never thought of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his particular School, but for the
envy he bore to <hi>Polemon,</hi> that filled
his mouth with thoſe proud words,
which cauſed the ſeparation 'twixt him
and other Philoſophers. So that
truth, which cannot be divided by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
number of Auditors, nor changed
by Cuſtom of Countries, is found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
ſhared between two different
Sects, and as if ſhe had abandoned her
own Nature, ſhe is in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to countenance an Error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe ſought not to be popular;
<pb facs="tcp:64170:7"/>
for the multitude of Diſciples is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
ſign to authorize the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick
Doctrine. A man is not blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
becauſe his Antagoniſt hath a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
train then himſelf. The number of
Adherents is often a mark of Error;
and, as ſome Orators (to their ſhame)
will defend the worſt Cauſes, the moſt
ridiculous Opinions have ſome Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bators.</p>
            <p>Truth is ſufficiently victorious,
when good men receive her; the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of pretenders augment not her Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and, being diſintereſſed, ſhe ſeeks
not to pleaſe many. If the Stoicks be
not then cryed up, if they ſeem to be leſs
in the right then their Enemies, if they
have not that Credit that maketh their
Adverſaries inſolent, they muſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
this misfortune to the ſeverity of
their Profeſſion. That Vertue which
ſhould gain them Admiration, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
them Envy; and, as the Rigor
<pb facs="tcp:64170:7"/>
of the Goſpel hath rendred Chriſtians
odious to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the
Gravity of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s School hath made
the Stoicks deſpicable to other Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.
But notwithſtanding the
ſtrenuous endeavors of malice to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
their Sentiments, yet did they gain
ſome followers; the wiſeſt of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
have taken their part, and if we
believe a Hiſtorian of our Age, <hi>Pliny,
Tacitus, Plautus</hi> and others profeſs
no other Doctrine but what they fetcht
from their School. Doth not <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
maintain a great number of their
Paradoxes? And our Judgment muſt
be grown weak, not to obſerve that they
principally compoſe a great part of his
Works: <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is he
not a Stoick in all his Writings? Doth
not he render the Myſteries of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
familiar to us by their Doctrine?
And doth he not lead the faithful to
a vertuous life, by the Diſcourſe of theſe

wiſe Heathens?<note n="*" place="margin">

where I ſhew plain enough (I think)

then when ſhe ſet upon the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> diſcrediting
their Doctrin, to diminiſh their
innocence, and by a Practice as
Malicious as Self-ended, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an information againſt Vertue, that ſhe might
the better attack thoſe who pleaded her cauſe.
Paſſions (which are but the diſeaſes of Fools)
were the Pretext: and ſeeing that thoſe Famous
Philoſophers went about to Suppreſs them, as the
Monſters of Humane Nature. Forbiding the wiſe
man (they intended to repreſent) any uſe of them,
as concluding from their diſorders did ariſe all
our evils: this backbiteing Enemy procured them
foes, to take Vengeance on thoſe pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
and dealt with Orators to perſwade us,
that paſſions were no leſs then perfections of the
Soul, making not only Apologies but Elogies for
them; And of theſe were formed a party who
deſign'd their ruin. For hardly had this generous
Sect taken root, their weighty paradoxes made
impreſſions upon the moſt Solid minds, and the
moſt clear ſighted grown doubtful that truth might
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64170:10"/>
be on their ſide, ſeeing they lighted us to her with
ſo much Majeſty; but ſhe was ſurrounded with
as many adverſaries as Philoſophers; all who
were not <hi>Stoicks,</hi> became their Enemies, and as
that <hi>Hero</hi> in the <hi>Fable,</hi> they fought with Monſters
from their firſt Original.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Academia</hi> which might be called the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of good manners was their firſt Perſecutor,
uſing them as Rebels becauſe their principles were
different, and fearing leaſt the growth of theſe
might be their overthrow, they laboured to make
them appear to the Judgments of men, as Perſons
diſeaſed in the Spleen and Hypocondrium every
Apes face in <hi>Plato's</hi> School had a fling at them,
All his Scholers became Maſters of Art in the
miſtery of <hi>Calumny:</hi> and as they could not make an
accomodation between theſe Mens Maximes and
their own ſoft opinions, they repreſented them
for vainglorious extravagancies, as full of guilt,
as to them they ſeemed ridiculous. The <hi>Lycaeum</hi>
afforded them as few good offices as the <hi>Academia,</hi>
and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by his fox-like War, laboured no leſs
for their Ruin then did <hi>Pythagoras</hi> by his bare faced
oppoſition. For although theſe Philoſphers agreed
not in opinion, their principles different, the
thoughts of the younger not agreeing with the
tenets of the elder Brother, yet may the former
boaſt of routing his Enemy by ſuccouring his
Adverſaries, defending his own cauſe by pleading
for the <hi>Arabes</hi> againſt the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and paſſing from
the School to the Study, imitated thoſe Polititians,
that cunningly employ the Weapons of the fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
Subject, to ſuppreſs the Rebels of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64170:10"/>
For although this Philoſopher gained every
where Diſciples; drew Princes to his School by
the curiouſneſs of his Diſcourſe, put <hi>Athens</hi> to
Silence, and all her Citizens into a diſpoſition to
erect his Statues in the Chief places of their City:
yet did he judge that to affirm his Doctrin it was
needful to throw down that of his antagoniſts,
the ſhadow of an Enemy being ever dangerous
in that ſtate where Novelty is affected; who ever
will be abſolute in Government ſeeks his own
preſervation by the Rout, his Victory by the
Death, and his ſafety in the Sepulture of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Plato</hi> were more juſt then his Diſciples, and
for being more Divine could judg more reaſonably
of their opinions, he was not more valiant. If he
ſhewed leſs of Paſſion at their Defeat, he had not
reſolution enough either to follow or defend them;
for he that dives deep into the Writings of this
ſublime Philoſopher, will ſee, That if he be their
Panegyriſt, he is not of their party: If he reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
their Vertue he deſpairs of ever reaching it.
If he be inamoured with their perfections, he is
an Enemy to that Severity that bears them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and if he have conceived a high eſteem of
their Doctrin, he wants courage to imbrace it,
His <hi>Theater</hi> confeſſes that ſo high a Vertue draws
his Reſpect rather then his Love, and that ſhe is
too ſevere in her Philoſophers to make her of the
Number of his beloved.</p>
                  <p>Some other Modern Philoſophers, more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for their Ruin, are not content with the
credit of this acknowledgment, but much more
vain then thoſe whom they accuſe of Vanity,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64170:11"/>
Worſhip their own conceits, eſteem their own
Judgments above their Teachers, and as if all
their words were Oracles, they appeal from their
Maſter's to the eſteem of their own opinions,
They ſtick not to ſay that Pride is the Soul of all
<hi>Stoick</hi> actions. That the praiſe they expected
was the motive, and that the hopes they had
to out Live their Funerals, was the moving
Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, although I take part with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and
herein approve only the opinions that have ſome
agreement with <hi>Seneca's,</hi> I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
not to value <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates, ſed magis amica veritas <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles.</hi> 1 Eth, ad Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.</note> to
be a friend to <hi>Plato,</hi> and to
honour truth from the lips of
her Adverſaries. Nor can I
eaſily believe that theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
Authors ever had it in deſign to blaſt
the <hi>Stoick</hi> reputation, and to purchaſe Glory by
their diſhonour; but I rather perſwade my ſelf that
they preferred their own Satisfaction before the
truth, ſeeking to content their own humors rather
then their conſcience; and governed by ſelf Love,
that blinded them, they were leſs careful to be
truths Champions, than to appear Eloquent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants:
Or elſe (which is moſt likely and doth
moſt hide their infirmity) as Satyrical matters are
more fertile than Elogies, we are ingenious in
Slanders and tardy in praiſes, invectives are more
pleaſing to our minds than <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> ſo it may
be ſaid that they contrived Errors where with to
charge the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> made formal Monſters to aſſault
them, and mixing the Art of Poetry with the
liberty of Orators, they invented faults to delight
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64170:11"/>
themſelves in the publication thereof. For what
Color was there, that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſhould be judged
guilty for leaving the <hi>Academia,</hi> and forſaking their
Maſters Party, to ſide with truth? who can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accuſe them of inſolence for courting of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
themſelves and procuring her the Love and
admiration of others? Is it no temerity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt Philoſophers after the manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
for taking nature and reaſon to be their
Guides? Is it a Crime to aſpire unto goodneſs?
And can a man be condemned as unjuſt, becauſe he
endeavours to be more vertuous then his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions?
And yet this is the Crime of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
they are guilty becauſe they deſired to be better
than others, their Inſtructions are ſuſpected, for
being too auſtere: their Life is odious for being
too much retired, and their Diſciples at this day are
accounted but aſſes, only becauſe they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
too near the perfections of Angels.</p>
                  <p>It's true, that thoſe, who diſcourſe of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
from the conſequences they produce, and who
judg a cauſe by the Number of the Counſel that
plead it, can hardly figure to themſelves that <hi>Zeno's</hi>
School was once the moſt Famous, ſeeing it hath
yet brought forth only fantaſmes: the felicity
wherewith it fed her Diſciples hath produced but
an imaginary happineſs; and the wiſe man, they
promiſed us, ſo many ages paſt, hath only appeared
in <hi>Idaea.</hi> They add that this Sect was ſurely ill
grounded, ſince it could not preſerve its innocence
in its uprightneſs, ſince it found the period of its
glory in the Funerals of its Authors, and was
conſtrained to borrow the Pen, of one of its
Diſciples, to keep up the memory of it's ancient
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64170:12"/>
greatneſs. It's true that if <hi>Seneca's</hi> works had not
recovered it, and if he had not given it by his
Eloquence that Splender, which time and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the envious raviſht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from it, their precepts
had been buried in ſilence, and their paradoxes had
been to us unknown. We might have Laboured
at this day for the Name of him that began it,
and all Hiſtorians had been to ſeek in teaching us
to whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was obliged for the ground of
his quarrels, whether to the modeſty of <hi>Zeno,</hi> or
the Confidence of the <hi>Cynicks.</hi> Theſe reproaches
are not without ſome Color of truth, and as thoſe,
who form them, are prejudiced by paſſion, it may
be ſaid of them, that they are as Wiſe as theſe hot
heads, that ſome times utter Oracles and think it
not. For although I am concerned for the honour
of my Teachers, and that it be more my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to ſpeak after their manner, then to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
my Self to the weakneſs of their Enemies;
Yet I confeſs with them that the Wiſe man whom
they place ſo near to their Gods, and whom the
<hi>Academy</hi> ſets ſo little diſtant from fabulous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
hath not yet appeared but in their Writings,
and if ſome men have built him Temples, none
are yet found that have loaded his Altars, but with
wiſhes, for his Birth. Alſo that wiſe Roman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
condemned for comparing his <hi>VViſe man</hi>
with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and for uniting in his perſon the
infirmities of a Man with the powers of a God,
doth not pretend ſo much to an Original as a
Copy and he that examineth well the ſenſe of his
words, will confeſs that he propoſeth only the <hi>Idaea,</hi>
and ſeeketh to conduct us to the object by the
Glaſs of Repreſentation.</p>

When <hi>Fabius</hi> formes an Orator, ſhews him the
Art of perſwading, teaches the way to enamel his
diſcourſe, to ſwell his periods for the Elevation
of his meaner thoughts. When he diſguiſeth truth
or untruth by <hi>Ironie,</hi> cauſeth Toombs or Statues
to ſpeak by apoſtrophy, runs to pretended <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
for a crafty pratling, wherewith to deceive
his Auditors, calls for <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to put a gloſs

a hundred Modes of Speech to ſet out the
Flouriſh of his Stile. It may be ſaid that he hath
attained the art of good expreſſion, is become the
Father of Rhetorick, brought her forth that taught
him to ſpeak, and diſplayed all the artifices of an
accompliſhed Orator. Nevertheleſs it muſt be
confeſt that this good Speaker is not yet brought
forth, and he that is ſo well deſcribed in his works
hath neither yet mounted the Pulpit, nor pleaded
at the Bar.</p>
                  <p>Who will then admire that this wiſe <hi>Stoick</hi>
hath not yet appeared, that his Glories ſhould
forerun his Birth; that he ſhould be at age before
he be of Years, and that he ſhould become both
the Favorite and the admirer of Vertue, before he
could be acquainted with her; <hi>Seneca's</hi> honour is
not ſmall that he raiſed him to ſuch a pitch as his
Rivals cannot look up to, without envy, and made
him the ſhame of the Peripatick, after he had been
the wonder of the <hi>Cynicks.</hi> A Conquerour is not
accounted raſh for projecting deſigns which he
could not bring to paſs; or for imploying hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Vertues in the gaining of an Ordinary Victory:
Valour would be diſrobed of Splendor, if limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
if her endeavours were reſtrained by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64170:13"/>
Laws of prudence, and ſhe always obliged to
walk within the Circle which Morality hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
her.</p>
                  <p>How convincing ſoever this Reaſon be, yet
doth it not ſatisfy the moſt obſtinate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Peripateticks agree with us, that it is
not more impoſſible for <hi>Seneca</hi> to bring forth his
wiſe man, then for <hi>Fabius</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> to form a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Orator, yet can they not comprehend how
this Wiſe man can be without paſſion; that he
ſhould be a Man and not pertake of his faults,
and be ingaged in the Body, and not feel it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
They affirm, as do their Maſters that
theſe Motions are natural to us, that it is not in
our power to hinder their Birth, that they are the
Seeds of Vertue, and that as Speech and Geſture
make the beſt parts of an Orator, Paſſions are the
auxiliaries that nature hath given us to make us
active and virtuous. That whilſt the Spirit ſhall
be united to the Body, whilſt the Angelical part
ſhall ſhare with the Beſtial, and the Soul be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to Negotiate with Fleſh and Blood; ſhe
will find diſturbances. That theſe infirmities of
the Soul are the Subject of her Merit, and Victories,
and that it is neceſſary that man ſhould fret and
fear, rejoyce and be afflicted, if he will be juſt,
and prudent, temperate and valiant; For by their
diſcourſe Vertue would be
without employment if ſhe
had not theſe Monſters to
fight with,<note place="margin">Naſcitur ex affectibus Virtus, &amp; nata cum illis conſiſtit. <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> apud Stob. Serm. 1.</note> and this illuſtrious
habitude that may be termed
the Life of wiſe mens actions,
would languiſh if ſhe had not theſe inſurrections
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64170:13"/>
of the Senſitive appetite to exerciſe her vertue
But who ſees not at firſt that this Diſcourſe ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at the principles of Morality, abaſeth vertue
to a dependance upon her Slaves, and permitteth
Rebels to intrench upon her power by inſinuating
the utility of Enemies, that deſtroy, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of ayds and ſuccours, and I am of <hi>Socrates</hi>
mind, and dare affirm with him that whilſt the
Soul informs the fools head, ſhe will be forced to
conceive Paſſions, and whilſt ſhe hath no higher
apprehenſions then the Common People, ſhe will
be conſtrained to fear an ill accident, to form en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,
to hope well of them, deſire Wealth,
and to regret its loſs. But if ſhe view all theſe
objects with indifference, receive Fortunes ill
looks with as much Conſtancy as her good Offices.
If without trouble ſhe ſee Death repreſented on
the face of that Body ſhe animates, if ſhe conſider
her own Goods with the ſame Eye that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
the wealth of her Neighbour, if ſhe care
not for pain, and place her contentment in the
poſſeſſion of vertue, What ſervice ſhall paſſions
do her? To what end ſhall ſhe deſire Treaſures
ſince they make her not happy? Why fear evils
ſince ſhe owns not that there is any evil but vice,
whoſe arrival ſhe may prevent by the bare Acts of
her will? Why ſhould Death afright her, ſince
ſhe finds her advantage in it? Why ſhould ſhe call
anger to the vengeance of an injury, ſince ſhe
ſlights it? and why ſhould ſhe draw Joy from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
ſmiles, ſince ſhe places her happineſs in a
good Conſcience? <hi>Paſſions</hi> are then of no uſe to
the Wiſe, it is the weak and ſenſleſs that reſent
them, and if we conſult thoſe very people that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64170:14"/>
have ſhewed them any countenance, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
with us, that they are rather friends to vice
then Vertue, more guilty then innocent, and more
proper to foment then to allay the diſorders of our
Soul.</p>
                  <p>And yet will any believe that Vertue muſt be
idle unleſs ſhe proclaim War againſt Monſters?
and that this noble faculty muſt pine away, unleſs
ſhe fight to Subject the Rebellious, and to range
the Factious into reaſon? She is, without doubt,
too generous to derive her Glory from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of ſo weak Enemies. She judges her
ſelf well enough employed, when forming the
Ornaments of our Soul, and ſlighting the inſolence
of her Slaves, ſhe is buſied about making us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
and Vertuous: When the Sun finiſheth
his courſe, when he withdraws from our Horizon,
that his abſence cauſeth our nights, and ſeeking
another part of the World to enlighten, he is not
leſs powerful then when making our Shadows to
fly away, he guildeth the tops of our hills, and
produces the Enamel of our Gardens and Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.
But as he draws not his light from our
darkneſs, it is hot in other parts though we feel
it not; and he is as abſolute a Monarch in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes

contrary to Natures order the
Slave did often invade the

themſelves in obſerving the

left the Maid to Court the

they made her a Temple, and therein placed their

ſeparated the Philoſophers, for each one exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
his Reaſon upon this, according to his own
apprehenſion, and built a felicity as himſelf fanſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and as they were ignorant of themſelves
they made War againſt each other, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ground of the Quarrel they ſought for
happineſs, but could not find it. They Writ her
praiſes, and knew not wherein ſhe conſiſted, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64170:16"/>
if they did diſcover that ſhe was grafted in ſome
part within them, they knew neither the Name

<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who is politick in all his Works, and ſo

                  <p>If it be no School Treachery not to ſide with
ſo Learned a Maſter, and if a man run not the
hazard of being cenſured by his Schollars for
taking Reaſons part, and pleading <hi>Senecas</hi> cauſe,
I think it may be ſaid ſuch thoughts are too
mean to form a Diſciple of Chriſt, and that his
words are too little generous to make an ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Philoſopher. For who ſhall imagin that things
out of our power ſhould make us happy? and
that Fortune, which is but a <hi>Chimera</hi> ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
the favours which are the Recompences of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64170:17"/>
Vertue. Wherefore ſhould we build our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon Riches; Since our minds are the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azines</hi>
of true wealth, and why ſhould we expect
that from Strangers, which we may beſtow upon
our Selves? Nature is too liberal to deny us our
Deſires: She is too Noble to refuſe us a gift which
ſhe preſerves for us in the Cabinet of our Soul:
and her Guide is too faithful to carry us aſtray
from that good to which we aſpire. Thoſe that
ſo much cry it down have not known the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of it: and had they ſtudied to become as
reaſonable as eloquent, they would have confeſſed
with us, that ſhe is not leſs a Teacher of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
then a Soverain to the Polititians, and the
Miſtreſs of Philoſophers. Vertue is her workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
born in her boſome, and ſo obedient a
Daughter, that ſhe followes her Counſels in all her
Actions. Juſt men own her for
their Mother,<note place="margin">Neſciat juſtus, niſi Secundùm Naturam Vivere; in cujus inſtituto Dei lex eſt. <hi>Ambros</hi> lib. 2. de Abrahamo. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> they pay reſpect
to her Orders, when ever ſhe
commands; and as her Laws are
deſcended from Heaven, they
fear to offend him that ruleth
there, by hearkening to other
Counſels then hers.</p>
                  <p>Morality which boaſteth of governing Men in
their Actions of aiding them in their Needs; of
defending them againſt evil accidents, of comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Vice, of teaching us Vertue, and of making
continency and modeſty familiar to us Mortals,
is uſeleſs to them that obſerve Nature, all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Morality have yet produced but paper
Vertues; and if they have at any time formed a
Philoſopher or a Monarch, the Succeſs is more to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64170:17"/>
be attributed to their own good inclinations then
to the Soundneſs of thoſe Maximes. There are
ſome Nations that avoid Vice and follow Vertue,
without the help of this Moral Guide; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not inſtructed them, are yet ſo Wiſe as to
conquer their paſſions, root out Voluptuouſneſs,
limit deſire, reſiſt ſorrow, and deſpiſe riches. Our
<hi>Country</hi> people may lawfully diſpute the Reward of
Conſtancy with the moſt cloudy browed Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and I know not whether thoſe Diſciples of
Nature do not inſpire thoſe Famous Doctors,
with the Love of Temperance and Juſtice. They
are vertuous without Art, they laugh at Fortunes
diſgraces, they look for Death without terror, and
being perſwaded that it is but a paſſage to Life,
they receive it contentedly. They endure poverty
without complaint; they Practiſe Vertue without
Violence, they bear Sickneſs with patience, and
without runing to Morality for advice, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
patient, juſt and couragious. If their valour
be not ſo ſplendid as that of conquerors, it is not
therefore leſs real; and if their ſobriety be leſs
publiſhed then that of our ſtricteſt <hi>Monaſticks;</hi>
it produceth not fewer chaſt and continent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>And even St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> though an Enemy to the

nothing, that all might be
owned to the aſſiſtance of Jeſus
Chriſt, is aſtoniſhed that Sin
which brought all our Senſes
into a Cloud of Error, darkened our minds,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64170:18"/>
depraved our Wills, and poured into our Souls
the Seeds of all Vice, could not choak the inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
we have for that which is good: that we
ſhould be naturally juſt after our Fathers Revolt,
and guilty as we are, we ſhould retain a Love for
Vertue, and a hatred for her Contrary. Some of
his Diſciples doubted his Arguments, they could
hardly comprehend how that which makes the
Fountain of our Crimes, ſhould be the Original
of our good Deeds, and that, againſt thoſe inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
which he maintains, ſhe often brings forth
perfections inſtead of <hi>Monſters.</hi> They admired
that the firſt Men that ſucceeded in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin,
ſhould become righteous by converſing with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they ſhould put Laws in Practice
which they never read off, and by conſulting this
prudent Mother, they ſhould conceive a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
for their Creator, compaſſionate care
of their Subjects, and an affection for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals.</p>
                  <p>Methinks it is not very hard to clear all theſe
Doubts, and without ſtumbling at the Difficulties
they lay down, it may Suffice to propoſe them a
<hi>Dilemma,</hi> to ſhew them the Truth by day light.
For after <hi>Adam's</hi> fall it muſt be, that either God
forſook his Works, or that he knew Nature po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
enough to do well, without the aid of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Laws. If to augment the guilt of the firſt
Man; or diminiſh the rigor of his puniſhment,
you repreſent God infinitely offended; who juſtly
denies his aſſiſtance to <hi>Adams</hi> Deſcendants, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that you do not equally queſtion both his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and his Mercy, and remember, that you
cannot take from him the Care of his Creatures
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64170:18"/>
without offending his Bounty. But if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that Nature is impotent in the Exerciſes of
Vertue without particular Grace. That Man in
the State of Sin hath more inclination for Vice,
then Vertue, that the one is natural to him and
the other a ſtranger. Where are thoſe command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that brought him back to his Duty? Where
are the Written Laws that decided his Doubts?
Where the promiſes and threats for reward of the
Righteous, and puniſhment of the Wicked? It
muſt then be concluded, that Nature is not ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
but that we may draw ſome advantage
from her. That though we be guilty, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
ſomething of our innocence, and, with a
little Labour to keep her in Breath, we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
Vice, practice Vertue, and triumph over
our Paſſions.</p>

happily, a man need but be
conformable to the Councels
of Reaſon. To apprehend this
Learning well, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
(with <hi>Seneca)</hi> a great
difference between the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the wiſe, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64170:20"/>
Judgment of other Men: For as this is but a bare
opinion that ariſeth from our Fleſh, which erects
her <hi>Empire</hi> in the <hi>Senſes,</hi> and hath no other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
but what proceed from the meaneſt part
of a Man, ſhe ſeeks nothing but ſenſuality, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the deſires thereof, before thoſe of the Soul,
and as a grateful Child, ſpeaks ever well of the
Parent, Opinion is a thing ſo much fixt to the
Earth, that her deſires are limited there, and her
thoughts are ſo little generous, that ſhe ſeeks for
no other goods but what our common Senſe hath
ſet a price upon. The honour ſhe pretends to, is
fickle and vain, her Reſolutions uncertain, her
Counſels dark, and ſhe paſſeth Judgment <hi>expertè.</hi>
If ſome times ſhe have good intervals, and being
hurried by the vanity of the Objects which ſhe
purſueth, ſhe wing her ſelf towards Heaven yet
thoſe agitations are ſo ſhort and inconſtant, that
they laſt but a few moments. She is preſently
ſtagering, if what ſhe deſireth agree not with our
Fleſh. She gives the Title of Error to our choiceſt
thoughts, and pleaſing her ſelf with Novelty, She
ſoon rallies her Counſelers and makes them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
from their firſt advices. But Reaſon is the
Daughter of Heaven, her

                  <p>
                     <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> thought her formed of his Subſtance,
a Branch of the Diety, and as the Sun ſhooteth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64170:21"/>
forth his light without diminution of his Power,
God produced Reaſon from himſelf without
weakening his Nature. Theſe bold words, though
they ſeem to deſtroy our Faith, by which we know
Reaſon to be a part of our Soul, produced by
time, yet it cannot be denyed but that ſhe is an
Image of the Diety, having the Characters of
the Almighties greatneſs and that (without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it Robbery) ſhe imitates thoſe perfections that
render Him (onely) worthy of Adoration. They
alſo which could not comprehend the adorable
Miſtery of the Incarnation, who doubted whether
the Divine Nature were compatible with ours,
and whether He that was begotten from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
could become Man by time, made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of apprehending that God allied Himſelf
to our Soul by Reaſon, and that he communicated
daily with our Spirit by means of this His Image.
Indeed this production ſeemeth to be His legit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate
Daughter, ſince ſhe hath ſo much ſhare in
his glorious qualities, being Heireſs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and beſtowing upon our Souls the ſame
Advantages which ſhe hath received from her
Father. For beſides that ſhe repreſenteth the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of His Perſons by the Trinity of His po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
and ſheweth us, without confuſion, the unity
of His Nature in the diviſion of the faculties
whereof it is compoſed. Reaſon makes her ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
in goodneſs that ſhe never forſakes her
when once ſhe hath owned her, repentance never
ſucceeds her wiſhes, her Counſels are as juſt as her
Deſigns: and ſhe is aſſured ſhe ſhall keep her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
ſo long as all her thoughts pleaſe her, and
that ſhe conſult her in all her undertakings. So
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64170:21"/>
that Reaſon is the moſt excellent part of us, her
glory maketh all our felicity: and a Philoſopher
ſaid truely, that if the Spirit were the Soul of the
Body, Reaſon was the Soul of our Spirit. She is
alſo the moſt Majeſtical part of the Soul: and if
any Philoſophers were found ſo raſh as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
her of that quality, they might boaſt of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deſtroyed her, by doing violence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who value a Man by the abundance of
his Treaſures, who Judg of his Blood, by the long
continued line of his Anceſtors, and place his
good Fortune in the Beauty of his Mannors, his
gaudy Apparel, and the number of his Servants
and Slaves that ſurround him, do plainly diſcover
that they never knew Nature, and that they have
been ignorant that theſe gifts which they ſo much
prize, are favors that God for the moſt part vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
to his Enemies. But to know well the
Excellencies of a Man, &amp; to proportion his eſteem
to his merit, he muſt be viewed in his Shirt: Strip
him of all that Splendor that dazles our Eyes:
conſider him without thoſe Ornaments that ſet
off his Body, and preſs the plummet to the depth
of him, to be informed whether Reaſon hath
preſerved her priviledges in him, if ſhe have not
ſuffered her ſelf to be abuſed by common opinion,
if <hi>Paſſions</hi> have not deceived her, and if ſhe have
not permitted Forraign Commodities to prejudice
the Productions of her own Countrey, to cheat
her Subjects, and debauch her Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledg with our Divines, that Reaſon is
weakened and conceiveth proud deſigns, that her
lights are darkened by Sin, and that ſhe is ſubject
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64170:22"/>
to illuſions ſince her revolt againſt God. I confeſs
that the Soul ſince her diſobedience, is light in
her undertakings, and embraceth falſhood for
truth, that ſhe often ſides with Vice, and ſeldom
takes part with Vertue. To enlarge upon theſe
defects, and to add to her own diſorders the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of her Body, I do know that they agree
not, that this Earth plays the Rebel againſt the
Sun that enlightens it, and that overwhelming
the Laws of Nature, the Miſtreſs becomes often
the Captive of her Slave: Briefly, I know that
in her operations ſhe hath need of the Organs
of this Tyrant, ſeeing with his Eyes, hearing with
his Eares, judging of the diverſity of taſtes by
his Tongue, and that ſhe would be condemned to
perpetual ignorance, if theſe parties concerned
undertook not to inform her of their knowledg
of Colors, of Sounds, of the ſoftneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Objects; <hi>How be it</hi> theſe diſorders deſtroy
not her good inclinations: She is undiſtracted
in her miſery, the advantages ſhe had in her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
are not loſt by her fall; and although ſhe be
thought blind, ſhe can yet find out the Truth
in the midſt of ſenſual illuſions. She is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in all her Enterprizes, that with a little Care
to redreſs her, ſhe gives us freſh aſſurances of her
fidelity: thoſe Remains of Light that are yet in
her ſince the State of innocence, put her in mind
of her firſt Glories; and although ſhe be guilty,
ſhe is yet righteous enough not to commit any
thing unworthy of her Birth. Her diſobedience
cauſed her ſubmiſſion: She knows God after ſhe
hath offended him. She emplores his aid when
ſhe remembers her contempt of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64170:22"/>
and as ſhe findeth her ſelf bound to reſtore
what ſhe hath robbed Him of, ſhe obligeth the
Soul to acknowledg Him her only Soveraign. The
<hi>Meſſengers</hi> ſhe ſends abroad for forraign intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
cannot deceive her unleſs ſhe pleaſe, their
falſhoods make her prudent, and if they be cunning
enough to give her falſe informations, they are
neither ſo powerful nor induſtrious as to perſwade
her into the belief of them. That <hi>Priſon</hi> that
ſurrounds her cannot arreſt her thoughts. The
Diſeaſes that weaken her Body, cannot touch her:
and as if ſhe held no commerce with the Earth;
She remains at Liberty in the midſt of her Fetters,
and keeps her health in an infected habitation.
If <hi>Paſſions</hi> are able to obſtruct her operations,
if they can cool that Fire that makes her Act as
a Commander in chief, they are not able to put it
out: and if Sin have disfigured this living Image
of God, it hath not been able to deface her firſt
lineaments, the impious perceive her in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries,
if their Mouth protect them, Reaſon
condemns them, if the night favour their Crimes,
the Sun laies them open: and it's but ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to have Companions in Sin, when they find
every where a Witneſs to accuſe them, a Judg to
condemn them, and the Executioner to puniſh

                  <p>SOme modern Philoſophers ſeem to wonder
that the leaſt of all Cauſes, ſhould, in our
Actions, be of the greateſt uſe. That the
End which ſubſiſteth but in <hi>Idaea,</hi> ſhould
be the <hi>Motive</hi> of all our works; and that that which
hath ſo little ſhare in all humane productions,
ſhould be ſo neceſſary a <hi>Midwife</hi> to bring them
forth. They build their opinions upon <hi>Ariſtotles</hi>
diſcourſe, and as they Learn of him, that that
which hath no being muſt needs be barren, and
that nothing can be drawn from it but what is
imaginary, they conclude, that ſeeing the End
is nothing in ſubſtance, and that its being depends
on our intelects, it can conceive nought but <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's,</hi>
and bring forth nothing but conceited ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions.
Others ſomewhat
more ingenious,<note place="margin">

its ſubſiſtence is not ſo ſenſible
as that of the matter; that
its manner of operation is different from that
of the Form, and efficient Cauſe; and that when
this unites the Soul with the Body, and maketh
them agree in one, the End doth but figure out
<hi>Idaea's;</hi> and form imaginary Reſemblances. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64170:23"/>
convinced by the deductions of the firſt of
Philoſophers, they avow that if the End be not
the more Noble of the four principles, ſhe is how
ever the moſt neceſſary: and that if ſhe make leſs
ſhew then her Companions, ſhe hath ſo much the
aſcendant of them, as to make their operations
Suitable to her Deſigns. True it is that all our
Projects would be monſtrous if our intentions
prevented not their birth: and Nature, that is ſo
regular in her Works, would commit nothing but
Debaucheries, if ſhe directed them not to the End
appointed by her Maker; As Goodneſs is the
moſt illuſtrious Object of Morality, and all that
is there intreated of, tends to the acquiſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
we are not to wonder if all men ſeek her, if
the guilty as well as the innocent court her: and
if ſhe often procure her ſelf real Lovers, by the
bare appearance of Goodneſs. When a Tyrant
oppreſſeth his people, ranſacks his Neighbours
Countries, depriveth the innocent of Liberty, and
to enlarge his Frontiers, intrencheth upon thoſe
Bounds where wiſe Nature had limited his
Authority, Policy which is always ſelf intereſſed,
excuſeth all theſe diſorders by Pretext of a greater
Good: and the advantages ſhe hopeth for, by
weakning the Subject, and ruining the Enemy,
ſeem conſiderable enough to juſtify ſuch iniquities
when a Criminal is accuſed, and brought before
the Judg, finding himſelf engaged to ſhew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
in the matters layed to his Charge; he
borroweth a good Countenance to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
and as there is no man ſo impious, as in his
Crime, purely to intend Evil, he throweth his
offence upon the ſincerity of his intentions.</p>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64170:24"/>
Goodneſs is ſo Natural to Man, that he cannot
looſe the Love of her: and
when ignorance hides her
Truth from him,<note place="margin">Bonum eſt, quod omnes appetunt. <hi>Ariſt.</hi> Eth.</note> or that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
cheats him in the ſearch
of her, he forbears not to Scuffle for her, and to
catch at all her Reſemblances. The <hi>Academia</hi> that
made profeſſion of underſtanding her Eſſence,
is of this an evident proof: for deſigning to form
a Felicity that ſhould ſurpaſs all our deſires, they
invented happineſſes, that have hitherto only bore
the Name. They would have it to conſiſt in the
health of the Body, that Pleaſure ſhould be its
inſeparable Companion; that Fortitude ſhould
have no other employment, but to defend and
preſerve its healthful ſtate, and that Beauty, which
is but the Feminine ornament, was part of a
<hi>Wiſe Mans Felicity.</hi> As Experience taught theſe
Diſciples that health was a fountain that watered
all the parts with her perfections, that its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
conſiſted in a good intelligence with the
Elements; and that all the Favours of Nature loſt
their Splender in an infirm Body, they ſet up health
as the Principle of their Felicity: They averred
that to live happily it was neceſſary to have a
ſound Body; and that all our other Faculties were
uſeleſs to us, when the viſage had loſt its Color,
and the Members their ſtrength, and when the
food, that was for our nouriſhment, became of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
to the Eyes. They compared health to a
Calm Sea: They would have it, that as this
favored the <hi>Alcyons</hi> in laying their Eggs, and in
bringing forth their young; the other aſſiſted the
Conqueror in the obtaining of Victories, Princes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64170:24"/>
in the Conduct of their Subjects, <hi>Artificers</hi> in their
Labours, Orators in their Praiſes of vertue, and
Philoſophers in outbraving their misfortunes.
That it was health that charmed the diſturbances
of our Life, and that we ſhould be condemned
as eternally miſerable, if this did not ſweeten the
Travels of our <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> and change part of our
miſeries into delights.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Philoſophers had well ſtudied the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man's chief happineſs, and not ranſact
the Fleſh for matter wherewith to content the
mind, I perſwade my ſelf, that in ſeeking to be
happy, they would have put ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their own felicity and that of <hi>brute Beaſts:</hi>
and that diſtinguiſhing their own condition from
that of impious perſons, they would have learnt
that that which entertaineth vice, &amp; nouriſheth all
our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> could not be a Principle of their
Felicity. For albeit that ſin be familiar to us,
that we bear the ſeeds thereof in our Souls, and
that to will the commiſſion of it be ſufficient to
make us guilty. Mean while
it is never more dangerous
then when it meets with aids
to ſecond it,<note place="margin">Nuſquam pejus, quam in ſano corpore, animus aeger habitat. <hi>Petr.</hi>
                     </note> then when it
cauſeth our advantages to
ſerve its deſigns, and when by the health of our
Body, it throws Infection into our Souls. There
are ſome Men that know not what Vertue is till
they become impotent in Vice: Sickneſs muſt
diſable them, to cure them of ſin; and they would
never call to mind that Hell may be one day the
place of their puniſhment, if the enflaming feaver
did not feed upon their Intrails. Others there are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64170:25"/>
that owe their innocence to the abſence of health:
their Method of Life would be always criminal,
if they were not ſometimes infirm, and if ſome
violent agitations did not overthrow their deſigns,
they might be ranckt in the Number of diſſolute
Perſons. As health is a benefit as frail as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
God beſtows it but on few, the Men of
great action have been ever much concerned:
thoſe high Enterprizes that have diſturbed the
whole World, have afforded them little reſt, the
violent eruptions of their ſpirits, weakned the
activity of their Bodies: and if to be in health
were to be happy, it might be concluded, that
<hi>Wiſe Men</hi> are miſerable the one half of their
Lives.</p>
                  <p>Beauty is but a reſult of health, and as ſubject
to decay as the principle to alteration; Yet have
we ſome Philoſophers that love her, that preſent
her with praiſes, after vows of affection, and by
a blindneſs, the more blamable for being volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
fancy her to be the ſecond part of their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
they call her the Mate of Vertue, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
her to be Divinely animated, and will have
it, that ſhe doth not leſs influence the Souls of <hi>Wiſe
men,</hi> then the imagination of Fools. To hear
them diſcourſe, She is the delight of all our Senſes:
and although ſhe be the moſt pleaſing object of
our ſight, yet is ſhe the raviſhment of our Eares
in the recital of her perfections. If we believe
ſome Heathen, the Gods themſelves, behold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here below more glorious then a face on
which they have beſtowed their favours, and men
draw not more vanity from any thing what ever,
then to find themſelves inriched with a benefit,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64170:25"/>
that appears without difficulty and may be enjoyed
without Envy. For ſhe exerciſeth ſo abſolute a
Dominion upon humane conceit, that ſhe converts
all that behold her into Lovers: the perſecutors
of the innocent, are friends to
her:<note place="margin">Pulchritudo eòs, qui ipſam ſentiunt, amicos reddit &amp; inimicum Neminem Sibi fieri per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit. <hi>Stob.</hi> Serm. 68.</note> and more happy then
Vertue it ſelf, ſhe hath not yet

Do but ſee her, and you love her: when
you have once ſeen her, you cannot be her Enemy:
and her allurements are ſo potent, that ſhe takes
us from our ſelves, at her very firſt appearance to
our Eyes.</p>
                  <p>But alas, who is there that may not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

that a Benefit, which hath all
its glory from our opinion, is
too light to ſatisfy our deſires,

and as if all thoſe lines in their foreheads, were ſo

neceſſary that Pleaſure ſhould make the laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

but an even temper of the Body, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
which proceedeth from the mixture of the

and that the vigor of the Body have its
dependance on the heat and Humidity of the
Blood, yet the good offices which health rendereth
unto her Land-Lord are conſiderable enough to
gain ſome reputation in the Schools. For it is
ſhe that preſerves his comlineſs, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates

which gives him ſtrength to conteſt with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes

it is a Treaſure ſurpaſſing all the Riches of the

Earth. If Beauty have her frailties, if her Empire
laſt but few days, and if after ſhe hath triumphed
over a ſmall number of Slaves, ſhe become the
ſpoil of old Age or of Death, ſhe hath perfections
which procure her reverence, the reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
worſhip their Creator in his Image, vertue
ſerves it ſelf of her in communicating with her
Lovers, and as if the ſplendor of Beauty aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the Majeſty of vertue, ſhe takes pleaſure
to employ her, when ſhe Acts the Soveraign in the
hearts of the Sons of Men.</p>
                  <p>But pleaſure is infamous, in what ſhape ſoever
ſhe be dreſt. She is aſhamed to apear in publick;
they who protect, condemn her, they ſeek for
darkneſs to poſſeſs her and knowing that ſhe is as
common to the Beaſts as to us; they blame her
in all their diſcourſes ſhe is of ſo Malignant a
humor that ſhe turneth all our delights to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes
or puniſhments. She courteth not vertue
but to corrupt or ſeduce her. If ſhe give her Slaves
a ſmile, 'tis but to deceive them, and more cruel
then Tyrants ſhe paies reſpect to her Enemies and
gives death to them that are her ſworn faithful
Servants. Yet have we found Philoſophers who
have pleaded for her, and forceing vertue to take
her for a handmaid would afterwards perſwade us
that the Miſtreſs and this Maid held a very good
correſpondence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that ſage Profeſſor of delights im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined
that Man was born to enjoy her. That
pleaſure ought to be the ſeaſoning of all his actions,
and that after he had paid his honors to vertue,
it was lawful for him to aſpire to the enjoyment
of her Slave. As he makes her to aſſiſt at her
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64170:28"/>
Triumphals, he will have her the conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of her Labours: in all her occupations
he renders her aſſiſtance neceſſary, he is of opinion
that Fortitude it ſelf would fail if the pleaſure
which ſhe expects from the rout of an Enemy,
did not Spirit her to Battel: and that temperance
would be little concerned for the regulation of our
Paſſions, if ſhe were not ſpurred on as well by
delight as utility. In fine he ſayeth that pleaſure
to a wiſe Man is no diſhonorable companion, that
the Slave might be courted without wrong to her
Miſtreſs; and that the converſation of diſſolute
Women was not more unſuitable to Philoſophers
then <hi>Zenos</hi> diſciples amongſt the <hi>Academians.</hi> I
know that <hi>Seneca</hi> labours to juſtify this opinion in
ſome part of his Writings: and having arraigned
the ſence given it by them of the party, he forms
the Authors apology. As if he had been of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
with <hi>Epicurus</hi> rather then with Truth,
he takes part with him againſt his adverſaries, he
aſſerteth that the pleaſure whereof he treateth is
modeſt, that her humor is not leſs auſtere then that
of vertue, and that if ſhe put on the pleaſing orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a more cheerful countenance, it is but
with leſs difficulty to gain her Miſtreſs a greater
number of Lovers.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould readily ſubſcribe to this opinion, and
it were ſufficient to know that it proceeds from
<hi>Seneca,</hi> to receive it with reverence. But as moſt

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64170:28"/>
of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that <hi>Seneca</hi> is not of their
Party, though ſome words have run from his
Pen to their advantage. If he give a favorable
Explication of their Maſters meaning, they owe
it to the greatneſs of his civility: he gives him
combat too often, to approve the moſt ſordid of
his opinions and when he

pleaſure,<note place="margin">Voluptas, cùm maximè delectat, extinguitur, nec Multum loci habet, itaque citò implet &amp; tedio eſt, &amp; poſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum impetum marcet. <hi>Sen.</hi> de vita beata. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> and the merit of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

all Gods works to be perfect, and giving an
Earthly conſtruction to the words of that famous
Man <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhe beſtows the quality of goodneſs

elevated above that of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as the Valor of
Women is beneath the Courage of the <hi>Hero's,</hi>
alloweth nothing to be good but vertue, ſhe cannot
endure that that which countenanceth the vicious

Moſt rich men have made themſelves guilty by
wealth, and thoſe famous criminals that at this
day are the ſhame of their Poſterity, might have
paſſed for innocent perſons, if Gold had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
their wicked deſigns. If we believe the
moſt Learned of the Apoſtles,
Riches are the root of all evil,<note place="margin">Radix omnicum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum, cupiditas. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </note>
and the ruin of all our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
It is mony that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64170:30"/>
all our crimes, taught Children to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon the Life of their Parents, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the death of them that brought them into
the World. It was this that ſhewed the covetous
to oppreſs the innocent, to ruin Families, rob the
Church and make bare her Alters. It was this
that tempted friends to break their faith, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to ſport with Princes heads. It was this that
furniſht incontinent perſons with matter to gratify
thier luſts, to deprive Women of their chaſtity,
and their Husbands of their Lives, in fine Wealth
hath over turned Kingdoms, confounded Families,
and ruined private Men. But if Gold were not
the cauſe of all this confuſion in the World, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
were not perſecuted by the covetous, and
if Juſtice were not corruptible by an inſatiable
deſire of wealth, it would ſtill be fatal to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
And to oblige us to diſeſteem ſo dangerous
a Weapon it may ſuffice to know, that it faileth
not either to deſtroy or to wound us. Pride and
fear are its inſeperable companions: theſe <hi>Paſſions</hi>
which ſeem rather to be contrary then different,
become agreed to Plague the Avaricious, and teach
theſe terreſtrial Souls that they cannot be wealthy
without being miſerable. For if by means of their
Treaſures, they deſign to make their Houſes vie
with Kings Palaces if by Gold they procure favor
at Court, if their Enemies become their Slaves,
and if they ſhare in all thoſe delights that compoſe
the felicities of the happy men of this World,
they grow inſolent, and extracting vanity from
the magnificence of their Buildings, the luxury
of their Aparrel, and the number of their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
they are not leſs injurious to their inferiors,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64170:31"/>
then troubleſome to their equals. But if a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
Surpriſe them, if fortune ceaſe to cajole
them, and if experience teach them that wealth
hath Wings, that a Tyrant may ſeize their Eſtates,
and that fortune, of whom they were borrowed
may demand payment when ſhe pleaſes, they
tumble ſuddenly into fear, their lofty humor is
changed into dejection they fear the future by the
accidents already befallen them; and their cares
for preſervation, ſwallow up all the delights which
before filled them with vanity. Riches are ſo
dangerous to man, that he can hardly poſſeſs them
without guilt, and their uſe is ſo ſeemingly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that he cannot eaſily reſolve to quit them for
fear of being miſerable: his reſt is incompatible
with the poſſeſſion of mony, he ceaſeth to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
when once he hath attained wealth, and as
he knoweth that Ambuſcades are laid for that
Metle of which he hath formed his Idol, he is no
leſs afraid of the familiarity of his friends, then
the power of Princes, and the hatred of thoſe that
envy his Proſperity. He ſuſpects the embraces
of her who is in his boſome, the reverend appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his Children puts him into doubts; and
knowing that Gold hath cauſed Children and
Wives to betray their Love and Obedience to
Husband and Father, he feareth and ſtands upon
his Guard to both.<note place="margin">Divitias Nego bonum eſſe: nam ſi eſſent, bonos facerint. Nunc, quoniam, quod apud malos deprehenditur, dici bonum Non poteſt, hoc illis nomen Nego: <hi>Sen.</hi> de vita beat. <hi>cap.</hi> 24.</note> They then

                  <p>As honor is vain, moſt commonly the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of vice, and inſeparable from wealth, it muſt
create no wonder if the effect be as empty as the
cauſe, and if ſhe looſe that Title ſo often as ſhe
forſaketh vertue, to adorn her Enemy. The great
Pomp of Princes is not an infallible token of their
Juſtice, their Actions, which would merit puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the perſon of their Subjects, are recorded
to their praiſe; and if ſucceſs favor their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
they never fail of Orators to magnify their
wiſedom turn their crimes into Vertues, call their
Murders victories and their uſurpations legitimate
Conqueſts. The fighting of a ſingle duel, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
chaſtiſement in a private Gentleman; But
a King is never more eſteemed, then when he ſacks
whole Cities, Plunders Provinces, depopulates
Kingdoms, and converteth the moſt flouriſhing
Realms of the Earth into enhabitable Countries.
But without buſying my ſelf about mans Injuſtice,
and to ſhew that honor is not always the price of
good behaviour, and that ſhe is oftner the portion
of crime then the reward of goodneſs, it is enough
to conſider that even they which ſo highly extol
her, do confeſs that ſhe is but a forreign commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
which is as little at our ſervice as her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
Wealth, and that as the one is a dependant
of Fortune, the other ſubſiſteth in popular opinion,
which cauſed ſome who had ſeen the vanity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64170:32"/>
to look out for more ſolid Principles to build
honor upon, and finding by Experience that ſo
fickle a Judg would not be long in Love with one
and the ſame thing, they ſearched the Ages paſt
for Pillars to ſupport this light Structure. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
then that envy raked not in the Aſhes of
their Anceſtors, that their Reputation was no more
the Babe of chance, that Fortune bare reverence
to their Valor, and Men to their memories, they
boaſted of their Birth, they thought the Grandeurs
of the Progenitors would render their off-ſpring
illuſtrious, and being Heires to their wealth they
ought to partake in the glory of their Actions.
They ſought for natural Reaſons to juſtify theſe
conceits, they maintained that Gentility had no
leſs power upon its deſcendants then Yeomandry,
and that as the one bequeathed their ruddy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
to their Children; and as ſome diſeaſes
were Hereditary to whole Families, the other
might lay claim to the honors that had made their
Predeceſſors ſo famous upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>But ſurely theſe ſucceeded no better then the
former, and if the Principles from which they
fetch their Reaſons ſeem to be leſs weak then the
opinion of an intereſſed Populace, the good they
contend for is ſo little related to the felicity of
Man, that they cannot aſſign it the leaſt ſhare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <p>The Laws which eſtabliſh the Heirs of Families,

that its not poſſible to be made happy by what we
poſſeſs not, that a Benefit to make a Man happy,
muſt be in his power, and that felicity depends ſo
much on our Will, that we may beſtow it upon

that Fortune which bruiſeth Scepters in the hands

which takes pleaſure in reducing the Gods
of the Earth to the condition of the meaneſt
Bondmen, hath not yet bin able to make her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</p>
                  <p>But as ſhe is the whole felicity of her Lovers,
ſhe wills that they be ſatisfyed with her delights
only, and permits them not by courting of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearances to turn thoſe things, which may
divert her Love, into objects of their affections.
To ſpeak truely all the things which we love with
ſo much <hi>Paſſion,</hi> have nothing of certainty but the
miſeries that attend them: the toil and labours
we undergo to obtain them, the fear of their loſs
after ſuch troubleſome acquiſition, the cares we
employ to ſecure them, the grief we reſent when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64170:35"/>
they are taken from us, are not ſo much the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our wants, as of their own Malignity,
and it is not leſs eaſie to reſolve, whether poverty
with its incommodities, be more ſupportable then
abundance, with all its inſeparable torments.
But Vertue is a benefit as ſolid as delightful, her
favors are above Fortunes reach, and although ſhe
deſpiſe the wealth of the avaricious, the Pride
of the ambitious, and the paſtimes of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
ſhe doth nevertheleſs ſatisfy the deſires of
all her real Suitors. She is their happineſs as well
as their glory; the excellency of Vertue needs no
off-ſets, and ſhe is ſo jealous of her Lovers, that
ſhe will not admit their addreſſes to any thing elſe
when once they have choſen her for their Miſtreſs.
For if ſhe alone make not a Wiſe man happy, and
if any thing elſe can be found in Nature to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
her title and quality, who ſhould reſolve to
love her, ſince a Man muſt often put himſelf in
great hazard to obtain her? who would be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to her, ſince ſhe rejects what we eſteem, and
cannot inrich us but by teaching us to be poor?
Thoſe alliances which are ſo eſſential to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to preſerve them in peace, and ſo uſeful to
Families to maintain their concord, would be
burthenſome to Men if any doubt could be put
upon that Principle of Vertue, the Shepheards
would drive her from their Huts, as well as Kings
from their Court, and remembring that friendſhips
are often contracted by the loſs of the goods of
the Body and of Fortune, they would caſt off a
Vertue that inſtead of procuring them Benefits
ſtrips them naked; ſtrength would be odious to
Conquerors, ſhe who hath ſo often trampled upon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64170:36"/>
the ſubdued world might complain of the want
of aſſiſtants, and though ſhe be powerful enough
to attract admirers, few would be encouraged to
fight Battels, or attack the Enemy at the hazard
of their Lives and Fortunes. Gratitude would
be vexatious, if we were to exerciſe it at the loſs
of our Eſtates: and ſhe who teacheth us that it is
more glory to give then to receive, would ceaſe
to be our delight, if opinion could perſwade us,
that that which we return is part of the good
deed, that we muſt beggar our ſelves to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the good offices of a friend, and that
the ſame Vertue which raiſed us that friend, is not
ſufficient to acknowledg his favors. But to ſtay
no longer about raiſing the price of Vertue above
the goods of the Body and of Fortune, who ſees
not that Man is too generous a Creature to lodg
his felicity in ſuch periſhable commodities, and
which cannot eſtabliſh him in their poſſeſſion
without making him the moſt unhappy of all
created beings? For if he believe that to live
contented he muſt feed himſelf with delicate
Meats, and ſeek wherewith to awaken his dull
appetite in the diverſity of Meſſes, the Beaſts that
brouze the Graſs of the Field will in nothing give
way to him, they eat with more delight then he,
they taſt the ſuperfluities of the Earth with more
pleaſure, then do the Gourmandizers of <hi>Ragouſts</hi>
and admirable ſauces, and that hunger which
ſeldom forſakes them, makes all they eat delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
If he will imagin that to be happy, he muſt
ſwim in fleſhly delights, and turn voluptuouſneſs
top-ſide-turvy to find matter wherewith to divert
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64170:36"/>
his ſenſualities the <hi>Savage Creatures</hi> have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of him, and take in pleaſure with more
delight then he.</p>
                  <p>The uſe they make of it is not ſeconded with
repentance or ſhame, and as their deſires are more
regular then ours, they perform the acts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without weakning themſelves, and beget their
like, ſcarce looſing any of their own ſubſtance.
But if man will place his glory in the perfections
of his Body, and will conclude that the benefit
of his ſenſes contributeth to his felicity, he will
be conſtrained to acknowledg that the irrational
Creatures are therein more excellent then he. The
ſight is more peircing in <hi>Eagles,</hi> the taſt more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in <hi>Monkies,</hi> the feeling more delicate in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To make Judgment then of the dignity of a
Man, the way is not to enquire if he ranſack Sea
and Land to adorn his Table, if his Meats be
curiouſsy Cooked if he be
ſerved in Gold and Cryſtal,<note place="margin">Nemo iſtorum, quos di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitiae honoreſque in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiore faſtigio ponunt, magnus eſt: quare ergo magnus Videtur? cùm baſi illum ſuâ Metiris, non eſt magnus pumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, licèt in monte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiterit. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 76.</note>

of that chearfullneſs which appeareth in his
countenance, and whether he hath not any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
but what are conformable to Nature and

he cannot ſtray by following them, and that

rich that the poſſeſſion of her is alone ſufficient
to vie advantages with the Nobility, Empires
with Monarchs, Wealth with avaricious perſons,
and pleaſures with voluptuous Men.</p>
                  <p>For it is ſhe that draws us towards our Maker,
that reſtores us to our Ancient Dignities, that

it is knowledg that teacheth men Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that entertaineth Learned men with the
Miracles of Nature, that diſabuſeth the ignorant
of their Errors, and ſtirs up Philoſophers to the
diſcovery of Truths which they knew not. But
ſhe is ſo unſteady and her humor hath ſo little
Coherence with the objects ſhe hunts after, that
ſhe makes game of all ſhe meets with and ſhe is
ſo violent in her purſuits, that no man hath yet
been ſeen that was able to reſiſt her fury. It is a
Worm that gnaweth in every ones Brain, an Itch
that (without reſpect of perſons) tormenteth both
the wicked and the vertuous, a ſickneſs that unites
joy and ſorrow in the perſon of them that have it,
and he that knoweth her Nature will confeſs,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64170:38"/>
that nothing is more common in the World then
this diſtemper, we find nothing more unjuſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more inſatiable: She undertakes voiages
and runs over all the Earth, to find out ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
ſhe takes upon her to know the ſecrets of
Nature, and to unfold by what artifice this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Mother bringeth forth Gold in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
by what Vertue ſhe hardeneth water into Cryſtal,
and converts the dew of Heaven into Pearles, by
what means the <hi>Adamant</hi> attracts the <hi>Needle</hi> with

being bruiſed in peices it preſerveth a <hi>Quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

She aſcends the Heavens without the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of evil Spirits, there ſhe examines how the
Sun forms the meaſure of time, how he divides
the Seaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proportioneth his Circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
She contriveth perſpectives to diſcern his
Magnitude, ſhe draws him to a deſcent that ſhe
may look into the matter whereof he is made,
and without fear of being ſinged with his heat,
or blinded with his brightneſs, ſhe climbeth his
Globe to judg of his Nature. We find men now
adays ſo curious that they reverſe the method of
time to ſatisfy their deſire of Novelties, they riſe
by night to lay wait for the Moon in her courſe,
her borrowed light is not without charms power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enough to attract their affections: and though
the <hi>Poets</hi> make her the Miſtreſs of reſt, ſhe becomes
often the tormentor of <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> and curious
perſons; they deſcry Clouds in her, which (if you
believe theſe ingenious Artiſts) are nothing leſs
then new Worlds, wherein they deſcribe Cities,
Provinces, and Governments, and without giving
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64170:38"/>
themſelves the trouble of telling us which of the
Apoſtles preached the Goſpel there, whether the
<hi>Roman Pontiff</hi> be head of the Church in thoſe
Worlds, whether the Spirit and Water compoſe
their Baptiſm as they do ours, they multiply
Temples and form a Communion of our Saints
with thoſe planetary Inhabitants. This diligent
curioſity admitteth of ſome pardon, becauſe ſhe
hurts only ſuch as give way to her ſurpriſals, they
are tormented by the ſame vanity by which they
were tempted and it may be ſaid that the error
and blindneſs that attend it, are the cure of an
evil of which they were the cauſe. But we find
ſome men, who daring to act
the petty Gods,<note place="margin">Aurea prima ſata eſt aetas, quae vindice nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, Sponte ſua, ſine lege, fidem rectumque cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. <hi>Ovid.</hi> 1. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moph.</note> are curious in
nothing but the diſcovery of
other Mens faults, all their
ſtudy tends to the ſounding of
their Neighbours Conſcience,
they deſcend to the depth of

notwithſtanding they are Slaves to their

unworthily confound it with the crimes and ſins

                  <p>If I am no <hi>Moliniſt,</hi> if I confeſs that I underſtand
not that competent or midway knowledg by him

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64170:39"/>
Freedom of the Creator in all his operations, if
I own no other knowledg in him but what had
the ancient Divines for approbators, if I cannot
endure that his power ſhould be rendred weak or
imperfect, and that it ſhould be made dependant
on ſecond cauſes in its working, yet do I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
approve all the Doctrin of his adverſaries:
they are too rigid in moſt of their opinions to
invite me into their Party; and how much ſoever
they are flattered in the Juſtice of their cauſe, let
them proteſt that they undertake but to diſcover
the confuſion that ſin hath wrought man into,
and the neceſſity of the grace of Jeſus Chriſt to
reſtore him: they ſeem to me too ſevere when
they at once paſs the ſentence of condemnation
upon all good works of the Heathen, and allow
none to be upright or ſincere but ſuch as proceed
from Faith.</p>
                  <p>For if Vertue be nothing more then a habitude
acquired by multiplied Acts of
Reaſon,<note place="margin">Non ex regulâ jus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur, ſed ex jure quod eſt, regula fit. <hi>L.</hi> prima <hi>F.</hi> de reg. jur.</note> and if Reaſon be a
Law of God imprinted in our
hearts, who ſhall believe that
Man becometh guilty in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
this guid? that he merits chaſtiſements by
living according to his Inſtructions? &amp; that vertue,
who is always innocent, ſhould be nothing different
from Vice, for not being elevated by faith, and
juſtified by the grace of the Son of God? ſin may
have raviſht our original righteouſneſs, but it hath
not been able to rob us of natural purity; if it were
potent enough to corrupt our nature, it was not
ſufficiently powerful to deſtroy it; and if he that
committed the firſt crime were abſolutely able to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64170:39"/>
bring all his Children into that revolt, he may
boaſt of not having made ſo many guilty as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
ſucceſſors. The ſickneſs they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
hinders not the performance of healthy
actions, we may exerciſe Vertue though we be
fallen from our excellency, we may love God,
although we be born his Enemies, and as Birds
do walk though their wings be clipt, we may
perform actions that are good according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
although not meritorious without grace.
The Example of the <hi>Patriarcks</hi> is of this a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
proof, their life was pleaſing to God,
although they were guilty of their Fathers crime,
they became his friends without any reconciliation,
they eſchewed evil before the Sacraments had
healed their wounds, and to ſpeak after the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the great Doctor of the Gentiles, they
obſerved his Commands before they knew any
of his Laws.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak properly all Chriſtian inſtructions are
but ſo many Commentaries upon their Lives,
which being Written for our Learning, we become
Vertuous by imitating their actions: if holy
men have taught us piety, it hath been by conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
theſe primitive Doctors, and even in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi>
opinion, that Vertue which renders to every
one his due is not ſo much the effect of opinion,
as the product of nature and conſcience, we can
tell what Vertue is before we are taught it, and
we have an abhorrance of Vice though we never
ſaw its deformities. When God Almighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
man the obſervance of his Laws, he made
uſe of termes ſo plainly ſimple that the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi>
are at their Arts end about the explication thereof,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64170:40"/>
it was enough to give us the knowledg of his will
without adding the Reaſon of it, he knew it to
be a ſufficient juſtification of his decrees againſt
the tranſgreſſor to ſay thou ſhalt not kill, and thou
ſhalt not commit Adultery, for the Law of Nature
prohibiting impudicity and homicide, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
but few words in the publication of the two
moſt important of his Commandments. When
<hi>Cain</hi> had perſued the criminal tract of his Fathers
offence, when he had committed the firſt murder
upon his Brothers perſon and when paſſion had
armed him with weapons to bereave him of Life,
whom by the Law of nature he was bound to love
and cheriſh, the Scripture obſerves that he was
both witneſs and Judg againſt himſelf, that he
condemned himſelf to death before he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
his crime became both his puniſhment and
tormentor: and without having yet received any
written Law forbidding <hi>Parricide,</hi> he confeſſeth
that his ſin was too great to be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>As the Law of Nature is not one thing in thoſe
firſt Men, and another in the Heathen; As both
one and the other are governed by the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and as Conſcience is a
faithful indifferent Judg in
both,<note place="margin">Peccatum eſt, dictum factum vel concupitum contra legem aeternam. <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. 22. contra cauſt. ergo illam ſervare non eſt peccatum.</note> they condemn ſin and
approve its contrary, they are
dejected after a crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and rejoyce in well
doing, they know that the one
eſtrangeth them from God, and that by the other
they draw nigh unto him, and without having any
other guide then Reaſon, they know by the End
propoſed to themſelves the innocence or guilt of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64170:40"/>
their actions. If then all their Vertues were
falſe, and if all their good works were real ſins,
I do not ſee why they ſhould not indifferently
afflict themſelves in the Commiſſion of Vice and
the practiſing of Vertue, why they ſhould not
complain that being created free <hi>Agents,</hi> they are
conſtrained to commit offences againſt their will,
that they are made guilty for obſerving the Law
of Nature, and that they are condemned to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
puniſhments for ſuccouring their Neighbor,
ſerving their Country, for taking Armes in defence
of a good cauſe, and putting their lives in hazard
to prevent the raviſhing of Women, the robbing
of the Fatherleſs, and the oppreſſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrin ſeemeth ſo rational to them that
maintain it, that they judg it needleſs to borrow
any arguments from Divines to make out the
truth of it, and if the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> had not
cenſured the contrary opinion, it were more then
ſufficient to ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt delivers it to
his Apoſtles, and gives it authority by his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
that all Chriſtians might be obliged to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it. When he teacheth his Diſciples how to
walk amongſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> he exhorts them to
follow their inſtructions: though he condemn their
practice, he directs them to eſteem their Doctrin,
though he forbid: them the imitation of their
manners, and invites them to reverence their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
though he charge their actions with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
reproaches. As we commend the Vertue of
an Enemy, and prefer a publique good above a
private hatred, he diſtinguiſheth their good works
from their ſins, he approves their Vertues and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64170:41"/>
deteſts their Vices, and putting a difference between
the works of God, and the practice of vicious
Men, he commends the words that proceed from
their mouth, and blames the hidden malice of
their hearts, and the ſcandal which they cauſed
unto others.</p>
                  <p>This Truth is ſo conſtant, that to conſult the
ancient Fathers, is ſufficient to confirm her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
in their belief; and though St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſeem to be of a different ſentiment, yet in many
parts of his Writings he forbeareth not to approve
it. He aſcribes the flouriſhing of <hi>Rome's</hi> common
Wealth to the Juſtice of her Laws; he aſſerts
that the uprightneſs of her Subjects had ſubdued
more Enemies then the courage of her Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that they poſſeſt the moſt famous Empire
of the World as the reward of their Vertues;
and that though God would not make them the
Companions of Angels in Heaven, becauſe they
were Infidels, yet he gave them
the command of the whole
Earth,<note place="margin">Romani Mundi impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium acceperunt à Deo, in remunerationem vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum ſuarum morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> apud <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> becauſe they were ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.
When he writes to
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> he declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
openly to be of their
Party: he delights in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to him the price of civil Vertues, ſince they
attract ſuch glorious rewards: he aſſures us they
are not criminal, ſince they may be admitted to
Honors in Heaven; and that being Chriſtianized
by the powerful excellency of Faith, they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
their Lovers to the franchiſement of that
City whoſe Soveraign is truth, whoſe Law is love,
and whoſe duration is Eternity. Theſe two places
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64170:41"/>
diſcover his thoughts; and who ever ſhall well
examine his words will confeſs that he mixeth the
Vertues of the <hi>Romans</hi> with their ſins, becauſe they
had no regard to the glory of God, and that they
propoſed ends to themſelves, which for the moſt
part were faulty and unlawful. I know that in
his opinion, that Act cannot be holy which is not
accompanied with Charity; that all the good
inclinations we have for commendable things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make us truely Vertuous, if they be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by grace, and that Nature and Reaſon muſt
implore the Celeſtial ſuccours, if they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
works worthy of eternal glory. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I cannot conceive how that all who walk not
in theſe ſteps ſhould become guilty, that a Man
ſhould be accounted diſobedient to his Maker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tranſgreſſing his Laws, and that without being
accuſed by his own Coſcience, he ſhould juſtly be
condemned to thoſe Torments that are only the
portion of Sinners and wicked men.</p>
                  <p>If all theſe Reaſons be not prevalent enough to
convince a <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> he will at leaſt hereby be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to acknowledg that it is not ſo much an
Error as an Incivility, not to be of his opinion, and
that that which hath been examined by the moſt
skilful Divines, approved by the moſt famous <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demia's</hi>
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and authorized by a Councel,
may be written without danger, and maintained

to prove his Doctrin, would be ſilent, or would
ſpeak but one and the ſame Language, if this

terms to explain his meaning and eſtabliſh his
fond imaginations.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe Sects that are daily brooded, are but
ſprouts of that ſelf complaiſance, and the Goſpel
which containeth ſo many Miſteries under the

none but <hi>Poets</hi> for Interpreters, if pride had not
corrupted ſome Male-contents, and put the Pen
into the hand of ſome (I know not what to call
them) ignorant men, to mangle and diſguiſe the
ſenſe thereof. We delight ſo much in ſelf opinion
that no mans judgment is valuable but ours, and
truth it ſelf is unpleaſant to us even in the mouth
of our friends, if it be not cloathed after our
faſhion, and obſtinated by <hi>Paſſion</hi> that blinds us,
we admire only our own conceipts, and will eſteem
no opinions but our own. Few or none are willing
to be accompted, ignorant every one aſpires to the
contrary quality, we ſtrive rather to be knowing
then Vertuous; and <hi>Socrates</hi> that ſpent his life in
obſerving the different inclinations of Men had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64170:43"/>
ſome Reaſon to ſay, that if in a multitude we

but that if the judicious and prudent ſhould
be ſummoned to come forth, there would be none

Self conceipt is ſo natural to man, that it may be
ſaid to be inſeparable.</p>
                  <p>This quality is the principle of all his actions;
he always contemplates himſelf with great delight,
and if intereſt oblige him ſometimes to reflect
on the vertue of his Neighbour with a diſguiſed
Admiration, we are aſſured that he conſidereth
his own parts with perfect ſatisfaction. This truth
appeareth evidently in the preſent Subject every
one defines the faculties of the Soul according to
his fancy. All thoſe different <hi>Idea's</hi> thereof for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the Writings of modern Authors, are no
leſs the proofs of the diverſity of their deſigns,
then of their opinions; and that matter which
hath been moſt examined in the Schools is at this
day the moſt intricate and unknown. Some have
thought that <hi>Paſſion</hi> was not ſo much the Act of
the Soul as of the ſenſitive appetite, that ſhe was
partaker with the cauſe from
whence ſhe proceeded,<note place="margin">Delectatio non eſt in poteſtate delectantis, Niſi quia Actus eſt in poteſtate agentis. <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> 1. diſt. 1. q. 3.</note> that
ſhe ſtirred it not up, and that
ſhe was not at mans command
but ſo far as the Acts that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
it depended upon his
will. To confirm this their opinion, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
voluptuouſneſs with the operations of the
Angelical matter; they ſay, that the one works
the other to perfection; that pleaſure was always
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64170:43"/>
the companion of her Labors; and that <hi>Paſſions</hi>
being ever buſied in the diſturbance of her reſt,
could not properly be comprized under the notion
of action.</p>
                  <p>Others, whom I eſteem not more plauſible, but
becauſe they teach a Doctrin more common, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<hi>Paſſion</hi> by the effects ſhe produceth: They
attribute the alterations of countenance in them
that are under her ſubjection, to her violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
they will have it that the Soul is not
leſs agitated when ſhe fears and is afflicted, then
when ſhe loves and hopeth, and that men make
not a different conſtruction of one and the ſame
thing, and one man of another but becauſe they
are animated by different affections. In fine, they
conclude <hi>Paſſion</hi> to be nothing elſe but an emotion
of the ſenſitive appetite, excited by the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of good or evil which chiefely buſieth it ſelf
in diſturbing the Body contrary to the Laws of
nature.</p>
                  <p>If this definition be common, if all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
allow it, and if all <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> diſciples engage
to defend the principles thereof, yet methinketh
it may be rejected without offence to its authority,
and it ought not to be thought ſtrange, that being
of the <hi>Roman Philoſophers</hi> judgment, I abandon
the <hi>Grecians</hi> Party, to maintain the opinion of the
<hi>Stoicks.</hi> For as I hold with them, that <hi>Paſſions</hi>
are not natural to man, that ſenſe and opinion are
the cauſes thereof, and that their abode is rather
in the will then in the imagination, I muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
forſake his Doctrin and (againſt my humor
betray my own ſentiments) to continue faithful
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64170:44"/>
to the moſt puiſſant Enemy of that only Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
that in other things I honor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſſion</hi> then in <hi>Stoick</hi> terms, is nothing elſe but
a violent motion of the Soul againſt Reaſon, cauſed
by the apprehenſion of good or evil contrary to
the inclination of nature. I ſay that it is a motion
that violently aſſaults our Reaſon; for although
<hi>Paſſion</hi> perform its laſt act in the will, although
it have its conception in the reaſonable faculty, and
may in ſome ſort be called by her Mothers name,
yet for that the principle is corrupted by opinion,
and this Soveraign ſeduced by her unfaithful
ſenſes, the School of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> have commanded
her to forgo that quality, and to bear the name of
natures Enemy, and Reaſons Baſtard. She works
a change which is againſt natures Laws: for as
this common Mother is conſtant in all her actions,
her productions regular, and brings forth nothing
but what is as perfect as uſeful to her Children, ſo
ſhe abhors all debaucheries, ſhe rejects all thoſe
motions that War againſt her inclinations, and
ſhe cannot endure to have ſuccors aſſigned her that
deprave her workmanſhip, and conſpire her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
or her ruin.</p>
                  <p>As this definition is different from that of other
Philoſophers, and as the fidelity that I have vowed
to the <hi>Stoicks</hi> obligeth me to abandon their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
it muſt not be wondered if I conſent not
to them in the cauſe from whence <hi>Paſſions</hi> do ariſe,
and if, after I have diſcovered them to be of no
uſe to vertue, I conſider them as the depravations
of the mind and the will. For if the reſidence of
<hi>Paſſions</hi> as moſt modern Philoſophers will have it,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64170:44"/>
be in the meaner part of the Soul, and that the
imagination only informed by the ſpecies ſhe draws
from the ſenſes, ſtirs up the ſenſitive appetite;
I do not ſee how a man could afflict himſelf for
the loſs of his honors, and inrage himſelf for the
ruin of a benefit which the ſenſes perceive not;
and that before <hi>Paſſion</hi> can make a man take reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of vengeance his mind muſt repreſent the
matter to him as infamous, and the will abhor it
as injurious to his perſon. There is ſuch a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
in the faculties of the Soul, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors
ſeldom or never ſtir but according to the

and the will engage the ſenſitive appetite to
ſide with them, and cauſe it to embrace all as good,
which they approve, and to reject all as evil which
they condemn.</p>
                  <p>So then we muſt conclude with <hi>Seneca</hi> that
<hi>Paſſions</hi> reſide in the will, it is there that all the
operations of the Soul are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;<note place="margin">Affectiones nullâ na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae vi commoventur, omniaque ea ſunt opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iones ac Judicia levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis. <hi>Cic.</hi> 3. defin.</note>
and the ſame powers
which form our ſins &amp; crimes,
comprehend our affections and
deſires. For by the principles
of this Learned Philoſopher,
our <hi>Paſſions</hi> are not bare motions that ariſe from
the appearance of good or evil which receive their
ſuccors from the imagination, and finally ſtop in
the inferior part of the Soul; But productions
of the mind, ſentiments of the rational faculty,
and, to uſe the <hi>Stoick</hi> Language, opinions that
deprave the mind and corrupt the will, perſwading
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64170:45"/>
them to be approvers of their advices, and to
follow their irregular motions. Alſo St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
who I look upon in this matter as <hi>Senecas</hi> warrant,
intermixeth our <hi>Paſſions</hi> with
our rational appetite,<note place="margin">Omnes affectus nihil aliud quàm Voluntates ſunt.

us that the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

are but ſo many affections
which draw their good or
their evil from the objects to
which they have reſpect, our
deſire, according to the words of this great Doctor,
is nothing but a will to an abſent good which we
purſue with much earneſtneſs, our hope is but a
will to a good that flatters us and which we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
expect, and fear and ſadneſs are but wills,
of which the one oppoſeth the evil that threatens
us, and the other the miſchief which we already
feel, contrary to our good liking.</p>
                  <p>So that the matter muſt get into the will before
a man can be ſaid to be in <hi>Paſſion;</hi> and pleaſure
could never ſeize our wiſhes if the will were not
conſenting; neither would our deſires make ſuch
extravagant fallies out of the Fort, if the will did
not bear them company in the purſuit of the
benefits we hunt after. Upon the authority of this
great man, I think it can be no Error to declare for
the <hi>Stoick</hi> Party; and their Enemies are obliged

may be ſaid that the ſame is but a tendency to the

                  <p>That which is practized at Court is but the
conſtant exerciſe of the Schools; and <hi>Cicero's</hi>
teſtimony of Philoſophical affaires is ſignificant,
when he declares that to govern well, Kings ſhould
become Philoſophers or Philoſophers Kings. For
if theſe be truth's combatants, if they lay new
Foundations, if they form new arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

they return to the principles which they had once
forſaken, and if by a liberty permitted in the

When they declaim againſt the Reaſons that
ſupport the Doctrin of their Predeceſſors, it is
that they hope for reputation from the novelty of
their opinions, or heighten their own credit by
vanquiſhing the ſentiments of their Teachers and
Antagoniſts.</p>
                  <p>This truth appears evident in the Subject of
<hi>Paſſions,</hi> and if we examin well the deſign of thoſe
that deſcribe them, it muſt be owned that they are
divided among themſelves touching their number:
thoſe that find it their advantage to engage with
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and rather to leane upon his authority,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64170:46"/>
then upon the ſtrength of his arguments endeavor
to perſwade us that they are in number eleven,
that nothing is to be added to or diminiſhed from
that diviſion, and that they are not to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
without mixture of ſuperior <hi>Species,</hi> nor
retrencht without wrong to their diverſity. To
ground their opinion, they ſeperate the Soul into
two faculties, whereof one draws her name from
<hi>Deſire,</hi> and the other from <hi>Anger.</hi> In the firſt
they place thoſe <hi>Paſſions</hi> that are leaſt violent, and
in the other them that are never at reſt. For they
will have it that the ſix contained in the <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible
appetite</hi> are divided, that ſome are but little
employed and others active, that ſome are ſordid,
and others generous, that ſome wander abroad,
and the other ſatisfied with their domeſtick Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments.</p>
                  <p>In fine they tell you that Love follows the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the Body which tendeth to his center,
that deſire is the moveing Orbe, and that Joy
repreſents him a place of content and reſt, that
Hatred reſembles that averſion which he diſcovers,
when he is placed in an uneaſy condition; that
Flight imitates thoſe earneſt endeavors uſed to get
out of trouble and danger, and that Sadneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
the diſlike that appears upon a violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
therein. But they inform us that the five
<hi>Paſſions</hi> that are placed in the <hi>Iraſcible powers,</hi> are
all impetuous, reſembling the Heavens, ever in
motion, that they create combats and ſcorn to
retreat, and that as they look upon good and evil
as difficult, they can delight in nothing but agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor love any thing leſs then reſt. The truth
is Diſpair is wretched, Anger is out rageous, Hope
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64170:47"/>
is negligent of the things ſhe poſſeſſeth in aſpireing
to what ſhe expects, Fear runs to meet the evil,
afflicts it ſelf before it come, and Audacity finds its
divertiſement in peril and dangers.</p>
                  <p>They divide all theſe different qualities, and
eſtabliſh their number according to the diverſity
of their objects. For ſay they when the Soul
moves ſhe has generally good or evil for her object,
and that begets Love or Hatred: ſhe either conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
them particularly as abſent, and that's
Deſire or preſent, and that's Joy or pleaſure. When
the evil ſhe hates, makes her already feel his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities,
they commonly call it <hi>Dolor,</hi> or elſe
vexation: and when he's abſent and though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
enough yet producing horror, they change
his name into that of Flight. Then if good be
her object and ſhe find it uneaſie to acquire, and
that maugre all the difficulties that ſurround it,
ſhe promiſe her ſelf the poſſeſſion, they name it
Hope, when ſhe ſincks under the evils that attack
her, they give it a contrary title, and call it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.
When the miſchief ſhe judgeth hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
torments her, and when ſhe buſtles to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it, they call it Anger; and when it barely
threatens and the Soul employs her dexterity to
prevent or give it Battel, it aſſumes the name of
Fear or Audacity.</p>
                  <p>Some others who are indebted to vain glory
for their Eloquence, or to the affection they bear
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for ſtraying from the common opinion
of Philoſophers acknowledg but one <hi>Paſſion,</hi> they
aſſure us that Love only is the diſturber of our
quiet, and that our pleaſures our paines, our fears
and wiſhes, our hopes and deſpaires, are but ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64170:47"/>
many different ſhapes which love aſſumes when
he feels an evil or ſwims in content; when he
purſues what delights him, or fears what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to him, and when he promiſeth himſelf
ſome felicity, or looſeth the fancy of obtaining it.
Although I have a venerable value for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of this opinion, and that the Reaſons
wherewith they lay their foundation be ſufficiently
ſolid to command my eſteem, yet it ſeemeth to me
as if they had not throughly examined the nature
of Love, when they make him the Author of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
and Hatred, when they imagin that the moſt
generous of our <hi>Paſſions</hi> ſhould become the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the moſt timorous and violent: and that
how ever they cannot make Flight and anger bear
the name of Love, without confounding the cauſe
with its effects. For as Love is a diſpoſition of the
Soul, reſideing in the will, and as Sorrow and Fear,
Deſire and Hope are <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the inferior part of
the Soul, that immediately or mediately are loves
attendants; I think according to the rigor of
Reaſoning we ought not to give them the ſame
name, and that it is to injure the moſt noble of our
<hi>Paſſions,</hi> to beſtow his characters upon thoſe wild
and ſavage effects that have no coherence with his
nature.</p>
                  <p>But without ſtaying to contend this opinion,
and to ſhun the uncertainties that ariſe from Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick
diviſions and to avoid the incumbrances
that encloſe the unity of other modern inſtructors,
I conclude with St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that there are but four
principal <hi>Paſſions</hi> which comprehend all the reſt,
of which ſome have reſpect unto good and evil
as preſent, to wit Pleaſure and Grief, and the two
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64170:48"/>
other as abſent, namely Fear and Deſire. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
is not hard for them to prove who place
averſion and deſpair under fears, and who for
avoyding multiplication in unneceſſary matters,
reduce Hope Audacity and Anger under Deſire.</p>
                  <p>All the difficulty that can ariſe from this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
is that it ſeemeth lame, that it comprehends
not all the motions of the Soul; and that by the
diſtribution thereof made by this Doctrin, the
two fountains Love and Hatred, have no ſhare in
thoſe great agitations. This objection that in
<hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> judgment hath ſo much ſeeming weight,
concludes nothing in the opinion of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and
it may ſuffice them that hold too violently with
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to know that Love and Hatred are not ſo
much <hi>Paſſions</hi> of our Soul, as natural inclinations
and averſions which we have for good and evil in
General. Theſe ſentiments are ſo powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
in our Soul; that it is not poſſible to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
them; we are carried to what is good by
motion of nature alone, and we abhor what is
evil, without being thruſt from it otherwiſe then
by the inclination we naturally have to preſerve
our ſelves. The will it ſelf, as
much a Soveraign as ſhe is in
her operations,<note place="margin">Natura intellectualis, ſcilicet Voluntas, habet naturalem inclinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ad ſuam perfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem: Nec eſt magis in Voluntate, quàm in lapide. <hi>Scotus</hi> 4. diſt. 49.</note> works accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to nature when ſhe tends
to her own perfection; ſhe
ceaſeth to be indifferent when
ſhe regards her chiefeſt good,
and in the opinion of the witty
Doctor when ſhe reſpects her felicity, ſhe is no
more at liberty then a heavy Body that runs to its
Center, or then Beaſts that haſten to the ſprings of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64170:48"/>
Water when they are thirſty. It is true that ſhe
indeed is abſolute in her Dominion, ſhe can ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
her motion when the imagination offers her
a pleaſing object, and ſhe can ſhun or embrace a
thing for which the mind hath conceived an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>But then this good which ſhe ſeeks muſt be
peculiar, and rather her divertiſement then her
felicity: for if her glory conſiſt in it, ſhe ſteers to
that by a natural motion, ſhe approves it without
choice, and ſhe loves it without having it in her
power to make Election. Thus may we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Reaſon upon the Subjects of Love and Hatred,
and aſſert that they are not ſo much <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the
Soul as impulſions of nature, which engage us
to purſue that which is good, and fly from its
contrary.</p>

more dexterouſly oppoſe the Impiety or Sordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that age, than when he renders Vertue a
Stranger to Mankind, engaging <hi>Socrates</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
her Advantages with his <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and proves
that ſhe is not ſo much the Portion of Heaven or
of Nature, as the Daughter of the Mind and the
Will. His Diſcourſe is ſhaped according to the
ordinary proceedings of the World, and the ſame
Maxims that preſerve Kingdoms and States, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Reaſons, and confirm his Doctrine: For if
Vertue, ſaith he, be natural, and the Country where
we are born, or the Climate under which we live,
be ſufficient to make us vertuous, Rewards in
Common-wealths are idle things, the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
given to them that deſerve them are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
and all the Laurels and Crowns wherewith
the Heads of Conquerours and Kings are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
will not be ſo much the Teſtimonials of their
Juſtice or Valour, as the Marks of their Nature
and good Fortune. From whence he concludes,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64170:49"/>
that Vertues are voluntary, that they owe their
Birth to Practice, and that Perſeverance which
endureth Grief, and laughs at Fortune, is the chief
Principle.</p>
                  <p>Though Paſſions be oppoſed to Vertues, and
their humour rather contrary than different,
though ſome are inſolent, and others modeſt,
ſome irregular, and others innocent, ſome contend
to ſubject the Soul to the Body, and others to
make the Body ſervant to the Mind; yet they
proceed from one and the ſame Spring. Vertues
and Paſſions have one common Mother, and
though they have different Objects when they
are agitated, their birth is nevertheleſs from one
and the ſame Faculty of the Soul: For to joyn the
ſtrengh of Reaſon to the Authority of this great
Philoſopher, and not to undervalue the ingenuity
of his Logick for proof of a moral Concluſion, if
Paſſions were born with us, and if Nature taught
us to deſire and fear, to grieve and to rejoyce,
we muſt of neceſſity infer, that all theſe motions
are good, that we may follow them whereſoever
they lead us, and that we cannot err in treading
the ſteps of a Guide,<note place="margin">Si affectus a Natura eſſent, boni eſſent. <hi>Lipſ.</hi> 3. Manud. ad Stoic. Philoſ.</note> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs

Now the Peripateticks confeſs
that they are neither good nor
bad, that they are capable of good or evil, and
that they may ſerve as well to Vice as Vertue:
it muſt be then concluded that they are not ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

foreign aids muſt be called in to ſtay their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and if Virtue be not employed to vanquiſh
or tame them, we ſhould ſee nothing in the world

and that thoſe commands are to be had in jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie

ought to be common, that ſhe ought to be equally
diſtributed to all men, and that as the reaſonable
Soul is intire in all the Body, and undivided in
each part, ſhe ought alſo to communicate her
perfections and infirmities to all the Nations
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64170:50"/>
upon Earth: mean while we find ſome perſons
ſubject to Paſſions which others know nothing
of, and of ſo many men as are contained in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
or State, few ſhall we ſee that are agitated
by one and the ſame motions. Ambition which
tyrannizeth over Conquerours is not the Plague of
all mankind; if ſome are found to aſpire to Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs,
we ſee others that deſpiſe them; if ſome
hunt after Honours, others have them in deriſion;
and if ſome will reign over their fellow creatures,
others find their content in obedience: the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

ſome Citizens fill their Coffers, but there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

not every man avaritious, and if ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them build all their hopes upon their
Treaſures, we find others of them that take pride
in their diſdain. Envy is not ſo much a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as a peculiar evil; if ſome perſons have been
obſerved to make war upon Vertue, we have ſeen
whole Nations that have built her Temples, and
Orators that have preſented her with Elogies. As
powerful as Love is, he hath not yet been able to
ſubdue an intire Kingdom, the moſt perfect Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have gained but few Lovers, and thoſe Faces
that have thrown ſo many flames into the hearts
of Generals of Armies, were not able to touch the
affections of their Souldiers. Now if all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations
of the Soul were natural, they would
be found equally in all men; the Objects and the
Senſe would not make a different impreſſion upon
their imagination, as theſe two cauſes are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
active, they would every where propuce the

'Tis then an error, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> to imagine that

is a lover of Reſt, and Audacity finds its Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

throws diviſion among friends, and a monſter,
who more cruel than the Tyger and Panther turns

him with evils that touch him not, ſhe makes the
Chaſtiſements of the vicious his puniſhment; ſhe
looks upon the Suffering, and conſiders not the
Crime, and more unjuſt than hatred, ſhe would
bribe Juſtice (if poſſible) to deliver the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and the murtherer from his Sword. In fine,
Paſſions are mans domeſtick enemies, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſouldiers, who, undertaking to defend him and
keep him in action, trouble his Government, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
his Empire, corrupt his Reaſon, diſorder his
Will, and throw confuſion into all the powers of
his Soul.</p>
                  <p>It's true, we meet with ſome men in the world
whom Nature ſeemeth to have produced to give
the lye to this opinion, and whoſe inclinations
conſtrain us to believe that Paſſions are grafted in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64170:52"/>
the Soul; for we ſee ſome ſo effeminate that a
word puts them into a rage, a ſincere reprehenſion
irritates them, and in what method ſoever you deal
with them their anger or indignation is not to be
avoided. Some from their youth are ſordid, they
affect Wealth almoſt before they know what it is,
and it would be more eaſie to change the face of a
Negro into the colour of his Teeth, than to pull
out of their hearts the deſire of heaping up Riches.
Others are naturally baſhful, as often as they ſpeak
in publick they bluſh, and what art ſoever is uſed
to make them confident in company they cannot
hinder ſhamefacedneſs from altering their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
It is not hard to anſwer theſe Objections,
and whoever is at the trouble to examine the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Paſſions, will be conſtrained to acknowledg
that nothing is proved though much be ſaid. For,
to proceed in order,<note place="margin">Affectus non eſt obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas rerum ſpecies move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſed ſe illis <hi>Idem</hi> 2. de ira <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> Anger is
not that firſt motion that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
at the appearance of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and which oweth its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
rather to the Infirmity of
the Body than to the Strength of the Mind, but
that fury of the Soul which by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is ſtiled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
that motion which hurries us to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
and invites us to contrive the ruine of him
that hath offended us. All thoſe other emotions
that prevent the Judgment cannot properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Paſſions, and when they trouble or ſeize the
Soul, it may be ſaid that ſhe reſents but produceth
them not, and that ſhe rather ſuffers than operates.
Generals of Armies have been ſeen to ſwoon at the
approach of Battel, Commanders to grow pale at
the ſight of an Enemy, Souldiers to tremble in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64170:52"/>
on their Armour or their Head-piece, and all
that Valour wherewith they were animated could
not hinder them from beginning their Victories
with quaking, and their Triumphs with ſigns that
brought their Courage into queſtion. The moſt
eloquent of Orators found himſelf often taken
with theſe ſurprizes, and he was aſtoniſht that his
Diſcourſes ſhould chaſe Fear from the minds of
his Auditors, and that his Reaſon ſhould not be
ſtrong enough to drive apprehenſion from the
poſſeſſion of his heart, to hinder Fear from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving
him of his Strength, to prevent his hairs
from ſtanding on end, and to oppoſe his tongues
cleaving to the roof of his mouth when he was to
ſpeak. But all theſe ſudden changes are but corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and ſurprizes which borrow their aids from the
temper and conſtitution of the body. If Riches make
ſome men covetous, it is after the Judgment is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
Nature hath produced nothing in the
whole univerſe that is able to ſtir their deſires, ſhe
hides the Gold in the entrals of the Earth, ſhe
leaves us nothing but the ſight of the Heaven and
the Stars, and knowing that this mettle might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
them if ſhe diſcovered it in its ſplendor, ſhe
cauſed it to grow among the Sands and the Dirt,
to the end they might deſpiſe it.</p>
                  <p>True it is that Baſhfulneſs ſeemeth more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to man than Avarice and Anger, and that he is
become impudent and inſolent that altereth not his
countenance after the commiſſion of a fault or an
incivility: But this timorous Paſſion is only the
daughter of the Body, the Mind hath no ſhare in
her Production, and if the novelty of a thing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
it, the cauſe thereof is the leaping of the blood
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64170:53"/>
about the Heart: hence old men rarely bluſh, the
furrows in their front ſeldom receive a foreign co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and when heat declines their heart, it ceaſeth
to ſend into the Face that innocent Vermilion that
makes the Countenance of Children ſo amiable.
As this motion is a pure effect of the Bodies tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature,
our Players could never yet get her to
appear upon the Stage, and the moſt ingenious
of them deſpair at this day of adorning the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of their Actors with this curious colour.
They repreſent us Sadneſs with all her ſhagrine
humors, and as ſilent as ſhe is, they find inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to counterfeit her follies. They ſhew us
Fear upon a pale Face, and imitate all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſo well, that they ſeem to tremble, grow
wan and fall into a ſwoon. Love is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſubject wherewith they entertain their Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and the ſmalleſt Apes-face of the Society can
act the Gallant, the Suitor and the mad Lover;
but none of them have yet been ſeen that could
act the Shame-faced perſon, and if ſome few
have learned to ſtoop the Head, abaſe the Voice,
and to look downwards; we hardly obſerve any
that have been able to call for Bluſhes to teſtifie
that the Applauſes given to them, or the Reproches
thrown at them, were unpleaſing. But as Paſſions
depend on us, it muſt not be wondered, if they be
counterfeited with ſo much eaſe, if they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſad and angry, audacious and deſperate,
when they pleaſe; and that conſulting the mind and
opinion of which they are formed, they repreſent
all thoſe outward ſigns which Paſſions diſcover
upon the Bodies of ſuch as are poſſeſſed by them.</p>

are any thing but due debt, ſhe ſtiles her the only

lifteth man into Heaven to contemplate there the
perfections of her Author: and though ſhe know
that her Body have need of health to preſerve her,
ſhe is aſſured that her Soul wants nothing but
knowledg to participate of his Eternity. By theſe
mens diſcourſe this quality is as immenſe as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
preſent every where, including all differences
of time, coexiſtant with all Ages; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

not be a ſtranger to any thing in nature, the moſt
hidden things ſtir him to make diligent ſearch

perſwades him that knowledg is a part of his

the immenſity of the Creator, by his mind
he is preſent in all places of the World, he flies
into Heaven, and deſcends into the depths of the
Earth, without leaving his Cloſet, and drawing
an univerſal notion from all particular things he
comprehends all Creatures, and becomes a true
<hi>Microcoſme</hi> by the multitude of his <hi>Idaea's.</hi> To
conclude, in knowledg conſiſteth all his glory,
ſhe is the moſt uſeful of his perfections, and if
Phyſicians learn of her to cure diſeaſes, States-men
to govern, and Judges to diſtinguiſh the innocent

diſorderly motions would be ſubmiſſive to us,
we ſhould prevent their fury by the knowledg of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64170:54"/>
the benefits they hunt after, and the evils they
abhor: and having no traffick with the People for
their opinion in this matter, they would obey
Reaſons orders. But the greateſt of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
is that we go to the ignorant for Counſel,
we rely upon unfaithful ſentinels, and againſt our
own Judgments, give credit to the ſenſes who
cheat and abuſe us. For generally their reports are
falſe, and though they be obtained by knowledg,
it is very rare if they do not ingage us in Error.
They are blind guids that carry us a ſtray from
truth, under colour of leading us to her, windows
by which falſhood gets into our underſtanding,
and interreſſed Counſellors who always plead the
cauſe of the objects which pleaſe them moſt. As
the Soul becomes often a Slave to the fleſh, takes
the noiſe of ſounds for realties, and judges by
their reports of things without her, it muſt not
be wondred if ſhe be cheated in her diſtinctions,
if ſhe make blind and precipitate Judgments, and
if forgetting her own Grandeur, ſhe fight under
the Banner of her Slave. For ſeeing theſe treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous
Miniſters of her Goverment deal falſely
with her, plead always in favor of the Body, and
ſlighting her Counſels, follow the inclinations of
their fleſhly Companion, ſhe ſides with them, ſhe
lets her ſelf looſe at their inſtigations, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by their importunities who preſent her the
objects, ſhe pronounces her <hi>fiat</hi> to all that they
Judg uſeful and pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>From this unjuſt diſorder ariſe our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and
of ſo many motions as interrupt the quiet of our
Souls, we find not any, that taketh not his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
from ſome one of our ſenſes, Love is the Son
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64170:55"/>
of the ſight, the Eye conceives him before the
Heart, and though he terminate his Conqueſt by
the will, yet he always gives Battel by the look,
The <hi>Poets</hi> were aſſuredly miſtaken when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
him as blind; and they rather had regard
to the effects then to the original, when they
cover his Eyes with a Muffler. For thoſe lights
which nature hath given us for our conduct, are
the common Meſſengers of this furious <hi>Paſſion,</hi>
that which ought to diſcover the defects of a face
hides its imperfections: and by an unpardonable
ingratitude the moſt ſplendid members of the
Body darken the Soul, from whom they receive
their light. Deſire ever begins by the Eyes or the
Eares, wealth corrupts not our minds but after
infection of the ſenſes, and man would ſeldom
form any wiſhes, if he were born deaf and blind.
Hope owes his original to them, the advantages
wherewith he is flattered are not ſo much princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as accidents, and the imagination could never
dazle our underſtanding with their ſplendor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the intermediation of thoſe Organs. Theſe
are they who conceive Envy, who make him
conſider the goods of his Neighbour with Grief,
who cauſe his Joy to ariſe from other mens miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
and make them confeſs that their felicity
is able to create their torment. In fine, theſe
faithleſs Miniſters are the Fountaines of all our
diſquiet, and Love which is the moſt common of
our <hi>Paſſions</hi> would want Slaves, Hope would be
without Lovers; and Envy without Martyrs, if
theſe blind guids did not prevent our imagination,
ſeduce our Judgment, and deprave our will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64170:55"/>
If ſenſe begin our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> opinion gives them
perfection, and if thoſe give us the objects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſedly,
theſe always deceive us in their choice.
For opinion being but the Picture of Reaſon, and
a common noiſe that gathers Authority from the
encreaſe of thoſe that approve it, ſhe deceives us
by ſemblance of Judgment, and without Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination
of her Reaſons ſhe would have us to eſteem
all for juſt that is approved by many. As ſhe is
concerned for Priviledges of the Body, ſhe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
of that party, and as ſhe is of an Earthly
Original all her motions and inclinations partake
thereof. We are not then to think it ſtrange if they
which follow ſuch a guide never arrive at generous
things, if they ſtray from the truth in the greater
part of their ſentiments and if diſcerning things
no otherwiſe then through that falſe Glaſs; they
embrace an Error for its contrary. For as the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
are not ſo happy in their
opinions as to know how to
judg favourably of Vertue or
Reaſon;<note place="margin">Non tam bene cum rebus humanis agitur, ut me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora pluribus place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: argumentum peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimi turba eſt. <hi>Senec.</hi> de. vit. beat. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</note> and although all the

it hinders them not from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into extravagance and Error, the more to
be lamented for being common. They affect
only ſuch things as are vain or uſeleſs, they reject
good and embrace evil, they applaud what they
ought to ſhun, and condemn what they ought
to love.</p>
                  <p>Alſo with much Reaſon in my opinion doth
<hi>Seneca</hi> compare the caſe of the vulgar to the
condition of Fools, or Mad-men, ſaying, that the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64170:56"/>
greateſt part of mankind were not leſs extravagant
then they which have loſt their ſenſes, and that
there was but this difference
between the Phrenetick and
the Vulgar,<note place="margin">Inter inſaniam publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam, &amp; hanc quae me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis traditur, nihil intereſt, niſi quod haec morbo laborat, illa o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionibus falſis. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 94.</note> they were actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the diſeaſe of the one was a

of the mind, that the one aroſe from the
abundance of Blood or Gall, and the other from
the weakneſs of Judgment, and that the one came
from a diſordered temperature, and the other from
an ill governed Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, What is there more extravagant then a
man who rejects the truth to embrace the noiſe of
a biaſſed and interreſſed multitude? Who departs
from his own Reaſon to be guided by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
And who deſpiſeth all the Counſels of Reaſon
to take the advice of one that is blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?
For from this corruption proceeds all our
faults: hence we take the objects to be other then
they are, hence we are deceived in our choice, and
abuſed by the value, or diſeſteem that others have
of it, we call for our <hi>Paſſions</hi> to effect or avoid it.

theſe turbulent motions from acting without our

after they have violated the Laws of Reaſon and

                  <p>For when the Soul has once admitted them,
and that of ſtrangers ſhe permits them to be her

and, by an injuſtice not eaſy to expreſs, they oblige

their Soveraign to take Laws of them. Therefore
to preſerve the liberty of the mind, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the rights of Reaſon, theſe ſeditious intruders
muſt be allowed no entrance, and we muſt imitate
thoſe prudent Governors that ſuffer not their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to approach their Borders under pretence of
friendſhip and aſſiſtance. For
if the Soul permit them a
ſhare in her Authority and
miſtruſting her own ſtrength,<note place="margin">Affectus quidem tam mali Miniſtri quàm duces Sunt. <hi>Idem. Cap.</hi> 9.</note>
ſhe call in theſe Forreign

theſe pretended friends turn tail, become Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they ſtir up parties to bereave her of her
Scepter, they diſturb her Judgment and her Reſt,
and having ſtript her of her Lights, they conſtrain
her to take them for Counſellors and to follow
their inclinations.</p>
                  <p>This Tyranny would be tolerable if it laſted
but a few moments, and we might draw this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from our miſery to learn from their ill uſage
the difference between liberty and ſlavery. But
theſe Rebells have ſo many artifices, that they cauſe
their Martyrs to love them, the torments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they afflict them cannot procure their hatred,
they will entertain them although they know they
are abuſed by them, and, by an humour which they
would hardly wiſh to their Enemies, they take
delight in the converſation of Executioners that
torment them.</p>
                  <p>For though <hi>Paſſions</hi> be fickle yet are they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
they reſemble thoſe accidents that are not
to be deſtroyed without ruining the Subject
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64170:59"/>
wherein they reſide, they are like ungrateful Gueſts
that take poſſeſſion where they are entertained,
and are of ſo malignant a nature that they never
leave thoſe men that permit them to be their
Counſellors. They are Souldiers that will not
be disbanded but by Death, ivy of which the
duration is equal with the Wall that ſupports it,
and diſeaſes, againſt which Phyſicians have yet
found no remedy. What can then be more irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
ſaid then to affirm that man who is at
liberty in all his actions, had need of ſo many
monſtrous Beaſts? That he cannot perform gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
things without their aſſiſtance? And that
thoſe which ought to obey him muſt preſcribe him
Laws? A man muſt have loſt his judgment to run
to his ruin for ſafety, and believe that his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
can afford him ſtrength, that treachery will
bring him ayds, truth a lie, and health a multitude
of diſeaſes. <hi>Paſſions</hi> are too mutinous to render
us any good ſervice, and they are too much mans
Enemy to labour for his felicity.</p>
                  <p>I will admit that they ſometimes diſguiſe their
malice, that they raiſe a kind of contentment in
his ſoul, that the moſt generous ſtir up the courage
of the more ſordid, and that the more modeſt do
curb the inſolence of ſuch as are moſt ſavage:
but all theſe good effects are produced by the war
that is among themſelves, from their different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
from a conſpiration of ſome againſt
others: and, by a quite different method of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſome become charitable to their Companions
becauſe their humors agree not.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, do we not ſee that they are
often of uſe to us? That they ſometimes fight
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64170:60"/>
Vertues battels, and employ endeavors for her
defence which beget admiration? Truly that
which ſeemeth to be the Reaſon of their neceſſity
gives us the ſuſpition of their imperfection, their
good offices create a jealouſy; and who ſo knows
well their nature will confeſs them to be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and that they force their own inclinations
ſo often as they take up Armes in Vertues quarrel.
They reſemble that famous Murtherer that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the life of a Tyrant in deſigning to take it
from him, and who breaking an Impoſtume that
threatned him with death, became his Cure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be his Executioner.</p>
                  <p>For if they oppoſe vice, if they ſide with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and if they employ their arts to preſerve the
rights of Reaſon, they betray their own diſpoſition,
they commit good without premeditation, and,
like unto ſtormes that accidentally conduct the
Ship into her Port, they guide us to Vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to turn us into a contrary Path. No man
in his right mind will conclude venims to be
wholſome for having removed a ſick-mans diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and he that would be an approver of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in a Kingdom becauſe it hath ſuppreſſed ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
reduced the People to ſubjection, united
different Intereſts, and baniſhed rebellion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
from the bowels of the State, would no leſs
contradict the rules of Policy then the dictates of
Reaſon. We ſee ſome Phyſicians who expel one
evil by another, who Cure an Ague with Poiſon,
and diſſipate the Peſtilence by ſweating which often
procures it, and who allay the ſmarting pain of
the Gout with medicaments more proper to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the torment.</p>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:64170:60"/>
A Feaver did once ſo inflame the brain of a
General that it made him undertake the Conqueſt

not have thought on; and in the late Wars with
<hi>Flanders, France</hi> had a Mareſhal who was ſeldom

that theſe ſeveral ſorts of cures or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
can turn us to accompt; and that it is not
more advantageous to man to banniſh then enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſuch methods for his Conduct? It is a great
unhappineſs to find no cure but in diſtempers &amp; to
be obliged for the recovery of health, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

                  <p>That man would be ſuſpected of folly that

they furniſh him with rebellious Aids, who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently

                  <p>Nature has ſufficiently armed us in giving us

know that Tyranny is odious, that uſurpation is
unjuſt, and that we cannot ſeize the Territories
of our Neighbours without breach of reputation,
Ambition will furniſh us with excuſes. So that all
the ſuccours that ſome would aſſign us for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

                  <p>This diſcourſe runs the Peripateticks into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,

with us that the exceſs of <hi>Paſſions</hi> is dangerous,
that they cannot be employed without loſs of
liberty, and, that we ceaſe to act as men when
they get poſſeſſion, yet they affirm them to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
if moderated, that they may be formed into
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64170:61"/>
Vertues if we know how to manage their humors,
and that it is ſufficient to render them profitable
to us, if we do but correct that fury which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
their violent comportment, that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
prepare poiſons and venims, and as nature
qualifies the diſpoſition of the Elements, it is
the work of morality to reduce <hi>Paſſions</hi> to a mediocrity,
and ſtripping them of their extravagant

                  <p>A wiſe man muſt as well be without <hi>Paſſions</hi> as

both friends and foes,
they would not conſent to the
choice of a Sovereign to command themſelves.
They invented a new mode of Government to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from ſervitude, they made their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
elective, they annually created two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and, to avoid the vexatious name of Subject,
they ordained that thoſe to whom they committed
the management of their affairs ſhould take upon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64170:63"/>
them the Title of Conſuls and not of Lords and
Monarchs. Man hath in him (I know not what
to call it) ſomething ſo ſublime that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
violence, he imagineth Servitude to be the
greateſt of his evils, and he is ſo great a lover of
Liberty that he often prefers a diſhonourable free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to an advantageous bondage. That human
prudence that regulates things preſent by the
knowledg of things paſt, teacheth Monarchs to
ſtand upon their guard with Subjects, and lets
them know that they are to make the calculation
of their enemies by the number of their vaſſals:
as ſhe cautioneth Kings againſt the treachery of
new conquered Countries, ſhe bids them be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of all that ſerve them, ſhe ſhews us men in
Hiſtory that have ſteeped their hands in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
blood for a remedy againſt their Slavery,
and others that have ſet Kingdoms on fire with a
pretence of freeing them from Tyranny. In fine,
Liberty hath ſo many Charms that ſo often as we
are deprived of it, we deem our ſelves unhappy,
and its contrary is ſo burthenſom, that believing
our ſelves free-born, and therein equal to the moſt
mighty Princes of the earth, we are ſufficiently
ſtirred up to be delivered from it. Indeed this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
condition is very odious, and it's not without
cauſe that the greateſt number of men would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
die free under an apparent Slavery, than live
as bondmen under a viſible Liberty. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it muſt be owned that this evil comes not
near the miſeries that we endure from <hi>Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and the Empire of theſe inſolent Uſurpers is
leſs ſupportable to man than the hatred of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
the rage of Tyrants and the violence of his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64170:63"/>
Enemies: For if theſe torment or perſecute him,
they exerciſe their fury but on his body, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

of the moſt noble part of himſelf: if they aſſault
his innocence, if they deprive him of his friends,
if they caſt him into irons, and if they attempt
upon his very life by injurious uſage, his Soul
preſerves her authority, the fetters that reſtrain
her ſlave touch her not, and ſhe acts with ſo much
facility, that it may be affirmed ſhe is never more
ingenious than in affliction. But <hi>Paſſions</hi> diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both, they extend their oppreſſions beyond the
Body, they deal with the Soul as Men with their
Slaves, and without regard to Grandeur, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
their violence upon all her faculties. They
puff out the light of his Underſtanding, they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
his Will, they ſeduce his Judgment; and, by
a power not much inferiour to Magick Art, they
throw illuſions into his Spirit to trouble his mind.
If men account Exile cruel becauſe it ſeparates us

will not own that the Tyranny of our <hi>Paſſions</hi> is
the moſt ſevere of our torments, ſince they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently

Fortune, which hath ſet up that unjuſt diſtinction

the agreement we hold with them provokes their

our fidelity augments their fury, and they are
never more cruel than when we obſerve their
orders, or obey their commands. Sometimes Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
is rather to be choſen than Liberty, and there
be ſome ſlaves that would not change conditions
with their Maſters: for though theſe impoſe
upon their Liberty, and permit them not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

they be charged with the care of providing for

they muſt take an account of their actions, and
buy with money that authority which they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
upon their Wills; ſo that their pretended do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
amounts to a ſpecious ſubjection, and they
ought not ſo much to be ſtiled their Lords as
their Atturneys and their Stewards. But <hi>Paſſions</hi>
are ever ſavage, they form nought but evil deſigns
againſt their ſubjects, they increaſe their wounds
inſtead of giving eaſe, they violently over-run
Vertue and Liberty together, and abuſing all their
faculties, they make their conditions equal with
the damned: ſometimes they give them looks ſo
frightful that the Earth hath nothing more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or more inſolent, and anon they leave in the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64170:64"/>
Soul ſuch a Fear and Grief that nothing is more
unhappy. Their evil entertainments have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

reach them: if the perſons with whom they live
be difficult, or if the Law of the place admit no
Affranchizement, they may remove into another,
and ſeek that liberty in foreign Dominions which
they could not obtain in the Land of their nativity.
But they who ſerve <hi>Paſſions</hi> carry always their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
with them, into what part of the world ſoever
they travel they cannot hide themſelves from
them, and ſo unhappy is their condition, that
they cannot ſheer clear of them without danger
of ſinking their Veſſel. If they abandon their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
if they throw themſelves into the arms
of Princes for protection, and if all the Provinces
they paſs thorough, be ſo many Sanctuaries and
places of freedom, yet are they ſhackled, they
carry their fetters with them, they remain ſlaves
even in the very boſom of Liberty, and the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
under whoſe command they are liſted are
ſo outragious, that they ſpare them as little abroad
as at home. All that pleaſes the ſenſe ſtir up their
Grief, and that which would cure a ſick man,
is matter of their puniſhment. For if in their
Travels they obſerve ſpacious Countries, if
they meaſure the height of Hills, if they fix the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64170:65"/>
Eye upon the current of Rivers, if they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
the Flowers of pleaſant Meadows, and meet
nothing in their way but what imploys or diverts
their Fancy, they rather charm than heal their
Torments, and do not ſo much deceive their
thoughts as their eyes and ears. By an unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that ſhews the miſery of their condition, they
often convert their Remedies into Poiſons, and
change the Objects of their divertiſements into
ſubjects of their Grief. The ſight of remote Lands
puts them in mind of their own Countreys, the
Cities through which they paſs repreſent them the
places where they began to ſuffer, the Inhabitants
ſeem to diſcourſe of the paſſages of their former
life, the things and beauties they find there awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their deſires; and although they are far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from all that can anoy them, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
not to conceive Love, Hatred, Joy and
Grief.</p>
                  <p>What greater Puniſhments

And what more cruel
Vengeance can be drawn from

his Affection, and the thought of Triumphs
that were preparing for him is not powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to diſſwade him from laying his Arms at
the feet of his captive Slave; her Beauty raviſheth
his Soul, and ſtops in a Paſſage where a hundred
thouſand men durſt not have attended his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
without terror.</p>
                  <p>From theſe two Examples it is not hard to
conclude, that <hi>Paſſions</hi> debaſe us, that we cannot
treat with them without becoming their ſlaves,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64170:66"/>
and that we muſt of neceſſity renounce our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
when we obey ſuch inſolent Maſters. To
prevent then this ſhameful ſervitude, a wiſe
man muſt take Reaſon into his Counſel, he muſt
ſtay till ſhe has examined the Nature of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that preſent themſelves before he let in
Love or Hatred; and he muſt conclude nothing
touching their perfections or defects, till this
Sun have inlightned his Will, and have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or forbidden the purſuite.</p>

makes vanity of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting

he takes pride in his own
miſeries, and emploies all her
benefits to make himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
or guilty. Thoſe that have
exerciſed their Eloquence in decifering corrupted
nature, thought it ſufficient to be the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>
to render us diſobedient, that the ſin of that firſt
revolter againſt his God, was the ſpring of all our
evils, whereof <hi>Paſſions</hi> became the Children after
they had been the Mother, and that man never
committed an unjuſt act but by the inſtigation of
concupiſence, which becomes the chaſtiſement
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Although the Authors of this Doctrin be to
me very venerable, and though the opinion which
they maintain be approved by all Chriſtians; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
I perſwade my ſelf that they will not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
deny to allow me, that we derive not all
our defects from his crime, that we may as well
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64170:67"/>
bewaile the perfections which we ſtill retain as
thoſe we have loſt, and that we find orderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in our Bodies which are rather arguments
of the Excellency of the Soul then the defection
of nature. Some men would be innocent if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
had not honoured them with favors, their rare
qualities occaſion their miſery, they are poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are too rich, they run themſelves into
dangers by being too much enlightened, and they
engage not in Error but by being more perfect
then others. What ever renders a wiſe man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht
makes them miſerable, they anticipate
misfortune by their foreſight, their memories call
to mind the injuries done them, their wits are
buſied about uſeleſs or hazardous things, and all
their qualifications become pernicious or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious.</p>
                  <p>To augment their own miſeries and add to
natures defects voluntary errors, they take counſel
from the noiſe of the People, they regulate their
lives by their reports, they act but by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and they approve all for reaſonable that hath
many Approbators, and not that wherein truth
moſt conſiſteth. Likewiſe they who have made
ſo many invectives againſt the ſin of our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
have almoſt depraved the whole ſtock of
man-kind, by endeavouring to explain the moſt
difficult Principle of our Religion; and have
taught them undeſignedly, to juſtify their defects
and to form excuſes for their lewdneſs. For if that
inhumane Father, ſay they, have bequeathed us
death with our being, if he have made us Slaves
by the loſs of his innocence, if the <hi>Paſſions</hi> which
ariſe in our Soul be the effects of his Rebellion,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64170:67"/>
if they be as inſeparable as our members, and if
we cannot ſhun their Surprizals but by the aids of
grace; who ſhall reſolve to labour their Conqueſt,
ſeeing they are born with us, and proceed from the
conjunction of the Soul with the Body, ſince the
ſeeds thereof are in us, and that that grace to
which they have recourſe, is a bounty which God
only beſtows upon his Favorites? To avoid then
all theſe complaints it muſt be owned that human
nature is not ſo depraved as they deſcribe her, that
ſhe yet retains ſome remains of her purity, and
that man hath ſtill a power to combat vice, follow
vertue, and conquer his <hi>Paſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When thoſe famous men that laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Romes</hi> Empire, would inſtruct their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by their precepts or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them by their Laws,<note place="margin">Parricidae cum lege ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perunt, &amp; illis facinus paena monſtrauit: peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo loco fuit pietas poſt quam culeas ſaepius vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus quàm cruces. <hi>Sen.</hi> de clem. lib. 10. cap. 23.</note>
they rather diſordered then
ſettled them, they taught them
crimes of which before they
were ignorant, and they made
many guilty perſons in deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to keep men innocent.
<hi>Parricides,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> firſt began in <hi>Rome</hi> by the
prohibition thereof, the puniſhment threatned to
thoſe that ſhould be found ſo monſtrous inſpired
them with cruelty; men became barbarians
when they were forbidden to be inhumane, and
they feared not to murther them from whom they
had received life, after the Law had informed them
that ſuch a ſin might be committed. So that thoſe
men muſt be Enemies to nature who throw all
their faults upon her infirmities, and we muſt deny
that we often employ our perfections to procure
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64170:68"/>
our own unhappineſs. This truth appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in the Subject of this diſcourſe. We ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Paſſions</hi> which are but the pure effects of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and the will, to be the productions of nature,
we fancy that they are born with us, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from our weakneſs, that a wiſe man cannot
defend himſelf from them but by a Miracle. In
fine, we deem all things difficult which we fear to
undertake, and judging of other mens ſtrength
by our own, we take all for impoſſibilities which
we our ſelves cannot perform.</p>
                  <p>Alſo I am of <hi>Senecas</hi> judgment, and do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with him, that there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and other
Philoſophers as between men
and women:<note place="margin">Tantum inter Stoicos &amp; caeteros Sapientiam profeſſos intereſſe, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum inter faeminas &amp; mares merito dixerim; cùm utraque turba ad vitae ſocietatem tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem conferat, ſed altera pars ad obſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, altera imperio nata ſit <hi>Sen.</hi> lib. Conſt. cap. 10.</note> and as theſe two
ſex are neceſſary for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Families and States,
the one is born to command
and the other to obey. For
let <hi>Epicurus</hi> be commended,
let his Diſciples protect him,
and let them ranſack the Body
of Morality to ſhape excuſes
for his opinions, yet it muſt be owned that he has
made no Scholars but Slaves, and that when he
deſigned to create Philoſophers, he innocently
formed vicious and impious perſons. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
Father of the <hi>Academia,</hi> is not more vertuous then
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> though he ſeem more reaſonable, for he
makes but Baſtard wiſe men, he moderates the
violence of their inclinations to render their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
eaſy, and allowing them ordinary diſtempers
he hath taught them that they cannot be healthy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64170:68"/>
unleſs they have infirmities, that they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
liberal without covetouſneſs, that to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
they muſt have the help of ambition, and
that vertue would be of no uſe to them, if they
had not <hi>Paſſions</hi> to execute what ſhe projects.
This opinion ſeems ſo little generous to <hi>Zeno's</hi>
Diſciples, that they cannot forbear vigorouſly to
oppoſe it, and <hi>Seneca</hi> has condemned it for ſo
unreaſonable a tenet, that he thinks he pleads
vertues cauſe ſo often as he is ingaged in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</p>
                  <p>Where, replies he, is the freedom of the wiſe
man, if he may not act but by the intermediation
of his <hi>Paſſions?</hi> If he be obliged to fly to their
Counſels, and if he muſt borrow of them all the
forms of his Government? Reaſon is unthroned
ſo ſoon as ſhe admits an alliance with them, and
their Communication is ſo pernicious to her, that
ſhe cannot lend them an Eare without inſenſibly
mixing with their Party. For when ſhe hath once
admitted them, they do what they will, and not
what ſhe permits them, they follow their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
though ſhe contend for the Conqueſt,
and they become in the end ſo inſolent or ſo wild,
that they violently conſtrain their Soveraign to
yeild to their diſcretion. For this cauſe he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the only means to be delivered from them,
is to prevent their aſſaults, and attack them before
they threaten, and according to the Rules of
Policy, provide that thoſe who are yet but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Enemies, become not our domeſtick Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</p>
                  <p>It availes not his Adverſaries to fly to natures
imperfections for a reply, and to ſay that Reaſon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64170:69"/>
is become blind and weak, ſince ſhe ſuffered her
ſelf to be ſeduced by the Serpent. This reply,
though true, proves nothing in morality, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
foundations they draw from Divines to
ſupport it, yet muſt they confeſs that it makes not
ſo much for Reaſon as for Faith. For again ſaith
this wiſe <hi>Roman,</hi> if Reaſon be not ſtrong enough
to hinder <hi>Paſſions</hi> from making excurſions into her
Dominions, how will they have her to keep them
in order when they have entred her Territories?
If ſhe ſink under their violence when ſhe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to expect them, how ſhall ſhe be able to give
them Laws when ſhe is become their Captive?
And if ſhe cannot repulſe Enemies at the Gate,
how ſhall ſhe repel their fury when they have
gotten poſſeſſion? We muſt then infer either that
a wiſe man may prevent their aſſaults or that he
cannot moderate their inclinations, that he can
hinder their ſudden ſwellings, or that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtay their diſorders when they have made
Head.</p>
                  <p>Tranquillity is one of the qualifications of a
wiſe man; men cannot rob him of it till he
change his condition, and he may boaſt of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſo long as he preſerves it: but <hi>Paſſions</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
bereave him of it in every of their aſſaults,
and he ceaſeth to be his own when he has any
thing of diſpute with them. He is their Slave
without being conquered he mourns in oppoſing
them, and he is conſtrained to part with the moſt
precious of his Benefits, ſo often as he takes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to fight them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:64170:69"/>
For be they never ſo well moderated they ceaſe
not to diſturb his quiet, they throw diſſention
among the Parties that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it,<note place="margin">Quid ſi ſanum voces leviter febricitantem? Non eſt bona valetudo mediocritas morbi: quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo oculos major &amp; perfecta ſuffuſio excae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, ſic modica turbat. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 85.</note> and they ſo much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
his mind, that nothing
is left him but a weak and
languiſhing liberty. The <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi>
are not ſo juſt as to
abate him any of his evils for
the elevation of his Grandeur:
they render him ſubject to all the maladies of the
Soul, they allot him all <hi>Paſſions,</hi> to vanquiſh or
tame: and without conſidering that many times
one violent evil is preferrable to a multitude of
waſting diſeaſes, they will that he have fear, but
it muſt be moderated, that he be ſpurred by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but it muſt be reſtrained, that he form deſires
and hopes, but they muſt be limited, that he be
moved by Anger, but it muſt be eaſy to recal, and
that he have Love and Audacity, but they muſt
not run into folly and fury. But who doth not
eaſily ſee that this Tyranny ſtrikes directly at his
Liberty, that theſe motions howſoever moderated
annoy his Peace? And that it would be more eaſy
to conquer one powerful Enemy then give Battel
to a multitude of ſmaller adverſaries at one and
the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>Vertue is ſo delicate in this point, that ſhe could
never yet ſuffer <hi>Paſſions</hi> to be
aſſigned her for Companions,<note place="margin">Non quia difficilia ſunt, non audemus, ſed quia non audemus difficilia ſunt. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 104.</note>
as ſhe knows that they hold
intelligence with vice, ſhe
rejects all their proffered
ſervices, ſhe believes that he unjuſtly-Tryumphs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64170:70"/>
that owes Victory to any thing but his Valor;
that he is unworthy the name of Conqueror, if
he may be reproached that in the combat he mixt
Cowardize with his Courage, and did not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
his Enemy, but becauſe he was ſomewhat
fearful and imprudent. She is jealous of all their
Labors, ſhe will have no Souldiers that eſteem their
own Counſels more then her Commands, and ſhe
would think it injurious to her own Grandeur to
make uſe of their Services.</p>
                  <p>Truely what art ſoever hath been uſed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prudence to allay their fury the method of
reducing them to Reaſons obedience is yet to ſeek,
and which way ſoever they be conſidered it wants
Dexterity to ſubject them to her Empire. As we
find no Animals that yeild obedience to this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and as the tamed hearken as little to her
Counſels as the wild; ſo, man hath no <hi>Paſſions</hi> that
will obey his Commands, they make head to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his decrees, they conſpire to leſſen his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and by a faction as unjuſt as inſolent, they
diſpute the Government he pretendeth to have over
them. Their nature reſembles that of the <hi>Tygre</hi>
and <hi>Lyon,</hi> which never forſake their ſavage humor,
which are as ravenous in the Houſe as in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
and can never be ſo well tamed, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their firſt fury when leaſt ſuſpected. In
fine, <hi>Paſſions</hi> are faithleſs ſubjects, and domeſtick
Enemies, with whom a Peace is no leſs to be
feared when War and perſecution.</p>
                  <p>But to return to my matter, if <hi>Paſſions</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable,
and if all our prudence be too weak to
prevent the aſſaults of fear, the attacks of grief,
the ſnares of Love, and the ſurprizals of Anger
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64170:70"/>
upon our will, who can aſſure himſelf of ſtaying
their Carreer, and of obliging them that prepare
for Battel without our leave to proceed no farther
then we ſhall direct? One of theſe two extreams
muſt be choſen, either to ſtiffle them in the Cradle,
or reſolve to become their Slaves: to give them
Battel before they make head, or reſolve to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
our liberty: to deprive them of means to
gather their forces, or take up a reſolution to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their violence. For as thoſe things which
ſtir them up are without us, and the good and
evil which they reſpect are not in our power,
they imitate the nature of the objects that employ
them, they encreaſe according to the cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they partake, and they become more violent or
moderate, according as things ſeem pleaſant or
diſſatisfactory; deſire redoubles his ſtrength when
hope appears of his Party, and flatters him with
the poſſeſſion of the benefit he hunts after. Fear is
augmented when the apprehended evil ſhews it
ſelf with more then ordinary horrors, or when
working her own miſery, ſhe deſcribes it more
terrible then it is.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid of deſire and fear may be
applyed to all our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and as they arm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our command, and the objects that ſupport
them depend not of us, it muſt be confeſſed that
it's not in our power to bring them to Reaſon, to
moderate their fury, or hinder their running into
exceſs. It's a ſort of folly to think that we have
an Enemy at our command whoſe inſolence we
may ſuppreſs, and to imagine that that Governor
is able to keep Rebels in awe, who was not pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
enough to prevent their taking up of Armes,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64170:71"/>
putting into the Field, and forming an Army to
offer him open Battel.</p>
                  <p>Although this arguing be bold yet it is unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
even in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion, and they that
would enervate it muſt have recourſe to their own
weakneſſes to leſſen its force. They ſay it is very
difficult for a man to gain ſo abſolute a power over
himſelf, as to command all his inclinations, to ſee
beautiful Faces, and to be inſenſible of love, to
look upon a threatening evil, and not to fear its
arrival, to have Treaſures laid before him, and to
have no deſire to them, to be injuriouſly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully
uſed, and not to let Anger ariſe, to have
his pleaſant Edifices deſtroyed, his Lands vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
forraged, and his goods plundered, and he
not afflicted. Such favors are only beſtowed upon
beatified perſons, we muſt be ſeparated from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
commerce to obtain them, and we muſt
mount the Heavenly manſions to conſider the
glories of this World with indifference, and to
behold all the revolutions that are wrought in it
without diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>If this Objection be the chief foundation of the
contrary opinion, yet is it not very ſtrong but in
ſhew, it reproves our practice, but diminiſheth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our abillity, it declares the faults of fools,
and hides the perfections of wiſemen, and without
ſurvaying mans nature, it excuſeth his ſordidneſs
and conſidereth not his advantages. Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
generous, he hath not yet attempted any
thing but what his induſtry hath overcome, and
all thoſe difficulties which the <hi>Academia</hi> oppoſed to
his undertakings, have only ſerved to augment his
glory and admire his courage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:64170:71"/>
The moſt wild and ſavage <hi>Paſſions</hi> have yeilded
to his power, and all that fury wherewith they
were animated, could not hinder his conſtraining
them to the obedience of his Laws; his power is
equal to his will in this point, from his own cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
he obtains what ever he deſires to execute,
and all his faculties are ſo ſubſervient, that he hath
often drawn ſervices from them, that ſeemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to nature. Some humoriſts have refrained
ſmiling, and purſuing their reſolution have ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſht
from their countenance that pleaſant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
which diſtinguiſheth us from other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Temperance hath taught others to ſuppreſs
their appetites, and hath ſo much forced their own
inclinations as never to taſt Wine. Some have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themſelves againſt the violent aſſaults of
love, have had in deriſion all thoſe pleaſant Faces
that have made ſo many Idolaters in the World;
and have ſo much conquered themſelves as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Maſters of a <hi>Paſſion</hi> that hath all men for
Slaves. There have been others that have ſo far
commanded themſelves as to live without ſleep,
and have made watching ſo familiar to them as
that they have not been ſeen to cloſe their eye-lids.
In fine, man is abſolute in his Goverment, he hath
not undertaken any thing which he brought not to
perfection, difficulties have diſcovered his ſtrength;
and we have ſeen nothing ſo irkſom which he hath
not ſurmounted when he joyned perſeverance to
his courage.</p>
                  <p>The labors then which he ought to imploy to
gain this perfection, ought not to divert him from
ſo glorious a deſign, and without hunting for many
reaſons to prompt him to it, it will ſuffice that he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64170:72"/>
reflect upon his own life to be taught, that it is
as eaſy to Conquer as to moderate his <hi>Paſſions.</hi>
The greater part of his actions are real puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all that he does is mixt with diſquiet; and
I know not but it might be more eaſy for him to
live without <hi>Paſſions,</hi> then to act what he daily
performs. For what is more delightful then a
vertuous vacation, and what is more toilſom then
Anger? What is more tranquil then clemency,
and what more turmoiling then cruelty? Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
begets content, but Love is unſatiable, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
loves to be at quiet, but deſire delights in
trouble, humanity is quiet, but confidence is ever
buſied.</p>
                  <p>In fine, Vertue is treatable with ſattisfaction,
but <hi>Paſſions</hi> are not converſable without hazard of
Conſcience reſt or liberty. From all theſe diſcourſes
it's not difficult to conclude, that a wiſe man may
be without <hi>Paſſions,</hi> ſince they are not natural to
him; ſince ſenſe and opinion are their ſprings,
ſince their ſervices are dangerous, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
employ them in his neceſſities, without injury
to his liberty or courage.</p>

that Philoſopher never made any thing ſo glorious

Queen of Vertues, he ſets her on a Throne ſo
glorious as he can hardly afford his Gods to be
equal to her; he places all thoſe noble habitudes at
her footſtool, he gives them in charge to obſerve
all her Commands, he forbids them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any thing without her order, and he fancies
that Vertues are ſufficiently honoured when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
them employments in her ſervice; he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
Prudence to be careful of her preſervation,
to prevent all things that may annoy her tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and to uſe her utmoſt skill to ſtrengthen her
Power. He commands Juſtice to be liberal in her
favor, to divide Eſtates with Diſcretion, not to
let her ſuffer an injury, and to make all men her
friends by doing good to every one. Fortitude
muſt defend the Body againſt Grief, ſhe muſt not
ſuffer that choice Companion with whom ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
makes her abode, to be aſſaulted by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and if ſhe cannot totally hinder it, ſhe muſt,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64170:73"/>
at leaſt, endeavour to moderate the rigors thereof
by the remembrance of paſt delights. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
muſt regulate her inclinations, preſcribe the
ſeaſons, quantity and quality of her Meat and
Drink; and muſt ſo uſe her to Sobriety, that ſhe
muſt abhor debaucheries, and love nothing but
what is eaſie to acquire. But above all, care muſt
be taken ſo to correct the qualities of the Elements
of which ſhe is compoſed, that one entrench not
upon the other, that Grief or Anger diſcompoſe
not the conſtitution, and that health, in which her
greateſt happineſs conſiſteth, be no way interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The erection of ſo unreaſonable an Empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
all Philoſophers. They that had before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Pleaſure a ſeat in their Schools, could not
now ſuffer ſo unjuſt an uſurpation; and judging it
to be the moſt inſolent act of a ſhameleſs man to put
Vertue under the ſubjection of her enemy, they
all made head againſt the Author; and although
they had no other weapons but Tongue or Pen
wherewith to aſſault him, yet did they charge
him with ſo many reproaches, that his Diſciples
are at this day in deſpair of procuring his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
True it is that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes an excuſe
for him, when he mixeth delight with human
actions, when he makes Joy the companion of
our occupations, and aſſures us that Pleaſure is
not leſs uſeful to the Body than neceſſary to the
Mind. That Joy ſweetens our toyls, recruits our
tyred vigor, adminiſters comfort to the miſerable,
and gives us all thoſe advantages which other
<hi>Paſſions</hi> promiſe us. That Nature ſtands in need
of refreſhments, that ſhe becomes weary by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64170:74"/>
labours, and that ſhe muſt be comforted by
divertiſements, if we expect renewed ſervices
from her. He adds, that the enjoyment of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
becomes irkſom if it be not attended with
Delight, and that it is an abuſe of our Faculties
and Senſe not to employ thoſe aids that Nature
hath given us to bring our Travels to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In fine, that Joy is natural to us, that ſhe is
nouriſhed with us from the Cradle, that ſhe is
mixt with all the actions of Life, and that it is
a ſelf-cruelty to employ her otherwiſe than that
common Mother intended.</p>
                  <p>I know that this Doctrine is not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without being accounted ſtupid or ſavage in
the Peripatetick Opinion, and that it is a kind of
temerity to attempt the deſtruction of a <hi>Paſſion</hi>
whoſe Lovers are all the Poets, whoſe Panegyriſts
are all Orators, and whoſe Advocates are moſt
of the Philoſophers. Yet muſt we declare that
in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Principles ſhe is of no uſe to Vertue,
that Vertue is too generous to ſeek her ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of her ſelf, that ſhe is happy in her own
deſerts, and eſteems it even a diſhonour to look
upon Pleaſure as her end, and to uſe her as a means
to accompliſh it: likewiſe thoſe that make love to
her pretend to no other Rewards but the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her ſelf; they eſteem themſelves happy
enough when they can obtain her; and though
Death or Envy be ſometimes the price of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
they cannot be perſwaded to forſake her.
But then their motive is unlike that of other men;
for beſides that theſe undertake nothing but what
they are hurried to by their ſelf-intereſts, ſetting up
Pleaſures for the recompenſe of their Labors, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64170:74"/>
love not Vertue but becauſe they hope to find De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
among her attendants; they lay hold on
benefits that are but ſuch in ſhow; and, abuſed
by common opinion, they ſeek their felicity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
things that are the cauſes of their ſorrow.
Some imagine that Wealth is able to procure their
happineſs, and leaning upon the <hi>eſteem</hi> that moſt
men make thereof, they promiſe themſelves Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
by the acquiſition of Riches. Others are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with Honors, and perſwading themſelves that
praiſes are often the fruits of Vertue, they place
their felicity in airy Titles. Some are ſo ſenſual
and effeminate as they affect only infamous or
ſuperfluous things, thoſe Feaſts that were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for their recreations become their whole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:
they take delight in the converſation
of diſſolute women, and they would deem their
lives miſerable if they ſhould be deprived of thoſe
objects that flatter their Taſt or their Luſt. Some
others more generous aſpire to Grandeurs, they
draw vanity from the multitude of Subjects, and
as if their felicity encreaſed by the number of their
Slaves, they pleaſe themſelves only in the ſacking
of Towns, in the ruine of Countries, and in the
conqueſt of Kingdoms. Others there are that
vainly boaſt of their Learning, they employ the
faireſt part of their life in contemplating Natures
wonders, they think there is nothing more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than the knowledg of their Eſſence; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they cannot but know that ſuch skill will
not render them more vertuous, yet ceaſe they
not to lodg their felicity in it.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe delights have ſo little coherence
with Innocence and Tranquillity, that we cannot
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64170:75"/>
engage with them without loſing the one and
hazarding the other; their brevity is an evident
mark of their fallacy, and <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid moſt truly
that as intemperance charmed the miſery of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
by a delightful madneſs that laſted for a
moment, ſo thoſe objects afford divertiſement on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make men the more ſenſible of Sorrow when
the vanity that attends them is diſcovered. To
make judgment of a mans happineſs we muſt know
if he be of an even temper in all his actions,
if his Joy be as conſtant as the Vertue from whence
it proceeds, if he change not his reſolution with
the variety of objects, and if he preſerve the ſame
meaſures in time of proſperity as in the ſtate of
adverſity. A wiſe man ought to imitate the ſtars
fixt by God Almighty in the firmament, he ought
to conſider the ſublunary revolutions without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
and the evil that aſſaults him ought no
more to diſcompoſe him, then the ſplendid favors
of fortune to ſwell his mind.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not then be wondered if the Stoicks
maintain ſo fierce a war againſt Pleaſure, ſince
they find it void of Reaſon; if they condemn the
uſe thereof ſince it runs always to exceſs; and if
they baniſh it from the Court of their wiſe man,
ſince it moſt commonly proceeds from cauſes as
unjuſt as imaginary. For, to ſpeak properly, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is the Fountain, this Fantaſtick which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
our underſtanding, corrupts our Will, and
diſguiſing the nature of the objects, leads us into
delights that either abuſe or make us guilty. For
which cauſe <hi>Zeno</hi> thought it no offence againſt
Truth, to deſcribe Joy, An inclination of the Soul
againſt Nature, occaſioned by the opinion of a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64170:75"/>
delightful thing, that ſeemed to afford us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
for what advantages ſoever <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> invents
to feed our Delights, it muſt be ſaid that opinion
is their Mother, that the objects are the Authors,
that the principle, and their uſe would never
pleaſe us if we were not perverted by the report
that opinion delivers of them. From thence it
comes that a ſick man takes delight in things hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that a vicious man rejoyceth in Debauchery,
that a Lover takes pride in his Servitude, that
Princes build their Glory upon the Honors given
to them by their Subjects, and that the vainly
curious make Idols of Flowers, Pictures and
Images.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe we ſee that when the mind becomes
diſabuſed, that truth ſucceeds the outward ſhews,
and that Reaſon diſcovers all theſe Pleaſures to be
but the effects of opinion, and the employments
of ſick or idle perſons, they ſoon alter their
minds; that which before flattered their ſenſe,
they now deſpiſe, thoſe Grandeurs that limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their pretenſions become void of Charms to
ſtay their deſires, they ceaſe to admire dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Beauties, and they finally turn Perſecutors
of them whom before they adored. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
in his Confeſſions is aſtoniſht that God ſhould
be ſatisfied with his own felicity, that his Will
ſhould be unchangeable, and that one and the
ſame Eſſence ſhould always be the cauſe of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs:
that the Angels ſhould be eternal in their
Affections, that their Love ſhould be as conſtant
as their Knowledg, that they ſhould be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
knit to the Subject of their Glory, and
that man only ſhould delight in Change, that the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64170:76"/>
injoyment of benefits which he hath violently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed
ſhould become nauſeous to him, and that he
ſhould ſo much love Novelty, as often to convert
his greateſt Pleaſures into Torments. Some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
thought they had ſatisfied this doubt,
by alleadging that man drew his inconſtancy from
the Heavens, and that being compoſed of a mixt
body, which is always in agitation, he cannot but
partake of its qualities. Some others have thrown
this defect upon Nature, they ſay that his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is incompatible with Reſt, that his greateſt
content is in variety, and that as he is ſeldom in
one and the ſame mind, it ought not to ſeem
ſtrange that his temper ſo often differs. But
what Reaſons ſoever they aſſign, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with <hi>Seneca,</hi> that Opinion is the only cauſe
of this inconſtancy, that it is ſhe that alters his
Reſolutions, that runs his Underſtanding into
error, that makes him approve what himſelf
condemns, and perſwades him that without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
againſt his own Judgment, he may prefer
a greater before a ſmaller benefit.</p>

We may ſay that malice is arrived to an extrem,
when infamous things do not only divertize us,
but delight us, when vices become our manners,

                  <p>Love is not ſo pleaſing a <hi>Paſſion</hi> as to invite men
to erect him Altars, and they have plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
that they knew but the meaneſt part of his
nature, when they went about to make him the
glory and delight of Lovers. For although the
other motions of the Soul be irkſom, that their
violence quarrels Reaſon, and that their humor be
not leſs oppoſite to Juſtice then Temperance, yet
have they this advantage upon Love, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us reſpite, and that after having made us feel
their fury, they leave us in a condition wherein
we taſt a kind of reſt. Deſire doth not always tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

us, and ſo ſoon as Hope makes but ſhew of
leaving him, he falls a ſleep. Sorrow doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
throw us into deſpair, and by giving her but
the leaſt aſſiſtance you may draw her from her
abaſement.</p>
                  <p>Anger, that wild and untreatable <hi>Paſſion,</hi> is not
always in the perſuit of vengeance, ſhe will take
her eaſe when ſhe hath troubled us a while, and
when ſhe has gnawn the Bit ſhe is at quiet. But
Love will grant us no ceſſation, he perſecuteth his
Slaves at all times, his favors are as fatal as his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces,
and it is not eaſy to judg whether his
ſcorns or his carreſſes be moſt dangerous. Thoſe
Beauties for which men languiſh, are the cauſe of
all their miſeries, if they flatter their Hopes they
encreaſe their flaming deſires, and they tumble
headlong into inſolence and extravagance if they
anſwer not their expectations. The liberty which
that glorious ſex vouchſafeth to man to approch
their perſons proves as pernicious as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
not to preſume to come into their preſence,
they fight againſt the one and are vanquiſht by the
other; and our condition is ſo miſerable, that we
cannot practiſe them without being their Slaves,
nor endure difficulty to obtain their favors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
becoming their Martyrs. What greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can an Enemy be condemned unto, then to
love a Creature that derides or makes her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of his liberty? What greater cruelty can
be invented then to make Men idolize a Miſtreſs
that either maintains her rigor, or perſeveres in her
kindneſs? Both one and the other are as dangerous
as diſhonorable: and if a man be unjuſt to beſtow
his affection upon a perſon that diſdains his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addreſſes,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64170:78"/>
he is mean ſpirited when he ſubmits to
her who ought to obey him. Likewiſe they that
diſcourſe moſt ſolidly of loves eſſence, are in doubt
to believe that it is natural to man, they aſſure us
that there is another Principle in him which the
art of Phyſick hath not yet diſcovered, and that
a <hi>Paſſion</hi> which overthrows the
order of nature cannot be of
her production:<note place="margin">Si naturalis amor eſſet, &amp; amarent omnes, &amp; ſemper amarent, &amp; idem amarent; Neque alium pudor, alium co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatio, alium ſatietas deterreret. <hi>Petr.</hi> dial. 69.</note> for, ſay they,
If love be born with us, it muſt
be common to all men; that
the Objects by which ſome
are inſnared ought to make
impreſſion on the minds of
others, that the ſhame and infamy that attends it
ought not to divert them, and that by a neceſſary
concluſion, one Woman ſhould have all men for
Suitors, or one Man ſhould have all Women for
Miſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the inclinations of Men are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
that one and the ſame object procures Love
and Hatred to divers perſons, and that one views
with indifference what another beholds not but
with Admiration. They infer that love is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that opinion is the Mother of this diverſity of
wills, who repreſents us things other then indeed
they are, and makes us conceive a Love for that
which is unworthy of it. Thoſe Faces to whom
Heaven hath not been liberal in favors, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
freed from ſuſpition, ſome men fall in
Love with <hi>Baboons</hi> in feminine habits. Uncleanneſs
is ſometimes as ugly as ſhameful, and it is not
more ordinary for the deformed to love, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
for the beautiful to be courted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:64170:78"/>
All the parts of the Body unite when they are
employed in the work of Nature, the ſenſes that
are uncapable of conduct, conſtrain their aſſiſtance
to ſuccor or enlighten her, and the faculties of the
Soul are ſo ſubſerviant to her, that they always
abandon their private differences to execute her
orders.</p>
                  <p>But Love diſpiſeth all her Precepts, weakens
her vigor, corrupts her inclinations, oppoſeth her
dictates and by a fury as blind as unjuſt poureth
confuſion into all her Dominions. Never is man
leſs reaſonable then when he is ſeized by this <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
and he never appears more indiſcreet then
when he gives ear to his Counſels or admits
his ſuggeſtions. The moſt noble of his habitudes
vaniſh at the appearance of this Tyrant, his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
flags, his Counſels are uncertain, his ſtrength
tranſmutes into Temerity, and having no thought
for any thing but the Subject of his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
as uſeleſs to his friends as burthenſome to
himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poets</hi> had ſome Reaſon to feign that their
<hi>Jupiter</hi> intermitted his own felicity when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from Heaven to be a
companion of women,<note place="margin">Amare ſimul, &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere ipſi Jovi non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> that the
converſation of Creatures ſo
little valuable, debaſed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that the Empire of Love was incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with his Perſon, and that he did neceſſarily
ceaſe to be a God ſo often as he ſubjected himſelf
to his Slaves. Although theſe wiſe Prattlers
might think that their God was unchangable, and
that they had more in deſign to publiſh the power
of Love, then to make him a Soveraign of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64170:79"/>
Diety to whom they paid Divine adorations; yet
may it be ſaid that this fable is become a real truth
upon Earth, and that the <hi>Paſſion</hi> which they feigned
to preſcribe Laws to their Gods, ſwallows up man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and guides the inclinations contrary to
their Nature. He is ſo powerful upon their minds
that he changeth all their faculties, he makes the
fearful audacious, he inſpires the Niggard with
liberality, he engageth the moſt generous to ſerve
in vile and ridiculous actions, he abaſeth the proud,
he makes wiſe men carry Fools baubles, and by a
new <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> he turns <hi>Dunces</hi> into <hi>Poets</hi> and
<hi>Orators.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as theſe are ſtrained diſguiſes, which ought
to be rather attributed to the force of Fancy, then
to the power of the thing loved, they eaſily return
to their firſt inclinations, they renounce their
<hi>Amours</hi> to purſue what is more ſuitable to their
humors, they become at laſt the Perſecutors of
thoſe Beauties which before had made them Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters:
for as ſoon as the Sun of Reaſon begins to
dart forth his Lights, that the judgment examins
his firſt decrees, and that the will acknowledgeth
his Errors, then he learns without much preaching,
that Love is imperious, that he cannot be obeyed
without hazard of liberty, that a man is a Slave ſo
ſoon as he becomes ſubject to his Laws, and that
Kings ought to think of laying down their
Crowns from the hower that they become Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Plato</hi> exerciſe his Oratory in favor of Love
as much as he will, let him make it the Governor
of Arts and Sciences, and let him give it, if he
pleaſe, the glory of having ſubmitted the whole
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64170:79"/>
Earth to his Empire, he ſhall be conſtrained to
acknowledg that it is the moſt ſordid and the
moſt blind of our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and that he muſt have
loſt both his ſenſe and his Reaſon that becomes his
advocate. For what can be ſhewed us more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Man, then to ſubject him to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to make him forſake his underſtanding to
follow her fantaſtick humor, and to creep ſo far
into her Dominion, as to have no deſires but what
are hers, no reſolutions but what proceed from
her lips, nor any Authority but what is confirmed
by her decrees. Sometimes, as if the Beauty he
adores were a Diety, he grows pale in approaching
her Perſon, he trembles as often as he ſees her,
his Tongue gets the Cramp, when he would ſpeak
to her, and his Soul diſtracted with exceſs of the
<hi>Paſſion,</hi> can form nothing but nonſenſical and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
words. We muſt truly ſay that Love is
an Enemy to nature, ſince it violates all her Laws,
changeth the conſtitution of the moſt noble part
of her Workmanſhip, and that leaving him in a
condition where he hath no more the command
of himſelf, he can undertake nothing that is not
ridiculous or irregular.</p>
                  <p>To avoid them all theſe diſorders, and to defend
our Selves from the Tyranny of ſo malignant a
<hi>Paſſion,</hi> Reaſon muſt timely prevent his aſſaults,
and we muſt conſider before we engage with ſuch
an Enemy, that the object to which he would draw
us is not in our Power, that it is a benefit that
cannot contribute to our felicity, and that the
greateſt Beauties are Heavenly preſents placed
upon Womnes faces, only to puniſh the folly of
indiſcreet and curious Perſons. That this delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64170:80"/>
proportion of parts is an advantage of as ſmall
continuance as of great danger, that it's a flower
that fades in few days, and a favor of Nature, to
which all the accidents of life may prove inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p>In fine, that Beauty is but a Sun that borrows
all his Vertue from our opinion, and which would
be void of light if it drew not it's ſplender from
our blindneſs. Indeed, if Love had not found the
way to put out mens eyes he had long ſince been a
King without Subjects, we ſhould have been no
more Souldiers liſted under his command, thoſe
who fight under his Banners would become his
greateſt Enemies, and they would diſdain to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
their affections to a Miſtreſs whoſe chiefeſt
excellence is nothing but what ſhe hath borrowed
from the vain eſteem of fooliſh men. But Love
knows ſo well how to diſguiſe her defects, that he
ſees not any thing in her of which he raiſeth not
the price, he makes her apparent blemiſhes to paſs
for currant perfections, and though ſhe be often
endued but with ordinary Charms, he forbears
not to give her exceſſive praiſes. He raviſheth the
Lilly of her whiteneſs to colour her face, he ſteals
the Bluſh of Roſes to embelliſh her Cheeks, he
dims the gliſtering of the ſtars to increaſe the
brightneſs of her eyes; and to hear him ſpeak of
her, Nature hath nothing wonderful in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is not ſummed up in her Perſon. He
reſembles thoſe Idols that have eyes and ſee not,

                  <p>PHiloſophy owns nothing in Nature more
glorious than her ſelf, all her Participants
take ſhare in her Grandeur, and although
ſhe ſuffers not her Suitors to draw vanity
from their applications, ſhe dares commend her
ſelf without fear of offending againſt the good
manners ſhe makes profeſſion to teach them. The
Delights ſhe promiſeth to ſuch as court her, ſeem
to her too innocent not to attract their Love,
and ſhe concludes that a man muſt be without
Courage or without Reaſon to refuſe her his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
when he has diſcovered her merit. She
is ſo noble in her purſuits that ſhe is buſied only
in the contemplation of the chiefeſt Good, and
ſhe is ſo delightful in her employments that
her converſation is never without ſatisfaction;
for beſides that ſhe is the Companion of Vertue,
that ſhe ſhews us the ſecrets of Nature, that ſhe
lifts us up into Heaven to inform us of her Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and that ſhe anticipates our felicity by the
knowledg ſhe gives us of our future happy eſtate,
ſhe fills the Soul with content, ſhe unites our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the object which it ſeeks after, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64170:82"/>
wide the Gates of Truth, and diſcloſing all
her Charms, ſhe ſeemeth to tranſport us from
darkneſs to light, and from Bondage to a glorious
Liberty. The contentment which man receiveth
from the enjoyment of other things is always
imperfect, the frailty of their nature threatens
him with their deprivation, the crimes that uſually
follow it make him doubt their poſſeſſion, and the
difficulty he meets with to preſerve them leave
him but a mixt ſatisfaction of fear and grief.
But underſtanding is a benefit which fortune can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach, the oppreſſors that rob him of his
Wealth cannot touch it, it remains with him when
his goods and honors are ſled away, and a wiſe
man may boaſt of being happy ſo long as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
it.</p>
                  <p>The utility of wiſedom gives place in nothing
to the contentments ſhe promiſes, and if ſhe have
attractions to draw our Love, ſhe hath benefits to
ſatisfy the hopes of her Suitors. The Prince of
Orators is not deceived when he ſtiles her the
Nurſe of young men; the ſtay of the aged, the
ſuccour of the afflicted, and the Protector of
the vertuous. He aſſures us that Religion would be
doubtful if ſhe were not enlightened by knowledg,
and that neceſſarily the Spirit muſt diſunite from
the ſenſes by underſtanding, to conceive her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries;
that their is nothing more dangerous in a
ſtate then an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> who emploies himſelf in
explicating that Doctrin that is above his reach,
and that a Kingdom looks towards it's ruin when
Philoſophers ceaſe to command, and the people to
obey them.</p>

                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64170:82"/>
But though Antiquity make ſo high an eſteem
of knowledg, and that the honors ſhe beſtowed
upon the Ancients obliged them to give her ſuch
glorious Titles, yet the Profeſſors of Divinity
make her the moſt rigorous of their Torments,
and the moſt ingenious among them have confeſt
that her pains ſurpaſs her pleaſures; and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
that muſt be undergon for her, do much
exceed the delights ſhe affords us. Her greateſt
buſineſs is to entertain us with matters as vain as
uſeleſs, all her inſtructions are little more then
eloquent words invented by ſubtilty to amuſe us,
and doubtleſs, a man is not much wronged, if he
be denied that learning which he may be ignorant
of to his advantage, and which he cannot know
without danger.</p>
                  <p>Truth is ſo gentle that ſhe permits all that court
her to take her by the hand; not to deſpiſe her,
is ſufficient to be admitted into her preſence, and
as the Sun imparts his light liberally to all men,
ſhe comunicates freely to all thoſe that ſeek her:
ſhe is obſcure only where ſcience hath bemiſted her.
Thoſe Tracts which art hath beaten to come at her
have made her inacceſſible, that which ought to
conduct us to her, has turned us out of the way,
and man is aſſured to miſs her ſo often as he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploies
learning to find her. Nature had endewed
us with more ready helps to become better; ſhe
hath fixt our felicity to our will, as ſhe condemns
all thoſe habitudes which fill our heads with wind,
ſhe approves no skills that direct us not to vertue,
ſhe rejects all that ſublime knowledg whereof the
learned make their boaſt. She eſteems them the
inventions of eaſe, and delights which after having
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64170:83"/>
a while entertained our fancy leave us in diſpair
of finding her.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe arts which we ſtile liberal, are but the
paſs time of youth, School-boys muſt learn them,
and a man is not to converſe with them any longer
then while he is uncapable of more excellent
knowledg. For if they be the beginning they are
not the end of his ſtudies, if they make part of
our Apprentiſhip, they are not to be our employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and if they help to make us knowing,
they contribute nothing to our vertue. Alſo <hi>Seneca</hi>
acknowledgeth but one ſcience that leads us to
wiſdom, that teacheth us modeſty with the art of
good Expreſſion, and that putting us into a ſtate
of liberty, at once inſpireth us with the Prudence
of Politicians, the Valor of Conquerors, and the
conſtancy of Philoſophers.</p>
                  <p>But ſhe is ſo excellent that ſhe admits no rival,
ſhe endures not inferior Allies, and ſhe would
think it a Treaſon againſt her own Grandeur if
ſhe ſhould vouchſafe them her company. As the
deſigns of Princes are not formed from the wild
opinions of their People, and as Commanders
baniſh from their Counſels thoſe advices which
conduce not to the end propoſed, vertue rejects
all that is not for her purpoſe, ſhe retains but
what is neceſſary; and as ſhe eſteems it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
in a covetous man to wiſh for ſuperfluous
Riches, ſhe concludes that it would be a kind of
intemperance in a wiſeman to deſire the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

ſhe commands that practice ſhould be the

lives in the ſearch without the love of Truth.
When God placed man in the terreſtrial Paradice,
he inſpired him only with the knowledg of things
needful for him, although the favors wherewith
he honoured him were exceſſive. He limited his
Science, He would not he ſhould learn what could
not profit him; and, in the opinion of <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> he
ſent him not the Animals made of Corruption to
give Names unto, but for that the knowledg
thereof was not of uſe to him, too much Learning
is always inſolent, and edifieth not; as we find
no Conquerors that are not proud, we ſee no
learned men that are not puffed up, Divines can
tell us that the proud Angels ſtrayed not from
their Duty but by having too much knowledg.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was of opinion that the famous men
of old were often guilty of fantaſtical actions, that
they made ſmall ſallies which were little different
from great follies, that their Extaſies ſurpaſt the
ſtrength of their Reaſon, and that they could bring
forth nothing above ordinary men which was not
akin to fury. Thoſe great Wits which Antiquity
puts amongſt the number of Prodigies, have not
always been the wiſeſt men, their Works are not
irreproveable no more than their Lives, if they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64170:84"/>
have written ſome things worthy of honor, they
have left us others as ridiculous, and their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
confeſs they had intervals in which they were
not more reaſonable than mad men. Although
this Language be oppoſite to the common opinion
of the people, and that the benefits of knowledg
oblige men to give it reverence where ever they
find it, yet I think it not hard to draw them to
the contrary ſentiment, and to obtain their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that the knowing men at this day are but
delightful dotards who act the fool by authority,
and teach impertinencies with approbation. For
what is it that our Profeſſors of Learning do when
they inſtruct us to define all things by their chiefeſt
attributes, to ſeparate their nature from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
and, by the aid of propoſitions infer that
Vertue is a Gender, that Juſtice and Prudence are
the Species, and that Vertue is ſeparable from
Temperance, but that Temperance is not to be
divided from Vertue? What profit do we reap
from theſe formalities? Of what uſe is it to know
how to compoſe a formal Diſcourſe? to reduce an
Argument to an impoſſibility? to frame Sophiſms
to enſnare the unlearned? and to uſe <hi>Dilemma's</hi>
and Inductions to ſurprize the unskilful? What
advantage can we hope from the knowledg of
Natural Philoſophy, to be informed that the Earth
is ſolid, that God by his Power can ſeparate the
form from the matter, that he unites at his pleaſure
two ſubſtantial forms into one compound, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the ſubſtance to produce a third by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediation
of accidents, to which he communicates
his efficacy? What ſerves it us to diſcover the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the Heavens, to know that the Planets
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64170:84"/>
are corruptible, that the Sun is a mixt not a pure
Element, that the Stars are void of Life, and that
the whole Earth is but a Point compared with
the Firmament that ſurrounds it? In fine, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
do we acquire when we are taught by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
that God is infinit? that the Unity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
agrees with the Trinity of his Perſons? that the
Father begets the Son from all eternity? and that
the holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the
Son hath the communication of their Perfections?
Were it not better that all the Arts were baniſhed
the Schools, than that they ſhould entertain us
with ſo many unedifying things, that they ſhould
teach us to regulate our Wills rather than our
Fancies, and how to live vertuouſly, rather than
to diſpute well? Were it not to be wiſht that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
by which we flouriſh our Harangues, by
which we examine the property of Speech, and
which boaſteth of laying open Truth by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty

and to reject all theſe vain amuſements of

of Divinity would diſcover to us the way
to love rather than define the Creator, and inſtead
of informing us of his Eſſence, and labouring to
make us conceive the myſterious Trinity of his

Are not her Remedies
as cruel as hazardous? The
Diſputes of her Doctors, have
they not been the deſtruction

Do not Phyſicians make traffick of human Bodies

at the price of our Lives? And ſee we not daily
that they ſend Death to their Patients with the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64170:86"/>
Drinks that ought to cure them? The Churches
and Church-yards are full of their victims; the
Marbles that cover them publiſh nothing but their
injuſtice; and if the Stones, under which they lie
were not inſenſible, they would openly accuſe
them of Temerity and Ambition: they would
proclaim to all the world that they are deprived
of Life by uſing too much means to preſerve it,
that Art haſtened their Sepulture, and that the
multitude of Medicaments was the only cauſe of
their Death. So that Science which was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to divert or comfort us, is turned into our

Authority, ſhe from thence formeth Conſequences
no leſs dangerous than to her they ſeem evident.
In fine, Knowledg is an immortal evil, her fury is
without bounds, her malice exceeds the limits of

are ſo conſiderable that we muſt be ignorant of

muſt forſake us if we eſteem not the moſt noble

to the obſervation of her maxims, that our glory

they were not afraid to declare that we were more

That if we received this from Heaven, we obtained

of God as our Soveraign, and to reſpect

ſhe take upon her the care of inſtructing Princes,
of leading their Subjects in the paths of obedience,
of ſhewing Fathers how to educate their Children,
and of furniſhing States-men with thoſe excellent
rules by which to retain the people within the
lemits of reſpect, and to make themſelves dreaded

ineffectual to their purpoſe, if ſhe had not
firſt allured them from their Caves and Foreſts, to
give them the diſcipline of good manners; and
preſerving to every one their right, taught them
to erect Houſes, Caſtles and Citadells. Indeed it's
ſhe that invented Architecture, that contrived the

the Architects that raiſed them are but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

Authority, and what care ſoever the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
takes to preſerve them from diſorder they
cannot in ſuch families hinder the commiſſion of
thoſe Crimes which in Huts and Cottages are
unknown. Theives take the advantage of their
Woods and Coverts to ſurprize the harmleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
Traveller, the domeſticks lead a diſorderly
life, the Maſters ſpend their time in Play and Riot
their ſervants become lazie, their Stewards grow
rich, and their Lords poor, and the frequenters
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64170:88"/>
of ſuch Houſes, inſenſibly become vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent.
It is with families as with Cities, the
greateſt are commonly the moſt vicious; becauſe
men live in Palaces more at their eaſe, they do not
therefore lead more vertuous lives, vice attends
plentiful Tables, and be it that liberty or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
facilitates the way to ſin, experience ſheweth
that they who enjoy them ſeldom eſcape unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</p>
                  <p>But we likewiſe ſee, that Divine Juſtice gives
Commiſſion to the works of great men to become
their tormentors, they tremble in the midſt of their
Palaces, they are afraid of death under the covert
of their guilded Ceelings, the cleft of a wall puts
them into a fright, the clattering of a ſhutter
drives their courage to a <hi>Non-plus,</hi> and they fear
their days to be at an end every time the wind
breaks a pane of their Windows, or puffs up a
Tile from their Roof. The places of ſafety are
not ſecure to them, and they are as much amazed
to ſee the tapiſtry ſlip from the wall as if an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
had violently thrown up the foundation of
their Dwelling.</p>
                  <p>How much more happy do I eſteem the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of our forefathers, who neglecting the art
of building, contented themſelves with the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that nature had made them, thoſe Chambers
which ſhe had indented in the Rocks ſerved them
for places of retreat, the open Fields were their
floores, a large heap of Earth caſed with Moſs,
was their Bed, and as Vanity had not yet taught
them the art of adorning their Dwellings, they
retired to the Caves of the Earth as to the places
of their recreation. If they found a neceſſity of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64170:88"/>
building Houſes, art had no ſhare therein, the
Earth without opening her Bowels, ſerved them
for foundations, mud mixt with ſtraw was the
matter, the ſpoiles of Trees furniſht the Roofs
and Covering, and two forked poles interlaced
on each ſide ſupported the whole ſtructure. The
ſmall accomodations that ſecured them from the
outragious influences of the weather, were alſo
their defence againſt ravenous Beaſts, and they
lived more happily in thoſe their Huts, then Princes
do at this day in their glorious Palaces. For they
were free under ſtraw and moſs, and theſe are
Bondmen upon Thrones of Gold and Ivory;
they found the contentment of happy men in their
poverty, and theſe meet with the miſeries of the
damned in their Plenty. Though they poſſeſs all
things, yet are they never ſatisfied, and it ſeemeth
as if Heaven had granted them the temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of abundance, only to render them eternally
miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe men that were ignorant of the uſe of
Noble ſtructures, who lived in woods and forreſts,
who built not but to defend themſelves againſt
the intemperatures of the Air, paſt their time with
content, their nights were not interrupted with
vexatious thoughts, they awakened as chearful in
the morning as they contentedly laid themſelves
down to reſt over night. Our cares commenced
with the art of Building, the Edifices that encloſe
us raviſh our reſt, and it may be ſaid we became
unhappy, when knowledg perſwaded us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
our Dales and Cottages to inhabit Palaces
and Lordlike Houſes.</p>

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:64170:89"/>
A wiſe man that knows the vanity of our ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
deſpiſeth them, he uſeth Houſes as places
of refuge, not as apartments to dwell in, he looks
upon them as fortreſſes invented by neceſſity to
warrant him from injurious ſeaſons, and without
being concerned for the matter whereof they are
compoſed, he lodgeth his felicity in his vertues
and in his conſcience; he eſteems his habitation
ſumptuous enough, when he hath vertue for his
Gueſt, he conſiders the manſions of Noble men
as the Sepulchres of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">Illud humile tugurium nempe vertutes recipit, jam omnibus templis formoſius erit. <hi>Sen.</hi> Cens. ad Helu. cap. 9.</note> he calls them the retreats
of men that know how to
hide themſelves but not how
to live, and whoſe ſpirits are
mean enough to love their
Priſons, but wanting courage to deſpiſe them.</p>
                  <p>They who delight in Gardens are not more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable;
and what pretext ſoever they lay hold
on to authoriſe their practice, they cannot eſcape
the cenſure of Philoſophers. The pleaſures which
theſe men boaſt of taſting in ſuch exerciſes, ſeem
not to them ſufficiently pure and innocent to rob
them of their time; and though they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to themſelves great advantages by their fruits
or beauty, yet could they never intice thoſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
men to approve ſuch employments. They
paſs the ſentence of blame upon them for that
they conclude them unſerviceable to wiſdom, and
they inveigh againſt their Authors, becauſe they
entertain us only with things vain and forreign.
<hi>Socrates,</hi> who ſo perfectly underſtood the injuſtice
and ſordidneſs of our divertiſements, baniſheth
this employment from his School, he prefers the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64170:89"/>
City before the Country, he adviſeth his Scholars
to be Citizens and not Peaſants; and well knowing
flowers and Trees are ſpeechleſs things, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
them by his own Example not to conſult
thoſe Tutors, who if they be able to recreate their
Eyes, cannot ſatisfy their Ears.</p>
                  <p>I know that the <hi>Romans</hi> made eſteem of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
that the moſt famous amongſt them made
ſuch their abode, that they diſingaged themſelves
from the care of the Empire to exercize a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
life, and that a great number of their wiſe
men retired to ſuch places, the better to apply
themſelves to the ſtudy of Philoſophy. I know
that the curious walks and plots of Gardens, are
friends to the Muſes, that the refined wits take
pleaſure in them, that the greateſt part of thoſe
works we admire at this day, had their conception
there, and that their ſhady retirements have often
been of more uſe to the learned then the Schools
and conferences. There I know that the <hi>Poets</hi>
compoſed thoſe verſes that animated many men
to glorious Actions, that the Orators there made
their <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in vertues favor, and that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
there taught us quietly to attend our
change, to reſiſt misfortunes with a reſolution, and
to expect death without fear.</p>
                  <p>But I alſo know that Gardens were made but for
diverſion, that they are the ordinary employments
of inſignificant men, and that the greateſt number
of ſuch ſpend their time therein but for recreation.
Some are ſo linckt to them that they make it their
whole buſineſs; they paſs away all their life in the
obſervation of party coloured flowers, they form
and contrive ſpacious walks only for delight, they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64170:90"/>
invent mazes and labyrinths only to have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of being at aloſs; and if they adorn them with
murmuring Rivers, and reflecting Fountains, it is
but to renew their Pleaſures, to be charmed into a
ſleep by the noiſe of the waters that run from
them. They ſpend a proportion of their revenues
to buy Onyons, they turn Merchants of forraign
Plants, they value nothing but what was unknown
in the Gardens of their Anceſtors, and they would
never be content if they thought they had not
comprehended in their ground all the rarities that
the Earth produceth.</p>
                  <p>What an extaſie of joy are they in, when their
Garden has brought them forth a new flower,
when a Tulip is curiouſly ſtreaked, when an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is finely doubled, and that a Pinck hath
delightfully coloured her leaves with the mixture
of bloud and milk? But then again how are they
diſtaſted when the Worms have got into their
onion Beds, when the Sun hath withered a Plant
which they had carefully cheriſhed in a curious
Pot, when the wind or the cold has kill'd a young
wall Tree? We ſhall ſee ſome as much afflicted for
theſe loſſes as others for a Kingdom, and I cannot
tell whether they would not better bear the death
of the deareſt of their friends, then the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of a fine Tulip, or a curious Emony. What
more vexatious occupation could curioſity have
invented to torment us, then to affect us with the
art of Gardening, to exercize a mans care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
flowers, and to convert the moſt innocent
of recreations into matters of grief and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:64170:90"/>
If then Heaven have permitted us the delight
of Gardens, let us uſe them as places of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not as retreats for idleneſs, let their
ſhady beds and ſeats ſerve to unweary us, not to
ſleep in, let their obſcure Arbors put us in mind
of the habitations of the dead, and not ſerve to
act our private debaucheries in, and let all that we
there meet with ſerve modeſtly to divert, not to
employ us. Let us not bid more for things then
they are worth, let us judg of the beauty of our
Gardens by the report of wiſe not of curious men,
and let us learn of them that all theſe odoriferous
ſtars which we ſo much eſteem, are but party co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored
knots of Graſs: and, to uſe the words of a
Greek-Poet, <hi>Zephyrus</hi> breaths, that laſt a few days
and flatter our ſight the better to make us bewail
their loſs, when they have changed their glory into
corruption.</p>

they cannot baniſh it from their will, without the
extremity of Violence. They love God though

in the perſon of his Children, though they
are not any more in a condition to communicate

Although the love we have for beauty be not
ſo natural as that which we bear to goodneſs, that
the one be affixt to our ſubſtance and the other
attend upon our will, that the one be an inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of nature; and the other but an effect of
opinion, it is therefore not leſs univerſal, and I
know not if there be any Nation under Heaven
that have not therewith been attainted. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridionals</hi>
who baniſh formal courts and reveling
from their aſſemblies, deſpiſe not gay cloathing,
they put on rich apparel ſo oft as they deſire to be
ſeen in publick; and deeming that their veſtures
ſet off the beauty of the Body, they array it with
their choiceſt ornaments. They ſet tufts of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
on their heads, they fix Diamonds and Pearls
to their Ears, they dreſs the skins of Beaſts to
cover them, they ſet off the blackneſs of their
Bodies by the whiteneſs of fiſh bones, and as if the
Pomp of their apparel made their Perſons more
honorable, they draw vanity from the coſtlineſs
of their attire. This <hi>Paſſion,</hi> though guilty, is not
by them condemned as criminal, ſhe hath ſome
qualities that make her glorious, her manner of
operating is a Copy of that of the Diety, and
adding to the Body a beauty which before it had
not, ſhe gives us to underſtand that our ſeeking
to her is not ſo much the mark of our indigence
as of her liberality. She beautifies the Body as
the Temple of God, and ſhe is of opinion that

of Perſons by the diverſity of
Garments. They array Kings
in Purple that they may ſeem
the more Majeſtical to their
Subjects, they give Robes to
Senators as tokens of their Employments, they
ſeparate the Nobleſs from the Yeomandry by the
fleece and the garter, and they will have it that
ornaments ſhall be as well the rewards as the ſigns
of valour, but this judicious manner of cloathing
is at preſent out of uſe, opinion hath aboliſhed
the motive.</p>
                  <p>At this day we apparel our ſelves only for ſhew,
the noble men wear their ornaments only out of
vanity, and as the low Eſtate is deſpicable, ſo the
common people put on Genteel habits only to
diſſemble their condition. It is hard now adays
to diſtinguiſh a Merchant from a Gentleman by
his Apparel, one cloath covers them both, and
if it were lawful to judg of the quality of a man
by his Garb, I know not whether ordinary perſons
would not often prefer a Citizen before a Knight.
The Citizens Wives are as exquiſitly dreſt as our
Ladies, the Pearls and Rubies which were formerly
the ornaments of Princeſſes, now magnify their
necks and fingers; the <hi>Indies</hi> have nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
but it's to be ſeen about their Bodies: and
ſome amongſt them are ſuch flebergebits that their
attire muſt not be inferior to the Rings and Jewels
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64170:92"/>
of Dames of the greateſt quality. But as the one
and the other are inexcuſeable they will not be
angry if I place them together, if I make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

                  <p>Nature doth ſo much reſemble truth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon Earth can corrupt her: Art which
brags of being her Ape, could never debauch her
works, that Purple which makes a King and the
Cowl that makes a Hermite, alters not his Face,
and what artifice ſoever induſtry emploies to raiſe
or abaſe it's beauty, ſhe is not able to diſguiſe the
Air and lineaments thereof. We ſee ſome Women
ſo charming that they dart love into men in deſpite
of the Rags that cover them; and ſome are by
nature ſo ill proportioned, that all our Court in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
cannot render them pleaſing, the ſplender
of their Attire encreaſeth their defects, and they
are never more deformed then when they are beſt
accoutred, all that ſhould ſet them off makes them
ugly, and they cauſe their beholders to confeſs,
that if ornaments do ſometimes diminiſh the
graces of the beautiful, they always augment the
imperfections of the unhandſome. Ladies, if this
Principle be true, and if experience conſtrain you
to own it, though with ſome difficulty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
waſte you ſo much time in your attire? What
is that Spaniſh red with which you force your
Cheeks and Lips to bluſh good for? And of what
uſe are all thoſe Jewels which rattle at your Ears?
If you are deformed all theſe ornaments increaſe
your defects, your faults are more viſible when
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64170:93"/>
they approach the glory of your attire, and you
carry nothing of leſs uſe about you then that which
you employ to hide your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomneſs.<note place="margin">Deles picturam a Deo datam mulier, ſi vultum tuum materiali candore oblinas, ſi acquiſito ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore perfundas: illa pictura Vitii non deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris eſt, fraudis non ſimplicitatis. <hi>Amb.</hi> Exam. lib. 6.</note>
I know that
you will fancy your ſelves to
be beautiful, and that it would
be an offence againſt that civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
which you imagin to be
due to your ſex, not to think
as you do. But if you believe
it, why do you betray your

after ornaments to adorn you, and thereby ſilently
confeſs that ye are unhandſome, ſeeing ye have
need of a forreign beauty to ſet off your own:
innocence and purity are Enemies to diſguiſes,
impurity and unworthyneſs ſeek Coverts and off

Woman becomes doubtful of her own perfections
when once ſhe calls to her Jewels and her Silks
for their aſſiſtance to purchaſe the vain Title of
beautiful.</p>
                  <p>It's true that what ſome of the moſt witty of
the ſex have to ſay for themſelves is ingenious;
For they plead that it is to pleaſe their Husbands,
and as their happineſs conſiſteth in the enjoyment
of their good graces, they ought to employ their
utmoſt skill to obtain and preſerve them. But they
forget that in deſigning to preſerve the love of a
man, they looſe the favor of God, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
their Husbands, they beget impudicity in
others; and theſe committing Adulteries upon their
Faces, they are the cauſe of unlawful deſires.
What a folly is it for a Woman to prefer a baſtard
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64170:93"/>
complexion to her own? To drive nature from
her Cheeks by Vermillion, and forfeit her own

and that if Adultery be odious becauſe it is
a violation of Chaſtity, the Luxury of apparel
ought to be abominated, for that it corrupteth our
Nature.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Chriſtian Ladies that lived in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, were far from this vain humor of
Apparel; they deſpiſed outward ornaments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were the Teſtimonials of ſin, they never
clothed themſelves without conſideration of their
Mothers nakedneſs, and as they were chaſt and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64170:94"/>
penitent, they would not make uſe of attires that
ſhould not put them in mind of her diſobedience.
They thought they were going to their own fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
ſo often as they were obliged to dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and making judgment of the miſery of
their condition by the greatneſs of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inflicted on them they believed themſelves
condemned to dye, becauſe they were conſtrained
to carry about them the marks of their crime.
Being the daughters of <hi>Eve,</hi> they were content if
their ſhame were but covered, a peece of Cloath
ſerved for that; they thought it a ſin againſt Juſtice
to be more richly clad then their Parent, and
glorying in the meaneſt of their Apparel, they
taught the Dames of our days that there is no
beauty but that of vertue, no comely white but
that of purity, no lovely red but that of ſhame-facedneſs,
no handſome or graceful behaviour but
that of modeſty.</p>

Salvation, and hath ſo much the aſcendant of their
underſtanding, as to induce them to break the Oath
which they made in the day of their Baptiſm.
For if they will look back into that, they ſhall
find there that they dedicated their liberty to the
Son of God, they promiſed to be his ſpouſes, they

Diſciples, they prefer his advices before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels

                  <head type="sub">Of the Nature of Deſire.</head>
                  <p>AS a wiſe mans content is from within, he
finds his felicity in his own Breaſt, he
draws his confidence from the ſincerity
of his Conſcience, and diſcovers nothing
upon Earth that is able to ſatisfie him but his own
Vertue, it ought not to be wondered if he reject
his <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and if after he hath examined their
nature and properties, he finds them as diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to his reſt as uſeleſs in his conduct. Their
ill uſage has procured his hatred, and he drives
them not from his ſoul, but becauſe they breed
ſeditions and diſorders. The diſcourſes which
the Peripateticks have formed to undeceive <hi>Seneca</hi>
in that belief, could not perſwade him to receive
them into his ſervice, and what exceſſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
ſoever their Writings have afforded
them they could not bribe this generous <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
they hinder him not from declaring war againſt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64170:96"/>
them; and he conſiders them as the evil ſpirits
that ſet themſelves in oppoſition to Vertue, as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
that conſpire her ruine, and inſolent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
who brave her Authority and deſpiſe her
Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſidonius,</hi> who was not famous amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
but becauſe he ſided with the Stoicks,
thought he pleaded the Cauſe of his Gods as often
as he oppoſed their Adverſaries, when he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Diſciples to ſcorn their aſſiſtance, and when
he proved, by Reaſons drawn from Morality, that
<hi>Paſſions</hi> were but the diſeaſes of mad men, and the
opinions of the ignorant. To hear this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
diſcourſe, the Earth bears nothing more
miſerable than a paſſionate man, and, in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to reſtore Vertue to her Dominion, we need
but baniſh her Enemies which are our <hi>Paſſions.</hi>
This ſentiment for being ſomewhat ſevere, is no
opponent to Reaſon, we find Philoſophers at this
day who maintain it in the Schools, and are not
afraid to incur the cenſure of ſome Divines by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the Doctrine of Infidels. <hi>Seneca</hi> blameth
Love for that he is always intereſſed, becauſe he
ſeeks his own advantage in the object he hunts
after, becauſe he reſpects fortune and not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and for that his duration is no longer than
while he is fed by pleaſure or profit. He condemneth
Fear becauſe ſhe is umbragious, ſhe haſtens our
misfortunes by her foreſight, ſhe is tormented
before the afflictions touch us, and unites the
preſent with the future to make us unhappy. He
oppoſeth Sadneſs becauſe ſhe is injurious to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
ſhe wounds his Body, ſhe troubles his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and is not leſs offenſive to one and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64170:96"/>
the other in her moderation than in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
                  <p>But he is never more animated againſt <hi>Paſſions</hi>
than when Deſire would be admitted into em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and he demonſtrates by Reaſons as
evident as efficatious, that he cannot lawfully act
any thing for us: and that that man muſt not
give him any buſineſs who will not hazard his
liberty and reſt. To apprehend this Doctrine
well, we muſt ſuppoſe with <hi>Zeno,</hi> that no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be good which is not agreeable to Nature:
in the Morals of this great
Philoſopher,<note place="margin">Omne quod contra na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam eſt, monſtri me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur notam penes om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; penes nos verò e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam elogium Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legii in Deum naturae &amp; authorem <hi>Tertul.</hi> lib. de coron. milit.</note> whatſoever ſtrays
from this univerſal Law is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and a man cannot boaſt
of being vertuous any longer
than he governs himſelf by
her rules. For as all her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
are divine, ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
nothing but what is equitable, and every
man ought to obey her, that will not ſet himſelf
to overthrow the purpoſe of her Author. Kings,
who are the Gods of their People, are ſubject to her
Laws; among Chriſtians we accuſe them of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg
againſt God, who tranſgreſs her Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and no man becomes guilty of their violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but he is deemed a monſter in the judgment
of all men. The juſtice of her Laws renders ſuch
as offend againſt them more guilty; as ſhe is the
Diſciple of Truth, we cannot violate her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
without offending her Maſter. What ever
iſſues not from this ſpring is vicious, and we may
be aſſured of falling headlong into danger every
time we ſhut our Eyes againſt this Light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:64170:97"/>
From hence it comes that Philoſophers maintain
ſo bloody a War againſt Deſire, becauſe he ſlights
her precepts, he is inſatiable in his purſuits, and
contrary to Nature, who is content with little,
nothing but infinity muſt be his bounds; Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
as ingenious as ſhe is, hath not yet found
the way to give him ſatisfaction, he is inſolent
notwithſtanding her precautions, the remedies
which ſhe hath compoſed to heal him, have only
ſerved to enflame his feaver, and ſhe is not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the imputation of having taught him to
long for exceſſive things, by permitting him to
ſeek after ſuppoſed neceſſaries. For as he is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
he always meditates new Conqueſts, the
Riches he already enjoys content him not, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
to them that are out of his reach; and as if
he were immortal and infinite, he gains new
ſtrength from that which one ſhould think ſhould
ſtifle him. A man who thinks of nothing but what
yet is to be received, eaſily forgets what he hath
already obtained, he ceaſeth to take pleaſure in
preſent enjoyments, and having all his thoughts
bent upon the future, he confeſſeth that he is nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the midſt of his Wealth.
But his poverty proceeds
from his ingratitude,<note place="margin">Quiſquis de accipiendo cogitat, oblitus accepti eſt, nec ullum habet malum cupiditas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus, quam quod ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 73.</note> he is
indigent becauſe he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,
and he is not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
but becauſe he ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the benefits he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
to hunt after the things which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
                  <p>An ambitious man was never ſeen to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with his condition, he languiſheth under the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64170:97"/>
hopes of renued Grandeurs, thoſe which he alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
enjoys are but the Ladder by which he climbs,
he looks upon them which are above him and
not upon thoſe of a meaner ſtate; and he hath leſs
pleaſure to ſee many behind him, then diſquiet to
behold one before him. His Deſire encreaſeth
with his Power, and as he conſiders not from
whence he came, but whither he tends, it permits
him not to ſtop in that to which he had impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
aſpired. A laſcivious perſon loves diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
he ſtays not long upon one Beauty, one and
the ſame object delights and diſpleaſes him in a
few days, and as if his Love made him loſe her
allurements, he forſakes her to ſeek another. A
covetous man is never ſatisfied, he reſembles the
bottomleſs pit which ſwallows all; the wealth
which he gathers augments his appetite, and who
ſo could ſound the depth of his thoughts would
ſee that he wiſheth for the death of all men, that
he might become Maſter of their Treaſures. The
ſtudy of our own inclinations is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
theſe Truths: We never loſe the deſire of
augmenting our Eſtates, we can hardly believe
that we have wealth enough, our fortunes diſpleaſe
us when we make compariſon with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
Sometimes, by a ſtrange humour, we deem
the favours that are done us to be injuries, and,
ſuffering our ſelves to be ſurprized with ſuſpition,
we think our ſelves offended,<note place="margin">Divum Julium plures amici confecerunt quam inimici, quorum non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleverat ſpes inexplebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. <hi>Sen.</hi> 3. de ira c. 30.</note>
when the things given us are
not correſpondent to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.
This diſorderly
<hi>Paſſion</hi> cauſed the death of the
firſt Emperor; that valiant Prince was maſſacred
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64170:98"/>
for not being able to ſatisfie the Deſires of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents;
the Pride and Covetouſneſs of his friends
were more fatal to him than the Rage of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and he ſaw himſelf pierced thorough the
ſides in the midſt of the Senate, by thoſe whom
he had obliged but was not able to ſatiate. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he managed his Conqueſts liberally, and
reſerved nothing to himſelf but the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the ſpoils amongſt his Souldiers, he could
not render them content becauſe they altogether
demanded that which one could but wiſh for.</p>
                  <p>If a man who deſireth be inſatiable, he is not leſs
inconſtant; and though he covet all yet is he
irreſolute in his deſigns. He changes his wiſhes
according to the objects that preſent, he abandons
a real good, to chooſe one that is but ſuch in
ſhew; and as he is at liberty in his Will, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciates
himſelf upon all that he fancies to be of
uſe or delight to him. The Hope of a freſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
ſtirs up his faculties, and raiſing diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Deſires in the reaſonable appetite, he is ſo
much the more inflamed as he meets with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the obtaining. The Good of another
appears to him attended with more charms than
thoſe which himſelf poſſeſſeth; and it ſufficeth
him to apprehend that a thing is out of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to make him affect it. For as he is unlucky in
his choice, and ſeldom finds that benefit that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contents him, he eſteems what he hath not, he
doubts of the reality of what he enjoys; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not much taken with it, he eaſily forſakes an
ordinary benefit to aſpire after a better. Our Deſires
have ſo much coherence with the things we covet,
that they follow all their motions, they alter their
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64170:98"/>
humors when theſe change their faces, they abate
of their violence when theſe loſe any thing of their
advantage; and, by a contrary faculty, they encreaſe
their eagerneſs when theſe put on new Beauties.</p>
                  <p>From thence it cometh that we commonly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from our ſelves, that our laſt reſolutions make
war upon our firſt deſigns, that we aſpire to the
things which we deſpiſed, that Repentance ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
our Vows, and that we are as little ſatisfied in
Proſperity as in a low eſtate.</p>
                  <p>But although that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
feed our Deſires,<note place="margin">Nihil habet ita mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificum, quo mentes in ſe noſtras trahat, praeter hoc quod mirari illa conſuevimus: non quia concupiſcenda ſunt, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantur, ſed concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quia laudata ſunt. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 18.</note> that
they are the firſt cauſes of their
agitation, and that they may
bear the imputation of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
and diſorder, yet have
they need of opinion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the eſteem of men; their
charmes are not powerful enough to ſeduce the
underſtanding without our own approbation;
and they would make but light impreſſions upon
us, if that fickle Counſellour were not retained
for them. All thoſe advantages which we ſo much
prize have nothing praiſe-worthy but our own
admiration, they are not valuable but becauſe we
eſteem them ſo: wealth and honours are not in
vogue but becauſe they are reverenced of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, and men would never become proud
and covetous, if they hearkened not rather to the
bruit of the World than to the inſtructions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In moſt of our ſentiments we are unjuſt,
we meaſure the worth of things by other mens
reports, we ſeek them becauſe they are eſteemed;
and, to ſay all in few words, we commend them
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64170:99"/>
not to love them, but we love them becauſe they
are commended. Alſo the Stoicks define Deſire
to be an eruption of the Soul towards an abſent
Good, upon which Opinion hath ſet a price, and
which ſhe hunts after contrary to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For what dexterity ſoever Morality makes
uſe of to keep him in order, he is equally blind
and inſolent. He is inexorable to Vertue, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
her maxims, and is ſo much an enemy to
Reaſon, that he always forſakes her Party to joyn
with her Adverſaries. Though hope be the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
of the miſerable, ſhe is nevertheleſs unjuſt;
ſhe abandons ſolid benefits to ſeek after periſhable
advantages, ſhe promiſeth what ſhe cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and againſt Natures oeconomie ſhe affords
nothing more delightful than perpetual agitation.
Audacity which is a deſire of combat, is not more
reaſonable, ſhe undertakes things above her
ſtrength, ſhe atacketh danger and knoweth it not,
and ſhe often precipitates her ſelf into deſtruction,
deſigning it for her enemy. Anger is a Peſtilence
to Nature, ſhe maintains enmity amongſt men, ſhe
looks upon the offender and not the offence, and
as ſhe is as ſavage as proud, ſhe torments her
gueſts before ſhe gives them vengeance for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
they have received. But as the calamities
which theſe three <hi>Paſſions</hi> bring us into are too
great to be comprehended in this Diſcourſe I,
have aſſigned them the three laſt of this Treatiſe
after I have ſhewed in the two following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
of Deſire in Ambition and Covetouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>SOveraignty is ſo ancient and her Conduct ſo
neceſſary to Government, that ſhe is not to
be diſſolved without ſending nature back to
the <hi>Chaos,</hi> ſhe is the only
pillar of human affairs,<note place="margin">Jure naturali regna edita. D. de juſt &amp; jur.</note> the
line that unites all the parts of
the Common-wealth, and the
vital Spirits which animate all the members that
compoſe it. For, as man is a friend to Society, and
that Society cannot ſubſiſt without Peace, as Peace
followes union, as union is inſeparable from
good order, and as good order cannot be without
dependance nor dependance without Authority.
Policy hath happily invented Government, ſhe
got the people to be ſubject to Magiſtrates, ſhe
placed Princes at the head of the Nobles, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that inſtinct that is common to all men,
ſhe made ſervitude neceſſary to us, and obedience
delightful. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who is lookt upon in Scripture
as the model of Politicks, thought he did <hi>Eſau</hi>
no wrong when he commanded him to obey his
younger Brother: this preference according to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64170:100"/>
the words of <hi>Philo</hi> was not ſo much a maladiction
as a teſtimony of his love, he ſatisfied the Divine
Juſtice by hearkening to the ſolicitations of his
wife; and knowing that a man that lives by his
weapon is ſubject to many <hi>Paſſions,</hi> he judged he
might appoint <hi>Jacob</hi> to be his Governor without
injury to his primogeniture. It was with this
Reaſon that the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth juſtified her uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations;<note place="margin">Ut domiti ſe melius ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berent, quum indomiti ſe deterius habuerant <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. de civit. cap. 21.</note>
that ſhe perſwaded
the World that her Conqueſts
were lawful, ſince their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
became beneficial to the
people whom they overcame, and that giving
them Philoſophers to inſtruct them in vertues, they
made their ſubjection of greater advantage to
them then their liberty. That as the Body obeys
the mind, and Reaſon commands our <hi>Paſſions,</hi>
they alleadg that the weaker ought to ſubmit to
the ſtronger, Cowards to Valiant Men, and the leſs
perfect to the more accompliſht.</p>
                  <p>This feeble argument hath made ſo ſtrong an
impreſſion on the Spirits of ambitious men, that
they thought they might lawfully aſpire to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that the deſire of honors was not ſo much a
mark of Pride, as of generoſity; and that the
moſt excellent thing in this World might be ſought
after without ſcruple. They affirmed, with much
Reaſon, that man was born to command, that
nature had given him extraordinary parts for that
purpoſe, and that as ſhe had granted ſtrength to
wild Beaſts to offend or defend, policy to ſome to
avoid the Hunters, and ſwiftneſs to others to fly
from their Enemies; ſhe had: placed in man a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64170:100"/>
generous Spirit fit to command, which delighted
in Dignities, and which eſteemed all things below
himſelf but Government and Empire: In fine,
that the <hi>Paſſion</hi> that made him affect greatneſs was
natural to him, that Soveraignty was approved
of all Nations, that the Son of God propoſed it
to his Diſciples, when he promiſed they ſhould
ſit upon Thrones judging the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
But what colourable Reaſons ſoever are formed by
Hiſtorians and Orators to excuſe the deſire of
greatneſs, they cannot deny but that it is fatal to
the ambitious; and that if it be not always ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
unjuſt to render them guilty, it is too
extravagant not to make them unhappy.</p>
                  <p>For beſides that they aim at that which is out
of their power,<note place="margin">Magna ſervitus magnae fortunae eſt. <hi>Sen.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſol. ad Polib.</note> that they are
encloſed with Enemies that
oppoſe their deſigns, that they
ſee themſelves often deceived
in their hopes, that their friends forſake them;
and that they are forced to confeſs, by the Travels
that attend their Projects, that it is no leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to arrive at dignity then to preſerve it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, envy is inſeparable from their condition,
that men often conſpire againſt their Perſons;
that their Subjects hate them, and that their equals
ſuſpect them: they endure miſeries that give the
lye to the opinion of the World, the honors they
hunted after with ſo much earneſtneſs, procure
their diſquiet; and, by an inevitable misfortune,
they meet with grief amongſt thoſe things from
which they expected their joy and felicity.</p>
                  <p>Fear aſſaults them at every turn, they ſuſpect the
countenance of their friends as well as the looks
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64170:101"/>
of their Enemies, all that approach them create
their jealouſies; and, by a ſuſpition that diſcovers
their Calamities; they have often an apprehenſion
of the Valour or vertuous comportments of their
ſucceſſors. They are afraid that they which are
one day to ſit on their Throne ſhould contrive
their ruin; and as they know that the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in novelty they fear leaſt their Children
ſhould becom their Soveraigns.
Indeed,<note place="margin">Rato quam juſtus quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fuit, ut non cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior populo ſucceſſor ſoret. <hi>Petr.</hi> de remed, utriuſq. fort.</note> goodneſs is not the
object of the love of all men,
if ſome reverence it in the
perſon of their Prince, others
grow weary of it, or deſpoſe
it. What integrity ſoever Kings bring to the
Throne, they become guilty enough by reigning
long; and it's ſufficient to know that they have
ſucceſſors, to render them odious to their Subjects.
The vulgar are ſo fantaſtical in their affections,
that their greateſt conſtancy laſts but a moment,
they hate the bleſſing which they enjoy, they deſire
it when it's expected, and never truly eſteem it but
when they have loſt it.</p>
                  <p>What contentment can a man have amidſt ſo
many apprehenſions? What felicity can he taſt
in the Government of an ungrateful people, who
are never ſatisfied with his Conduct, who expect
his death every time he is indiſpoſed, who wiſh
it under the ſhaddow of enlarging their liberty;
who find fault with the favors they have obtained
from him, and magnify them only which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from his heirs?</p>
                  <p>Without doubt theſe Reaſons made <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
think ſo often of a Retreat, and which inſpired him
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64170:101"/>
with the deſpicable thoughts of an Empire, which
expoſed his actions to cenſure, his ſafety to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and his life to perils. For although he gave
Laws to the greateſt part of the world, held the
<hi>Roman</hi> fortune in his hands, and ſaw the wiſeſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
upon earth pay reverence to his Commands,
yet he ſighed after retirement, he ceaſed not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
the Senat for leave to ſurrender; his moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Speeches ended with theſe pleaſant expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and he ſtiled that his happy Day that ſhould
ſtrip him of his Dignities. He had learned, by a
long experience, how toilſom a publick Charge is,
how many hazards were to be undergone to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, and how many cares were required to
preſerve it; having been often obliged to arm
himſelf to tame his Subjects, give Battels to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
his Competitors, and bring Armies into the
Field to warrant him from the ſurprizes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of his friends. How often was he ſeen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to abandon his Frontiers, to march into
<hi>Sicilia,</hi> travel into <hi>Egypt,</hi> carry Armies (yet cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with <hi>Roman</hi> Blood) into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to bring the
factious to obedience? When he is buſied in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
the <hi>Alpes,</hi> when he is drawing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
to their Duty, when he is making Slaves of
his Enemies, and is projecting new Conqueſts,
beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> even then they
contrive plots againſt his Perſon, they prepare
Weapons in the City of <hi>Danube,</hi> for his Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and, he that was coming triumphant from
the ſubduing of all the Rebels of his State, finds
himſelf deſigned for death by a Band of ſeditious
men. Hardly had he eſcaped theſe Ambuſcades
but his own Daughter, attended by a company of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64170:102"/>
young Gallants whom ſhe had gained by her
Proſtitutions, renewed his fears, and by alarms
that ſeldom gave him reſt, threatned to ſend
death to him, through the thickeſt of his Guards
that ſurrounded him. Thus being wearyed with
the Dignities of an Empire, and tired with a load
that expoſed him to ſo many dangers, he ſeeks for
reſt, and charmed his misfortunes with that hope:
he conjures the Senat to diſcharge him of this
burthen, and, by an imbecillity affixt to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Kings, he ſupplicates that of others,
which himſelf could vouchſafe to all the Slaves of
<hi>Rome.</hi> He ſhunned the Court as the Enemy of
innocence, and ſought for ſolitude as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of reſt,<note place="margin">Funes ceciderunt mihi in praeclaris. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.</note> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Vertue. He knew that
men could not reign without
being unhappy or guilty, that the hatred of the
people or the diſpleaſure of God were the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
portions of Monarchs; and that as they
could not command well without the diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of men, they could not govern unjuſtly
without attracting the Anger of God. With what
Authority ſoever Kings are flattered, they never
can be ſaid to be abſolute in their Governments,

an Orator told <hi>Trajan</hi> excellent well, that if it were
a mark of great felicity in his perſon to be able to
do what he deſired, it was an act of Grandeur to
command no more than what was juſt. Authority
deſtroys not Juſtice, and a Prince renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
incapable of governing his Subjects, from the
time that he diſcredits his Laws by his own actions.</p>
                  <p>Though it be eaſie to conclude from all this
Diſcourſe that Greatneſs is a ſtate of Servitude,
and that that Puiſſance that attends it is as defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
as dangerous, yet are there but few men that
do not ſeek it, and who care not for becoming
guilty or miſerable, provided they may but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be great. The Ages paſt, have ſhewed us
ſome ſo degenerated as to violate all Laws for the
obtaining of Govenment; who have mounted the
Throne by Murders, who were not afraid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a homicide to acquire a Kingdom, and who
held it for truth that if it were in any caſe lawful
to pervert Juſtice, it was to be done in matters
of State, and to arrive at Command. The Poets
who in their fables have ſo wittily deſcribed the
inclinations of men, obſerve well that an ambitious
man muſt needs be inſolent, ſince he ſpared not
the blood of his neareſt Relations, that a Kingdom
was dearer to him than his Gods and his Children,
and that he often ſacrificed the
one and the other to the
flames,<note place="margin">Sceptra Thebarum fuit impuné nulla gerere. <hi>Sen.</hi> in Thebaide.</note> to bring his deſigns to
paſs. <hi>Polinices,</hi> whoſe tragical
Story we read of, was of this humor, although his
mother aſſured him that he could never arrive at
the Command of others without renouncing of his
own liberty, that a Kingdom was a laborious Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64170:103"/>
that a Scepter was not ſo much a heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as amark of Gods anger; and that it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to inform him that <hi>Cadmus</hi> and his Heirs
had been unhappy, to purge him of ſo evil a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
as the deſire of Soveraignty: he made her
this anſwer, that he was reſolved to be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
that the misfortunes of his Anceſtors fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not, that death was no terror to a man
that deſpiſed it, and that he was not careful what
his end ſhould be, provided he might but die poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of a Scepter and Diadem.</p>
                  <p>That Divine ſpake wittily, who ſaid that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
was Charity's Ape, that the moſt inſolent
of our <hi>Paſſions</hi> imitated the moſt excellent of our
Vertues, and that their manner of acting had
much reſemblance, though their motives were
different. Charity, ſaith that eminent Doctor, is
patient, and ſuffereth generouſly the injuries done
her for the love of things eternal, and Ambition
paſſeth by affronts to arrive at the Honors of the
Earth; Charity is merciful, and diſtributeth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of the Riches ſhe poſſeſſeth; Ambition ſlights
them, and eſteems only thoſe ſhe aſpires after;
Charity endureth pain and death in defence of the
Truth, and Ambition ſhuns no Combat for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment
of her own Glory. Both believe and
hope all things; and amongſt all their reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
this difference only is diſcernable, that the
one purſues that which is good, and the other
hunts after that which is evil; that the one makes
her Lovers to become the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
and the other cauſeth her Martyrs to be the
Slaves of Satan. Indeed who ſhall believe that a
man who makes war upon his Neighbours, who
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64170:103"/>
breaks into the Frontiers of his Allies, who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the ſacred bounds of Nature, and tramples
under foot thoſe Alliances which that wiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath made among the Nations of the Earth,
to arrive at the accompliſhment of his deſigns, is
not poſſeſt of an evil ſpirit? Who ſhall think that
a Prince, who is never content with his Fortune,
who drives the bleſſing of Peace out of his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who preſcribes no limits to his Deſires, who
eſteems nothing unjuſt but what he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
is not a Slave to the Devil and a Martyr of
Vanity? Who ſhall judg that a man who deſcends
into the Seas, who traverſeth all parts of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
Globe to gain a piece of Earth, can be in his
right mind, and can be other than his own enemy,
and the Tyrant of the people whom he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered?
Pride hath nothing of Juſtice but her
own miſeries, and without the invention of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
to chaſtiſe her, to leave her to her ſelf
is ſufficient to make her unhappy: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all the <hi>Paſſions</hi> ſtrive to afflict her, Hope
to ſeduce her, Fear to perplex her, Grief to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
her, and Anger to throw her into precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Battels; ſhe cannot obtain what ſhe deſires
from the vanquiſhed. If ſhe make them her Vaſſals
ſhe cannot procure their Love, and what Art ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhe employ, ſhe cannot oblige thoſe freeborn
men to give her their Affections or Venerations.
The deſire of Riches for being more common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men than that of Honors, is not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable:
for if that be inſolent, this is impatient,
if Ambition render men arrogant, Covetouſneſs
makes them ſordid; if Pride make impious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites,
Avarice begets Idolaters: and in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64170:104"/>
Morals it is difficult to reſolve, whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more guilty by pretending to be above our
equals, or when we make a God of that metal,
which we ought to place among things of the
meaneſt conſideration.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſt that this <hi>Paſſion</hi> is in ſome
ſort natural to us, that our Parents taught us the
uſe of it from our infancy, and that recommending
to us the acquiſition of Gold and Silver, they have
left us the deſire thereof for
our inheritance.<note place="margin">Admirationem nobis parentes auri argenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que fecerunt: &amp; tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris infuſa cupiditas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius ſedit, crevitque nobiſcum. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 16.</note> For although
men are ſeldom in one mind,
that novelty robs us of that
happineſs, and that we change
our opinions as often as the
objects vary; yet is it certain
in this point that Gold is profitable to man, that
it aſſiſts him in his wants, that it opens him the
Gates of publique employment, and that he raiſeth
his fortunes by honorable Alliances. Private men
who are governed by publique Example, pay it
reſpect, they wiſh it to their Children; and as if
Heaven comprehended nothing more precious then
Gold, they convert it into preſents and offerings
for their Gods. In fine, the poſſeſſion of Wealth
is ſo advantageous, and want is accompanied with
ſo many calamities, that ſhe is become the ſcorn
and fear of all men: the poor hate her as well as
the rich; and without ſeeking for a mans greater
faults, it is enough to know that fortune hath
uſed him ill, to make him odious to ſuch as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
him.</p>
                  <p>If all the Nations upon Earth have entertained
theſe opinions, they are not therefore the more
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64170:104"/>
reaſonable, and nothing makes them more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of deceipt, then the great number of their
approbators. For as the people are equally blind
and of interreſſed judgments; they commend
wealth as the only ornament of life, and in their
fancy Heaven cannot make a better demonſtration
of favor towards them then by tumbling Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
into their laps. But truly, it were to be
wiſht that they who ſeek them with ſo much eager
affection, would conſult with the rich; and that
they would inſinuate themſelves into the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of theſe ſplendid Slaves, to be taught by
them the diſquiet and reſtleſs torments which they
find inſeparable from their Poſſeſſions. Without
doubt they would ſoon change their deſires; and
I know not if they would not make vows to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the obtaining of any part of that which they
had ſo earneſtly ſought after. All thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
they ſo much admire are good but in ſhew,
the comforts they promiſe are more faulty then
ſpecious; if they promiſe honors they make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in torments; and they reſemble thoſe ſavage
Beaſts which can neither be caught nor kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hazard. Likewiſe, when they come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and conſider the deplorable ſtate of their
condition, they cannot retain their teares, they
complain that their affection hath been the cauſe
of their chaſtiſement, that they find more trouble
to preſerve their Treaſure then to get it, and that
they are become miſerable by having obtained
what they demanded.</p>
                  <p>But that which increaſeth yet more their pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
is, they dare not diſcloſe their miſeries,
they hide what they cannot diſcover without
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64170:105"/>
ſhame or danger: and be it the remorſe of unjuſt
gotten goods, or the trouble they find in their
enjoyment which tyrannizeth them, they grow
pale at the ſight of Gods judgments, they tremble
at the thought of the threatning evil Spirits, of
the accuſing Angel, of friends to whom their deeds
are deteſtable, and of the rigorous judg who is to
condemn them.</p>
                  <p>It is then without cauſe, avaricious men! that
you take ſo much Pride in your Riches, ſince they
procure you ſo much torment, and that by the aid
thereof you promiſe to your ſelves the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of all your deſigns; ſince you cannot
enjoy them without becoming their Slaves: you
would be your own Maſters, if they were not
yours, you might make uſe of your own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
if they were not in your power; and, to
ſay all in few words, you might be freemen if you
were not laden with abundance. Learn, from the
travels you ſuffer your own infelicity, that you
ſerve, in ſtead of commanding your own covetous
appetite; and that as ſaith the Scripture ye are
men that can deſire but know not how to poſſeſs
Riches.</p>

                  <p>NEver do Orators appear more ſplendid
then when they deſcribe the Lives of
Conquerors, when they give renown
to their Valor, when they admire their
Conduct, when they repreſent them in combat
with their Enemies, and when they render them
triumphant over fortune and death. It ſeemeth
as if they exceeded themſelves every time they
recount their Battells and Victories, and that they
deſign their own commendations in magnifying
their victorious Souldiers. For of all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
they find in their perſons, none ſo much
ſtirs their eloquence as their courage, they paſs by
all their other qualities to render this valuable;
and if ſometimes they find a neceſſity of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome praiſe upon them alſo, it is with ſo much
faintneſs, as is eaſie to conjecture that the notice
they take thereof is but becauſe they would not
be reproached with being ignorant of any of their
endowments; when they ſpeak of their Juſtice
they cloath it in ſuch ordinary language as puts
the Reader in doubt, whether they ever knew the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64170:106"/>
merit thereof, they diſcourſe of their clemency as
if it were always mixt with meanneſs of Spirit
and inconſiderateneſs; and although Science be
the moſt excellent ornament of Monarchs, yet
amongſt them it is accompted but as the exerciſe
of Cowards, and the employment of idle perſons.
A man muſt have nothing but valor to make him
the ſubject of their Elogies, he muſt be guilty of
Murthers to merit their eſteem, and muſt be as
little ſparing of his own, as of the life of his
Enemies to deſerve the honor of their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
                  <p>As audacity is the cauſe of all theſe effects, ſhe
draws admiration from all men; Hiſtorians never
mention her but with veneration, Philoſophers
recommend her to their Diſciples; and <hi>Poets</hi> are
ſo much concerned for her honor, as to aſſure us
that if Kings be indebted to fortune for the happy
ſucceſſes of their Armies, they owe the original of
their victories to the bold attempts of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
In fine, they affirm that without her aid
we become faint hearted, that all our actions bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
their ſplendor from her ſtrength, and that a
man is no longer to be eſteemed then whilſt he is
hardy and adventurous.</p>
                  <p>The mind of man is ſo depraved, and the vulgar
opinion hath ſo much corrupted him, that he
values nothing but thoſe things which procure him
worldly glory, he finds nothing delightful but
what is beyond the common achievement, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vertues affect him not, and by an obſtinacy
full of imbecillity, he conſiders not ſo much the
prudence of a General as the defeat of the Enemy,
he ſpeaks of a victorious Captain with admiration,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64170:106"/>
he ſwells his praiſes into Volumes; and as if the
honor of a Commander conſiſted in ſeeking Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells,
in routing Armies, in razing Cities, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolating
Countries, he ſtrains his induſtry to the
higheſt pin to compoſe his <hi>Panegyrick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſurely he doth not in any thing diſcover his
blindneſs more then in this Subject, the badneſs of
his cauſe diſparageth his judgment: and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to condemnation without a formal examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of his intentions or motives, let it ſuffice to
know, that all the employments of audacity tend
to the ruin of our fellow Creatures; that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſs
which invented or procures them is
too much defective in juſtice to make them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
and ſhe whom we adore as the mother
of Noble attempts, is too fatal to the ſons of men
to be obeyed without danger. For what did ſhe
ever do in the World that turned not to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
of the Conqueror, or the diſadvantage of
the vanquiſhed? Was ſhe ever ſeen to be moderate
in combat or modeſt in Victory? Was ſhe ever
merciful to the innocent in aſſaulting the guilty?
Do not all Kingdoms complain of her injuſtice?
And had we ever heard of Revolts and Treaſons,
Murders and Parricides, if audacity had not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
inſpired the raſh and Cowardly? Vice would
at this day be covered with darkneſs, if this <hi>Paſſion</hi>
had not taught us to bring it to the Light; infamy
would be a ſtranger to Society if it were not mixt
with unclean perſons; no uncomely action would
appear there, revenge would be as little practiced
as homicide; and with reaſon we may doubt
whether ſin had ever been publickly acted if auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

All the crimes which we read of in Hiſtory,
and which we yet deteſt in our Age, had no other
Author but this <hi>Paſſion:</hi> all Philoſophers aſſign
her to be their mother, to her they attribute all
their malice; and although they own man to be
ſufficiently inabled, to contrive evil deſigns; yet
they aſſure us that he would want reſolution to
execute them, without being animated by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements.
If we believe a certain Orator, 'tis
ſhe that throws diviſion amongſt States, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
the ambitious with Tyranny, that prompts
laſcivious perſons to acts of violation, that incites
coveteous men to theft and rapine, that deſolates
Kingdoms; and that making ſmall accompt of
whole Armies, cauſeth Monarchs to looſe their
Kingdoms, and Subjects their Liberty.</p>
                  <p>For who ſhall believe that <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> had ever
attempted the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, if he had not
been as hardy as ambitious? Who ſhall think that
<hi>Alexander</hi> had ever aſpired to the univerſal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
if he had not been ridden and ſpurred as
well by his courage as amibition? The one and the
other are guilty before men for unwarrantable
undertakings; and they are not lookt upon as
Monſters in Hiſtory, but for that they ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be commanded by the violence of a <hi>Paſſion</hi>
that overturns all natures Laws. They likewiſe
became, the terror of all mortals, dreaded they
were by all forreign Nations, the arrival of their
Armies hath often cauſed their Enemies to fly,
their progreſſion put the whole World to a ſtand,
their own Souldiers were afraid of them as well
as their adverſaries, and <hi>Seneca</hi> doubted whether
their valor were more fatal to their Enemies or to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64170:107"/>
them of their own party: the one had vowed the
ruin of his Neighbours, and the other the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his own Country; the one cauſed <hi>Greece</hi>
to groan, and the other threw horror into the
City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the one trampled upon Kings, and
the other made breach upon the Rights of the
moſt famous common wealth of the World. But
all thoſe diſorders own no other principle then
audacity; if ambition were the occaſion, boldneſs
was the principal cauſe, and that deſire of vain
glory in <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Ceſar,</hi> had remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
or ineffectual, if it had not called this
complice to its aſſiſtance. But for fear of being
deemed partial in this Subject, and that I be not
blamed for dareing to condemn a <hi>Paſſion</hi> that hath
received ſo much commendations in the Writings
of Philoſophers, I agree with them, that her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
are ſometimes generous, ſhe aſſaults
death without fear, ſhe is the only <hi>Paſſion</hi> which
beholds evil with ſtedfaſtneſs, and which dares
undertake to oppoſe and overcome it. For, though
fear be prudent, ſhe is not couragious, ſhe looks
not upon evil ſo much to meet, as to avoid it, ſhe
draws her confidence from her amazement, and if
ſhe ſometimes admit Reaſon of her Counſel, it is
rather to prevent then to expect it's arrival. Anger
is ever concerned, ſhe doth not ſo much conſider
the affront as the vengeance, and the hope ſhe hath
of obtaining ſatisfaction alays her grief, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
her content. But audacity ſeeks the evil
directly, ſhe offers him Battle in all places, and,
without regard to the hazards that ſurround her,
ſhe thinks her ſelf ſufficiently honored when ſhe
obtains Commiſſion to aſſault and fight him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:64170:108"/>
Although this diſcourſe be true, and not eaſily
rejected without being ignorant of the advantages
which this <hi>Paſſion</hi> is Maſter of above his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet doth it not prove any thing in the <hi>Stoick</hi>
Doctrin, and it's eaſie in their opinion to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that her enterprizes are as uſeleſs to the wiſe
as her attempts and combats.</p>
                  <p>For as they acknowledg no evil but Vice; and
that which the vulgar do ſo much dread, paſſing
with them for an indifferent thing, they have no
need of other helps to ſurmount it then Reaſon,
this Enemy is always in their Power, the will
which formeth can ſtifle it, and even as a man, to
be innocent, need but will good, ſo it is ſufficient
to will evil, to make him guilty or vicious.</p>
                  <p>It is not then without cauſe if I baniſh audacity
from my wiſe man,<note place="margin">Temperatus ſit ſapiens &amp; ad res fortiùs agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das non iram, ſed vim adhibeat. <hi>Sen.</hi> 2. de ira cap. 17.</note> and if I permit

diſpoſeth of thoſe good things which ſhe hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and thinks only on the favours which ſhe
promiſeth to her ſelf ſhall yet be received. She
ſlights the paſt and values only the future; and
aſpireing to all things out of her poſſeſſion, ſhe
cares not for being ſtiled ungrateful, provided ſhe
can but merit the title of Provident. Indeed let
an ambitious man look never ſo well upon his
Benefactors, and what ſubmiſſion ſoever he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them in aſſurance of his gratitude, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
not ſo much what he hath received as what
he expects from them, he eaſily ſteps over the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
received, and remembers only what he
hopeth for, and, according to the nature of the
<hi>Paſſion</hi> that poſſeſſeth him, he forgets all the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durs
that have raiſed him friends, to contemplate
only the advantages that may render him equal to
Kings and Potentates. As laſciviouſneſs is a lazy
Vice, and the ſlavery that bears it company ſtrips
it of the power of any generous action; ſhe alſo
quickly looſeth the remembrance of paſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
the charms of novelty drive away her fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
joys, ſhe deemeth them loſt that have been;
and although her preſent contentments may by
accidents be interrupted, though they which are
to come be as hidden as uncertain, and that no
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64170:110"/>
comforts are ſolid but thoſe which cannot be taken
from us, ſhe cauſeth unclean perſons to deſpiſe
them, to feed upon the new delights which ſhe
holdeth forth to their expectation. The deſire of
Wealth, which ariſeth as often from our indigence
as from our infirmity, looks upon nothing but the
time to come, it conſiders the future and reflects
not on the paſt, it becomes the numerator of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Treaſures, but cares not to caſt up what it
hath in poſſeſſion, it receives all and pays nothing:
and without hunting for many Reaſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it, it is ſufficient to know that it is inſatiable,
to judg it unjuſt and ingrateful. Hope, which is
the ſoul of all theſe <hi>Paſſions,</hi> hath inſpired them
with this odious quality; ſhe teacheth them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
in ſhewing them to make excurſions into
the future; her forgetfullneſs cauſeth her ſhame,
and as that man is accuſed of unthankfulneſs who
diſowns a benefit received, who diſſembles it for
fear of repayment, or who doth not requite it but
when he is forced. He that forgets it ought with
much more reaſon to be deemed ungrateful for
ſuffering a favor to eſcape his memory which he
ought to have retained to his laſt hour. But Hope
is ſufficiently odious ſince ſhe is unthankful, and
if we ought to hold her promiſes in ſuſpicion,
becauſe ſhe is faithleſs to her friends, and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to her Benefactors, the unquietneſs of mind
which waits upon her doth not render her leſs to
be rejected, and we need but learn of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that
ſhe is the Enemy of our reſt to perſwade us to
ſhun all her employments.</p>

For according to the words of that eloquent
Philoſopher, Fear purſueth
Hope:<note place="margin">Spes metum ſequitur, nec miror iſta utrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que pendentis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi eſſe, utrumque fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi expectatione ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citi. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 6.</note> although theſe two
<hi>Paſſions</hi> be contrary, they rarely
part company; a man muſt
be fallen into diſpair to be
void of fear, and as it often
happeneth that one faculty
periſheth by the ruin of another that is it's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
Fear never forſaketh us till we ceaſe to
Hope; from thence it comes that the Criminals
that are lead to execution, are without apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that they look death in the face without ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
that they are more confident on the Scaffold
then at the Bar, and have no averſion for leaving
the World becauſe they have no expectation of
life.</p>
                  <p>This truth is ſo conſtant, that a certain <hi>Stoick</hi>
was of opinion that nothing could be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
then a long ſuſpence, that we ſuffered
more eaſily the deprivation of Hope, then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
thereof; that an extended deſire was a
tedious torment, and that if in a wiſe mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the loſs of a benefit proved ſometimes our
advantage, the expectance was always attended
with fear and grief.</p>
                  <p>But truly we ought not to wonder that he that
hopeth ſhould fear, ſince the benefits he waites for
are doubtful, ſince the <hi>Paſſion</hi> by which he is lead
is defective in her promiſes, ſince, for the moſt part
ſhe deceiveth all that rely upon her word; and
often flatters them with the enjoyment of pleaſures
that have nothing more in them then a bare ſhew
of truth. As man is not the cauſe of what is to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64170:111"/>
come, it is not to be expected that he ſhould be
able to diſpoſe of the future; and what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
ſoever he have acquired in the conduct of
Kingdoms or the oeconomy of Families, he is not
able to foretel the event of things: this part of
time is equally uncertain and
out of his ken;<note place="margin">Quis enim pollicetur ſerenti reventum, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanti Victoriam, mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pudicam uxorem, patripios liberos?

will be faithful to him, that the Children ſhe ſhall
bring him, will be obedient, and that they ſhall
honor him as their Father, and that ſhe ſhall love
him as her Husband? We reaſon according to
outward appearances, and not according to that

profitable, but we examine not the difficulties that
ſurround it.</p>

miſerable or guilty. The ingenuity of our Spirits
ſerves to diſcover the evils before they come, our
memory calls them back when they are paſt, and
the will often ſhuns them before they make ſhew of
aſſaulting us. In fine, we convert all our faculties

ſo unfaithful as to ſide with his adverſaries, yet
would it be a repugnance to me to believe that
Anger can be ſerviceable to Vertue; and that ſhe
muſt neceſſarily be employed by Commanders in
giving of Battells, by judges in the condemnation
of the guilty, and by Kings in the chaſtiſement of
the Rebells of their State. Her fury is too much
ſuſpected, to approve her Conduct, her manner
of proceeding is too much void of equity to juſtify
her decrees; and the puniſhments which ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth,
are too rigorous to clear her from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of injuſtice, and cruelty. If our other
<hi>Paſſions</hi> be ſufficiently odious becauſe they rebel
againſt Reaſon, and that it is not for nothing that
we ſo much apprehend their Tyranny, ſince they
drive us from our ſelves to the ſubject of their
fury, the benefits wherewith they keep us in hand,
do alay their rigor: if their defects beget our
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64170:113"/>
hatred, their fair proffers cauſe us to affect them,
and all ſavage as they are, they have charms that
tempt us to give them employment. Deſire doth
not at all times torment us; if it diſturb our mind,
it tickles our imagination; this languiſhing humor
is mingled with delight; and if it ſometimes
raviſh our reſt, it labours to give us poſſeſſion of
the advantages we ſtand in need of. If love
pitch his Tents in our Souls, if he break in upon
our liberty, and if, by an injuſtice which gives the
lye to his name, he give us our Slaves to be our
Miſtreſſes he unites us to the o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ject we affect, and
ſo much delights us with her perfections, that we
prefer her enjoyment above all the Grandures of
of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>If Hope hold us in ſuſpence, and by a too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
foreſight, ſhe redouble the meaſure of that
time which we remain in expectation; ſhe gives
us with it the promiſe of fortunate ſucceſs, ſhe
aſſures us that our Travels ſhall not be in vain,
and our reward ſhall bear proportion to our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
If fear darken our judgment, if it fling
horror into our Spirits, and cauſe us to apprehend
miſchiefs contrary to our hopes; ſhe teacheth us
moderation in proſperity, ſhe foretels us of our
evils to come, and prepares us to bear them with
conſtancy, when they have laid hold on us. So
that all our diſorders have ſome charms: if they
perſecute us, they do us good ſervice; if they are
violent, they abate ſometimes of their cruelty,
and give us intervals, that cauſe us the more to
eſteem our liberty, but anger is ever inſolent, and
take her which way you will, ſhe is equally ſavage
and precipitate. If ſhe puniſh the guilty, her
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64170:113"/>
blindneſs cauſeth her to commit exceſs, if ſhe force
ſatisfaction for outrageous actions, ſhe her ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
guilty of the prophanation of all natures
Laws; if ſhe aſſault her Enemies, ſhe often runs
headlong into their ambuſhes, and like unto thoſe
tumbling ruins that throw down the houſes on
which they fall, ſhe finds her own puniſhment in
her revenge, her own defeat in her victory, and
her own execution in her condemnations.</p>
                  <p>But that which yet better diſcovers her blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and makes her injuſtice
leſs ſupportable is that ſhe
makes fuel of all wood,<note place="margin">Tam ex amore naſcitur quam inter luſus &amp; jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 18.</note> ſhe
proceeds from love as well as
hatred, takes up Armes againſt friend and foe, and
falls not leſs violently upon thoſe that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
then on thoſe that have done her injury.
Thoſe paſs times which heal or charm the other
<hi>Paſſions,</hi> diſcompoſe this, ſhe is as much diſpleaſed
at play as at ſerious buſineſs, as much offended at
a jeſt as an afront, and it matters but little whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the motives which excite her be conſiderable,
if the perſon who has them in apprehenſion be
but ſuſceptible of her violence. For as the fire
operates but according as it finds the diſpoſition
of the matter, and its activity is not always the
meaſure of its working; as we find bodies that
indure not its heat, and others that retain a ſpark
till it amount to a flame, Anger waits upon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Spirits, ſhe burns them up in giving them
courage, and ſeldom forſakes them, till ſhe hath
made them ſcornful, temerarious, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>

To know well the ground of all theſe diſorders
it ought to be known that Anger is not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of other <hi>Paſſions,</hi> which gently make their
way into the ſoul by inſinuations, which flatter
the imagination at their entrance, and by leſs
vigorous acceſſes diſguiſe their violence. But An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
runs in with impetuoſity, ſeizeth on all the
faculties in a moment; and being at full ſtrength
from her very birth, ſhe doth that at once which
others do but by degrees. So that if theſe court
us, ſhe violently conſtrains us, if they make us
ſtray from the paths of Reaſon, ſhe leads us into
the ways of madneſs, and if theſe be ſlow in their
formations, this <hi>Paſſion</hi> takes growth all at once.
In fine, nothing is more blind then ſhe in her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
more violent in revenge, proudly vain
in Victory, nor more enraged in defeat. For which
cauſe the moſt wholſom Philoſophy baniſheth her
from the ſoul of the wiſe man, and ſhe judges that
a <hi>Paſſion</hi> ſo little ſubject to Reaſon, and which hath
ſo much affinity with fury, cannot have any uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
qualities.</p>
                  <p>Though injuries be vexatious to man, though
they break in upon his reputation, and equally
wound the innocent, and the guilty; though there
be nothing leſs ſufferable, though great Spirits
hardly bear them, though the moſt ingenious feel
them, and though the one and the other do often
want ſtrength to ſtand under them; nevertheleſs
nothing ſo much demonſtrates their cowardize as
the reſentment they ſhew of injuries, nor doth any
thing more diſcover their puſilanimity, then the
meditation of revenge. It belongeth, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi>
to men of mean Spirits to avenge one afront by
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64170:115"/>
another, to ſharpen our teeth againſt them that
have bit us, and to hurt our ſelves becauſe an other
would have hurt us; they reſemble Rats and
Emmots who make head againſt ſuch as only look
as if they would hurt them; and perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be wounded every time they are toucht.
But if the injury be excuſeleſs, and if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
offering it had deſign to rob us of our honor,
yet ought we to abſtain from Anger, and take care
of being carried away by a <hi>Paſſion</hi> which inſtead
of abateing increaſeth our grief: conteſts are ever
dangerous or to no purpoſe: and as we cannot
contend with them above us
without deſerving the Title
of Mad men,<note place="margin">Si vis ulciſci injurias, tace &amp; ultus es. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt.</note> nor with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
without being ſordid;
we cannot hope to be avenged of our equals
without the hazard of being worſted. Anger is
too malignant or too precipitate to be employed
in ſuch an adventure: Reaſon muſt be our judg,
we muſt receive her orders before any thing be
undertaken; and we muſt learn of her, that it is
more glorious by ſilence to avoid an injury, then
by words to overcome it.</p>
                  <p>When we feel our ſelves offended, let us lay our
hand on our breaſt, let us examin whether the
harm done us be juſt, and whether we drew it not
upon our ſelves by our own indiſcretion: if ſo,
it is very reaſonable that we ſhould bear it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and receive it as the chaſtiſement of an evil
which we our ſelves cauſed in the offender. But
if the outrage be unjuſt, if we are wrongfully
perſecuted, and if our Conſcience aſſures us of
the innocence of our actions; why are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64170:116"/>
and afflict our ſelves for an act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
which ought to make him that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to bluſh? Let us not always believe the
reports of men, let us ſet aſide
the circumſtances that might
help to prove them,<note place="margin">Dandum eſt tempus, Veritatem enim dies aperit ne ſint aures criminantibus faciles. <hi>Sen.</hi> 2. de ira. cap. 22.</note> let us
miſtruſt our own conjectures;
time will tell us the truth, and
it may be, that which to day
we take for certain, to morrow may be void of
all likelyhood. Let us raiſe our ſelves above the
common ſort; let us believe nothing of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
things that are told us, let us look upon
injuries as things out of our power, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that no man is offended but by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak truly nothing puts us into ſo much
agitation as opinion: it is ſhe, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> which
meaſures offences, which mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
their injuſtice,<note place="margin">Cauſa iracundiae, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio iniuriae eſt. Idem. 16.</note> and which
ſeducing our judgments, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them more hainous and
ſenſible then they are. We ſee ſervants that endure
blows with patience, but cannot bear a ſharp word,
that take a baſtanade more willingly then a box
of the Eare, and fancy that death would be leſs
inſupportable then a reproach or an abuſe. It is
not always the injury that torments us, but our
imagination that we have received it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man of a large Soul, and who knoweth his
own innocence or deſert, derides all the offences
that can be offered him; he looks upon them as
other mens extravagancies, he forgets the injury
before it be received, he ſtifles the reſentment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64170:116"/>
it touch him; and as he feels it not, he is
in no perplexity how to be revenged.</p>
                  <p>If Anger be dimſighted in revenge, ſhe is unjuſt
in chaſtiſement; and if ſhe violently break the
Laws of Charity in conſtraining reparation for an
abuſe, ſhe ſinneth againſt the rules of equity when
ſhe forceth ſatisfaction for the injury, all her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are irregular, the puniſhments ſhe ordains
do always exceed the greatneſs of the crime, and
without a formal proceſs, it is eaſie to condemn
her by the very ſentences which ſhe her ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
againſt the guilty.</p>
                  <p>For as ſhe is raſh, and the flames which ſhe
throws into the Soul of a judg
or a King,<note place="margin">Iratus ad paenam qui accedit, nunquam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocritatem illam tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit quae eſt inter nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; parum. <hi>Cic.</hi> 11. de oſſic.</note> puts them into a
fury; ſhe prompts them to
puniſhment, ſhe ſwells the
crime to juſtify the penalty,
ſhe invents new torments for
the puniſhment of offences;
and cauſeing them to act according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Authority, and not according to
Juſtice, ſhe puts it out of their power to keep
within the bounds of that moderation which
teacheth to diſtinguiſh between too much and too
little. For ſhe will have it, that all her procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
are regularly equal, that the vengeance
which ſhe directs is neceſſary: and contrary to
Reaſon, which eſteemeth that only juſt which is
agreeable to equity, ſhe deemeth all that to be
equitable which is ſuitable to her humor: ſhe
regards not ſo much the offence as the cauſe, ſhe
conſiders not ſo much the crime as the criminal,
and, by a fury as ſtrange as common to her, ſhe is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64170:117"/>
not leſs heated by the things which ſerve to the
offenders advantage, then by the circumſtances
which make for his condemnation. She is angry
both with the innocent and the guilty, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
the integrity of the one, and inlargeth the
faults of the other, ſhe is for nothing but puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and, obſtinate in her error, ſhe thinks it
more honorable to perſiſt in evil then to ſhew any
ſorrow for it.</p>
                  <p>The example hereof produced by <hi>Seneca</hi> in his
admirable Books of Anger, is an evident proof
of this; and without giving our ſelves the
trouble of ſearching into Hiſtory for any other,
let it ſuffice to relate the particulars of this, to
make known it's injuſtice. He ſaith that one of
the <hi>Piſo's</hi> being in Anger, eſpied a Souldier of his
returning from a party Convoy without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion:
this return ſerved him for a pretext to
puniſh him, he thought it warrant enough to paſs
the ſentence of death upon him, to have him but
ſuſpected of murder; and to cauſe him to be led
to Execution, for not having his fellow Souldier
in his company. This unhappy condemned man,
ſtoutly denies the crime, calls the Gods to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of his innocence, craveth ſome time to juſtify
himſelf; and aſſures him that by his diligence he
would bring the man to light who he ſaid was
maſſacred. The General refuſes him this favor,
is angry at the requeſt, and without farther delay,
commands him to be put to death. He is carried
out of the Trenches; and the Heads-man had
already hold on the ſword to ſtrike off his Head,
when the Souldier who was ſuppoſed to be ſlain,
appeared ſuddenly in the midſt of the aſſembly:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64170:117"/>
the Captain that attended this Execution, at the
ſight of this Souldier, directs a ſtop, commands
the Executioner to unlooſe the Felon, and not to
proceed without new orders from the General.
He brings the Priſoner then back to <hi>Piſo,</hi> to put
into his hands an innocent man, whom error had
cauſed him to condemn as guilty. The whole
Camp concluded that this Prince would let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
be overcome of Juſtice, that clemency would
ſucceed his rigor; and that being undeceived in his
belief, he would make no difficulty of pardoning
the man a crime, which he had not committed.
But ſeeing the Souldier yet alive, and taking his
return as a contempt of his Commands, he goes
back to the Tribunal all in a fury, pronounceth
ſentence of death upon both the Souldiers; and
that they ſhould be Executed
upon the place.<note place="margin">Excogitavit quomodo tria crimina faceret quia nullum invenerat. <hi>Sen.</hi> 2. de ira. cap. 16.</note> What can be
imagined more unjuſt then to
condemn two innocent men
becauſe one of them was not
guilty? Or to make too men
Felons becauſe one of them was found innocent?
His <hi>Paſſion</hi> carried him yet farther, and violently
throwing him from one Precipice to another, adds
to theſe two a third, which was the Captain, that
had brought back the Priſoner. His ingenious
rage had furniſht him with Reaſons to juſtify this
proceeding, and examining their offences, helped
him to raiſe from the diverſity of their fortunes,
the different cauſes of their puniſhment. I cauſed
thee, ſaid he to the Souldier, to be lead to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe thou waſt thereunto condemned,
and thou, ſpeaking to his Companion, for that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64170:118"/>
thou waſt the cauſe thereof, and thou, looking
upon the centurion, for that having received com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to put a Felon to death, thou haſt not done
it. He ſubtilly invented the way to make them all
guilty, and to commit three crimes at once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could not find any in the perſons he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                  <p>From this Example it is eaſie to diſcover the
cruelty of Anger, and to learn
how inſolent ſhe is in chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and dangerous in courts
of judicature,<note place="margin">Habet iracundia hoc mali, non vult regi; iraſcitur veritati ipſi, ſi contra voluntatem ſuam apparaverit. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi> 16.</note> and great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.
For as ſhe is proud, and
takes no other advices but her
own, ſhe purſues the dictates
of her own fury and can endure as little to be
governed, as reprehended: likewiſe we ſee that none
but Barbarians and men of mean Spirits, make
uſe of her, who know not how to forgive an
injury when they have it in their power to revenge
it.</p>
                  <p>It is true that Anger ſeemeth in ſome ſort more
uſeful in Camps then in Courts of Juſtice, that
her violence hath ſome thing of agreement with
a Martial humor, and that her aſpect better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
the face of Commanders then the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of a Judg and a King. For if we credit
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> nothing contributes more to Valor then
Anger: ſhe it is that ſwells the courage of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
that animates them in the thickeſt of the
combat, that awakens their generoſity, and cauſeth
them to hazard their own, to become Maſters of the
life of their Enemies.</p>

this vertue muſt be
aſiſted with her fury, to make
her deſpiſe the dangers that
threaten her; and ſhe muſt be
warmed with her fire, to be
able to give Battel, and gain
the Victory. For although
man be naturally of a generous

                  <p>But ſurely if this Rule were true, that vertue
owes the happineſs of her ſucceſſes to Anger, and
that Souldiers are Cowards unleſs they be furious;
I know not why, we may not infer that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is a neceſſary Martial vertue, ſince it often
makes them fearleſs, ſince it renders them bold,
puſheth them into the Battel, and cauſeth them
to deſpiſe both wounds and death it ſelf. Some
have been ſeen, that could not be got into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged

had forſaken their Poſt, had they been ſober, and
the ſight of the Enemy had put them to flight,
if the vapors that clouded their Brains, had not
been the Author of the greateſt part of their
Courage.</p>

Good ſucceſſes are not always
the works of Valor and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
oftentimes fury doth
not leſs triumph over the Enemy then vertue. And
the Politicks do tell us, that there are Rencounters
wherein unadviſedneſs proves more lucky then
prudence. But there is no man who confeſſeth
not that theſe qualities are weak and unbecoming,
that they excite the Soul without giving it ſtrength,
that they corrupt vertue in ſtead of informing
her, and that they make no impreſſion but on the
Spirits of them that want reſolution when they
are deprived of Angers aid. Likewiſe we ſee
not a valiant man, that draws not his Courage
from the depreſſion of Anger, that is not ſtout
without fury; and who becomes not more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
when he is heated by her fire, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  <p>This <hi>Paſſion</hi> is too raſh, to have any ſervice from

ſhe is too impetuous to obſerve the Maximes of

of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and that a man cannot
undertake to plead their Cauſe, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
their hatred and cenſure. I know that
the ſeverity of their principles is had in ſuſpicion
of many perſons, that their Sentiments are diſliked
by popular ſpirits, that their Doctrine ſurpaſſeth
the belief of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> and that they
both declare nothing more extravagant than that
which we admire in their Writings: thoſe that
ſide with theſe, laugh at the others paradoxes, and
affirm that they are glorious but in ſhew, that
their words are fuller of oſtentation than Reaſon,
that the world admires them becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them not, and that learned men do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
them, but becauſe they raiſe their thoughts
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64170:120"/>
to a higher pitch of ſublimity. They proteſt, they
cannot comprehend, that a wiſe man can be the
only rich man of the world, ſince he often falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
want, ſince fortune reduceth him to Ambs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace,
ſince he is often without things neceſſary,
and for the moſt part hath neither Clothes to cover
him, Houſe to put his head in, nor Servant to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, that he can always enjoy himſelf, ſince
he is ſometimes at a <hi>nonplus,</hi> making vain erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
forſaking his diſcretion in diſcourſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
at certain times the part of mad men. That
he ſhould be the Monarch of the World, ſince he
hath ſeldom any Subjects to command, being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
conſtrained to ſerve ignorant Maſters, and do
ſuch work for them, as is oppoſite to that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty

the abſurdities wherewith they charge
their Paradoxes, they admire none ſo much as
thoſe which exempt him from opinions, which
diſintangle him from the knowledg of uncertain
things, affirming that it is as impoſſible for him
to doubt of a truth as to be ignorant of it. What,
ſay they, is a wiſe man infallible in his conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures?
Can he not err in his Judgment? Do we
not ſee that he diſcourſes of things he underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not? And, deſcending to particulars, doth he
not undertake to render an account of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Stars and Planets, of which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
as little the nature as the power? Would
you make a God of him, after you have filled him
with Pride? And would you make him partaker
of the Almighties ſecrets, after you have aſſigned
him the Knowledg of Angels, the Power of
Kings, and the Government of the Creation.</p>

But their aſtoniſhment will ceaſe if they take
the pains to examine the Senſe of their Paradoxes,
and to learn from the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they give them,<note place="margin">Iſta paradoxa, quae appelluntur maxima, videntur eſſe Socrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, longéque veriſſima. <hi>Cic.</hi> praefat. in parod.</note>
that they are grounded upon
Reaſon, that they are not ſo
much contrary to Truth as to
their opinions; and that they
teach nothing but what may be received by the
greateſt Criticks of our Age: For if they ſay,
that their wiſe man is the only man without want;
and make him Maſter of all <hi>that</hi> Wealth which
cauſeth covetous men to be indigent; it is for
that he acknowledgeth no other Benefits but thoſe
of the Soul, he expects nothing from Fortune,
what he hath he uſeth with diſcretion, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
diſpiſing thoſe forreign things, he knows
how to enjoy what he contemplates, though he
poſſeſs it not. If they affirm that he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in what he doth, it is becauſe the Light is
ever his Companion, and becauſe Reaſon is his
Counſellor in all his enterprizes. If they make
him a King in this world; and if without the load
of a Scepter or Diadem, they give him the charge
of States and Empires, it is for that he being in
tranquillity knows how to regulate his <hi>Paſſions,</hi>
he is alone capable of commanding his equals,
and his integrity makes him not leſs in humane
ſociety, than the Pilot in a Ship, the Magiſtrate
in a City, the General in an Army, the Soul in
the Body, and the Spirit and Reaſon in the Soul.
If, in fine, they baniſh opinions from his mind,
and if they will that his knowledg be as certain as
himſelf judges it to be true, it is becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

but what are drawn from infallible prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and forms no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<note place="margin">Zeno &amp; Stoici opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem repudiarunt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niari enim te ſcire quod neſcias, non eſt ſapientis, ſed temerarii ac ſtulti <hi>Lact.</hi> 3. cap. 4.</note> but what he knoweth
before hand, bear a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the matter whereof he
diſcourſeth. Knowledg is the
portion of the wiſe, and he is
ſimple or temerarious, that
perſwades himſelf that he is Maſter of a Truth
which he knoweth not.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe it is, that <hi>Seneca</hi> maintains ſo
bloody a war againſt Fear, and informed of the
diſorders with which ſhe entertains her gueſts, he
gives her battel whereever he finds her. For
as ſhe is but a doubtful knowledg, and the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an abſent evil which threatens us, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
her foreſight, he forbids her the Counſel of
his wiſe man, and he would think that he rob'd his
Soul of tranquillity, if he permitted him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
her in his ſervice. To ſpeak truly, nothing
ſo much diſtracts our quiet as this <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much abaſeth our Courage, as her provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
curioſity. For, as if ſhe were ingenious at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but our deſtruction, ſhe aſſumes all imaginary
forms, to make us miſerable. One while ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth
our diſaſters, to make us feel them before
they come, anon ſhe makes us look upon them
through a magnifying Glaſs,<note place="margin">Plura ſunt quae nos ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent quam premunt, &amp; ſaepius opinione quam re laboramus. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 13.</note>
to render them leſs ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to us; another while ſhe
repreſents them inevitable, to
run us headlong into deſpair, and already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with the evils ſhe gives us to expect,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64170:122"/>
ſhe cauſeth us to wiſh for Death, that we may be
delivered from a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which conſtrains us to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it with tedious and divers repetitions: ſhe is
of ſo timorous a nature, that ſhe is afrighted at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing ſhe fancies to be able to hurt her, ſhe
formeth monſters that will never be brought forth,
ſhe confoundeth imaginary with real evils, and
ſuffers her ſelf to be ſo much ſurprized by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that without knowing the cauſe, either of the
one or the other, ſhe is equally afraid of both.
Hatred in this particular ſeemeth more reaſonable
than Fear: for if ſhe reſiſt an evil, if ſhe employ
all her dexterity to oppoſe the violence thereof,
it is becauſe it is real, and its preſence obligeth her
to Revenge. If audacity ſwell againſt her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and puts her ſelf in a poſture to oppoſe all
their fury, 'tis for that they attack her, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or honour conſtrains her to a ſelf defence.
Sadneſs, all melancholy as ſhe is, regards nothing
but the evil that hurts her, ſhe complains of its
rigors, for that ſhe feels them, and ſinks not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their weight, but becauſe it's not in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to avoid them: But Fear multiplies our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
ſhe ſees them as ſoon as they threaten us,
ſhe ſeeks them before they come; and by an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
induſtry, ſhe makes uſe of the paſt and
the future to torment us. What greater folly,
ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> can be obſerved in a man, than to
run to meet his diſaſters, to feel them ere they
touch him, and loſe the preſent by fear of that
which is to come? A man muſt be extravagant,
to afflict himſelf before the time, to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be ſurprized by an evil, which it may be
ſhall never come nigh him, and to make himſelf
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64170:122"/>
miſerable, becauſe he feareth one day to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
to ſhew her vanity, and convince her of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in her foreſight, we need but to examine the
object which ſhe apprehendeth, to know that her
cares are always as hurtful as diſhonourable. For
either ſhe reſpects a real or an imaginary evil, if
it be real, it is in our power to avoid it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is able to draw us to Vice againſt our Will:
if it be but imaginary, and of the number of them
which fortune ſends us, we know already that
it is not an evil, and that it is to do her injury, to
give her the imputation of that which the moſt
ſound Philoſophy attributeth only to ſin.</p>
                  <p>To prevent then theſe vain terrors, which cloud
our Reaſon, let us not judg of things raſhly, let
us examine the nature of the objects which cauſe
our aſtoniſhment; let us pull that vizard from
their faces, which gives them ſo frightful an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect;
and let us conſider them nakedly in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal:
then we ſhall find, that they are not ſo
oppoſite to our humors as we imagine them,
that they are troubleſome to us, becauſe we are
ſeduced by opinion, and that they have nothing
terrible but the apprehenſion
we have of them.<note place="margin">Leniſſima ferè ingenia in tantum venere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midinis ut ſibi excide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: nemo quidem, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne aliqua jactura ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis, expavit, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſque furenti, quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis timet <hi>Sen.</hi> lib. 6.

and are ſo much divided between Fear
and Sorrow, that they would ſooner be taken for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64170:123"/>
furies than for rational men. As if Fear had carried
away their Reaſon with their ſtabillity, they are
afraid without cauſe, they are affrighted at enemies
which they have not, they fly from them before
they appear; and, by a blind timidity, they often
leave a beaten Road to chooſe a doubtful Path.
Opinion hath nothing of quietneſs in it; ſhe is
afflicted by every thing which ſhe fancieth capable
to hurt her; ſhe aſſures us as little of Heaven as
of the Earth, and frighteth us as well with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
evil, as with that which is ready to aſſault
us.</p>
                  <p>But a wiſe man that knows perfectly the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between real and imaginary evils, ſtands faſt
againſt all accidents; he is armed againſt fortune,
he conſidereth afflictions as the exerciſes of vertue,
he ſees them coming without diſturbance; and,
ſupported by the greatneſs of his Courage, he waits
for them with deſign to oppoſe and vanquiſh
them. Poverty doth as little touch him as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
of his friends, he looks upon tortures with
the ſame countenance as he doth injuries; and he
knows as well how to defend himſelf from adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
that threaten, as from thoſe who proſecute
him. It is too great an effeminacy to run to the
Doctor before we be ill, to bind up the Arm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
diſlocation, to complain of the Head-ach ere
ever the pain come, and to lay our hand upon the
part which hath yet no hurt. But if that Fear did
not diſguiſe our diſaſters, and were faithful enough
to repreſent them truly to us, when they do come,
yet would ſhe be of no uſe to us, ſince ſhe cannot
divert them, and it is always a kind of cowardiſe
to complain of grief before the cauſe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64170:123"/>
it, have overtaken us. How often have
we ſeen, that events have deceived our hopes, that
our Fears have abuſed us to no purpoſe, that
we anticipated misfortunes that never came at us;
and ſome have befell us which we did not expect?
Let us not be afraid of the things that may ariſe
without our leave; and, by a prudent deceipt,
let us promiſe to our ſelves, that thoſe which
give us ſo much horror will be favourable to us.
As ſome fair appearances produce bad effects,
ſometimes troubles turn us to account. Some have
gotten out of Priſon by the means of Women, who
had brought them to the utmoſt farthing, and have
preſerved their Liberty by that which might
have coſt them their Lives; others have eſcaped
ſhipwrack by help of Rocks and Precipices; ſome
have found their preſervation in the Ruines of a
Houſe; others have ſurvived their Executioners,
and have ſeen them put to death, who deſigned
their deſtruction. Evil fortune doth not always
perſecute us, ſhe hath her cruelties and her cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencies,
and it's not neceſſary to be a great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
to know that there are times wherein her
diſgraces are more advantageous to us than her
favours.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe Diſcourſes it is eaſie to conclude,
(me thinketh) that Fear is unneceſſary to us, that
ſhe can be of no moral good uſe to us, ſince ſhe
throws us into misfortunes before they come,
torments us by her foreſight, deceives us by
falſe reports, abuſeth us by miſapprehenſions, and
raviſheth our tranquillity and reſt, ſo often as we
give our ſelves up to her conduct, which we ſhall

its preſence brings down our Body, it ſeizeth our
Members, and aſcending from the meaneſt to our
more noble part, it cauſeth us to feel all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wherewith ſhe exerciſeth our Companion.</p>
                  <p>But what Arguments ſoever they frame, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the fear of torments, it muſt be ſaid, that ſhe
is the Daughter of Opinion,<note place="margin">Inopia atque morbi ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio ſubeunt, nec ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis nec auribus quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam terroris incuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt: ad tormenta mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no ſtrepitu &amp; appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu veniunt. <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 14</note>
that the tortures which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the moſt terrible, are not
always the moſt cruel, and
that corporal puniſhments do
not ſeem leſs ſupportable than
baniſhment and poverty, but
becauſe they are accompanied with leſs ſolemnity.
Nothing doth ſo much awe us, as that which may
happen to us by the diſpleaſure of a potent King;
and who having the diſpoſition of our life in his
hands, is able to condemn us to tortures as terrible
as infamous. Although that Diſeaſes deſtroy the
Body as well as Torments, that the Peſtilence be
not leſs feared by us than puniſhments, and that
there be natural evils that exceed the cruelty of the
moſt ingenious Tyrants; yet is there not any
thing which ſo much amazteh us as the ſight of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and nothing ſo much ſhakes our ſtability,
as the preparations made to deprive us of life, or
to make proof of our Faith. Other evils which
ariſe from our conſtitution, ſeize us ſilently, and
their coming is ſo ſudden, that there is often no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of time between their firſt arrivel and their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64170:125"/>
violence. Sickneſs overtakes us without warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it runs into our veins without noiſe, and
without ſhew of that which might trouble us,
it congeals our blood, or burns up our entrails.
Poverty hath not ſo frightful an aſpect, ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hurts our Eyes nor our Ears, when ſhe enters
upon the ruines of Riches, and Fortune changeth
not her countenance, in making us poor, or in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
us in the midſt of abundance. But Tortures
are terrible, we are aſtoniſht at their preparations,
the inſtruments of Death which they ſet out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, beat down our courage, and that tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
noiſe which attends the ceremony, throws
horror into the minds of all that behold it. There
they ſet in order all the cruelties which the
malice of Tyrants hath invented, here they ſet
up the Croſs, raiſe the Rack, expoſe the boiling
Cauldrons to view, lay open the pitched Shirts,
and rowze the cruelty of ſavage Beaſts, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
us; all this attracting matter ſends Terror
into our Soul, and it ought not to be thought
ſtrange, if we are ſo much afraid of Torments, ſince
they are ſhewed us with ſo much addition, and
that they appear to our eies in ſuch frightful ſhapes,
that the Executioner even redoubles our Fear, by
gradually expoſing the inſtruments of Torture,
and cauſeth the moſt reſolute to abate his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
by the preparation of things that are able
to offend it. Nothing ſo much abates our Spirit
as the conſideration of the evil that threatens us,
and experience lets us ſee, that pain is always leſs
rigorous than the apprehenſion we had of it. It is
not always the thing that wounds us, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that we have conceived of it; and we have
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64170:125"/>
found ſome perſons that had endured Tortures
with conſtancy, had they not firſt been overcome
by the ceremonies thereof. A man is not miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unleſs he think himſelf to be ſo, his thoughts
are the Regulators of his pains, and to become a
glorious Conqueror, he need but perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that the evil he ſuffereth is light.</p>
                  <p>Although theſe Arguments be peculiar, they
ceaſe not to be true, and it's ſufficient to obſerve
the effects of opinion, to make judgment of what
ſhe can ſay for her ſelf. For as ſhe is the Child
of the Body rather than of the Soul, and borrows
her activity from the Senſe: ſhe takes her part in
all the accidents that befall it, ſhe ſhares in his Joy
and Grief, and, by a ſubtile craft, ſhe raiſeth the price
of what ever pleaſeth it, and augments the horror
of what ever is odious to it. From thence it comes
that ſhe repreſents Torments with ſo much fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and enhauncing upon the evils which the
Body ſuffers, ſhe gives them dreadful ſhapes, which
aſtoniſh us, and which equally ſend their horror
into the Soul of the Patient, and of the Spectators.
She is ſo ſuſpicious, that ſhe never repreſents evil
nakedly; and ſhe is ſo little faithful in her reports,
that ſhe is generally found a lyar. If we float upon
the Sea, and the Winds ſwell her Waves, or never
ſo little toſs our Veſſel, we become faint-hearted;
Reaſon and Light make their eſcape; and, as if we
had already ſuffered ſhipwrack, or were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to drink up the whole Sea, we grow pale with
Fear, and fall into a ſweat with fright. If Earth
tremble under our feet, and if the houſes that cover
us do but ſhake, or make ſhew of falling upon us,
what out-cries do we not make, and what Deaths
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64170:126"/>
faces do we not ſhew in our countenances? Cold
takes poſſeſſion of all our Limbs, Fear ſummons
the Blood to the Heart, all objects aſtoniſh us; and,
as if the whole houſe were to fall on our heads,
we are afraid of every part. Yet we are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that a ſmall quantity of water will choak
us, that a tyle from our houſe is ſufficient to knock
out our Brains, and that we need but a Hole of
three foot to do our buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame in matters of Torture, of which
we have ſo much apprehenſion, the noiſe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it makes the greateſt part of the pain, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
enhaunceth its violence, and the ſight of
ſo many inſtruments ſet out for ſhew, fills us with
more Grief than that Death we are to ſuffer: yet
we know that all thoſe armed Soldiers, that that
Troop of Officers, that the Executioner trimmed
up in a Waſtcoat, can but remove us out of the
World, let out our Soul at the wound to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us, and not to affright our ſelves with the
name of Murther, ſeparate our Soul from our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
In fine, they can do but what a Worm doth
among Children in a Chamber, what the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green
cauſeth in the Hoſpitals, and what the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
every day produceth in the Courts of Princes
and Shepherds Huts. An ordinary reſolution will
ſerve to endure evils that paſs in a moment, and
which often terminate with the ſame ſtroak by
which they began.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed a difficult thing to gain this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
upon our ſelves: we find at this day but few
<hi>Scaevolas</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi>'s, it appertaineth but to thoſe
great Souls of Antiquity, to brave Tortures, and
bear them without diſturbance. We find no more
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64170:126"/>
men, who dare burn their own hands, to abate
the confidence of their Perſecutors, who dare run
to meet Death in deriſion of their tyrannical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors;
and whoſe Joys, in profeſſing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
are not interrupted under the hand
of the Executioner. Modern Philoſophy hath
made us too tender, and the love of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is become too natural to us, not to be afraid
of ſo many evils as do conſpire our deſtruction,
not to fear a Wedg of Iron which breaks our
Bones, wild Beaſts which rip up our Bowels,
Engines by which Death is conveyed to us with
tedious repetitions, and moderate flames which
reduce us not to aſhes, till after our patience is
tyred out.</p>
                  <p>But as general Principles terminate in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and that the living draw from them their
principal Lights, I think I may here propoſe the
courage of a Heathen-Dame to the cowardiſe of
our Chriſtian Men, and ſhew them in the Hiſtory
of her Life, that pain is inſupportable only to
them that are defective in reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Never was Empire more maligned than that of
the firſt <hi>Ceſar:</hi> his Uſurpation begat him the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of all the Nations of the Earth, the <hi>Romans</hi>
often attempted their Liberty; and did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
teſtifie by their enterprizes, that they could
no longer endure the Government of a Man, who
had rob'd them of their freedom. <hi>Brutus</hi> engaged
covertly in the Conſpiration, and though he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
himſelf in hiding the matter from his Wife,
he could not ſo well diſſemble it, but ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and obſerved by the change of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
the diſturbance of his Soul. Fearing then
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64170:127"/>
that her Husband miſtruſted her weakneſs, and
that he durſt not tell her a ſecret which might
be the price of his Life, if it took air, reſolved
to make tryal upon her ſelf, whether ſhe could
keep it undiſcloſed; for retiring into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and putting out her Servants, ſhe laid hold
on a Razor, which ſhe lets into her Thigh; her
wound bleeds in abundance, her members grow
feeble by loſs of Blood, a Feaver ſlides into her
Veins, and ſeemed to lead her toward the Grave:
when <hi>Brutus</hi> entering the Room, and ſurprized
by an accident ſo little expected, informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the cauſe and circumſtances. <hi>Porcia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
them that aſſiſted her to withdraw, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Husband to ſit down, and promiſed to
tell him her ſelf the original of her indiſpoſition.
You know, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Brutus,</hi> that when I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Houſe, it was not in the quality of a Miſs,
or of a Concubine, and that I preferred not your
Alliance before that of ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to be only the Companion of your Table
and Bed, but to lie in your boſom, to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of your Secrets, and to have my propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as well of your misfortunes as of your feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.
It is not that I accuſe Heaven, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that you are my Husband, but only that
you look not upon me as your Wife: You muſt
not imagine that I am content with the duties of
Marriage, and that I expect from your perſon
only thoſe outward Careſſes, that unite our Bodies
rather than our Wills and our Souls. I aſpire to
greater things <hi>Brutus;</hi> I require to be admitted
of your privy Council, and that you honor me as
well with your Friendſhip as your Love. This
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64170:127"/>
requeſt is too juſt to be refuſed, and if you judg
it ſuch, why are you ſo reſerved? Why do you
diſſemble your troubles of mind, and wherefore
do you hide from me that glorious reſolution
you have taken, to put a Tyrant to Death? If you
cannot hope for help from me, and if my Sex for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
me to aſſiſt you in your undertakings, you may,
at leaſt, expect from me ſome comfort, or leſſening
of your griefs, or misfortunes: and may be aſſured,
that if I am not ſufficiently ſtrong to be your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
I ſhall have always courage enough to bear
you company where ever ill luck or fate ſhall call
you; conſider not the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of thoſe of my condition,<note place="margin">Cui verba facio? rem vide, cepi ipſe mei ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentum &amp; ecce hoc vulnus, quod ſponte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utile ut diſcerem, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid dolori aut tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis par eſſem <hi>Lipſ.</hi> monit. polit. cap. 7.</note>
but remember only that I am
the Daughter of <hi>Cato</hi> and the

enough to ſuffer death,
the love that I have vowed to thee, <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſhall
make me conſtant in diſpiſing it. Then ſhewing

there the tryal which I have made thereof; do
thou now not ſcruple to open thy Boſom to me,
to reveal me thy deſigns: know

<hi>Cato</hi>'s Heart,<note place="margin">Poſſum ferre, poſſum contemnere, &amp; mori, Brute, cum marito, &amp; pro marito poſſum. <hi>Id.</hi> 16.</note> and that
if my Sex permit me not, to

                  <p>If a punctilio of Honor, if a vehement deſire of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64170:128"/>
Fame, and if a ſhort obſtinacy animated by vanity,
have cauſed ſome to triumph over Death, conquer
Pain, and deſpiſe the rigor of Tortures, what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Vertue do, when ſhe is ſupported by Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
When ſhe ſtands up for the preſervation of
Laws, when ſhe ſuffers for the defence of her Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and her Altars? Since ſhe is compoſed in her
Actions, and preſerves the ſame meaſures in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
as in torments.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to acquire this inſenſibility of pain
ſo familiar to the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and ſo little known to
other Philoſophers, let us often have in mind the
Actions of thoſe generous men, who by their
Courage ſurmounted Tortures, let us fortifie our
ſelves againſt the apprehenſions of Death, let us
not love our Bodies more than neceſſity requireth;
let us ſeparate from Torments that ſolemnity
which affrighteth us, and let us perſwade our
ſelves, that thoſe ceremonies contain no more than
what is deſpiſed by a man in his Bed, ſick of the
Gout, than what is endured by one at a Feaſt, who
is ſick at his Stomach, and what is undergone by
a tender Woman in Child-bearing.</p>

committed are rather forced

are not binding, that our agreements are
invalid, and that as ſhe deprives us of Liberty, or
hinders the uſe of Reaſon, ſhe acquitted us of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
and annulled our Contracts. Divines,
who conſider Death as the production of ſin, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the effects of our conſtitution, conclude,
that ſhe muſt needs be a great enemy to Nature,
ſince ſhe is ſo much redoubted, ſince ſhe gives
dread to all ſenſible Creatures, and that thoſe
which we ſtile inanimate, teſtified ſome kind of
averſneſs, to be ſeparated from their Principle.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64170:129"/>
The Chicken hides at the approach of the Kite,
the Hare flies before the Dogs, and we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Nature, which uſeth not its force, or
induſtry, to make defence againſt Death. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſeperate the Marble from the Rocks but by
violence, the Trees groan under the blow of the
Ax, the Air ſhuns the Fire that rarifies it, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
as it is, it makes oppoſition for ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
If the Animals, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which were
created purely for ſlaughter, love life, and are ſo
much afraid of Death, how ſhould not man be
therewith affrighted, when it threatens him, ſince
he was born to live for ever, and that he ſhould
never have ſeen ſeperation between his Body and
his Soul, if he had been careful of his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence?
Philoſophers ſupport the juſtice of their
Fear by the neceſſity of Death, they think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to redoubt an unavoidable evil, and which,
though common to all men, hath yet no remedy
in Nature. They accuſe it of cruelty, they ſay, that
it is ſhe alone of all the Gods, that will accept no
Sacrifice, who refuſeth the offerings of men, and
that it is in vain to dedicate Temples to her, or
build her any Altars, ſince ſhe is equally blind and
inexorable.</p>
                  <p>But what Reaſons ſoever theſe men invent, to
excuſe the apprehenſion of Death, it is not hard to
ſhew them their error,<note place="margin">Stultum eſt timere quod vitare non poſſis. <hi>Sen.</hi> de remed. fortuit.</note> and to
fight them with the Weapons
wherewith they maintain their
Principles. For if Death be
inevitable, if there be no Altars of protection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her Arreſts, if no man have been yet able to
ſecure himſelf from her; and if that by which we
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64170:129"/>
live, be the means of our Death, why are we ſo
much afraid of it? And why do we afflict our
ſelves, for the ſuffering of a pain, for which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath no remedy? We are born under this
Law, we came into the world to go out of it, our
Anceſtors have beaten the Road, and all thoſe who

he courts the Phyſicians, he promiſeth them moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

preſents engaged them to give him length
of years. For as if Divine Providence had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

of Men, he ſummoned the Hermits from the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and conjured them to requeſt the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Health by their Prayers: and without
taking care to amend his Life, he only chargeth
them with the preſervation thereof. Sometimes
being utterly void of all heavenly confidence, he
ſhuts himſelf up in his Cloſet, cauſeth all avenues
to be ſtopt, the doors to be barracadoed, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to be cloſe ſhut; and, as if Death had not
been able to pierce the place of his Retreat, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
his Pallace into a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<note place="margin">O miſer! aſſiduo times; ſemel faciendum eſt hoc. Quid times quod in tua manu eſt ne timeas? <hi>Lipſ.</hi> mon. polit.</note> Unhappy man! what art

that Death is but the way of Life, and that
thou mayſt be eternally happy, for having gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly

                  <p>Though Nature have brought forth nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, that is to endure to eternity, though
all her workmanſhip be condemned to diſſolution,
and though all that we behold is but for a few
days; nevertheleſs we may ſay, that nothing is
totally loſt, that her labours are rather extinguiſht
than annihilated, and that Death doth not ſo
much determine, as interrupt them. If the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
paſs away; if the Sun retire from our Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
if the Flowers forſake their Beds, and if in
our Fields we ſee no remains of the Vintage and
Harveſt, another year reſtores them to us, and
all thoſe Beauties which we look upon as vaniſht
recover and renew the Face of the Earth, by the
ſame means which ſeemed to have cauſed their
annihilation. If Winter ſteal away, if the Snow
diſſolve and leave bare the tops of our Houſes, if
the Froſt ceaſe to harden our Rivers, and if the
North-wind forbear to ſhake our Buildings, it
comes again after a little time, and his Months,
though departed for a while, fail not to return,
to make good his ſeaſon. If darkneſs prevail
upon the light, if night hide the Sun from us,
and if its obſcurity keep Earths Beauties from
our Eyes, the day following cauſeth the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to flee away, and makes us reſtitution of
the Lights which the precedent darkneſs had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
us of. The Stars which are never at reſt,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64170:130"/>
which are in perpetual motion, and rowl continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
over our heads, haſten to the point from
whence they departed, and reaſſume their Courſe
by the ſame degrees by which they began their
Motions: It is with Man as with other Creatures,
he dies to live again, the parts of which he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
return to their principle, as his Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
to the Earth, his Soul mounts to Heaven,
and, eſcaping her Priſon, ſhe flies unclog'd to her
original.</p>
                  <p>Neither do we ſee any but impious or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
perſons, that fear this ſeparation, and look
upon it as their moſt rigorous puniſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Divine Juſtice can chaſtiſe them: they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when they are told of Death, they dread the
judgments of God, which they have deſpiſed,
and are unwilling to leave the
Earth,<note place="margin">Ad refrigerium juſti vocantur, non eſt exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, ſed ad aeternita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem tranſitus. Quis ad meliora non feſtinet? <hi>Cyprian.</hi> lib. de mort.</note> becauſe they do not
hope to reign in Heaven. But
juſt men look on Death
without Fear, they ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expect it, and wiſh for it as
the eaſe of their miſeries,
they calmly prepare for it, and knowing it to be
the Sepulchre of Vice, and the Cradle of Vertue,
they ceaſe not to ſupplicate the arrival of their
change. They know by Faith that the World is
but a place of baniſhment, that Heaven is their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, and that they ſhall one day be called
home, to receive the reward of their Labours.
Deſcend into thoſe ſolitudes of the ancient <hi>Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi>
and you ſhall there find the examples of this
truth, there you ſhall ſee men who are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employed in the contemplation of Death, who
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64170:131"/>
think only upon the day in which they ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from the Earth, who expect it with joy,
and convert the moſt dreadful of our puniſhments
into their ordinary imployments. Break into their
Cells, there you ſhall find them, who are loaden
with Irons, who having their fleſh torn with the
Whip, lean with faſting, weakened with watching,
wiſh for the end of their Life, and, like thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Athletes, or Wreſtlers of old, offer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
to obtain Death, the recompence of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and Courage.</p>
                  <p>But, waving theſe Chriſtian Sentiments, and to
return to Philoſophical Arguments, I do not well
apprehend, why we are ſo much afraid of Death,
ſince it brings us ſo much advantage, and that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an end to our days, it makes us infinitely
happy, or renders us uncapable of further offences.
For if we have lived as vertuous perſons, if we have
not miſſpent the time given us for the working
out of our Salvation; and if we have well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the moments of our Life, why are we unwilling
to be taken from it, and why deſire we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to loſe it, ſince Death by which it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
is the paſſage to a bleſſed Eternity? But if
we have gone aſtray from our duty, and if we have
been Prodigals of our time, why ſeek we to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
it, and to augment the number of our

It is to be ignorant of our own condition, to
fancy that Death is a cruel thing, and not to
look upon it rather as a favor
than a grief of Nature.<note place="margin">Ignaro malorum ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quibus non mors, ut optimum inventum naturae, lauditur. <hi>Sen.</hi> Conſol ad mort.</note> For

as ſhe is the remedy of the infirm, and of the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

The Earth hath few men, that are not
beholding to Death, and who place her not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
amongſt the number of their acquiſitions than
their loſſes. For by her the ſlave is taken from under
the cruel hand of his Maſter, &amp; breaking the twine

a diſpenſation of his oath of fidelity: it is ſhe that
ſets the Priſoners at large, and who, knocking off

no abiding place here upon Earth, and that it
matters not much to what part of the world they

fortifies the faint hearted againſt their misfortunes,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64170:132"/>
who laughs at the cruelty of Princes, and who
conſtraineth us to believe, that the Life we love is
a puniſhment, ſince that which gives it a period,
puts an end to all our miſeries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> being Maſter of this Secret, and
who had learnt by divers Murthers, that Death
paſt for a favor amongſt the
unfortunate,<note place="margin">Mortem miſericors ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe pro vita dabis <hi>Sen.</hi> in Troade.</note> granted it only to
his friends; he that obtained
it muſt be reconciled to him;
and <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerved, that it was not ſo much an
effect of his Rigor, as of his Bounty, to be put to
Death in the time of his Reign. He would have
thought himſelf ignorant of the Fundamentals of
Tyranny, if he had chaſtiſed all men with one
and the ſame puniſhment, if he had not put a
difference between perſons, if he had condemned
the miſerable to death, and if he had preſerved
alive thoſe who deemed themſelves happy. There
were ſome men during his time, that wiſht for
Death as a favor, and deſired to be bereaved
of Life, that they might be no longer Witneſſes
of his horrible wickedneſs; <hi>Caninius Julius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Sentence of Death with Joy, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the Emperor thanks for it in the midſt of
the Senat; and whether it were to reproach him
of Cruelty, or that he would blame the Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
of his Compatriots, he let him ſee, that Death
was not ſo terrible, ſince it was poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
it, to avoid the ſight of a barbarous Tyrant.
He knew it was no extraordinary priviledg for
a Man to live; that Vaſſals enjoy it as well as
their Lords, that the condition of Beaſts in this
point was equal to that of reaſonable Creatures,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64170:132"/>
and that we muſt have had but ſmall experience
of the calamities of the World, to fear what
Children ſuffer without complaining, mad men
expect without concernment, and what the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
receive with ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Death hath nothing of Cruelty but opinion,
Philoſophers have augmented our horror by the
deſcription of it; they have increaſed our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
in deſigning to prepare us for it; and
they have repreſented her frightful even by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that might well ſerve to enable us to ſupport it.
Some have imagined, that ſhe
was the greateſt of all our
evils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

by depriving us of Senſe, it makes us incapble of
ſuffering pain, and in ſeparating our Soul from
our Body, it makes us inſenſible of all evils. The
<hi>Epicureans,</hi> who have vowed an inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to pleaſure, confeſs this Truth: the Living
feel it as little as thoſe that reſt in the Grave;
and as ſhe offends not in the latter, becauſe they are
deprived of Senſe, ſhe toucheth not the former,
becauſe they yet breath.</p>
                  <p>If all theſe Reaſons cannot perſwade the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi>
not to fear Death, at leaſt, they will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64170:133"/>
ſince an ordinary reſolution will ſerve to

that we care not to preſerve, or defend, a publique

I know that <hi>Seneca</hi> did allow
his wiſe man this ſentiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that it was his opinion that
we might depart this World
without offence, that there
was always Glory by letting
in Death by our own hand,
and that that man was able to live at liberty, who
could die without conſtraint: That a Wiſe Man
was Maſter of his Life, as well as his Actions,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64170:134"/>
that he was to live as long as he ought, and not ſo
long as he could; and as he withdrew himſelf
from a Feaſt when he was ſatisfied, or quitted his
ſport when tired; he was to leave the World
when he became weary of it. In fine, he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that this <hi>Paſſion</hi> was an honor to him: and
that if it appertained to men of great courage
ſometimes to forſake the Earth in their proſperity,
it was a mark of folly in a man to deſire to live,
being diſcontent and unhappy.</p>
                  <p>This ſentiment is ſo often repeated in his Works,
that we cannot deny but he was of that opinion,
and I muſt give the lye to my own judgment, if I
would defend or juſtifie him in that eſcape. But
he ſeemeth to me excuſable enough, being a <hi>Stoick,</hi>
ſince his error proceeded from the Principles of
the Sect he was of, and for commending Deſpair
in his Wiſe man, ſince it paſſed in his time for the
moſt glorious act of our courage: yet no ſooner
was he undeceived in this Doctrine, no ſooner had
Chriſtianity forbidden Homicides; and that no
attempt could be made upon a mans ſelf, without
breaking in upon the Rights of his Lord, but he
quitted his judgment; he retracts from his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and confirmed, by the cloſe of his Life,
the truth of his Belief. For having received the
Sentence of Death, he would not execute it
upon himſelf with his own hands, he permitted
his Veins to be opened by them about him, and
ſuffered them to let his Soul (with the Blood)
out of his Body, without his own aſſiſtance. In a
Letter which he writes to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> he exhorteth
a wiſe man not to deprive the Executioner of his
Office, and (without fear) to wait for the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64170:135"/>
of his days, he ſaith that there is fortitude
in deſpiſing but not in hating of Life, and that it is
rather a ſign of madneſs than
of wiſdom,<note place="margin">Aliquando etiam ſi mors iſtabit, &amp; deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum ſibi ſupplicium ſciet non commodabit ſapiens poenae ſuae mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, ſtultitia eſt timore mortis mori: veniet qui occidet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecta, quid occupas alienum negotium? <hi>Sen.</hi> Ep. 70.</note> to work our own
diſſolution by the fear of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Indeed amongſt all the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the Soul,
none are more ſordid than Deſpair: thoſe that
have made uſe of it, to recover their Liberty, or
to deliver themſelves from the Tyranny of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
have not ſo much made proof of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
as of their weakneſs; and they have paſſed
among men rather for impatient than couragious
perſons. <hi>Cato</hi> is not blamed in Hiſtory, but for
having hearkened to the advice of Deſpair, his
Death is the ſhame of the <hi>Romans,</hi> his homicide
blemiſheth all his other actions; and what prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſoever <hi>Seneca</hi> gives him in his Book of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
he cannot be exempted from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of cowardiſe, in having recourſe to Death, to
ſhun the power of a victorious enemy. It is a
defect of Courage not to be able to undergo Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
to wiſh for Death, becauſe our Life is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant,
and to anticipate the end of our Days,
to free our ſelves from pain and infamy. <hi>Regulus,</hi>
to whom the like evil befell, ſhewed himſelf much
more generous to Poſterity than this Philoſopher:
for being fallen into the hands of the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
he would not lend his own to Deſpair, that
they might be deprived of the Glory of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw:
and although he was become the Captive
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64170:135"/>
of them whom he had formerly vanquiſht in pitcht
Battel, he choſe rather to ſuffer, in being their
Servant, than violently to eaſe himſelf of their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
by the commiſſion of a homicide. He received
his diſaſter without murmuring againſt Heaven, he
bore the Domination of his inſulting Lords with
patience, he retained the ſame greatneſs of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in his Captivity as in his Authority, and
though far removed from the <hi>Roman</hi> People, he
ceaſed not to preſerve his affection inviolable for
them. If his enimies loaded his body with Chains,
they could not tear from his Soul, the love he had
for his Country, he was faithful to it in the midſt
of his miſeries, he made vows for its welfare,
and as he knew that he could not go out of the
world without the leave of him that placed him in
it, he waited for Death from his Enemies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
daring to prevent it, by attempting upon his
own life. But <hi>Cato</hi> never ſurmounted <hi>Ceſar,</hi> if
he became his Prince, he was alſo become his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
by the Law of Arms, and if he deprived
him of Liberty, it was after he had ſubjected the
Roman Commonwealth to his Authority. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
his Deſpair is an evident ſign of his imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
he did not kill himſelf, but becauſe he envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Ceſars</hi> fortunes, and ſet not the Dagger to his
breaſt, but becauſe he could not bear the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a victorious Antagoniſt.</p>
                  <p>If Deſpair be found guilty of infirmity, we ſhall
find her no leſs full of fury: violence gives not
way to weakneſs, and as we deem a man a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
whoſe heart faileth him in the day of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
he is eſteemed cruel, when he contracts with
Death for his deliverance. Thoſe Tyrants that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64170:136"/>
break in upon our Lives, come ſhort of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Deſpair, they diſcharge their Rage only
upon our Bodies, they leave our minds at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and, afflicting the meaneſt part of us, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſee the more noble victorious over their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
But Deſpair, that exerciſeth its fury upon
both, it depreſſeth the Soul with the Body,
it ſets us wholy on fire againſt our ſelves, and
more outragious than the evil that aſſaults us, it
conſtrains us to make uſe of Steel or Poiſon, to
deprive our ſelves of Life. Then it is, that we
become our own enemies, when we turn our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to our deſtruction, when we employ our
Reaſon to procure our ruine, and to avoid Pain,
which is but the trouble of effeminate men,
we ſummon the worſt of evils to our aſſiſtance.
Likewiſe an Orator hath excellently ſaid, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
was but the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of furious perſons, that it
took its Laws from Impatience, its Power from
Indignation, its Weapons from Fear and Pain;
and that a man called not for Death, but becauſe
he hated himſelf, or forgot his own Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Moreover Deſpair is accounted the moſt unjuſt
of our Inclinations; and whoſoever ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the uſe thereof amongſt reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
would no leſs offer violence to the Laws of
Nature than thoſe of Chriſtianity. Life is a
gift of God, we enjoy it not but ſo long as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him, we came not into the World but by his
favor, and that man would doubtleſs be inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
audacious, who would dare to abuſe a benefit
which he received not, but upon condition to
preſerve it. As none are permitted to chooſe the
Country where they will be born, nor the Parents
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64170:136"/>
that ſhall beget them, it is not allowable for any
to deſtroy themſelves; and it is but juſt, that He
only that placed us in the number of the Living
without our conſent, ſhould remove us from thence
at his pleaſure. For although we are born for
Command, and that we behold nothing upon
Earth, that is not ſubject to our Authority, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
the diſpoſing of our ſelves, is not within
our Commiſſion, our Life is in the hands of him
that gave it us; and ſince the Son of God hath
redeemed us by his Blood, it is no longer lawful
for us to undervalue it, becauſe of a few incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
that attend it. Even as the Laws of Men
forbid particular perſons to reſcue the guilty from
the hands of the Executioner, the heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
permits not that ſinners ſhould dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
or change their Chaſtiſements; and they are
thereby oblig'd to ſuffer all ſorts of calamitys rather
than to abandon the rights which God hath over
their Life, to the diſcretion of fortune. If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
Death let it be the Death of our <hi>Paſſions,</hi> let us
avoid every thing which makes us miſerable, let us
forſake all thoſe falſe opinions which ſeduce us,
and let us die to our ſelves, if we will not feel the
evil which we are ſo much afraid of.</p>

evil for want of employment. The truth is,
it falls out very often, that nothing is more fatal
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64170:137"/>
to us than retirement and ſolitudes: our Vices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
leſs vigorous when they are ſeen; when the
Diſeaſe is diſcovered, it's half cured, and a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
life is never more dangerous than when, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
the Eies of men, we retire into private
places. Yet ſuch is the humor of Grief, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in retirement, and ſeeks out ſolitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to entertain her ſelf with her own miſeries:
and, as if ſhe were poſſeſt of an evil Spirit, ſhe
ſhuns the company of them that are able to cure
her. She reſembles thoſe idle delicate perſons,
who know little or nothing of their own actions,
who think not of eating but when they are called
to it, and who know not whether they be ſitting

                  <p>If the other motions of the Soul put us into agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

love, and laying open its Beauties, or Benefits, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
us with the Joy of its poſſeſſion, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
Anger meditates revenge, ſhe conſiders
the injury done her, and is never appeaſed till
ſhe have had ſatisfaction: Covetouſneſs applies
her ſtudies to Riches; the comfort ſhe expects
from their enjoyment is her motive; and ſhe ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

ſhe propounds to her ſelf no ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe is altogether
taken up with her own misfortunes; and without
extending her thoughts beyond her ſelf, her food
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64170:138"/>

her Cure. The Journies or Voyages we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
wherewith to charm her; the cares we apply
to correct her nature, and the divertiſements of
which we make uſe, to allay her anguiſh, avail
us nothing: ſhe ſoon returns, and all the witty
inventions of Prudence ſerve not ſo much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
as to deceive her. For Opinion coming in
to her aſſiſtance, renews her Sorrows, ſhews her
the cauſe with aggravations; and, as if it drew
ſtrength from her reſpite, it ſtrives to make her yet
more miſerable. And it is from this reaſon, that
<hi>Seneca</hi> doth infer, that Grief is not natural to
man, ſince ſhe is ſo fickle in her humor, ſo varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in her wounds, and ſo inconſtant in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                  <p>What ever comes from Nature is not ſenſibly
apprehenſive of alteration, it preſerves every where
the ſame order,<note place="margin">Ea quae à natura origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem acceperunt eandem in omnibus ſervant; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret non eſſe naturale quod varium eſt. <hi>Sen.</hi> Conſol. ad Helv. cap. 7.</note> and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of matter it meets with
changeth not its courſe. Fire
which is a natural Agent, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
none, it equally devours
the Prince and the Peaſant, it
conſumes the Wife and her
Husband, and it muſt be Braſs or Diamonds, that
is able to reſiſt its fury. Steel enters into every
part of the Body, it divides all Metals, it ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
the moſt ſolid things, it conveys Death to the
greateſt number of Men, and we cannot reckon a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64170:138"/>
Martyr in our Annals, that was able to oppoſe its
violence. But ſorrow is partial, ſhe wounds one
without touching another; that which afflicts us,
reaches not our Neighbours, and we often ſee, that
one and the ſame diſaſter makes ſome contented,
and others unhappy.</p>
                  <p>The original of all this diſorder is ſelf-love, our
Griefs proceed from our affections, we grow not
ſad but becauſe we are in love with our ſelves, and
as that Matron ſaid in <hi>Quintilian,</hi> we regret not
the loſs of outward Goods, or of our friends, but
becauſe we affected them too much. If the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
ravage our Country, if the Peſtilence depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate
the Provinces, if the Hailſtones become the
Harveſtors of the Husbandmans hopes, if the
Thunderbolts batter down our Steeple-tops, if the
Famine decreaſe the number of our Compatriots;
we do not ſo much lament their miſery as our own
private calamity, we apprehend our own ruine in
their deſtruction, and their misfortunes and loſſes
touch us no farther, than that the ſame diſaſters
may fall upon our heads. For by a contrary reaſon,
if news be brought us, that the Armies have quitted
our Borders, that they are gone into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or
marched into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and are become Maſters of
their moſt conſiderable ſtrong holds, if we receive
advice, that the Plague hath tumbled twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Indians</hi> into the Grave, that the Sea hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up a whole Fleet of Infidels, that the <hi>Turks</hi>
have gained ſome Iſlands from the Chriſtians, and
violently carried away a great number of innocent
perſons into miſerable Captivitie; all theſe evil
tidings ſtir us not, we hear them without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;
and though Nature oblige us to love all
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64170:139"/>
men as our Brethren, we are not much concerned,
whether they be miſerable, provided we are but
out of danger; the misfortunes of our Neighbours
terrifie us not, but in proportion to the love we
bear them, and we fear not their unhappineſs,
but in as much as it may chance to concern our
ſelves. This was it that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to define Grief,<note place="margin">Triſtitia eſt diſſentio animi ab his rebus quae nobis nolentibus acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt. <hi>Aug.</hi> 14. de civ.</note>
according to the Stoicks, a
Diſpleaſure of the Soul cauſed
by the opinion of an evil,
which befalls us contrary to our Will.</p>
                  <p>But as the humor of this <hi>Paſſion</hi> agrees not with
that of its companions, ſhe bringeth forth effects,
that are different from theirs: For if Love and
Deſire treat us with oppreſſion, Grief deals with
us as a Tyrant, and if Hope and Fear treat their
gueſts as ſlaves, Sorrow makes them Martyrs. Her
malignity extends into all their faculties, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbs
the Body with cold, ſhe extinguiſheth the
heat, by which they ſubſiſt, ſhe dries up the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
moiſture, by which they live, ſhe obſtructs the
digeſtion of what they eat, ſhe embroils their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
ſhe perverts their judgment, &amp; ſhe leaves not
a member of their Bodies nor any power of their
Soul uncorrupted or not weakened. In fine, if the
other <hi>Paſſions</hi> be Diſeaſes, Grief is a Torment; if
Love be ſubject to diſcontents, if Joy be ligh-thead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if Fear be accompanied with imbecillity, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is attended at once with pining, anguiſh and
pain: ſhe beats down the Spirits with the Body,
and overthrowing the whole order of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
puts them into a condition uncapable
of acting any thing, but what is fatal to their Reſt.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64170:139"/>
Deſpair ceaſeth to torment us when ſeparated from
Grief, and our apprehenſions are ſupportable,
when divided from that unquietneſs with which
the faint-hearted are afflicted.</p>

                  <p>ALbeit I have ever been perſwaded, that
there was a God in Heaven, that I know

to forbear lifting my head into Heaven, to

the Creator of the Univerſe were the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the minutes and adventures of our Life. It
is true, that my error laſted but a while, and I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
my opinion as ſoon as I conſidered the Beauties
of Nature, when I contemplated theſe azure Vaults,
which hang over our heads, when I admired the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64170:140"/>
influences of the Stars, when I obſerved the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
order of the Seaſons, when I examined how the
Day ſucceeded the Night, and how the Sun, which
cauſed both, conveyed his Light and his Heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the quarters of the Earth. All theſe wonders
eaſily undeceived me in my miſapprehenſion; and
wholly aſhamed of my infidelity, I confeſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty, that he who divided the Seas, who
cauſed the Fruits to come forth in their ſeaſons,
who upheld the Earth by its own weight, was the
ſame who regulated our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Res humanas ordine nullo fortuna regit, ſpargitque manu mune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra caeca pejora fovens. <hi>Sen.</hi> Hippo.</note>
who took notice of our
Sufferings, who aſſiſted us in
our warfare, and made himſelf
Arbitrator of our Defeat, or
our Victory. But when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I ſaw that all things were in diſorder in
the World, when I obſerved in it the guilty hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and the innocent miſerable, when I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, the vicious rewarded, and the juſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
I fell again into my firſt error, I appealed
from my laſt opinion; and ſwayed by an injuſtice,
which to me ſeemed equitable, I acknowledged no

                  <p>But the Chaſtiſement that waiteth upon ſin, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me of this Diſtemper, the puniſhment of the

of the afflictions of the juſt, nor of the felicity of
the wicked, I know that theſe are ſufficiently mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
by being guilty; and that it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that Divine Juſtice ſhould abate their, Pride,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64170:140"/>
ſince Vice contributeth to their Torment. Indeed
let a man be as vicious as he will he ſhall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Chaſtiſement due to
his ſin:<note place="margin">Cognatum imò innatum omni ſceleri ſceleris ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicium <hi>Lipſ.</hi> 2. de Conſt.</note> his lewdneſs is his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
and how inſenſible
ſoever he be of his Crimes, he
cannot ſhun their puniſhment,
after he hath committed them. There is no ſafety
here upon Earth, but that of innocence, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can give reſt to our Souls, but the juſtice of
our Actions. As it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi>
to bear the Croſs upon which they were to be
crucified, impious men carry their puniſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them: the remorſe of Conſcience bears them
company in all places; and they feel themſelves
condemned before the Witneſſes be called, ere ever
the Judg paſs the Sentence, and before the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
lay hands upon them. Thoſe Torments
that are viſible, are not always the moſt ſenſible:
our Body is not at all times the theater of our
pain, that which wounds this is often offenſive only
to our imagination; and if its violence make it
ſhort, its modertaion is not inſupportable: but
that which proceeds from our Crimes is eternal,
it is this only which is able to unite different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which is as laſting as cruel, which endures
longer than that which cauſed it, which encreaſeth
by its ſilence, and gains ſtrength by its moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It reſembles that famous Tyrant, who gave
commandment to the Executioners, to give their
Patients a tedious Death, to make them ſuffer
their Torments with longer repetitions, to lay on
gently, that their Death might be the more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to them, and to ſend them into the other
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64170:141"/>
world by reiterated pains. For ſin gives us no
reſpite, it continues our whole life, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
torments conveys us to eternal Death.</p>
                  <p>But without ſpending more time in ſumming
up the Calamities of the wicked, it will not be
hard for me to ſatisfie thoſe complaints, which
moſt men make againſt Heaven; if I ſhew, that
Fortune hath nothing diſmal in her, that her
diſgraces cannot make us unhappy, that they are
rather teſtimonials of Gods Bounty than of his
Anger; and that if they are the exerciſes of the
innocent, they ſerve alſo for remedies to the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It is adverſity, ſaith an ancient Orator, that
reforms our Wills, that gives courage to the
cowardly, that conſtrains the obſtinate, that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the proud modeſty, which inſtructeth the
impious in vertue, which crowneth the juſt, and
puniſheth the wicked. <hi>Seneca</hi>

him, contributed to his
quiet, he thought he had loſt
his troubleſom buſineſs, not
his Goods, when they ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him of his Wealth, and that by a happy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
he had recovered his Liberty, in being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the care of preſerving his Riches: The
poor live ſecurely; and, as Fortune is not their
Landlady, they fear not her diſpleaſure. If a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
invade the neighbouring Countries, if he ſend
the Alarm into their Quarters, if he force the
Walls that ſurround them, they are not much
concerned, they know the Soldiers ſeek not for
them, and that that want which makes them
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64170:141"/>
unhappy, is their ſhelter from the purſuits of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers.
If they be baniſht from their Country,
and if, by a Power permitted by the Law of Arms
to Conquerors, they be forced to tranſplant, they
leave their Cottages without complaint, they ſeek
to get out, and not to carry away; and knowing
that the whole Earth is their Country, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
themſelves of finding every where ſufficient
to ſatisfie their needs.</p>
                  <p>Poverty is not inſupportable, but to them
that think it ſo, the imagination makes the
greateſt part of their Torments, men muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
by the noiſe of the people, to be ſenſible
of it, and be ignorant of neceſſitous content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to be afraid of their condition. If we
will take the pains to frequent the habitations of
the Poor, we ſhall ſee that there is nothing
frightful in them, but the name they bear; that
Joy covers the faces of moſt of their Gueſts,
that they diſpute tranquillity of mind with the
Rich, and that without being loaden with the
cares which diſturb the wealthy, they taſt Lifes
ſweetneſs with delight. But the rich are unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in the midſt of Pleaſures, Calamities beſet
them on all ſides, their Treaſures are their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
and as they get them by Labor, they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
them with Fear, and loſe them with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>But to make it appear, that Poverty hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vexatious, and that all its evil conſiſteth
purely in opinion; do we not ſee, that rich men
often imitate the poor, when they have a mind
to divert themſelves? That they appoint days, to
be entertained after their manner? That they lay
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64170:142"/>
aſide their Plate-Services for earthen Diſhes?
That they change their Goblets of Gold into
wooden Bowls? That they prefer the Work of
the Potter before the Art of the Goldſmith? And
that they ſet aſide the magnificence of their ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dwellings, to come and
divert themſelves in a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
Hut?<note place="margin">Dementes! hoc ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando concupiſcunt quod ſemper timent. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ibidem</hi> cap. 12.</note> Mean while theſe
unhappy men fly from Want,
they fear what they ſometimes
ſeek; and, by a blindneſs which ſhews their
infirmity, they abhor what in their Delights
they imitate. So much it is a truth, that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
is but an imaginary thing, that it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more terrible in it than the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of men, and that the incommodities that
attend it hurt not our Mind, but in proportion
to the wound they give to our imagination.
Sometimes one and the ſame cauſe produceth
different effects; and that which made poverty
odious, makes plenty a burthen. As it is of ſmall
importance, whether a ſick mans Bed be of Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or of Wood, and as his being often removed,
allays not his Grief; a man is as little ſatisfied
with Poverty as with Wealth, and becauſe he carries
his evil about him, there is no help for his miſery.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when any misfortune befalls us, let
us be aſſured, that the evil we reſent, is only an
effect of opinion, that it offends us becauſe we think
it doth, and that it afflicts our minds, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have ſuffered our imagination to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by it. If we are fallen into diſgrace, if
men have violently robbed us of our credit, or
good name, and if by the malice of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64170:142"/>
or the diſpleaſure of the Prince, we are
ſtript of our Dignities, let us remember that
we have no power over human things, that there
is a God above, who hath reſerved to himſelf the
Juriſdiction thereof, that we cannot be renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any longer than pleaſeth him, and that as
the Earth hath no pretenſions upon the day,
which by intervals enlightens it, we ought not
to promiſe our ſelves eternal advantages here,
ſince men may ſpoil us of them every moment.
Fortune doth not imitate Nature in her conduct:
as this perfecteth her Works by gradations, ſhe
brings them back by leiſurely motions to their
Principles: the Planets withdraw from their
Points at the ſame rate as they haſtened to them.
But that ſightleſs Dame doth often make us poor
at once; we loſe in one day that which coſt our
Anceſtors divers ages to acquire; and, as if ſhe
knew that we are all born equal, that Riches
fell unequally to our ſhares, that we ſtript our
Neighbours for our own accommodation, that we
have encreaſed them againſt the Laws of Nature,
ſhe caſts us violently into a ſtate of poverty, and
makes our condition equal to the meaneſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
on Earth. Though this method of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be a ſurprizal, yet is it in ſome ſort advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
to us: by wounding ſhe cures us, ſhe ſtifles
all our evils at once; and, as a skilful Chirurgion,
who nimbly draws an Arrow out of the Body, ſhe
carries away with our Goods the care of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and the apprehenſion of their loſs.</p>
                  <p>If the fire violently ravage our fields, if it burn
our houſes, and conſume all the ſubſtance we have
in them; we are to conſider, that this loſs happens
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64170:143"/>
to us by an univerſal cauſe, that this inſatiable Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
operates according to the matter it meets
with; and that it would be guilty of partiality, if
it ſhould ſpare our habitations, ſince it pays nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſpect to the Temples of God, nor to the
Pallaces of Kings. Let us repreſent to our ſelves,
that this burning is a forerunner of that fire which
is one day to devour the whole world, that this
Creature is enraged againſt us, that it is angry that
we uſe it as a ſlave, that we employ it in moſt of
our Arts: and that it is but juſt, we ſhould be
content to receive ſome damage from that which
affords us ſo many good ſervices. Let us perſwade
our ſelves, that the evil befell us by the ſecret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Heaven, that God ſends it to them that
leaſt think of it, and that the flames would never
deſtroy any houſes, if they were to ſtay for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the owners. As the fire is burning up our
dwellings, let us implore Heaven to conſume our
<hi>Paſſions.</hi> By the light of the flames let us behold the
vanity of temporal Goods, let us therein adore the
Hand that ſtrikes us, and which chaſtiſeth us in this
world, to ſpare us in the next.</p>
                  <p>If Death ſnatch away any of our friends; and,
by an innocent cruelty, deprive us of them we
loved moſt in the world, let us bear this ſeparation
with ſubmiſſion, let us be thankful to Providence,
that we had them ſo long; let us take her favors
in the beſt ſenſe, and not accuſe her of having
ſpoiled us, ſince ſhe could give as well as take; let
us remember that all things in Nature are ſubject
to decay, that men have yet brought forth nothing
immortal, and that the proudeſt of their works
laſted but a few years. Let us, by an ingenious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64170:143"/>
imagine, that our friends are abſent, and not
dead, that they have changed their abode, and not
their Country, that they are removed, but not
gone from us. Let us not be of the humor of thoſe
who love not their friends till they have loſt them;
and who, doubting of their own affections, have
recourſe to tears for their confirmation. If we judg
of a man by the more noble part of his compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we are aſſured, that thoſe we lament are not
dead, that their Souls live content; and that that
virtue which cauſed them to excel upon earth, hath

Mountains which diſtinguiſh
Kingdoms, and the Rivers
which ſurround their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
do not comprehend
their Territories: His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
are ſpread over all the Earth, he deemeth
that he is arrived in his own Country ſo often as
he is brought into another; and as by his mind he
poſſeſſeth all things, he perſwades himſelf to
be born in every place, into which Providence
hath caſt him. Who doth not laugh at thoſe
fools, that are faſtned with a ſtraw by the Leg to
a Table, who being tied to a Poſt, by a ſmall
thread, ſeem as immovable as if their Bodies
were loaden with Fetters and Shackles? And yet
we ſee ſome men agitated by the ſame Madneſs:
They are ſo much in love with their own Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Corners,
that they are not to be hauled
thence. They confine themſelves to a piece of
Earth, and like no Towns but thoſe they were
born in; and they would think themſelves thrown
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64170:145"/>
out of the World if they ſhould be forced into
freſh Quarters.</p>
                  <p>But forſaking the error of the multitude, whoſe
judgment, a falſe opinion hath diſordered, it
is not difficult to make appear, that Baniſhment
is to be borne, that it hath nothing more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than the noiſe of the World, that the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
may live contented, and that they ſuffer
nothing in Exile that is able to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.
We ſee ſome men voluntarily quit their
own to inhabit a foreign Country. The People
who fill the moſt ſtately City of <hi>Europe,</hi> are not
all born under one Hemiſphere, the moſt remote
parts contribute to her compoſition, Strangers
are not there leſs frequent than thoſe of the
Country: and if there were a general muſter of
the Occupants, I know not whether the number
of the Baniſhed would not exceed all that are
Natives of <hi>Rome.</hi> Either Delight or Profit is
the motive of this exchange of Air: Some come
thither for Traffick, others to hide their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
Some are perſwaded thither by the
deſire of acquiring Arts, and others by a vain
hope of heaping up Riches, or gaining of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
Ambitious men have ſought it as a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
whereon to expoſe their Vanities to view;
and we find no Nation of which ſome are not
very glad to change their Climate for that of this
Worlds Paradiſe. But go out of this City,
which is the common Country of all thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
paſs into the other Towns, which have not
her Fame nor Delights: Sum up the Inhabitants,
and you ſhall find, that the greater number are
Strangers, that their Language is different from
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64170:146"/>
that which they learnt in their Infancy, that
intereſt tempted them to remove; and that by
a humour which ſeemeth ſtrange, they often aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a pleaſant Air to ſeek an Iron or a Brazen
Sky.</p>
                  <p>Our Country is that place where we live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
our felicity depends
on us,<note place="margin">Patria eſt ubicunque bene eſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

us our Vertue, which ought to make all our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>A Priſon ſeemeth to have ſomething more
vexations than Baniſhment:
For beſides that this deprives
us of the advantages of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Tempus quo quis debet eſſe in carcere, compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur in tempore quo quit debet eſſe in exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio. Lib. 23. Cod. de poen.</note>
that it is the general
Reſidence of Darkneſs, that
it ſhuts out the Sun Beams,
and that the light enters not
but at the Grates and ſighing holes; it debars us
of Liberty, it tumbleth us alive into the Grave,
and makes us as Exiles in the midſt of our own
Country. The Lawyers confound Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Exile, and put no difference between
the time that we ſpend in the Dungeon, and
that which is waſted in Baniſhment. Mean
while that which makes others unfortunate, is
no incommodity to a Wiſe man: His mind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuffers reſtraint; and as he lives content in
Solitude, he remains at liberty in Priſon. The
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64170:146"/>
Walls which encloſe his Body, the Chains by
which he is faſtned to a corner of the Goal, cannot
limit his Soul: He is free whileſt his Companion
is a Slave, and without clearing the Gates that
encloſe him, he takes his advantage to eſcape in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all parts of the World. As in his freedom
he loaths Voluptuouſneſs, he laughs at Pain in
Servitude; and he careth little into what place
they put him, ſince he demands not to have his
Portion here upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>That which afflicts the weak, and makes a
Priſon ſo odious to perſons of honour, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is infamous, becauſe it paſſeth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of Men, for Satans habitation, the abode of
evil Spirits, where his family recides, and that
letting the innocent go free, they fancy that none
but the unfortunate and miſerable are there left
behind. But all theſe words ought not to affright
us: for if we be true Chriſtians, let us go in bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let us prepare our ſelves to fight with a Tyrant
even in his own houſe, and to trample under foot
an Uſurper, who is not leſs an Enemy to the Juſt,
than to the wicked. If the hole into which we are
thruſt, be the Poſſeſſion of Darkneſs, let our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
ſerve us for a Light; let our Patience bruiſe
the Fetters, let our inward ſweet ſmell expel the
Stenches of the place, and let our innocence tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over the rigour of the Goalers. We trade
well when we gain by our Commerce, when our
profits exceed our loſſes; and when adventuring
ſome vain pleaſures of this life, we exchange them
for ſolid and eternal Joys. It is really true, that
the Guard about us, thoſe Fetters with which
they load our Bodies, and the Dungeons in which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64170:147"/>
they bury us alive, are advantageous to us, they
attract us from the Earth, they are the Ladders
by which our thoughts climbe into Heaven, they
give us there the contemplation of Divine things,
and inſenſibly pour into us Charity, with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
They do what Providence daily performs
in the World; and as ſhe gives ceſſation to the
labours of Mortals by the ſweet refreſhments of
night, they allay our miſeries by the conſideration
of the rewards they work for us. In fine, a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
reſtoreth to the Soul that which by violence
it takes from the Body: The liberty of the one
ariſeth from the ſervitude of the other, as it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
our ſufferings, it begins our health: and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
us of the delights of the Earth, it leaves us
only the deſires of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But if the Priſoners be not attended with all
comforts, yet ought they not to be much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
A Priſon hath nothing but what may be
born with; if it have its Shame, it hath alſo its
Glory, and if it have incommodities that cauſe it
to be hated, it hath advantages which have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it deſirable. Some Philoſophers have made it
the habitation of the Muſes, they ſtiled it a Wiſe
mans retirement; there they compoſed the moſt
Excellent of their Works, and as if it had been
a Schoole, they there taught their Diſciples Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
unfortunate men Conſtancy, and their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors
Mercy; it was there that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
the Square of the Circle, by which he put
the greateſt Artiſts to a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> and proved by
Reaſon what they could never demonſtrate by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
It was there that <hi>Boetius</hi> writ his Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by which he ſhews, that it is God that ſends
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64170:147"/>
afflictions, that Philoſophy is a proper Remedy,
and that that which came from ſo juſt a Hand,
could not be offenſive, but to ſuch as were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of reward. It was there that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
preached the Goſpel, that he writ the greateſt part
of his Epiſtles, that he confuted both the Jews
and the Gentiles, and proved to all the World,
that we cannot enter into Glory but through the
ſtraight Gate of affliction. In fine, it is there that
we may learn to be ſober, to be contented with
what we have, to retrench our ſelves of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things, to contemn Earthly benefits, and by a
generous violence, to prepare for thoſe Manſions,
where the unfortunate ſhall be happy, the innocent
at reſt, and the Captives free.</p>

that the Pleaſure we taſt in it is

of human Felicity is always attended with

have their defects, the moſt enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their miſts, the moſt innocent their faults,
and the moſt couragious their weakneſſes, it muſt
not be wondered, that Vice doth ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us in its appearance, and that, aſſuming
a proportion of its contrary qualities, it needs
only a little outward ſhew to repreſent it ſelf
glorious; we magnifie Ambition becauſe ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
Generoſity, becauſe ſhe deſpiſeth Dangers,
affronteth Death, and, to gain a piece of Earth,
makes little of all thoſe laborious toyls which
give exerciſe to Valor. We eſteem Prodigality,
becauſe it oppoſeth Covetouſneſs, becauſe it claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
kindred of Liberality, and gives largely
without hope of reward. We pay reverence to
the Diſſimulation of Politicians, becauſe it hath
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64170:148"/>
an affinity with Prudence, becauſe it hides our
Deſigns, covers our Anger, and waits for the
day of Vengeance. We honour Compaſſion,
becauſe it reſembles Charity, becauſe ſhe takes
the Priſoners out of the Dungeon, comforts the
diſtreſſed; and without any conſideration of their
merits relieves equally the innocent and the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
All the Orators have given her Elogies:
they make her the Vertue of Princes, they have
lifted up her head above her Companions, and
do aſſure us, that if Valor and Juſtice made Kings
great, it was Compaſſion that
rendred them worthy of our
admiration.<note place="margin">Nulla de Virtutibus tuis plurimis nec gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior nec admirabilior miſericordia tua.

and if your Fortune have not
any thing to preſent you more
glorious than the Command

you with a more excellent Gift, than a Will to

                  <p>Although this Vertue be ſo fair in her out-ſide

without a renunciation of humanity, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſhe ceaſeth not to be found guilty of great
defects, and to paſs for a Vice in the <hi>Stoick</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
For as theſe generous Philoſophers ſtrip
their wiſe man of all the maladies of his Soul,
they allow not that other mens misfortunes ſhould
be his miſeries: they will have him as little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Neighbours afflictions as for his own
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64170:149"/>
diſaſters: They will have him to be fortune
proof; and that that which diſcompoſeth others,
ſhould teach him Conſtancy, and an even temper,
What, ſay they, doth Vertue conſiſt in infirmity?
Muſt we be guilty of effeminacy, to perform Acts
of Generoſity? Can we not be charitable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being afflicted? And can we not relieve thoſe
that are in miſery, unleſs we mingle our Sighs
with their Sobs and Groans,<note place="margin">Vere enim aegritudo, nec longè à miſeriis eſt quisquis miſeretur. <hi>Lipſ.</hi> 2. de conſt.</note>
and our Cries with their
Tears? A wiſe may ought
to conſider the Poor for their
Relief, and not himſelf to
ſhare in their Calamities; he ought to protect
them from oppreſſions, and not to be inwardly
diſturbed for them; he ought to endeavour their
comfort, and not to be a Partner in their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
                  <p>But as this Notion ſeemeth ſomewhat ſtrange
to them that know not the <hi>Stoick</hi> Sentiments, to
apprehend it well, we muſt ſuppoſe with <hi>Seneca,</hi>
That compaſſion is a compoſition of two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
parts, whereof one regards the Calamity to
relieve it, and the other to take a ſhare of the
ſuffering. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> reject the ſecond to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the firſt; They ſay that Pity is unworthy of
a man of Courage, they call it the vice of effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
perſons, and do declare, that they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſad without derogating from the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Mind: and that they muſt reſolve to be
miſerable, if other Mens misfortunes may as well
pierce their Heart as their Eyes. As we judge of
the weakneſs of theſe, when they water at the
ſight of others that have ſore eyes: as it is not ſo
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64170:149"/>
much a chearfulneſs of Spirit as an infirmity of
Body, to laugh with all that laugh, and to gape
every time that another opens his Mouth. Pity is
a badg of weakneſs, and we muſt be of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Women, not to be able to look upon
other mens troubles, without
being aſſaulted by it our
ſelves.<note place="margin">Non miſerebitur ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, ſed ſuccurret, ſed proderit: at illa facit tranquillam mentem vultu ſuo. <hi>Sen.</hi> 2. de Clem.</note> Therefore when a
Wiſe man giveth Alms, when
he ſaves a man from Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
when he hoſpitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the baniſhed into his
Houſe; he preſerves ſtill the ſame tranquility of
Mind; he is ſeen to be as little diſturbed when he
helps the diſtreſſed, as when he rebukes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
and chaſtiſeth the guilty. He accoſts them
without trouble, he comforts them with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he relieves them by his Liberality; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his grieving can do them no good, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draws money out of his Purſe, than tears from
his Eyes.</p>
                  <p>If Compaſſion be ſordid when ſhe renders
other mens misfortunes her own, Envy is infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
when ſhe makes her own Torment of other
mens Proſperity: and as we may not excuſe the
firſt by reaſon of her weakneſs, we cannot but
condemn the ſecond, becauſe of her injuſtice.
Vices do at ſometimes tickle us, they often ſteal
into the ſeat of vertue, and ſome of them are ſo
diſguiſed, that hardly we can know them from
their Contraries. Profuſion ſeems ſo becoming in
Monarchs, that we make no difficulty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
it with Liberality, Cruelty is often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with the Robe of Juſtice: Compaſſion is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64170:150"/>
ſo tender hearted, that ſhe is hardly to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Clemency, and as ſhe bears all her marks,
ſhe is not afraid to pretend to her praiſes; but En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
is always opprobrious, Vertue is her torment,
the moſt innocent feel her fury, ſhe dares not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the eyes of men, and as ſhe cannot conceal
her Malice, ſhe is forced to
ſeek darkneſs to hide her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
and diſcontents.<note place="margin">Invidia eſt odium ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enae felicitatis: reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu inferiorum, ne ſibi aequentur, reſpectu pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, quia ſibi aequan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Auguſt. in Serm.</note>
As if ſhe were animated againſt
the whole Race of Mankind,
ſhe maks war againſt all men;
and without diſtinguiſhing
their merits, ſhe ſets both upon the perfect, and
the leſs accompliſhed: She oppoſeth the moſt
eminent, becauſe ſhe cannot arrive to their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
ſhe perſecuteth her equals, becauſe they
reprove her Covetouſneſs and Pride; and ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes
her inferiours, as having an apprehenſion
of their happy Succeſſors. But though ſhe be an
Enemy to all the Vertues, yet ſhe exerciſeth her
fury particularly againſt the more Noble, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the Scorpions, who ſting moſt fiercely
when the Sun is moſt hot and clear; ſhe aſſaults
thoſe which have the greateſt Luſtre and Glory.
From thence it comes that Tyrants hate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
of their Heirs, that they fear the Valour of
their Commanders, that they dread the prudence
of their Miniſters, and apprehend the Puiſſance
of their friends. They think themſelves contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the praiſes of their inferiours; they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that the Commendations given to them is an
abatement of their own Grandeur, and they are
afraid of Deſigns to ſupplant them, every time men
ſpeak in their favour.</p>

But if Monarchs unwillingly ſuffer vertuous
perſons, the Subjects do not leſs envy their
Princes advantages: Conſpiracy is not always an
effect of their evil Government, it more often
proceeds from the Malice of the People, than
from the Tyranny of Kings; and their inacceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
is oft times the only cauſe of their ruine.
<hi>Socrates</hi> loſt not his Life but for being too Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
His integrity made all his Crimes, and the
<hi>Athenians</hi> would not at this day be accuſed of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put the wiſeſt man of their Commonwealth
to death, if Envy had not furniſhed them with
Arms to take him out of the way. But as no
Crime goes unpuniſhed, Envy finds her Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in her ſelf; ſhe drinks the greateſt ſhare of
her own poyſon; and to make her miſerable, we
need but leave her to her own fury. All other Vices
propoſe to themſelves ſome advantage, and though
it be never any thing but ſhew, it ceaſeth not to
give vigour to their purſuits; but Envy looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
good to afflict her ſelf, ſhe rejoyceth not but
in other mens harms, and by a blindneſs proper to
Avarice, ſhe meaſures her own Riches by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of her Neighbours, and her own wants by
their Treaſures. If a Paſſion be never ſo violent,
it laſteth not always, it ceaſeth after a time, and
often finds its ſuffocation in the cauſe that gave it
birth. Anger takes her eaſe after ſhe hath tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us a while, Pleaſure becomes our Pain, when
its Charms have tired us; Gluttony is wearied in
much feaſting; and our Soul hath not any faculty,
which admits not a Truce after a Combate: But
Envy is always in motion, ſhe laſts as long as her
cauſe; and what efforts ſoever we uſe to ſweeten
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64170:151"/>
her, ſhe is not to be cured but by the Death of the
Author.</p>
                  <p>From all theſe Diſcourſes it is eaſie to conclude,
that Grief is not natural, ſince ſhe is ſo ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited,
ſince ſhe doth not equally affect all men;
ſince ſhe is partial in Poverty, effeminate in Pity,
infamous in Envy, dejected, or inſolent in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
He that embraceth the motions of ſo dark
a Paſſion, may aſſure himſelf to be never happy,
and as the moſt innocent are attended by injuſtice,
we are not to expect any moral good ſervice from
them.</p>
