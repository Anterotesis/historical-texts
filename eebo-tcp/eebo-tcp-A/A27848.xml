            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that reads the
enſuing Tract, will
ſoon find that much
of the beginning of
it is by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to the Subject-matter
<pb facs="tcp:51158:3"/>
of the Book, and might well (if
not better) have paſt under the
Title of <hi>A Preface,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might have excuſed this: in
which I ſhall endeavour to ſhew
the Grounds and Reaſons that
put me upon this Argument; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
all Objections that may
he made againſt the Author, for
being a Sanguinary Perſon, in
treating ſo poſitively upon this
Subject; ſhew the neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the Law herein, in
point of practice by <hi>Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
in Caſes of Blood; give ſome
ſatisfaction to ſuch as may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
againſt the length of it,
whereas the Queſtion is ſo ſhort;
explain the <hi>Grand Jurors</hi> Oath;
and laſtly, endeavour to remove
all Difficulties made by them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſaid Oath.</p>
            <p>Two Reaſons principally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me to this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking;
The one was, The great Conteſts
and Differences I have too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
obſerved between the <hi>Judges</hi>
and <hi>Grand Jurors</hi> about finding
<pb facs="tcp:51158:3"/>
of Bills in Caſes of Blood,
whereby the whole matter of
Fact, with all its Circumſtances,
might receive its full diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Court, and not in a <hi>Grand
Juries</hi> Chamber; the <hi>Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
(as if they were Judges
both of the Law and the Fact,
which is ſufficiently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the enſuing Diſcourſe they
are of neither) finding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
ſometimes Manſlaughter,
when they ſhould find it Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
contrary to the ſenſe and
direction of the Learned Judge,
and of the King's Council, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a Murtherer many times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon was, That
if the Law were not determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this point, betwixt the
<hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Grand Jurors,</hi> the
Conſequence muſt needs be, That
<hi>Grand Jurors</hi> (that hear but one
ſide) would in the end take the
matter of Fact from the Second
Jury, that are proper Judges of
it, and ſhould try it; and the
<pb facs="tcp:51158:4"/>
matter of Law from the Learned
Judge, that ſhould give the
Judgment of Law upon it; and
this is ſo plainly proved in the
enſuing Diſcourſe, and hath been
ſo often in practice, that I know
nothing can be ſaid againſt it.</p>
            <p>Peradventure ſome may ſay, <hi>Sure
he that wrote this Book is</hi> Vir
Sanguinis, <hi>that deſires ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Juſtice againſt every man
that kills another man unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that he muſt be Indicted
of Murther.</hi> Certainly this is a
very great miſtake, which a
conſiderate Reader, or one that
delights not in ſpilling of Blood,
cannot be guilty of; here is no
more deſired or intended, but
that every Perſon that hath had
his Hands in Innocent Blood,
receive a full and a legal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
according to the Laws of
the Land, and the Liberty of a
Subject, to be tried at the King's
Suit. And I know no Kingdom
or Nation in the World, whoſe
Subjects have a fairer, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial,
<pb facs="tcp:51158:4"/>
and indifferent Trial
in ſuch Caſes, than the Subjects
of <hi>England</hi> have; who, except
(as I have ſhewed) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their own Accuſers, muſt
be accuſed by a <hi>Grand Jury,</hi>
and convicted or acquitted by
another; and afterwards (if
guilty) receive Judgment from
a Learned and Merciful Judge,
according to the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>I know by the Law of God,
amongſt the Jews there was
a certain Inſtitution, which we
call <hi>Lex Talionis, An Eye for
an Eye, a Tooth for a Tooth,
Life for Life;</hi> and that there
were Modifications and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
to abate the extremity
of it, in ſeveral Caſes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
as I have ſhewed there,
is by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
parallel to them: This is ſo
far from being Sanguinary, that
I conceive it would rather
prove a Remedy, than a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
rather prevent ſhedding
of Blood, than occaſion it; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:51158:5"/>
be <hi>Lex Praeveniens,</hi> than
<hi>Puniens.</hi> And certainly, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
oppoſeth this Opinion, and
propoſeth a milder and lighter
way of Trial againſt one that
hath had his Hands in the Blood
of his Fellow Creature, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
himſelf avoid the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Sanguinary Perſon.
This way propoſed, will prevent
that evil practice (too much u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
of labouring and packing
<hi>Grand Jurors,</hi> in point of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
when they are aſſured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that all Accuſations, by <hi>Grand
Jurors,</hi> for the unlawful kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a Reaſonable Creature,
muſt be Murther. It would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
very much to the diſpatch
of the Buſineſs in Court, and
be a great eaſe to <hi>Grand Jurors,</hi>
that now ſpend very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
time in Queſtions about
the Law, in ſuch Caſes, which
were better ſpent in examining
the Fact, and leaving the matter
of Law to the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51158:5"/>
Concerning the neceſſity of this
point to be determined, he is a
Stranger to the Engliſh Laws,
and to the Engliſh Nation,
that over-looks the juſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Conſequence thereof; there
being nothing in this enſuing
Tract aſſerted, but what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
(as I conceive) to
the Statute, and Common Laws
of this Kingdom, the beſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Practice, and the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all the Learned Judges,
(at whoſe Feet I have had the
happineſs to ſit many years,
both before the late Civil Wars,
and ſince the happy Reſtauration
of our moſt Gracious Soveraign)
and agreeable to ſound Reaſon,
the fulleſt and beſt Diſquiſition
after Innocent Blood.</p>
            <p>And who can but allow the
neceſſity of it, as to the Engliſh
Nation at preſent,<note place="margin">Duellum, quaſi duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum bellum.</note> when
Duels are ſo frequent
in <hi>England;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Done without Authority, is a war against Authority.</note> it being
made matter of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
for one <hi>Hector</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51158:6"/>
(as they call him) to kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if it be but for not pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Health, or ſomething that
looks like an Affront to his
<hi>Miſs,</hi> in placing her at

the Tavern, or
the like; and this muſt
not only engage the two
differing Parties (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity)
to ſacrifice their
own Lives,<note place="margin">Infoelix pugna, ubi majus periculum incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit victori quam victo.</note> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two Seconds, or
more, Perſons of as equal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to loſe their Lives in the
Conflict, or by the Law, (if
Death enſue to any of them)
in which Conteſt they are no
more concerned, than to ſecond
their Friend, and with their
own lives to juſtifie the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
between the two differing
Parties, as if both of them
had a good Cauſe, and were in
the right, when as ſometimes the
Occaſion is ſo trivial, not fit for
two Boys to diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51158:6"/>
As to what may be Objected
to the length of this Tract, I
have only this to ſay, That it
is no more than I have accuſed
my ſelf for, and did endeavour
to have abſtracted and omitted
much of it; but when I began
to do it, I was overcome by
theſe Conſiderations, That it was
the firſt Eſſay of this kind that
had been written as a Book;
That it was not like to meet with
all Readers of like Capacities;
ſome perhaps might gather much
out of a little, whereas others
would gather but a little out of
much, and the whole not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hours reading, which might
be worſe ſpent, and therefore
was willing to leave it, as I
had firſt framed it, although I
expoſed my ſelf to be cenſured for
it.</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>Grand Jurors</hi> put
ſo great an Obligation upon the
Oath they take as <hi>Grand Jurors,</hi>
and from that (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
frame ſo ſtrong an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb facs="tcp:51158:7"/>
That they are ſworn to
preſent all ſuch things and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as ſhall be given them in
charge; and that the Judges u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually,
in their charges, dilate
and declare the Law, as to all
the ſeveral Species and Degrees
of Murther, Manſlaughter, &amp;c.
what every unlawful killing of
a man is in Law, according to
the ſeveral Circumſtances of the
Fact: and therefore they, as
<hi>Grand Jurors,</hi> are bound by their
Oath to obſerve the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of every Fact before them,
what it is in Law as well as
in Fact, and ſo preſent to the
Court both the Law and the
Fact (<hi>Judice inconſulto</hi>). This
being the greateſt Objection that
I have heard from any of them
againſt what is here Aſſerted;
although ſomething is ſaid, as
to this Objection, in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſcourſe, I ſhall here add
ſomething more, to clear the
point, and anſwer fully that
Objection, by ſetting down the
<pb facs="tcp:51158:7"/>
Oath of a <hi>Grand Juror, in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
as alſo the Oath of a
<hi>Juror</hi> of Life and Death, and
explain them both:<note n="†" place="margin">The Oath of a Grand Juror.</note> 
               <hi>You ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
inquire, and true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
make of all ſuch things
and matters as ſhall be given

but the truth: So help you God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place you ſee by the
Oath, they are ſworn to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in their Inquiry, not to be
ſloathful or negligent, being
quickned by their Oath: this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb facs="tcp:51158:8"/>
is to be exerciſed in an
Inquiry, and this Inquiry is to
be made amongſt themſelves, in
what they know of their own
knowledge, or ſhall be brought
unto them by the Teſtimony of
others. As to the matter of
their Inquiry, which next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in the Oath, and from
which they frame their main
Objection, (<hi>viz.) all ſuch things
and matters as ſhall be given
them in charge:</hi> theſe words are
general (<hi>things and matters</hi>) and
certainly, in the cleareſt Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
are intended the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heads of all Offences by them
Inquirable; As all Murthers, and
that comprehends all manner of
unlawful killing: All Felonies,
and that comprehends all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſtealing; and ſo of other
general Heads of Offences here
Inquirable, as Perjuries, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
Miſdemeanours, &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Learned Judge (where
he hath time and leiſure) doth
in his Charge, when he ſpeaks
<pb facs="tcp:51158:8"/>
of Murther, declare the
ſeveral Species and Differences
in that Offence by Law; and ſo
of Felony, the ſeveral manners
of Felonies, ſimple and compound.
And ſo of other Offences, the
words of the Oath ſo much
inſiſted upon by them do no way
oblige them by reaſon of ſuch
a Charge, to determine (by
their preſentment) every nicety
in Law, that may ariſe upon
every Fact before them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than in that form and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(according to the nature of
the Caſe) the Court and the
King's Council have framed and
preſented it to their Inquiry,
where the ſingle Fact of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
killing another, &amp;c. by the
hands of ſuch a one, is proved
unto them ſo far, as in their
Judgments it is fit matter of
Accuſation, to bring the whole
matter of Fact, and all that
may depend upon it, to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and more full examination
(as is more fully manifeſted in
<pb facs="tcp:51158:9"/>
the enſuing diſcourſe) for ſhould
the Judge only give them general
heads of Offences in charge (as
he well may, and many times
doth) without diſtinguiſhing the
ſeveral kinds of them, the <hi>Grand
Jurors</hi> would then want a ground
for this Objection; beſides I have
ever taken it, that not only that
which is orally delivered unto
them by the Judge, but that alſo
that is delivered unto them from
the Judge in writing, to be by
them enquired of, is part of their
charge, and that is every <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that is preſented unto them,
or other matter in Writing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Court to their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>The Juſtices in Eyre, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
were Itinerant over the
Kingdom (in whoſe rooms theſe
Learned Judges ſucceed) ever
giving their charge, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was enquirable by the <hi>Grand
Jurors</hi> in writing; which if ſo
underſtood (as I know not how it
will be avoided) they are then
<pb facs="tcp:51158:9"/>
by their Oath, to preſent all ſuch
things as ſhall be given them in
charge, and ſo every Indictment
of Murther delivered by the Court
unto them, is to be found by them,
where (as hath been often ſaid)
the unlawful killing is ſo far
proved unto them as to make up
an Accuſation. Then it follows
in the Oath [<hi>The Kings Counſel,
their Fellows, and their own they
ſhall keep ſecret;</hi>] By the <hi>Kings
Counſel,</hi> is to be underſtood any
directions the Judge ſhall in Court
give unto them in any matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; as alſo the Evidence
of Witneſſes, that ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to them on the Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
in any fact (for no other
Witneſſes muſt be heard by them)
and likewiſe ſuch Counſellors
learned in the Law as ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the matter on the Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
(for no other Council is to
be heard by them againſt the Bill)
none of this muſt be revealed or
diſcovered by the <hi>Grand Jurors,</hi>
but faithfully kept ſecret accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:51158:10"/>
to their Oath from the party
concerned, his friends, and all
others, except the Court demand
any queſtion from them upon their
Evidence; ſo likewiſe muſt they
<hi>keep their Fellow Jurors Counſel,
and their own,</hi> that is, they are not
to diſcover what any one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have together counſelled,
adviſed, or debated, in the buſineſs
before them againſt ſuch a perſon.
They are the Kings great Council
upon this account, and all ſuch
great Councils where the King is
ſo much concerned, take an Oath
of Secrecy, for otherwiſe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
ſuch Counſels, a Traytor,
a Murtherer, and the greateſt
Felon may eſcape, to the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
of King and Kingdom;
and this offence in ancient time
was holden for Treaſon or Felony.
In <hi>George</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Anno</hi> 27.<note place="margin">Stamf. fol. 36. 27. lib. Aſſ.</note> 
               <hi>lib.
Aſſ.</hi> upon his Indictment was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted;
but the Lo. <hi>Coke</hi> in his
<hi>third Inſtitutes fol.</hi> 107. ſays, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that ſuch diſcovery is
accompanied with Perjury, and a
<pb facs="tcp:51158:10"/>
great Miſpriſion to be puniſhed by
Fine and Impriſonment.</hi> And it
is well provided by the Oath, that
each Juror is ſworn to keep his
own Counſel alſo; for he that will
not keep his own ſecrets, will
hardly keep anothers.</p>
            <p>So much for the matter of the
Oath, what they are to do; It
follows in the Oath, with what
Integrity they ought to do their
duty, <hi>They are to preſent no
perſon for any offence, through
any malice they have to the
perſon, nor omit any meerly for
any favour they have for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi>
This is ſo plain, it needs
nothing but practice; theſe two
ſeem very eaſie, but indeed are
very difficult to fleſh and blood,
Not to take revenge when one
hath power to do it, and not to
ſhew favour when there is power
and opportunity to expreſs it;
not but that a Grand Juror may
preſent another he is at difference
withal, if there be a real and
true cauſe for it, but it muſt not
<pb facs="tcp:51158:11"/>
be done from malice, and by way
of revenge, in preſenting ſuch a
perſon, before another as guilty.
<hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> (two great
enemies to Juſtice) are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
all Courts of Juſtice, as
too partial; and therefore the
Oath well concludes, <hi>That they
ſhall preſent the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth:</hi>
all theſe three expreſſions of <hi>truth</hi>
have relation to the fact of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or unlawful killing (for I
ſhall in this place apply it to that
Offence) in a legal ſenſe, as to
legal proceedings; <hi>The truth,</hi>
that is, Truth ſufficient to make
an accuſation againſt a nocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<hi>The whole truth,</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
any part of it wilfully,
but ſo preſenting it, that the whole
matter of fact concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
killing another may come
in queſtion to another Jury, which
cannot be unleſs it be found Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the Common Law account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all felonious and unlawful
killing a reaſonable Creature <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51158:11"/>
until the difference and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
appear upon the Verdict
of another Jury, that are to try it,
and the Judgment of the Court in
point of Law upon that Verdict.

where there is nothing of the fact

is cleared by the laſt words of the

be underſtood, skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

            </p>
            <p>And thus have I, according to
my beſt ſenſe and underſtanding of
the Oath, explained it, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the common Objection to
it, by making it appear, that
there is nothing in the Oath that
any way obligeth them againſt
what I have either here, or in
the enſuing diſcourſe, adviſed
them unto. And that this may
yet be more evident (becauſe I
would make it as plain as I can,
though with too many Tautologies
and Repetitions) I ſhall alſo <hi>in
terminis</hi> ſet down the Oath of
the <hi>Jurors</hi> of Life and Death,
<pb facs="tcp:51158:13"/>
by which it doth appear, that
they only ſtand charged with the
Priſoner (as it is expreſt in the
Oath) and the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> only
with the Accuſation againſt him;
[<hi>You ſhall well and truly try, and
true deliverance make between
our Sovereign Lord the King
and the Priſoner at the Bar
(whom you ſhall have in Charge)
and a true Verdict give accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your Evidence; So help
you God.</hi>] Which is to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
and legally drawn up in
the nature of a Declaration at
Law at the Kings ſuit, the King
being Plaintiff and the Priſoner
Defendant, which the Priſoner
upon his Arraignment either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
and then he is convicted
without hearing of any Evidence
againſt him, or otherwiſe pleads
<hi>Not guilty</hi> to it, to which the
King (by the Clerk of the Crown)
joyns Iſſue by <hi>Cul prit,</hi> viz. <hi>that
he is ready to prove him guilty;</hi>
and ſo the Iſſue being thus joyned,
Evidence for the King is given
<pb facs="tcp:51158:13"/>
againſt him upon Oath, to which
he makes his defence in
perſon, or by<note n="*" place="margin">If he have Council, he muſt pray it before he plead <hi>Not guilty,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not after. 3. <hi>Inſt. fol.</hi> 129.</note> Council
(if any point of Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
to which he deſires
Council, and the Court
approve of it, the Judge being as
well of Council for the Priſoner
as the King) calls his Witneſſes
(if he have any) who ſpeak upon
their Credits, and not upon their
Oaths, which is much for the
advantage of the Priſoner, the
Law preſuming (in favour of
life) the Affirmative proof to be
ſo clear againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
that nothing in the
<note n="†" place="margin">And that is one reaſon why regularly he cannot have Council. The ſecond reaſon is, the Court ought to ſee the Indictment, Trial, and other proceedings good in Law, leſt by an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Judgment they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint the Priſoner. 3. <hi>Inst. 137. fol.</hi> 29.</note> Negative can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(upon Oath) againſt
it; and after a full trial
of what can be ſaid and
proved on both ſides, and
a convenient time taken
by the Jury to conſider
of it, they bring in their
Verdict, either convict him or
acquit him; either find him
guilty according to the Indictment
<pb facs="tcp:51158:14"/>
found by the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one ſide, or ſpecially as
they find the fact by hearing of
both ſides; for they are not bound
ſtrictly to the matter and form
of the Indictment, as the <hi>Grand
Jury</hi> have found it, for they may
by Law extenuate it to the leaſt
degree of offence, that can be in
that kind, but they cannot aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
it, or exceed above what
the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> have found; for
if they might do ſo, they would
become Accuſers as well as Tryers,
which would be againſt the Laws
and liberty of the Subject: And
therefore the <hi>Grand Jurors</hi> have
the greater reaſon, to enlarge in
their Declaration or Accuſation
for the King (as in all
Declarations at Law is
uſual) as far as the Law
will heighten all offences
in Blood,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Secta pacis</hi> is by Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the King's Suit, and as it were his Declaration.

               <pb facs="tcp:51158:14"/>
Now upon what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Book, I am not ignorant how
much I have ſubjected my ſelf

for their King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
it is an honour to ſerve; And
I hope it will be no diſhonour nor
indignity to any of them to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

how they may with the

through an Enquiry after Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

called unto it, and leave nothing
therein (of this Crying Sin) to be
repented of, that it was not fully
Enquired of by them, that ſo

keep themſelves ſecure from the
guilt of Innocent blood.</p>

I doubt not but it will meet
with ſome Readers ſo poſſeſſed

            <p>I am very certain, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

I ſhall briefly ſhew, That it is
the duty of all Grand Jurors, in all
Caſes of blood, touching the death
of any reaſonable creature, by

violence, or by the hand or act of
any other reaſonable Creature,

brought unto them for Murther,
in caſe they find, upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
any probability that the
perſon ſaid to be killed in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
was ſlain by the perſon
charged to do it in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
to put <hi>Billa vera</hi> to that
Indictment, without forecloſing
the Court, by judging amongſt
themſelves the points of Law that
may ariſe in that caſe, as whether it
be Murther, Manſlaughter, at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, or upon the Statute
<hi>Se def. per Infortunium,</hi> Juſtifiable,
or otherwiſe; none of theſe ſpecial
matters being to be found by them
that are but Inquiſitors and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers
for the King; not tryers of
the offence, hearing but Witneſſes
on one ſide, and whoſe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or verdict, is not final, but
muſt be put to Iſſue betwixt the
King and the party to be tried by
another Jury, whether there be
truth in it or no, whatever the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51158:24"/>
practice of Grand Jurors hath been
(of late) to the contrary; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief aim and deſign of

            <p>I have not met with any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

there is none amongſt Heathens,
or rational Creatures, but believe,
whatever their practices are to the
contrary, that the ſhedding of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
bloud is a great offence, a
crying ſin. To take away the life
of a Plant, is but the vigour in the
juyce; and the life of a Beaſt, is
but the vigour in the bloud; but
the life of a Man is a<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 9. 4.</note> 
               <hi>ſpirit,</hi>
and ſpiritual ſubſtance, the breath
of God breathed into him, and not
to be extinguiſhed unjuſtly by the
hand of man. Certainly,
<hi>vox ſanguinis eſt vox cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantis,</hi>
it is one of the
four ſins<note n="s" place="margin">Sunt vox clamorum, vox ſanguinis &amp; <hi>Sodomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> vox oppreſſorum, vierces detenta laborum.</note> that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
calls, <hi>Clamantia
Peccata,</hi> Crying Sins, that cry
to God for vengeance (even in this
world) upon the Manſlayer. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the Floud God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51158:25"/>
commanded, that blood unjuſtly
ſhed ſhould be required by the
Magiſtrate of the Manquiller. It
is within the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of
God himſelf, and by an Act of
Parliament made in Heaven, never
to be repealed, It is enacted, that
<hi>he that ſheds mans blood, by man
ſhall his blood be ſhed. At the hand
of every mans Brother will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the life of man,</hi> ſays God
himſelf<note n="t" place="margin">Solus Deus qui vitam dat vitae eſt Dominus; nec poteſt quiſquam eam juste aufer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re niſi Deus, vel gerens au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem Dei, ut Judex. <hi>And this was the reaſon, that amongſt Chriſtians it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Lord to kill his Villain.</hi>
               </note>. God many times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> and other
ſatisfactions in other Felonies, but
never in caſe of blood; for, <hi>who
can make ſatisfaction for the life of
a Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Murtherer that we
read of was the Devil, who the
Scripture ſays, <hi>was a Murtherer
from the beginning; in quantum
traxit in peccatum,</hi> in drawing our
Firſt Parents into ſin, and ſo to
death. The next that we read of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51158:25"/>
(for the Devil would not be long
before he had tempted more to
his own ſin) was <hi>Cain,</hi> that kill'd
his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deſperately ſhed much of his
blood in many parts of his body,
for the word is in the Plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>vox Sanguinum,</hi> the voice of
his <hi>Bloods;</hi> or, becauſe the Bloods
of the future poſterity of <hi>Abel</hi>
(that he might have had) were
ſhed in him, by the Murther of
<hi>Cain.</hi> It is true that <hi>Cain</hi>'s blood
was not ſhed by that Law, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he kill'd his Brother, the
World being not then peopled,
nor that Law then ſo poſitively
given by God, and the example
and terrour to others could not
then be ſo great (which is oft the
great end of puniſhment, <hi>ut poena
ad paucos metus ad omnes perve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat;</hi>)
and therefore <hi>Cain</hi> was to
ſurvive by God's ſpecial appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not by any favour of God
towards him, but that he might
have Gods mark (as a Murtherer)
upon him, to the Terrour of all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51158:26"/>
others that ſhould ſee him. What
viſible mark and diſtinction this
was, is but conjectured at; ſome
think it was a horrible ſhaking
over his whole body, as the <hi>Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint</hi>

or an exceeding ſhame and

appointed for a Murtherer or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51158:27"/>
but only where it was done
unawares; as ſeveral clear Caſes

caſes there put, <hi>he ſhall flee to the
City of Refuge, and ſtay there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Congregation ſhall judge
betwixt the Manſlayer, and the

it wittingly, or unawares.</hi> The
<hi>Hebrews</hi> underſtand by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
the <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Chief

it were done <hi>unawares,</hi> and ſo
adjudged by the Congregation,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51158:27"/>
yet ſo hainous was the offence of
Blood before God (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of mans will in it) that
even ſuch Manſlayer was never
(during his life) afterwards to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the City until it was ſo
adjudged by the Congregation, or
until the death of the High-Prieſt,
(who was a type of Chriſt that
ſet us all free;) for if he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
then the Avenger of blood,
(who was next Kinſman to the
party ſlain) might, if he met him,
juſtifie the killing of him. So it is
very apparent, that before theſe
Cities of Refuge were appointed
for mercy to him that had killed
another unawares, ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer
might have been killed by
the Avenger of blood, as well as
he that had killed another wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
and after they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
they could not be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

had willingly, wilfully, or by a

where many ſuch Examples might

hindred the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51158:31"/>
was thus; The Conſiſtory or Bench

<note n="g" place="margin">Paul. Fag. <hi>Numb.</hi> 36. 6.</note> placed the party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Hall, and diligently enquired
and examined the cauſe; who, if
he were found guilty of voluntary
Murther, then was he puniſhed
with death; but if the fact were
found caſual, then he was ſafely
conducted back again to the City
of Refuge, where he enjoyed his
liberty, not only within the Walls
of the City, but within certain
Territories and bounds of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
within ſuch limits until the
death of the High-Prieſt (that was
in thoſe days) after whoſe death
he was at liberty;<note place="margin">20. Joſhua 6.</note> 
               <hi>Joſh.</hi> 20. 6. By
this means the offender, though he
was not puniſhed with death, yet
he lived (for the time, although
the offence was involuntary and
<hi>praeter intentionem</hi>) a kind of
Exile for his own humiliation, and
for the abatement of his wrath who
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51158:32"/>
was the Avenger of blood.<note n="d" place="margin">Maſius <hi>in</hi> Joſh. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</note> The

It is not agreed amongſt
Expoſitors, why the time of this
Exilement was limited to the death
of the High-Prieſt at that time:
but probably thought, that the
offender was therefore confined
within that City, as within a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
during the High-Prieſts life,
becauſe the offence did moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

by that Text of Scripture, <hi>If any

his cauſe was heard, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the ſlaughter determined
by the Judges. Secondly, it was
ſo appointed, that he might ſtay
there to the death of the High-Prieſt,
who was a type of our
Bleſſed Saviour, by whoſe precious
death we are all ſet free. Thirdly,
this was done <hi>ut menti eorum
(hac ratione) medeatur, &amp;c.</hi> to
heal and allay the mind and fury
of thoſe which otherwiſe would
delight in murther; for by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and continuance of time, the
rage of thoſe that ſought his life
would be qualified, and therefore
God provideth, that they ſhould
not ſtill be provoked by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
ſight of him. Fourthly,
and further by this, that he that
killeth a man unwittingly is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to flie, it is ſhewed (<hi>quod
reus poenae efficitur</hi>) that yet he is
guilty of ſome puniſhment. So
that involuntary killing was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with a kind of Baniſhment
among the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> So likewiſe
amongſt the <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſuch kind
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51158:34"/>
of Manſlaughter was cenſured
with one years Exile. And ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
from the Avenger of blood
for it was but an eſcape) was not
to go out of the limits and bounds
of the City, if he did, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the kinſman of the man
that was ſlain to kill him.</p>
            <p>There is a manifeſt diſtinction
of voluntary and involuntary
Murther or killing, grounded
upon the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
killing is of two ſorts,
there are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>chances unlookt

their Kingdoms were differenced
and diſtinguiſhed by names; ſo
did they differ in the nature and

They were unwilling to put any

It is a hard diſpute, whether there
be more mercy in death, or putting
out of Eyes, cutting off Legs,
Arms, &amp;c. or in the Gallies. It is
believed, that the boldneſs and
number of Malefactors begot the
Law of death, and thoſe whom
Death with ſo much Infamy (ſo

This way of Mercy it ſeems did
ſtretch too far, and covered too
many guilty perſons (as I fear

when as their ſeveral Caſes were
not judicially examined, indicted,
and tried, before hand, by a
Grand Jury, and a Jury of Life
and Death before a Learned Judge
(as in ordinary Trials of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals)

were done by misfortune, or in

from a foul Murther by a Pardon

<hi>Glouceſter;</hi> the words of which
Statute are as followeth;<note place="margin">6 Ed. 1. c. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King commandeth, that no

to enquire, whether a man did
kill another by Misfortune, or in

manner, without Felony; but he
ſhall be put in priſon until the

the Country that he did it in his

by the Report of the Juſtices to
the King, the King ſhall take him
to his Grace (if it pleaſe him.</hi>)
The Report to the King is, to
Certifie the Record into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
where the King is alwaies

a <hi>Pardon of Courſe,</hi>

whereas the Kings own <hi>hand</hi> and

the fact, as it appears in evidence
to them, or from their own
knowledge (which is that which
they now ſo much ſtand upon,
that is the very ſpecial matter
that makes it Manſlaughter, by
misfortune or <hi>ſe defendendo</hi>) the
party can never come to be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned

for that is not Felony, and if he

cannot Juſtifie it, for mens lives

take upon themſelves (upon the

neither) the ſole Judgment of Law

that have not formerly aſſerted

muſt not let the Priſoner ſuffer for
want of Counſel in Law) that a
Grand Jury cannot poſſibly do,
they hearing but only Witneſſes on
one ſide, and not the Priſoner;
beſides their want of Judgment
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51158:53"/>
and Knowledge in the Law in all
Caſes of Blood: whereas, if the
Grand Jury ſhall take upon them
(which they ought not to do) to
put out of the Indictment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the King, the words
<hi>Ex malitia praecogitata</hi>) the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
words that make it Murder, the
Court can never Judicially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the malice, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a ſecret latent thing, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with a great privacy and
cunning, and appears not in all
caſes of Murder expreſs, (and no
Evidence can prove further to a
Grand Jury) whereas the Law
in many caſes implies a malice to
make it Murder (although the
Parties never ſaw or heard of each
other before) which lies not in
proof of Witneſſes, but ariſeth as
a point of Law upon the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the Fact, which, not a
Grand Jury, but the Court is
Judge of, being matter of Law,
which Judgment in Law is wholly
fruſtrated and taken from the
Court, when the Grand Jurors
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51158:53"/>
put out theſe words, <hi>Ex malitia
praecogitata,</hi> which only make it
Murder, out of the Indictment.
And by ſuch favour, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or wilfulneſs in Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
many times the greateſt
Murder eſcapes by a <hi>per Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunium,

(if he can but read, get any one
to help him, or corrupt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
no great difficulty to do)
confeſſes the Indictment, and
prevents all further tryal upon
that Offence, and ſo neither the

twenty Witneſſes againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner)
what Evidence the Grand

Murder that can be (as my
own above Forty years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
attending the Crown Court
in one Circuit under many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

together with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
practice of labouring Grand
Jurors to ſuch a Preſentment, and
contriving with the Priſoner to
confeſs the Manſlaughter, leſt the
truth and foulneſs of the Murder
ſhould too clearly manifeſt it ſelf
(as truth ever will) upon a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial,
faithful, and careful Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Fact by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Judge, upon hearing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Evidence on both
ſides.</p>
            <p>It is true (as appears by
two ſeveral Acts of Parliament
noted in the Margent) that at
the making of thoſe Acts there
was a complaint in Parliament,<note place="margin">4 H. 4. 2. 37 H. 8. 8.</note>
That Indictments were ſtuffed
with more words than the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
required, and that of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to aggravate the Offence
more than it was grievous in it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51158:54"/>
ſelf. For as it is well obſerved
by Mr. <hi>Poulton,</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Poulton</hi> de Pace Regis &amp; Regni, fol. 167.</note> 
               <hi>That the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of every Offence do aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or diminiſh it according to
the qualities thereof.</hi> And by
thoſe two Acts of Parliament it
may be obſerved there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and redreſs made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by leaving out ſome formal
aggravating words (but then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial)
uſed in thoſe times in all
Indictments of Felony and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as by the Statute of the
4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2.<note place="margin">4 H. 4. 2.</note> the words then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
uſed in all Indictments of
Felony (without which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments
were not good) were
[<hi>Inſidiatores viarum &amp; depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latores
agrorum</hi>) provides that
thoſe words ſhould be left out in
all ſuch Indictments, and yet the
Indictments ſhould be good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them: And well they might
leave them out; for how uſeleſs
and impertinent (as to the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Indictment) were
thoſe words, and yet the effect
of them muſt be ſtill obſerved. As
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51158:55"/>
alſo by the Statute of the 37 <hi>H.
8. c.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">37 H. 8. c. 8.</note> the words, <hi>Vi &amp; Armis,
viz. cum baculis, cultellis, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus
&amp; ſagittis,</hi> or ſuch other
like words (before time common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſed and compriſed in all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments
and Inquiſitions of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Murther, Felony, Treſpaſs,
and other Criminal Offences)
ſhall not of neceſſity (for they
were ſo before) be put or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in any Inquiſition or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment;
but it ſhall be good
only with theſe words (<hi>Vi &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,
&amp;c.</hi>) leaving out the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any advantage that may be
taken (as formerly it was) by
Writ of Error, Plea, or otherwiſe;
for theſe words were to very little
purpoſe, to be of neceſſity uſed in
every Indictment: For as to ſome
Indictments, there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of pertinency or congruity
to the Offence in them. And
yet let it here be obſerved by the
way, That in thoſe times, and
before thoſe Statutes formerly
mentioned, continually (in all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51158:55"/>
Indictments) thoſe words were
uſed, and the Indictments found
by the Grand Jurors, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
proof made to them of ſuch
circumſtances (then eſſential) as
[<hi>Inſidiatores viarum, depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores
agrorum</hi>] liers in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
upon the High-ways, and
deſtroyers of Husbandry; or, as in
the other Statute, <hi>Cum baculis,
cultellis, arcubus &amp; ſagittis,
viz.</hi> with Staves, Knives, Bows
and Arrows; when perhaps he
that committed the Offence had
not one of theſe Weapons about
him, or was guilty of the leaſt
of theſe circumſtances of Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
which were then held
neceſſary to every Indictment;
which ſhews how obſervable (at
that time) Grand Jurors were to
the directions of the Court, and
to the Kings Council, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Indictments and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of it, Whether ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
lay in proof, or no?
But in neither of theſe Statutes,
nor any other Statute, is there
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51158:56"/>
any Exceptions made to theſe
words, in any Indictment for the
killing of a man (<hi>Ex malitia
praecogitata</hi>) then uſed in all
Indictments for the killing of any
perſon unlawfully, which (as is
ſaid before) are of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and uſe to be put into
all Indictments againſt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that hath ſhed innocent blood.
For, as Mr. <hi>Poulton,</hi> in the very
Folio before quoted, ſaith,<note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Poulton</hi> de Pace, &amp;c. fol. 167.</note>
(writing upon the two former
Statutes laſt mentioned;) <hi>If one
be Indicted of Murther or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,
there muſt be of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
in the Indictment, a ſtroke
ſuppoſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poult. <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> 1. m. Dier. 59.</note> 
               <hi>viz. tali die, &amp; anno

interfecit &amp; murdravit.</hi>
Here it is plain, that the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Manſlaughter, as well as
Murther, muſt have theſe words,
<hi>Ex malitia, &amp;c.</hi> in it. Neither let
any think that it is preſt further,
<hi>in foro legis,</hi> than it will bear <hi>in
foro conſcientiae;</hi> or that by this
means Grand Jurors are uſed but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51158:56"/>
as Cyphers (like the Ordinary at
the Aſſizes) <hi>pro forma tantum,</hi>
and that the Arguments of Law
and Reaſon here uſed, ſeem'd to
perſwade them (like thoſe of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) to be of
an implicite Faith, to believe as
their Leaders would have them,
and to do as they require them,
and yet to be under the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Oath to preſent the
truth of the matter of Fact. It is
far otherwiſe (being rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered)
they are not ſworn to
try the whole truth of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ſo as nothing may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in what they find, for then
there would be no need of another
Jury; they are neither to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
the Party, nor determine the
Law, Whether it be Murther or
Manſlaughter? or of what kind
or <hi>Species</hi> it is, as it appears to
them upon the hearing of but one
ſide, and that but of Witneſſes,
not of the Party, that is left (as
is ſaid before) to the ſecond Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who are properly Tryers of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51158:57"/>
the Offence <hi>de vicineto</hi>) of the
very Neighbourhood; not Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
only (as Grand Jurors from
every part of the County) where
Parties, and Witneſſes, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
on both ſides (if occaſion be)
may be lawfully heard.
<note n="g" place="margin">Jurato creditur in Judicio. And to ſay the truth, <hi>ſaith the Lord</hi> Coke, we never read in any Act of Parliament, ancient Author, Book-caſe, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that in Criminal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the party accuſed ſhould not have Witneſſes ſworn for him, and therefore there is not ſo much as <hi>Scintilla Juris</hi> againſt it. <hi>Cok. 3. Inſt. fol.</hi> 79.</note> The Grand Jury are
only ſworn to inquire,
and true preſentment
make of all ſuch things
and matters as ſhall be
given them in charge, to
preſent nothing for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
&amp;c. nor leave any
thing unpreſented for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
&amp;c. From hence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Grand Jurors frame an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to themſelves, that it is
part of their Oath to preſent all
ſuch things as ſhall be given
them in charge, that generally
the Judges in their charges di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
upon the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> and
differences in Murther: As, what
Offence the Law makes Murther?
what Manſlaughter at Common
Law? what upon the Statute?
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51158:57"/>
what <hi>per Infortunium?</hi> what <hi>ſe
Defendendo?</hi> what is malice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed?
and what is malice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
and therefore wherever
they find theſe ſpecifical differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
by their Evidence, they are
ſo to preſent it, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>This is upon a great miſtake,
nor is it, or can it be ſo intended
by the Judges; for although it is
true that the Judges (for the
moſt part, not all of them) in
their charges to the Grand Jury
(which I humbly conceive were
better omitted) do, uſually menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and branch out the ſeveral
ſpecifical differences and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Books of Law make in
ſhedding of Blood, in Murther,
and Manſlaughter, I conceive,
more to inform the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and to ſhew their Learning,
and the Law therein, than inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
that the Grand Jury
ſhould preſently (ſome of them
perhaps never ſerving before, <hi>uno
intuitu</hi>) take it into the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51158:58"/>
of their Oath, and make it
the nice Duty of their Inquiry,
which indeed they can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto, or determine the Law
therein, by only hearing of an
Accuſation of one ſide, from
which they are only to prepare
fit matter for the Court to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further upon, and to make
a more diligent inquiry after.
Such diſtinctions and directions
from the Judge being much more
proper for a Jury of Life and
Death, when any Queſtion of
Blood comes before them to be
conſidered of, and to be tryed and
determined, who have the only
means to do it, by hearing all
Parties, all Evidence on both ſides;
as alſo the directions of the Court,
as to the quality and nature of
the Offence, to give them a true
light to make a right diſtinction
therein.</p>
            <p>It is well ſaid by a Learned
Writer of the Law;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Finch</hi> 25. Caſe of preſentment and Indictment.</note> 
               <hi>An Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is an Inquiry finding ſome
Offence againſt the King. It was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51158:58"/>
the Kings Action whereupon the
Party ſhall be Arraigned, or put
to Anſwer by the King, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by another Jury. Every ſtrong
ſuſpicion of ſuch an Offence, though
it be in caſe of Felony appearing
of Record, hath the force of an
Indictment, as in an Action of
Treſpaſs for Goods carried away;
if the Defendant plead, Not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and be found Guilty,
he is a Felon, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">In ancient time it was uſual to Arraign one taken in the manner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Appeal or Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

if the Plaintiff, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the King ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

               <hi>Doctor</hi> and
<hi>Student;</hi> The Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is only charged with
the effect of the Bill (<hi>viz.</hi>) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be guilty of the Felony or
Murther in the Indictment, within
the Shire, and not whether he be
guilty, <hi>modo &amp; forma,</hi> as in the

they ſay <hi>Billa vera,</hi> they ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51158:59"/>
(as they take the effect of the
Bill to be) ſo it is though the Bill
vary from the day, year, and place,
ſo it vary not from the Shire; as
if there were falſe Latin in the
Bill they might well ſay, <hi>Billa
vera,</hi> for their Verdict ſtretcheth
but to the Felony, not to the truth
of the Latin.</p>
            <p>There is very much difference
in Law betwixt an Inquiry and a
Trial, betwixt a Preſentment and
a Conviction; beſides, the Judges
do now give it in charge to the
Grand Jurors, and ſo part of their
duty (if not of their Oath) that
when they have ſuch an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Murther come to their
hands, if they find upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that the party ſaid to be
ſlain in the Indictment, by the
perſon there charged with it, with
the time, and place, and manner
how, they are to enquire no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the nature of it (what
offence this is in Law) but to find
it as it ſtands in the Indictment,
which (for ought they know, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51158:59"/>
a further and more clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
of it in Court) may appear
as full, as it is laid in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
however it paſſeth fairly
out of their hands, they may
more clearly than <hi>Pilate</hi> waſh
their hands in Innocency from the
Innocent blood of ſuch a perſon,
and very well diſcharge their
Oath, the Law, and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
letting it paſs from them
with the Indorſment of <hi>Billa ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
a Bill that hath truth in it, fit
to be conſidered further by the
Court and another Jury.</p>
            <p>And as Indictments at the Kings
Suit do ſucceed Appeals, at the
parties Suit, ſo ought they to be
drawn and preſented as large and
as full for the King, as an Appeal
of death for the party, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was for Murther (if the party
Appellant would ſo have it) and
that may very reaſonably be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Indictments that the
Statute of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> directs in
Appeals, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Appeal
ſhall be abated ſo ſoon, as they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51158:60"/>
have been heretofore: But if the
Appellant in an Appeal do declare
the Deed,<note place="margin">6 E. 1. 9.</note> the year, the day, the
hour, the time of the King, and
the Town where the Deed was
done, and with what weapon he
was ſlain, the Appeal ſhall ſtand
in effect.</p>
            <p>Now ſo great an exactneſs of
the year, day, and hour, is not
required in an Indictment, as in
an Appeal (being the only violent
proſecution of the party) in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of life, many Niceties were
ſtood upon more than in other
Actions. And Mr. Juſtice <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
ſays, A man is not of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
compellable at Common Law
at this day, to put into his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the hour; the day was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be put down in an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;
for if the Appellee can
prove by certain Demonſtrations
and Teſtimony of credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
that he was the ſame day
at another place, at ſuch a diſtance
as it was not poſſible for him to
be there the day of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51158:60"/>
of the fact, or twenty miles
off the ſame hour the murther
was committed, the Appeal ſhall
abate. Yea, ſo many were the
Niceties of Appeals, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
were in uſe, not only in
Murther, but in all caſes of Felony,
and ſo full of Bribery and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the eaſie compoſition of
all ſorts of Murthers and Felonies,
and did ſo much delay the Kings
proſecution by Indictment (which
was not to begin until the year
and day paſt, after ſuch Felony
and murther) in which time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the Appellant grew ſlow in
his proſecution, and was many
times agreed with, and by the
end of the year Witneſſes were
dead and gone, all was cold and
forgotten, as alſo that the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
muſt ſue in proper perſon,
which ſuit was long and coſtly,
and made the party Appellant
weary to ſue.</p>
            <p>For remedy whereof the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the third of <hi>H.</hi> 7.<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 1.</note> was

               <note place="margin">MURTHER.</note> as alſo,
that <hi>the Appellant ſhall proceed
in his Appeal by Attorney;</hi> (all
helps the Law could deviſe to
prevent delays in caſes of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to find out and puniſh
the blood-guilty perſon) obſerve
the penning of that Statute (were
there nothing elſe to be ſaid in
this Argument) how neceſſary it
is that all Indictments be made
<hi>Murther,</hi> that are brought at the
Kings ſuit within the year and
day (as the King by this Statute
is enabled to do,<note place="margin">3 H. 7. c. 1.</note> the words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are as followeth, <hi>And if it
happen, that any perſon named as
principal, or acceſſary, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
of any ſuch Murther at
the Kings ſuit within the year and
the day, that then the ſaid Juſtices
ſhall not ſuffer him to go at large,
but either remit to Gaol, or
Bail him, at diſcretion, until
the year and day be paſt.</hi> And
further in the ſaid Statute it is ſaid,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51158:61"/>
               <hi>If the</hi> MURTHERER <hi>eſcape

that <hi>the Coroners ſhall return
their Inquiſitions before the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Gaol-delivery, and they
ſhall proceed againſt ſuch</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers;
and as it is before in the
ſaid Statute, <hi>The King ſhall not
ſtay until the</hi> year and day <hi>were
paſt, but proceed at any time after
the Murther committed:</hi> So that
(<hi>prima facie</hi>) the Statute looks
upon all Manſlayers (unlawfully)
to be guilty of <hi>Murther.</hi> And ſo the
Indictment ought to be drawn, or
they cannot be continued in Gaol,
nor Bailed by this Statute until the
year and day be out, nor the
Town amerced for ſuch eſcape,
nor the offender proceeded againſt
by the King, within the year and
day by Indictment.</p>
            <p>Now generally (in theſe days)
ſince the making of that Statute,
all proceedings in Murther and
Felony are by Indictment at the
Kings ſuit, not but that the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Appeal is ſtill in force, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51158:62"/>
the party hath his election which
way he will proceed, either by
Appeal at his own ſuit, or by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
at the Kings ſuit; yea,
even after the Trial had by the
Kings ſuit (in ſome caſes) although
at the Kings ſuit they have been
acquitted of the murther (but
that the abuſe of theſe and many
other obſolete Laws) hath taken
away the frequent uſe of them;
except it be through the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of Grand Jurors, and Jurors
of life and death, in caſes of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the one in not fully preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the murther, the other in not
conſcientiouſly giving a Verdict
according to their Evidence, and
thereby provoking the party
(whoſe Relation is ſlain) to the
nice and chargeable remedy of an
Appeal; upon ſuch Appeals ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
have been executed after
they have been acquitted by trial
at the Kings ſuit upon Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
one Woman in my time
in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> for petty Treaſon
for killing her Husband, after ſhe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51158:62"/>
had been acquitted for the ſame
fact at the Kings ſuit by Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was convicted upon the
Appeal, and burnt at a ſtake.</p>
            <p>Look how high the Appellant
ſhall draw his Appeal againſt the
Appellee or Defendant, as if for
Murther; in this caſe, if the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant
ſhall ſurceaſe to proſecute
ſuch Appeal, as by Nonſuit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe,
Retraxit, the Woman by
marrying a Husband, <hi>pendente lite,</hi>
or by the Act of God, as if the
Appellant die, or by the Act of
the Law, as if the Appellant take
the priviledge: Now in all the
former Caſes, where the Appeal
ceaſeth by the Act of the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
(that is, he that proſecuteth
the Appeal, after declaration in the
Appeal) the Defendant ſhall not
go at liberty, but ſhall be Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the ſame Declaration at
the Kings ſuit, for that it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the Declaration there is a
Murther committed, and the year,
day, and place, when, and where
the ſame was committed, and the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51158:63"/>
ſame is not tried; and the Law
will not allow ſuch great Offences
whereof it taketh notice) to be
concealed and remain unpuniſhed,
neither will the King at his ſuit
ſuffer it to be extenuated into a
leſſer degree of Murther, than the
Appellant did: ſo careful have the
Laws ever been in puniſhing of
Murther, and revenging Innocent
blood, which it ſeems (and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is obſerved) whilſt Appeals
were in uſe, and the Kings ſuit
muſt ſtay until the year and day
were paſt, many Murtherers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
unpuniſhed, and the killing
of men was made (as now it is)
a trick of Youth, Valour, Hecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and Jeſt, in regard of ſo
great impunity it found, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Pardons, Indulgence of
Grand Jurors, and others.</p>
            <p>And truly, it is much with us
in this Age, as it was in thoſe
daies when Appeals were in uſe,
and had the preheminence of the
Kings ſuit; Never more killing
of men by Duels, Tavern, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51158:63"/>
Game-houſe Quarrels, and yet
never more impunity to ſuch Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killers,
ſuch valiant murtherers of
their fellow Chriſtians, eſpecially
if the Mankiller have either a
fame for Honour or Valour, Mony,
or Intereſt of Friends, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
pity, or pardon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
from the Grand Jury, to
find it Manſlaughter (if they will
go ſo high) where it is Murther,
and then (through that falſe glaſs)

Many Recent, and freſh Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

divers Murthers, that have too

in not obſerving the direction
of the Judges in this particular
of finding Bills Murther, inſtead
of Manſlaughter, yea, and that
many times upon directions given
in Court, after open Evidence,
which open Evidence to a Grand

ought to be avoided as much as
may be, in regard it doth too

ſo indeed as many (if not more

may conceive what great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
have formerly been made
againſt Grand Jurors in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in erring upon both hands,
by taking too much liberty to
themſelves, and not obſerving the

was a neceſſity of making an Act
of Parliament,<note place="margin">3 H. 8.</note> in the 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
(immediately after Appeals began
to fall off) as you may read in
that Act of Parliament made to
reform them, and to reform the
Sheriffs power in retorning them;
the whole Authority of retorning
Inqueſts (to take Indictments)
being by force of the Statute of
the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. in Sheriffs and Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
of <hi>Franchiſes.</hi> It is obſerved
by the Statute of the 3 of <hi>H.</hi> 8.
that by reaſon of Bribing of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,
and their Bayliffs and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
many true and ſubſtantial
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51158:65"/>
perſons were divers times wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
indicted of Murther, Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and other Miſdemeanours,
to the utter loſs of their Lives,
Goods, and Lands. And ſometimes
alſo great Felonies and Murthers
were concealed, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the Grand Jurors, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
retorned by the Sheriffs or
their Miniſters; for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, it was eſtabliſhed
by the ſaid Act of the 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
That <hi>all Pannels of Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
put in by any Sheriff before
any Juſtice of Goal-delivery, and
Juſtices of Peace, one being of
the</hi> Quorum, <hi>in the open Seſſions
to enquire for the King, ſhall be
reformed, by putting to, and taking
off the Names of the perſons
which ſo be impannelled by every
Sheriff, at the diſcretion of the
ſaid Juſtices, before whom ſuch
Pannel ſhall be retorned, and the
Sheriff upon pain of twenty pound
ſhall allow of ſuch Pannel, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and retorned by the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the one half to the King, the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51158:66"/>
other to him that will ſue for the

not be a bar to his part that ſo
ſues.</hi> So careful were the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
to have faithful Jurors,
that ſhould neither accuſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
nor excuſe the Nocent,
and that eſpecially (in Caſes of
Blood) ſhould make no conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And leſt all this care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Grand Jurors ſhould
do no good, but that they ſhould
ſtill eſpouſe their own opinions,
and make head againſt the Court,
and wilfully conceal Offences they
were charged to enquire of,<note place="margin">3 H. 7.</note> there
is a Statute yet in force, 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7.
in which it is ordained, That
<hi>the Juſtices of Peace may (in

to be Impannelled, to enquire of
the concealments of other Inqueſts
taken before them, of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and offences as are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
and preſented before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of Peace, whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
ſhall be made. And if any
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51158:66"/>
concealment ſhall be found by any
Inqueſt, within one year after
the ſaid concealment, every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſaid Inqueſt, that made
ſuch concealment, ſhall be amerced
or fined at the diſcretion of ſuch
Juſtices of Peace, the ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciaments
ſo aſſeſſed in plain
Seſſions. And theſe Amerciaments
or Fines may be very high, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
and quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
This Statute only concerns
and remedies Concealments by
Grand Jurors, before Juſtices of
the Peace, at the Seſſions of the
Peace, as conceiving Grand Jurors
would be bolder there, and take
more liberty in their Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than they durſt before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of Aſſize, Oyer, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,
or Goal-delivery; as alſo,
that ſuch Juſtices and Judges knew
better how to deal with them, if
they made any ſuch concealments
or miſpriſion before them: For
the Grand Jurors being immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and ſubordinate Miniſters and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51158:67"/>
Officers in, and to the Court, and
anſwerable for their Duty there,
as Coroners, Conſtables, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miniſters of the Court, they
may and muſt ſtand to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Court; and in caſe
of any wilful contempt, miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor,
and concealment, may,
without Indictment, (for how
can they be indicted at the ſame
time by themſelves) be fined by
the Court, as any other Officer
and Miniſter of the Court.</p>
            <p>And let Grand Jurors take heed,
leſt by their remiſneſs and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs,
they give not occaſion
to the making of the like Statute
as was made in the 11.<note place="margin">11 H. 7. c. 3.</note> of <hi>H. 7.
c.</hi> 3. upon the ſurmiſe in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<hi>That whereas many great
Offences, as Riots, unlawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
Extortions, Mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
Imbraceries, and other
Offences, could not be duly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the due Order of the Law,
except it were firſt found and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the Verdict of Twelve
men thereto duly ſworn, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51158:67"/>
will not find, nor yet preſent the
Truth</hi> (obſerve here what occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Grand Jurors had then given
through their neglect) It was
therefore provided and enacted by
this Statute, <hi>That Juſtices of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize,
and Juſtices of Peace, upon
Information for the King</hi> (that is
meerly upon the Teſtimony of
Witneſſes, without Indictment,
or uſe of Grand Jurors) <hi>ſhould
proceed to make out Proceſs, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and Condemn Offenders by
their Diſcretion, as if it were
upon Indictments found by Grand
Jurors.</hi> Which Statute was a
great Infringment of the Common
Law, and the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>England,</hi> who ought not
by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Law
of this Land, to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
or condemned in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
or Eſtates (in Criminals) but
by Indictment firſt had and found
againſt them by Grand Jurors. It
is true, that Treaſons, Murthers,
and Felonies, and ſuch Offences
(for which life and member ſhould
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51158:68"/>
be loſt) are excepted out of this
Act (although they ſtand upon the
ſame Reaſons as the other Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
named in the Act). For by
this Act and new Law, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
might loſe his Liberty, ſuffer
Ranſom, Stigmatizing, Pillory,
Impriſonment, loſs of Lands and
Eſtate (things very near to Life
and Member). And the Lord
<hi>Coke</hi> tells us, <hi>That</hi> Empſon <hi>and</hi>
Dudley (<hi>two Judges (by reaſon
of this Act) committed upon the
Subjects inſufferable Oppreſſions:</hi>
and therefore this Statute was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Repealed after the Deceaſe of
<hi>H.</hi> 7. by the Statute of the 1. of
<hi>H. 8. c. 6. A good Caveat to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
(ſays the Lord <hi>Coke) to
leave all Cauſes to be meaſured
by the Golden and ſtreight Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wand
of the Law, and not to the
uncertain and crooked Cord of
Diſcretion.</hi> And as good a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat
it is to Grand Jurors in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Blood, not ſo much to be
led by the crooked Cord of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
as the ſtreight Rule of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51158:68"/>
the Law, and Directions of the
learned Judges, who ſhould beſt
know the Law, and the trueſt
meaſure thereof: For if the Rule
be true (as indeed it is) <hi>Quod
nihil relictum eſt arbitrio Judicis</hi>)
that nothing is left to the Will of
the Judge, much leſs, <hi>arbitrio
Juratorum,</hi> to the will of Grand
Jurors, they having been (through
too much connivance) by an evil
practice, corrupted herein. But
<hi>errores ad ſua principia referre,
eſt refellere,</hi> To bring Errors to
their beginning, is to ſee their
laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, haply Grand Jurors may
conceive, and argue thus;</hi> That
to extenuate an Offence, is not to
conceal it, if they find it not Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet they find it in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Manſlaughter, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
if the Kings Council will
put into the Indictment the words
(<hi>Ex malitia praecogitata, &amp;c.</hi>)
which only make it Murther, and
which is matter of Fact, they
muſt make it out to us, that there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51158:69"/>
was malice, either from our own
knowledge of it, or that it is
clearly proved to us from words
or deeds expreſs, by ſuch an act,
that lies in proof, or we are not
bound to find thoſe words, but
muſt ſtrike them out of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or find an <hi>Ignoramus:</hi> Or
if the Witneſſes themſelves ſhall
inform us, that it was a ſudden
falling out, or done by misfortune,
<hi>Se defendendo,</hi> in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or to defend himſelf againſt
one that would have robbed him,
in his Houſe, or upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
or that he that did it was
a Watchman, a Conſtable, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Officer, or Keeper of a Park
or Warren, and in doing his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or that he that did it was a
natural Fool, one not <hi>Compos men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
a Mad-man, or a young Child
that did it, and by his young and
tender years not capable of malice,
and ſo could not be guilty of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
or if there had been former
fallings out and differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, yet all was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51158:69"/>
and they good friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and this only a caſual and
ſudden difference betwixt them
upon a new occaſion, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
provoked unto it by him that
was ſlain, ſo that we cannot be
ſatisfied to find it Murther in any
of theſe caſes, being upon our
Oaths to make true Inquiry, and
if we find not the malice (being
matter of Fact) another Jury can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
try it. Beſides, we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
practice of our ſide, other
Grand Jurors have had, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the ſame Liberty, and why
ſhould not we? The Judges like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in their Charges inform us
of all the ſpecifical differences in
Manſlaughter, which we conceive
they intend we ſhould take notice
of, as it comes in proof before
us, in our Inquiry. <hi>This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
is as much as Grand Jurors
have ſaid, or can alledge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(where they are not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
partial, and go clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Evidence) why they
do not, or will not (for ſuch is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51158:70"/>
ſome of their Language) find it
Murther in all Caſes, as the Court
directs, and as the Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is drawn and ſent to them as
the King's Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſatisfie theſe reaſonings and
miſtakes (though ſufficient hath
been ſaid already to ſatisfie a wiſe
and ſober Grand Jury-man, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in a Caſe of Blood, which
can never receive too ſtrict an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
by a Grand Jury, the firſt
Inquiſitors of it in Court) let them
obſerve, that neither themſelves,
nor the party accuſed, can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
by what they ſhall ſo find,
be it never ſo high: Firſt, not
themſelves; they do but preſent a
probable Accuſation (no Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
againſt ſuch a perſon that
hath had his hands in Blood, hath
kill'd a man, is <hi>Vir ſanguinis:</hi>
And here certainly it will be the
beſt ſatisfaction to Conſcience (and
that is the beſt Friend we can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie)
to have all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Fact (as they are laid
in the Indictment) to be more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51158:70"/>
and circumſpectly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſifted, and tryed out, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Jury, by a Learned Judge,
in a publick Court, to the parties
face, where the King's Witneſſes,
and the party himſelf, and his
Witneſſes, may be fully heard, and
the whole matter fully tryed and
debated, which cannot be done in
a Grand Juries Chamber, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ſtifled and obſtructed, if
the Grand Jurors ſuffer it not to
come to this Judicial Teſt and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
but ſhall put out the words, <hi>Ex
malitia praecogitata,</hi> or otherwiſe
alter the King's Declaration and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
which already hath had
proceedings in it, and that in
Court of Record, where it hath
been adviſed by the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
upon peruſal of Informations
and Examinations from Juſtices
of Peace or Coroner, in that Caſe
certified to the Court, and upon
hearing the Proſecutor and his
Witneſſes, and ſo drawn and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the Court, Witneſſes
ſworn to it, and Indorſed, <hi>Jurat.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51158:71"/>
in Curia,</hi> ſworn in Court, and
ſo become ſomething more than
an ordinary Declaration or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Parchment, to be altered
by any, without advice or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Court; for if it might be
ſo, the King's Council and their
Advice (together with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in ſuch Caſes) would ſignifie
very little in drawing or adviſing
any Indictment of Murther, if
Grand Jurors in their Chamber
may (from their own advice) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it as they pleaſe, the Judges
themſelves being as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
in Conſcience, to do right
to the Priſoner and Party accuſed,
as Grand Jurors can be. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
admit that the Witneſſes ſhall
inform the Grand Jury that it was
a paſſionate and ſudden falling out,
or that it was done unawares, or
in his own defence, it is but what
they apprehend it to be; they can
inform but what they ſaw, or
heard, or believe; they are in the
Affirmative only, and can prove
but for that inſtant the Fact was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51158:71"/>
done; they dare not ſwear that
there had been no falling out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and as they cannot, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will not, prove an expreſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
ſo neither can they ſwear that
there was none at all, or not ſuch
a malice as the Law implies; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Witneſſes judge in all
Caſes, what is Manſlaughter at
Common Law, what upon the
Statute, what <hi>per Infortunium,</hi>
what <hi>ſe Defendendo,</hi> what is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable,
or what is Murther:
neither indeed in all theſe Caſes,
can the Grand Jurors, nor is it
convenient for them to judge of
all the ſpecifical differences, each
Circumſtance may ſo much alter
a Caſe; and will they then, by
their uncertain Judgments, in caſe
of Murther, conclude and precloſe
the Court, and determine the
Law, that this Fact of Blood
ſhall go no higher than they pleaſe
to adjudge it; as in the caſe put
of a Child that kills another, not
the Grand Jury (who ſee not
the Child) but the Court, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51158:72"/>
the other Jury ſhall inſpect the
Child, ſhall judge whether the
Child could do ſuch an Act, <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo
animo, ex malitia praecogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and ſo be guilty of Malice
and Murther; the Court, and not
the Grand Jury, being to judge,
<hi>an malitia ſupplebit aetatem,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon hearing him ſpeak, he
may be thought capable of malice
(as ſome at more tender years are
than others) ſo in the caſe of a
Fool, or a Lunatick, a Dumb or
Deaf perſon; ſo in the caſe of a
Reconcilement after a falling out,
and then a killing; can either Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
or Witneſſes, or any that
hears but one ſide, ſtate the caſe
aright, or judge whether the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
were perfect or not,
ſo as to take away all the ſeeds of
malice, revenge, or diſcontent?
And Mr. Juſtice <hi>Stamford</hi> ſayes,
<hi>That thoſe that are Dumb and
Mute, and Infants, ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
upon Arraignment.</hi> Which
ſhews that they are to be Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Murther: But how ſhall they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51158:72"/>
be Arraigned, when they cannot
hear, or ſpeak, and plead? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by the Inſpection and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Court upon their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment,
I mean, upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
found by the Grand Jury;
which plainly ſhews that the
Judges (not the Grand Jurors)
are Judges of the Law, and of
what ſhall be Murther. So in
the caſe of killing a Thief that
attempts to Rob or commit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(which is juſtifiable) this
muſt judiciouſly and certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
ſo upon the Tryal, that the
Court may judge whether there
were an intention to Steal, or to
commit Murther, or Rape; and
not let ſuch a Surmiſe only, <hi>That
there was no ſuch intention,</hi> lead
the Grand Jury to acquit him,
when haply there was ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And the Statute of the 24.
of <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſaith, <hi>That the Party ſo
Indicted or Appeal'd of ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
for killing a Thief, or one
that intended to Murther (by
Verdict ſo found and tryed) ſhall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51158:73"/>
not loſe or forfeit Lands or Goods,
but ſhall be diſcharged as one
acquit of Felony; and none can be
acquit of Felony that is not tried
for it;</hi> the doubt being before this
Statute, Whether he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
his Goods and Chattels as one
that kill'd another by Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medley?
So that there was no
doubt but ſuch a one was Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Murther before this Act, as
one that had kill'd another by
Chance-medly muſt, and yet is
to be Indicted; Chance-medly
being Manſlaughter at Common
Law.</p>
            <p>Sure in all theſe caſes, and all
other the like caſes of Blood, it is
moſt prudent and ſafe for every
wiſe and conſcientious Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-man
(that is ſatisfied there is
Blood ſpilt, and the life of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Creature unjuſtly taken
away by ſuch a perſon charged in
the Indictment) rather to preſume
it probable, all other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may be true, as they are laid
in the Indictment (ſo far as to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51158:73"/>
make an Accuſation againſt a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
perſon) then that they are not,
and ſo to leave it fairly to the
Court to judge thereof, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
free from the imputation of
Blood by concealment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
put the whole matter, with
all its circumſtances, upon a moſt
legal and impartial Tryal, many
times that appearing upon Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
that appeared not before.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon why a Petit Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or Jury of Life and Death,
may extenuate an Offence, and
make it leſs than the Grand Jury,
is becauſe (hearing of both ſides)
they may inquire of Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which a Grand Jury cannot. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
as the<note n="k" place="margin">Coke 3. Inſt. fol. 26. 1. Inſt. Sect. 194. Forteſcue c. 26. 72. Stamford l. 2. fol. 90.</note> Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
informs (that Oracle of
the Law) <hi>An Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is no part of the
Tryal, but an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Declaration for the King;
and the Evidence of Witneſſes to
a Grand Jury, is no part of the
Tryal: For by Law the Tryal in
that caſe is not by Witneſſes, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51158:74"/>
by the Verdict of Twelve men, and
ſo a manifeſt diverſity between the
Evidence to a Jury, and a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
by a Jury. If the Indictment
were part of the Tryal, then
ought he that is a Noble-man and
Lord of Parliament, to be Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by his Peers, for the Tryal
of him ought to be by his Peers;
but the Indictment againſt a Peer
of the Realm is always found
by Freeholders, and not by
Peers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The French word <hi>Enditer</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
in Law, an Accuſation
found by an Inqueſt of Twelve, or
more, upon their Oath; and the
Accuſation is called <hi>Indictamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
And as the Appeal is ever
the Suit of the party, ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
is always the Suit of the
King, and as it were his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the Appeal is the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the party. Some derive
it from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to accuſe, and as properly may it
be called <hi>Indictamentum ab indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicando,
quia aliquid notum facit
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51158:74"/>
dicendo,</hi> he that Accuſeth or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth
another man, or brings
his Crime into queſtion, <hi>indicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
quaſi indicatus,</hi> one that
hath his cauſe ſhewed out in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
(<hi>deferre nomen alicujus, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare</hi>)
to Indict, is to Accuſe
or Impeach. It ſignifies in our
Common Law as much as <hi>accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>
in the Civil Law, though it
have not the like effect: <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabilis,</hi>
i. e. <hi>accuſatione, aut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſione
dignus,</hi> one worthy
of Reprehenſion. An Indictment
being like the precious Stone of
<hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Indica,</hi> which (as
<hi>Pliny</hi> notes) in rubbing it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth into a purple ſweat; So
doth an Indictment of Murther,
which though it ſeem white and
pale in the Grand Jurors hands,
afterwards by rubbing and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
hard in Court, breaks out
into a purple or bloody ſweat (as

all) what comes from the Grand
Jury is more properly called a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.
For the conſtant form
and words in all Bills are, <hi>Jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores
pro Domino Rege ſuper ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
ſuum praeſentant;</hi> obſerve,
they are ſtiled <hi>Juratores pro Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino
Rege</hi> only; nor can they be
otherwiſe: for they are to hear
none but the Kings Evidence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own Declaration: And
whoever is to advance (as the
Grand Jurors are) but the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of one ſide, ought as ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to be permitted, to raiſe and
advance it to the higheſt pitch
(that by any reaſonable preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it will bear) as the other ſide
have liberty to extenuate it to the
loweſt degree and mean that art
and cunning (which in theſe caſes
of Blood are ſeldom wanting) can
bring it unto; the one being upon
an Accuſation againſt a criminous
perſon, who hath had his hands
in Blood, and is certainly guilty
in truth of ſomething in the crime
he is accuſed of: The other only
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51158:77"/>
upon his own excuſe, who can
never (upon the whole matter)
excuſe himſelf, <hi>à toto,</hi> from the
whole Crime of Blood. If they
are ſatisfied that it is an Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King's Peace, his Crown
and Dignity, and the life of another
perſon; it is enough for them to
preſent the whole matter to the
Court, as the Court hath direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and adviſed the Bill to them:
For every Bill of Indictment, that
is formally and legally drawn up,
is preſumed to have been ſeen, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
and directed (as before is
ſaid) by the Court and the King's
Counſel, upon an Information of
the Fact taken by them
<note n="l" place="margin">The Judges did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe in drawing the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>Leak, 4 Jac. Coke 3. Inſt. Tit. Treaſon, fol.</hi> 16.</note>, (as for the ſubſtance
of it, is meet and fit to be
put into ſuch formal and
legal terms for the King)
as it is by the Judges ſent
out of Court to the Grand Jurors;
it being a common practice for the
Judges (according to the matter
of Fact) to direct upon what Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
and Law, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51158:78"/>
and form the Indictment ſhall
be drawn and ſent to the Grand
Jury, that if they find only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
matter contained in it of
accuſation in any kind, they may
ſo preſent it to the Court, as their
Preſentment or Accuſation; the
word <hi>Preſentment</hi> coming from
the Latin word <hi>Praeſentio,</hi> to
ſmell or ſcent before, <hi>praeſentire
in poſterum,</hi> to have a ſenſe of
that which is to come: ſo if they
have any ſenſe or ſmell of Blood
in the Indictment, it is enough
for them to leave it to a further
queſt of what ſhall come after:
the Grand Jurors being like the
good Huntſman, that obſerving
where the Hare hath lately prickt,
or the Deer lately ſtruck, or hath
dropped blood, lays in his Hounds,
and leaves them to make the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery:
ſo indeed ſhould the
Grand Jurors do the Jury of Life
and Death, in Caſes of Blood, and
that the Blood of their fellow
Chriſtians. And thence likewiſe
the Grand Jurors Preſentment is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51158:78"/>
called an <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> from the Latin
word <hi>Inquiro, inquirere, quod
vulgo dicitur facere Informatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
for every Inquiſitor is as an
Informer, a promoter of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
to the Court, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the King, that it may
be more judicially enquired into
and determined, which is much
like a Citation of a perſon into
the Eccleſiaſtical Courts for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
fame, which is either fit to
be enquired further into and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
or the party purged or
pronounced Innocent: or like the
Maſters of Requeſts to the King
(Honourable perſons) that view
all Petitions and Complaints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be preſented to the
King, and determine what are fit
to be preſented unto the King, and
what are fit to be rejected.</p>
            <p>A ſtrong Suſpicion, and the
Fame of the Country may (in
many caſes) be Evidence ſufficient
for a Grand Jury to find a Bill;
and here I will leave to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51158:79"/>
of Grand Jurors, what I
find in Mr. Juſtice <hi>Stamfords</hi> Pleas

The whole Chapter is well
worth the reading.</p>
            <p>And it may not be amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that the ancient forms of
Indictments or Bills began thus,
<hi>Inquiratur pro domino Rege, Let
it be enquired of for our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord the King,</hi> as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is laid in the Indictment,
whether the offence be ſo (as is
there ſuppoſed) which is as much
as if the Grand Jury ſhould ſay,
<hi>We judge it fit that it be farther
enquired of, whether it be truly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51158:80"/>
ſo indeed, as it is here ſuppoſed;</hi>
for the Offence, as it is laid in the
Indictment, as it comes from the
Grand Jury (before it receive a
farther trial and enquiry of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Jury) is no more but <hi>Crimen
ſuppoſitum &amp; impoſitum,</hi> an offence
ſuppoſed and laid to ones charge
to anſwer; and this clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Record of every Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal
or Conviction of any that is
tried upon an Indictment; for the
words of the Acquittal or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
(as they are drawn up in
the Record) are theſe, <hi>viz. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratores</hi>
(that is to ſay, the Jury

ſo that <hi>ſupponitur &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponitur,</hi>
ſuppoſed and impoſed,
is all that can be inferr'd from the
Indictment; the Grand Juries
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51158:80"/>
Preſentment (upon hearing of
one ſide) being the <hi>Suppoſition,</hi>
and the other Jury (upon hearing
of both ſides) the <hi>Impoſition;</hi> or
<hi>Supponitur,</hi> and that relates to the
<hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Indictment, as
the Grand Jury ſuppoſe it to be;
the <hi>Imponitur,</hi> and that relates to
the <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> of the Offence,
and the circumſtances of it, as it
is laid in the Indictment, as it is
found by the Jury of Life and
Death; and theſe Circumſtances
indeed are the proper enquiry of
the Jury of Life and Death, upon
the hearing of Evidence on both
ſides, as appears clearly by the
penning and drawing up of theſe
Records, and all this is no more
than in every common Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the ſuit of the Party, only
this Indictment is as a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon Oath, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(for the ſatisfaction of thoſe
that are ſworn) contain, that
which for ſubſtance ſeems to them
(<hi>prima facie</hi>) to be a probable
truth, and a tranſgreſſion of a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51158:81"/>
Law, not ſtrictly looking into the
matter and form, aggravations
and circumſtances of the Fact (as
it is laid in the Indictment) for
thoſe do but attend and uſher in
the Fact; but Grand Jurors are
principally to eye and look upon
the ſingle Fact and act it ſelf, and
finding one that hath had his
hands in blood, and that probably
(upon a farther Enquiry) may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<hi>reus,</hi> a guilty perſon, by
killing of another perſon, they
are to put their <hi>Billa vera</hi> unto
it, although they have no proof
at all of the Aggravations and
Circumſtances that attend the
Fact (Evidence many times ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
out of the parties own mouth
(againſt himſelf, upon a ſtrict
examination in Court) more than
the Witneſſes againſt him have
proved.) And it is well obſerved
in the Book called, <hi>The Terms of the
Law,</hi> upon theſe two words, <hi>Billa
vera,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Billa
vera</hi> is the Indorſment of the
Grand Jury upon any Preſentment
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51158:81"/>
or Indictment, which they find
to be probably true, (mark theſe
words) <hi>probably true;</hi> nor do I take
the Adjective <hi>Vera</hi> in this place
to ſignifie <hi>True,</hi> but <hi>meet, reaſon,</hi>
or <hi>fit,</hi> and ſo it is often uſed in
<hi>Terence,</hi> and by the Grammarians,
<hi>Verum eſt, it is fit:</hi> ſo that <hi>Billa
vera</hi> upon the Bill doth not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
a <hi>true Bill,</hi> that hath nothing
but truth in it, but a <hi>meet,</hi> or <hi>fit
Bill</hi> for the further enquiry of
another Jury, which ever ſucceeds
ſuch an Indorſment of <hi>Billa vera</hi>
by a Grand Jury; certainly it is
upon a great miſtake (although I
confeſs it is often uſed in Law-Books,
and by wiſe men) to call
the Preſentment of a Grand Jury
a Verdict, to ſay that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſing
<hi>Billa vera,</hi> or <hi>Ignoramus</hi>
(which is all they do) is their
<hi>Verdict,</hi> there being a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between <hi>Billa vera</hi> and
<hi>Veredictum,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
veritatis,</hi> and even induceth
a Conviction; for nothing can
properly be called a Verdict, but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51158:82"/>
where it is given by a Jury; after
an Iſſue joyned, upon hearing of
both ſides, <hi>Veredictum,</hi> is, as it
were, <hi>quoddam Evangelium,</hi> like
a little Goſpel of Truth, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
every Verdict (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs
a man to the loſs of Life or
Eſtate) ought to be as true as the
Goſpel the Jurors ſwear upon;
for upon the Iſſue of a Verdict, the
Lives and Eſtates of all perſons
depend: And therefore an Attaint
lies in Law againſt thoſe Jurors
that give a falſe Verdict, contrary
to the truth of their Evidence,
which is a Villainous Judgment, a
very great Judgment in Law. And
this Attaint did never by Law, lie,
or was brought againſt Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
for any falſe Preſentment, for
they do but barely preſent an
offence, upon hearing of one ſide,
and therefore can be no Verdict
(as from them) the Grand Jury
being for number indefinite, that
being properly called a Verdict
from ſuch a Jury, where the Law
makes a determinate number of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51158:82"/>
               <hi>twelve,</hi> or <hi>twenty four,</hi> and no
more: Beſides, it is alwaies ſaid in
the <hi>Record,</hi> where ſuch a Jury
finds a Verdict, <hi>Juratores ſuper
Sacramentum ſuum dicunt, &amp;c.</hi> But
where the Grand Jury preſent,
<hi>Juratores ſuper Sacramentum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
praeſentant</hi> (not <hi>dicunt</hi>) there
being as much difference between
<hi>praeſentant</hi> and <hi>dicunt,</hi> as betwixt
a known truth, and the report and
fame of a fact done.</p>
            <p>And this will the better appear,
if it be well obſerved what Grand
Jurors write or Indorſe upon the
back of thoſe Bills they find; for
though they Indorſe ſuch Bills
(<hi>Billa vera</hi>) yet they never In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſe
upon thoſe Bills they do not
find (<hi>Billa falſa</hi>) as if one were
true, and the other falſe, for
ſhould they do ſo, it would be like
an Accuſation againſt the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
that prefers the Bill, and a
great diſcouragement to the Kings
Evidence; but they modeſtly
write (<hi>Ignoramus</hi>) which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
to the Court, <hi>they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51158:83"/>
of the matter in the Bill,
and that they find no cauſe, either
from what they have heard from
the Witneſſes, or know of their
own knowledge, to commend it to
a farther Enquiry:</hi> the Verb <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noro,</hi>
coming from <hi>Ignarus, not to
know, to be ignorant.</hi> And this
doth further evince, that the Grand
Jurors <hi>Preſentment</hi> cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be called a <hi>Verdict;</hi> becauſe a
<hi>Verdict</hi> doth in Law either <hi>convict</hi>
or <hi>acquit,</hi> which neither their <hi>Billa
vera,</hi> nor <hi>Ignoramus</hi> doth; the firſt
is always put to a farther enquiry,
the laſt is no acquittal to the party;
for although there be many <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus</hi>'s
againſt any perſon, yet
may more Bills be preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſame perſon for the ſame
offence; for it may be they did not
find the Bill, in regard ſome Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
were abſent or corrupted, or
the matter in the Bill miſtaken;
happily it may be no Felony, but
ſomething done in jeſt, or in the
nature of a Treſpaſs, or a Natural
death inſtead of a Murther, or the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51158:83"/>
Witneſſes of no Credit, or the
like. But if there be any thing
of Truth in the Bill proved to
them to make a Crime, although
not ſo fully as is laid in the
Bill, they muſt not in ſuch
caſe write (<hi>Ignoramus</hi>) as if
they knew nothing of a Crime;
as if it be a Murther in the
Bill, and the Proof reacheth but
to an <hi>Infortunium,</hi> or <hi>ſe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi>
or to any degree of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
killing, they muſt not
write <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the Bill;
or if Burglary, and the Proof
makes it but a ſingle Felony,
and no Burglary, they muſt not
Indorſe it (<hi>Ignoramus</hi>) but in
all ſuch caſes, where they are
in any doubt, the beſt way for
them will be to adviſe with
the Learned Judge, to move
the Court for directions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
It is too great a Scandal to
a Grand Jury (Perſons in that
quality highly to be eſteemed)
to ſay, that their <hi>Ignoramus</hi>
(that is, their <hi>Ignorance</hi>) is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51158:84"/>
their Verdict. It is very ſafe for
Grand Jurors, before they find
an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> to examine every
Witneſs produced; but if they have
many Witneſſes in Murder or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
if any one Witneſs induce a
ſtrong and pregnant Preſumption
it is enough, without perplexing
themſelves, in haſt of buſineſs, they
need not examine any more, but
put <hi>Billa vera</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>If a Grand Jury find, upon an
Indictment of Murther, that <hi>A.</hi>
killed <hi>B.</hi> what is it to them (as
hath been ſaid before) whether it
be Murther or Manſlaughter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were done, <hi>Ex malitia
praecogitata, per Infortunium, ſe
defendendo, in loco &amp; tempore
belli,</hi> or otherwiſe, this is Special
matter, and Special matter ought
to be found when it is at Iſſue by
another Jury, and muſt ariſe (I
mean the truth of it) <hi>ſuper totam
materiam</hi> of the Evidence, or
proof on both ſides; which can
never be found and determined by
a Grand Jury, that hear but one
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51158:84"/>
ſide, for very ſeldom is matter of
Fact truly ſtated in a matter of
difficulty, by one ſide, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as before is ſaid) the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> provides, that
every Man-ſlaughter, <hi>per Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunium</hi>
or <hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> ſhall be
found <hi>per Patriam</hi> after the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
hath joyned Iſſue with the
King, and put himſelf <hi>de bono &amp;
malo,</hi> of good or evil, that is,
either for his Acquittal or Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>ſuper Patriam,</hi> to be tried
by his Country.</p>
            <p>And the Jurors of Life and
Death themſelves are not tied, as
not ſtrictly to the form of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
ſo not to the whole
matter of it; not to the form, as
it was well urged by Sergeant
<hi>Montague</hi> Reader at the Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> for
Murther, by poyſoning of Sr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Overbury</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> who
told the Jury, That <hi>they muſt not
expect viſible Proofs in a work of
darkneſs; that many things were
laid in an Indictment only for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51158:85"/>
form; that they muſt not look that
the proof ſhould follow that, but
only that which is ſubſtantial, and
the ſubſtance (in that Caſe) muſt
be this, Whether my Lord of</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet
<hi>procured, or cauſed the
poyſoning of Sr.</hi> Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
<hi>or not.</hi> The Lord <hi>Coke</hi> (then

ſaid, <hi>The Law is clear in this
point, that the Proofs muſt follow
the Subſtance, not the Form, that
the Law gives forms in Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

And yet this was ſpoken to a Jury
of Life and Death, who are more
carefully to look into Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
and Forms (becauſe their
error is incurable, if they Convict
a man to loſe his life wrongfully)
than Grand Jurors are. And I
cannot but further obſerve (in

that which I would have all

Richard Weſton (<hi>who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

venenatus, &amp;c.</hi> And albeit it did
not appear, or could appear, of
which of the ſaid poyſons he died,
yet it was Reſolved by all the
Judges of the Kings Bench, that
the Indictment was good; for the
ſubſtance of the Indictment was,
<hi>whether he was poyſoned, or not;</hi>
and it appeared that <hi>Weſton</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that time aforeſaid, had given
unto Sr. <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> divers
other poyſons, as namely the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Diamonds, Cantharides,
Lapis Cauſticus,</hi> and powder of
<hi>Spiders</hi> and <hi>Aquafortis</hi> in a Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
And it was reſolved by all
the ſaid Judges, that albeit all the
ſaid poyſons were not contained
in the Indictment, yet the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of giving them was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to maintain the Indictment,
for the ſubſtance of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was (as before is ſaid) <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were poyſoned, or not.</hi> And
when the cauſe of the Murther is
laid in the Indictment to be <hi>poyſon,</hi>
no Evidence can be given of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe, becauſe they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51158:86"/>
and other cauſes: So if the
Murther be laid by one kind of
Weapon, as by a Sword, Dagger,
Stilletto, Stick, Tobacco-pipe,
Knife, Sheers, or other like Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
it makes no difference, the

they are all under one Claſſis

Sr. <hi>Gervaſe Elwys,</hi> and <hi>Richard
Francklyn</hi> a Phyſician (Purveyor
of the Poyſons) were Indicted as
Acceſſaries before the fact done:
And it was Reſolved by all the
ſaid Judges, that either the proofs
of the poyſon contained in the
Indictment, or of any other poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(although it were out of the
Indictment) were ſufficient to
prove them Acceſſaries; for the
ſubſtance of the Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them as Acceſſaries, was,
<hi>Whether they did procure</hi> Weſton
<hi>to poyſon Sr.</hi> Thomas Overbury,
<hi>or no?</hi> So that it may be obſerved
here, what in the Caſe above was
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51158:87"/>
obſerved by the Lo. <hi>Coke,</hi> that
<hi>Jurors were not to expect a direct
and preciſe Proof in every point
laid in the Indictment;</hi> ſhewing,
how impoſſible it were to Convict
a Poyſoner, who uſeth not to take
any Witneſſes to the compoſing
of his ſlibber-ſawces; neither do
other Murtherers, to the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of their malice, and manner
of killing another, but keep the
fire burning in their own boſoms
until it break out.</p>
            <p>Nor in all Caſes of <hi>Murther</hi> is
it material, that expreſs Malice
be proved to the Jury of Life and
Death, though they be to Convict
the Priſoner, much leſs (or not
at all) is it material to prove it to
the Grand Jury, who are but to
preſent it, not to the Jury of Life
and death in any caſe where the
Law only implies it, for ſuch
proof is in the Judgment of the
Court and not in the Jury, which
the Jury muſt ſubmit unto and be
over-ruled in; much leſs is this
implied Malice to be proved to the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51158:87"/>
Grand Jury, for it lies not in the
proof of Witneſſes, but in the
conſtruction of the Law (as is
ſaid before;) and yet the Grand
Jury muſt find thoſe words, <hi>Ex
malitia praecogitata, &amp;c.</hi> as if they
were proved expreſly unto them
by Witneſſes, or otherwiſe the
Jurors of Life and Death cannot
enquire of the offence (as

yet nothing of malice can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly

yet the Indictment muſt
be expreſly drawn, and ſo
found by the Grand Jury,
with theſe words to make

is, that he killed him out

that theſe words make a new of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Felony and Murther, that
was not Felony and Murther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and ſo eſteemed in all Caſes
where it was done voluntarily and
by aſſault; and this appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge</hi>
(formerly mentioned) 35 <hi>H.</hi> 3.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51158:90"/>
where it is ſaid, <hi>Murther from
henceforth ſhall not be adjudged,
before our Juſtices, where it is
found by Misfortune only, but it
ſhall take place in ſuch as are ſlain
by Felony, and not otherwiſe.</hi> By
this Statute it is plain, that killing
one unawares, by misfortune, was
Murther before this Statute, and
that after this Statute, all other
killing, where it is Felony, ſhall
be Murther, as before this Statute,
<hi>Felony</hi> is a general term,<note place="margin">Terms of the Law, <hi>Felony</hi> 160. fol.</note> which
comprehendeth divers hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
for which the Offender
ought to ſuffer death, and loſe
their Goods and Lands. They are
called <hi>Felonies</hi> of the Latin word
<hi>Fel,</hi> which is in Engliſh <hi>Gall,</hi> in
French <hi>Feil,</hi> or of the ancient
Engliſh word <hi>Fell</hi> or <hi>Fierce,</hi> or
becauſe they are intended to be
done with a cruel, bitter, fell, fierce
or miſchievous mind.</p>
            <p>So the Statute <hi>de Officio Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natoris,</hi>
made 4 <hi>Ed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Ed. 1.</note> 1. (where the

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51158:91"/>
dead, how he ſhould behave
himſelf, which is worth his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It follows in the ſaid Act
in theſe words, <hi>And if any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be
found Culpable of the</hi> Murther,
<hi>the Coroner ſhall immediately go
to his houſe, and Inventory his

in that Act is further directed) I
only mention it to ſhew, that all

was to enquire of it, as
Murther, or otherwiſe there
could be no Inventorying of Goods,
valuing, or ſeizing of Lands, &amp;c.
or committing the Offender to the
Goal by the Coroner, as plainly
doth appear by that Act.</p>

Murther only in the County
where the party dies, and in that

caſe can bring no Appeal of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter
(as in the ſtreightned

Manſlaughter) by this Statute is
declared, That <hi>where any</hi> Murther

ſhall be committed in one

there are theſe words in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<hi>Whereas upon truſt of the

of Manſlaughter, all manner
of Felonious killing, every Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being Manſlaughter, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

they being <hi>Termini conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibiles,</hi>
equally ſignifying the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

by what hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>Felony</hi> cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<hi>Manſlaughter</hi> or <hi>Murther,</hi>
for here the one is to be burnt with
an <hi>M</hi> for Murther, the Felon with
a <hi>T</hi> for Theft, both which marks,
upon the reſpective Convictions,
are (as I conceive in thoſe Caſes)
by vertue of this Statute, obſerved
to this day, although we now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Letter <hi>M</hi> to ſuch, as the

a ſudden heat of blood, occaſioned
by an actual (not verbal) provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in him that was killed.
This contradiſtinction betwixt the

(as I conceive) came
into our Laws only ſince the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the 23 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 1. that takes

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51158:93"/>
and takes away Clergy for the
Second offence of the ſame kind,
where Clergy hath been allowed
before; and it is obſervable, that
in this Statute it is called <hi>Murther,</hi>
with, or without the words <hi>Ex

reſpect to our Modern diſtinction,
which holds only (as is ſaid) in

Robbing of Churches, Robbing of

death, (ſo great favour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
had they in thoſe times
for ſuch bloody and crying ſins)
ſo prevalent were the Clergy, and
thoſe within Holy Orders, in thoſe

Parliament, that takes away Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
from others, that commit <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Burglary,</hi> and <hi>Robbery,</hi> and
other Offences before-named, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51158:94"/>
all within Holy Orders<note n="t" place="margin">Within five years of the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, there were above a 100 Murthers by Prieſts and men within Holy Orders.</note>,
from the ſame pains and

and Indulgence continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(as they call it) until the

Statute makes none of
the former offences Felony or
Murther, that was not ſo before
the making of this Statute, but
only takes from them (that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any of theſe offences) the
benefit of their Clergy; certainly
there wanted not thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
wilful Murther of Malice
prepenſed (as we now diſtinguiſh
it) before the making of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
as thoſe that committed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
robbed perſons in their
Houſes, and upon the High-way,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51158:95"/>
wilfully fired Houſes, and Barns
with Corn, and were Abettors to
the ſaid Offences: ſo it is very
plain, that this Statute makes no
alteration as to the drawing and
penning of Indictments of <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sacriledge, Robbery, Burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,
&amp;c.</hi> but only takes away
Clergy from every perſon, who
after the making of that Statute
ſhould be found guilty (as the
words of the Act are, <hi>after the
Laws of this Land</hi>) for any of the
aforeſaid Offences. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Indictment of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was, by the Laws of this
Land, before the making of this
Act, ſo muſt it be after the making
of this Act wilful Murther, in the
Statute 32 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 12. and this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the 23. of the ſame King,
comprehends as well that which
we call <hi>Manſlaughter,</hi> and every
killing where the will of man is
freely engaged, as it doth wilful
Murther of Malice prepenſed;
compare them together, in the
one you will find Clergy taken
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51158:95"/>
away for wilful Murther of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
prepenſed, and Sanctuary from
wilful Murther, and generally
ſuch Offences as were prohibited
Sanctuary by former Statutes are
now prohibited Clergy by later
Statutes. The words <hi>Ex malitia
praecogitata, &amp; murdravit</hi> (which
now make all this conteſt) before
the making of this Statute in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
caſe of Murther, neither ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
nor extenuated the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
made it neither more nor
leſs penal. But ſince the making
of this Act, thoſe words are made
neceſſary in all Indictments and
Convictions of Murther, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
and only (in caſes of wilful
Murther) to be conſidered and
weighed by the Court and Jury of
Life and Death, upon hearing and
debating the matter, with all its
circumſtances (as hath been ſaid
before) on both ſides; thoſe words
being matter of Law, mixt with
matter of Fact, and are not to be
expunged by a Grand Jury, becauſe
they cannot afterwards be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51158:96"/>
nor implyed by the Court, and
Jury of Life and Death after the
Arraignment of the Priſoner,
ſhould there appear upon Tryal
never ſo great cauſe, yet <hi>Felonicè</hi>
and ſome other words (though
material) may be ſupplyed in a
Special Verdict. If upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
of Murther, <hi>quod Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicè
percuſſit, &amp;c.</hi> the Jury find
<hi>percuſſit tantum,</hi> yet the Verdict
is good; for the Judges of the
Court are to reſolve upon the
ſpecial matter, whether it was
<hi>Felonicè,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cok. lib. 9. 69.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or not? <hi>Coke lib.</hi> 9.
69. And if the Court adjudge it
Murther, then the Jurors, in the
concluſion of their Verdict, find
him guilty of the Murther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Indictment, and to
ſhew the power of a Jury of Life
and Death (who indeed ſhould
have the fulleſt and higheſt Charge
can be laid againſt the priſoner,

If <hi>A.</hi> be Appealed or Indicted of
Murther, <hi>viz.</hi> that he of malice

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51158:96"/>

the Jury may find <hi>A</hi> guilty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,

of malice prepenſed) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

any ſuch petty Treaſon, Felony, or
Manſlaughter by Chance-medly, the
ſame perſon ſhall enjoy a ſecond
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51158:97"/>
priviledge of Sanctuary: <hi>So that
he that committed Murther of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>

the benefit of Sanctuary a ſecond
time.</p>
            <p>Then comes the Statute of the

               <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">25 H. 8. c. 3.</note> and remedies divers
defects that were in the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Foraſmuch as
the ſaid Act extended only to ſuch
perſons as were found guilty, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the due courſe of the Laws of
this Land, divers and great Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Murtherers, Burglars, and
Felons, did commit thoſe Offences,
perceiving, and clearly underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(by the words of the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute)
that they ſhould not loſe the
benefit of Clergy, unleſs they be
found guilty, after the due courſe
of the Law, upon their Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of, and upon the ſaid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Felonies ſo by them done
and committed, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
divers of the ſaid perſons, upon
their Arraignment of the ſaid Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
and Felonies upon their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments
againſt them, would
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51158:97"/>
ſtand mute, and ſometimes chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
peremptorily over the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Twenty, or elſe would not
anſwer directly to the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments
whereupon they were
Arraigned according to Law; It
was therefore provided by this
Statute, <hi>That every perſon that
hereafter ſhould he Indicted of
petty Treaſon, wilful burning of
Houſes, Murther, Robbery, or
Burglary, or other Felony, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tenour or meaning
of the ſaid Statute of the</hi> 23 H. 8.
<hi>and thereupon Arraigned, and do
ſtand mute of malice, or froward
mind, or challenge peremptorily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the number of Twenty, or
elſe will not, or do not anſwer
directly to the ſame Indictment
and Felony whereupon he is ſo
Arraigned, ſhall loſe the benefit
of Clergy, in like manner and
form as if he had directly plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſame petty Treaſon, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Robbery, or other Felony
whereupon he is ſo Arraigned,
(not guilty) and thereupon had
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51158:98"/>
been found guilty after the Laws
of the Land.</hi> Upon the penning
of this Act it ſeems clear that
all Indictments for the unlawful
or wilful killing of any perſon,
ought to be made Murther as
they were formerly before this
Act. For if the Priſoner ſhould
be Arraigned upon an Indictment
only of Manſlaughter (according
to the now diſtinction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter)
and upon his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould ſtand mute, not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
directly, or challenge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily,
whereby he could have
no Tryal, it would be a great
queſtion, Whether he could have
Judgment upon this Act? The
words are, <hi>petty Treaſon, wilful
burning of Houſes, Murther, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
Burglary, or other Felonies;</hi>
For as it is not named here by
the term Manſlaughter, ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
(with any congruity) be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under any of thoſe
Heads: Not under the general
Head of <hi>other Felonies,</hi> after the
commemoration of ſo many ſeveral
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51158:98"/>
Felonies next before, as <hi>Burning
of Houſes, Robbery, Burglary,
and other Felonies,</hi> muſt needs be
intended of ſuch like Felonies or
Thefts. And what Judge (in caſe
of Life and Death) will proceed
upon ſuch a <hi>moot point</hi> (or rather
a clear Caſe to the contrary) to
give Judgment and Sentence of
Death upon any by this Act of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>Then comes the Statute made
in the 28 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">28 H. 8. c. 1.</note> and rehearſeth all
theſe former Statutes, <hi>viz. 22 H.
8. 23 H.</hi> 8. and the 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and
continues them all until the next
Parliament; and provides further,
<hi>That ſuch as be within Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſhall be under the ſame
pains and dangers that others be;</hi>
(all within Holy Orders being
by the 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. excepted in Caſes
of Murther, petty Treaſon, and
Felony, from the pains and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that Lay perſons ſuffered for
ſuch offences). It ſeems thoſe in
Holy Orders then began to loſe
their eſteem, as appears more
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51158:99"/>
fully in the enſuing Act, which
perpetuates the former Acts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then comes the Statute made
in</hi> 32 H. 8. c. 3.<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and rehearſeth the
ſame Acts again, and makes them
perpetual; and Enacts,</hi> That all
perſons within Holy Orders,
which by the Laws of this Realm
ought, or may have their Clergy
for any Felonies, and ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the ſame, ſhall be burnt
in the hand, in like manner as
Lay Clerks in ſuch Caſes, and
ſhall ſuffer all ſuch pains, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and forfeitures as Lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in like Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then comes the Statute of the</hi>
1 Ed. 6.<note place="margin">1 Ed. 6. c. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and after it hath declared
what Acts ſhall be Treaſon; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
what Offences ſhall be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Clergy,</hi> viz. Such perſons,
as in due form of the Laws, ſhall
be attainted or convicted of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of malice prepenſed, of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
of malice prepenſed, of
breaking of any Houſe by day or
by night (any perſon being put in
fear) robbing any perſon in or
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51158:99"/>
near the High-way, felonious
ſtealing of Horſes, Geldings, or
Mares, or for felonious taking
of any Goods out of any Pariſh
Church, or other Church or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
all Offenders in any of theſe
Caſes ſhall be excluded of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Clergy, whether they be
convicted by Verdict, Confeſſion,
or ſtand Mute, &amp;c. and that in
all other Caſes of Felony, Clergy
may be allowed. <hi>Here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of petty Treaſon, burning of
Houſes and Barns with Corn, and
Acceſſaries before, to be outed of
Clergy, as is in the</hi> 23 H. 8. c. 1.
<hi>So that it ſeems after the making
of this Act, they might have had
their Clergy; the new Offences
added to this Act to be outed of
Clergy (that were not in that
Act of</hi> 23 H. 8. <hi>are only</hi> ſtealing
of Horſes, Geldings, and Mares:
<hi>And by this Act</hi> Poyſoning <hi>is made
Murther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Poyſoning mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although no malice be proved.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:51158:100"/>
Then comes the Statute of 2
<hi>Ed.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">2 Ed. 6. c. 24.</note> and this Statute gives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
in ſeveral Caſes of Murther
and Felony (where there was
none before at Common Law).
As firſt, where one is feloniouſly
ſtricken in one County, and dies
thereof in another. Secondly,
where one is Acceſſary in one
County to a Murther, or Felony
in another County; before this
Statute, no ſufficient Indictment
in any of theſe Caſes, could
be taken in either of the ſaid
Counties; for that by the
cuſtome of the Realm, the Jurors
of the County where ſuch party
died of ſuch ſtroke, would take
no knowledge of the ſaid ſtroke
(being matter of Fact) in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
County, although the ſaid
Counties and Places adjoyned ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
near together; nor the Jurors
of the County where the ſtroke
was given, could take knowledge
of the death in another County,
although ſuch death moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
came of ſuch ſtroke; ſo that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51158:100"/>
ſuch Offence (and the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
before mentioned) for the
like reaſon remained unpuniſhed;
and ſuch Murther could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
againſt, either by way of
Indictment or Appeal: Now this
Statute provides, <hi>That an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
found by the Jurors of the
County where the death ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
whether it be found before
the Coroner, upon ſight of the dead
Body, or other Juſtices that ſhall
have power to inquire of ſuch
Offences, ſhall be as good and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
in Law, as if the ſtroke
and poyſoning had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and done in the ſame County
where the party ſhall dye, or
where ſuch Indictment ſhall be
found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And likewiſe provides,</hi> That ſuch
Party, to whom Appeal of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall be given by the Law,
may commence, take, and ſue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of Murther in the ſame
County, where the ſame perſon
ſo feloniouſly ſtricken or poyſoned
ſhall dye, as well againſt the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51158:101"/>
Principals, as againſt every Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the ſame Offences, in
whatſoever County or Place the
Acceſſary or Acceſſaries ſhall be
guilty of the ſame. <hi>And doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
provide,</hi> That where any
Murther or Felony ſhall be done
in one County, and another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or more, ſhall be Acceſſary, or
Acceſſaries, in any manner of wiſe
to any ſuch Murther or Felony
in any other County, that then an
Indictment found or taken againſt
ſuch Acceſſary, or Acceſſaries (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Circumſtances of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before the Juſtices, &amp;c.) where
ſuch Offence of Acceſſary ſhall be
committed, ſhall be as good in
Law, as if the principal Offence
had been committed in the ſame
County where the ſame Indictment
againſt ſuch Acceſſary ſhall be
found.<note place="margin">Cok. l. 9. f. 117.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may be obſerved, That
the Appeal given by this Statute
to the party, where one is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or poyſoned in one County, and
dies thereof in another, muſt be
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51158:101"/>
an Appeal of Murther, otherwiſe
it will not lye either againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
or Acceſſary by the words
of this Statute. So in caſe of an
Indictment (where it is ſaid in
this Statute, <hi>where any Murther
or Felony ſhall be committed in
one County, and the Acceſſary be
in another County</hi>) here the word
Murther muſt be one <hi>Species,</hi> and
Felony, that is Theſt, another;
<hi>viz.</hi> carrying of ſtoln Goods into
another County: So that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
in this caſe againſt the
Principal muſt be Murther, or the
Acceſſary thereto is not tryable
in another County; and there muſt
be a Certificate of ſuch Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Attainder of the Principal
under the Seals of the Juſtices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom ſuch Principal was
Convicted or Attainted, before
ſuch Acceſſary can be tryed; and
that ſhall be ſufficient to enable
the Juſtices to try the Acceſſary in
Murther or Felony in another
County. And although the word
<hi>Manſlaughter</hi> be mentioned in this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51158:102"/>
Statute (as thus, <hi>within the year
and day after ſuch Murther and
Manſlaughter committed</hi>) it is not
here mentioned, as any <hi>Species</hi> of
Murther, but only as the <hi>Genus</hi>
called in this place only Murther
and Manſlaughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then comes the Statute of the</hi>
5 Ed. 6.<note place="margin">5 Ed. 6. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and Reſolves three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Doubts or Queſtions moved
upon the Statute of the</hi> 23 H. 8.
c. 1.<note place="margin">This is not much pertinent to this purpoſe, but that it takes away Clergy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to ſeveral Statutes before mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning murther.</note> 
               <hi>The firſt Doubt was,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Clergy were taken away by
that Statute, unleſs the very Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony

in the very Chamber or Place
where the Owner, Dweller, his
Children, or Servants ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be (although they were in
ſome other part of the Houſe). <hi>The
ſecond Doubt was,</hi> If it were
done in the Chamber, and the
parties there aſleep, and ſo not
put in fear. <hi>The third Doubt
was,</hi> Where ſuch Robberies or
Felonies are committed in a Booth
or Tent in any Fair or Market,
the Owner, Children, or Servants
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51158:102"/>
being then put in fear, whether
Clergy ſhould be taken away by
that Statute in any of theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the clearing of theſe three
Doubts it was Enacted,</hi> That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſon be convicted for robbing
any in any part of their dwelling
Houſe, or dwelling Places (the
Owner, his Children, or Servants
being in any part of the ſaid Houſe
or Precincts thereof) whether
ſleeping or waking, ſuch Offender
ſhall not be admitted to his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
And ſo he that robs any Tent
or Booth, in Fair or Market,
whether the Owner, his Wife,
Children, or Servants be ſleeping
or waking in the ſame, ſhall loſe
his Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then comes the Statute made

as were made in any King's

be too much to aſſume another Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:51158:104"/>
Then the Statute made 1 <hi>Jac.

<hi>that ſhall ſtab another, that hath

in keeping the peace, or correcting
his Servant or Child.</hi> This with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all queſtion was Murther (by
malice implyed) before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of this Statute; and ſuch a
kind of killing is adjudged Murther
at this day, that is, where one
ſhall wilfully kill another (by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
weapon) without provocation
from him in deeds; for no provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in words [only] will make it
Manſlaughter, or leſs than Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And (in my judgment) it
is an Error in practice of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
upon the Statute of
Stabbing, to leave out the words
(<hi>ex malitia praecogitata</hi>) in the
Indictment: For the words of the
Statute are (<hi>although no malice
can be proved</hi>) then ſure the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51158:105"/>
meaning of the Statute is (as in
other caſes) it ſhall be implyed:
And in all Indictments, where
malice is only implyed, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expreſly be proved, thoſe
words <hi>ex malitia, &amp;c.</hi> muſt be put
into the Indictment, to make it
Murther, and to take away Clergy,
and by ſuch words the Indictment
will be good, both upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and at Common Law.</p>
            <p>And ſo are the Indictments
made againſt lewd Women that
kill their baſtard children, upon
the 21 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 27.<note place="margin">21 Jac. c. 27.</note> although the
ſpecial matter of the Statute be
put into the Indictment, <hi>viz.
That it is a baſtard Child, and
born of her body alive,</hi> yet the
words, <hi>ex malitia praecogitata,</hi>
are always put into the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which malice the Law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
although none can prove
the child born alive, and none
can be preſumed to bear malice
to a dead child: And haply it
might be born dead, or dye after
it was born, againſt the will of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51158:105"/>
Mother, of her Throwes and
Strivings, to be delivered without
help. It is not the burying of
the Child, or hiding of it, that
makes it Murther upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
(as ſome have conceived)
for if the Child be found dead in
Bed by her ſide, or in her boſome,
yet it is Murther; for the word
[<hi>conceal</hi>] in the Statute, relates
not to the Body of the Infant, but
the death of it; the words being
theſe, <hi>Shall ſo conceal the death
thereof, that it may not come to
light</hi> (that is, to the knowledge
of one Witneſs at leaſt) <hi>whether
it were born alive or not, but be
concealed, ſhe ſhall ſuffer death as
in caſe of Murther:</hi> If ſhe can
prove by one Witneſs it was born
dead, then her hiding or burying
it afterwards will not be Evidence
againſt her to take away her Life
upon that Statute.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Statutes create no
new Offence that was not Felony
and Murther before,<note place="margin">1 Jac. c. 8. 21 Jac. c. 27.</note> but only take
away Clergy in thoſe two caſes,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51158:106"/>
the one of ſudden and deſperate
ſtabbing (then frequently in uſe)
the other of lewd Whores, who
having committed one ſin, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
their ſhame, and the charge
of a Baſtard, would commit a
greater, by truſting to their own
ſtrength in their Delivery, that
they might more privately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Infant, and yet avoid
the danger of the Law, becauſe
in that caſe, none for the King
could prove the Child born alive,
and therefore it was impoſſible to
Indict and Convict her at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law for Murther, although
really and in truth it were ſo. This
Statute makes the Suppoſition good
for the King to the Grand Jury,
and Jury of Life and Death, and
to the Judgment of the Judge in
point of Law, that the Child
(ſuppoſed to be murthered) was
born<note n="x" place="margin">Note this here, the Grand Jury find as it is laid in the Indictment by the Kings Counſel, that the Child was born alive, although they have not the leaſt Evidence for it, and yet I truſt they are not forſworn.</note>

murthered, in regard ſhe being a
lewd woman, and contrary to the
Cuſtome of honeſt and innocent
women (who always deſire help
in their Labour) chuſeth to be
delivered alone, this Statute puts
the proof upon her (if ſhe will
avoid ſo ſtrong a preſumption of
Murther) to be ſure to have one
Witneſs to prove the Child was
born dead. It being likewiſe
ſtrongly preſumed, that a woman
(without help of ſome other)
cannot be delivered of a Child at
full growth dead in the Womb.</p>
            <p>Two remarkable Caſes I have
known in my time upon the ſaid
Statute of 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi>
Circuit; the one in Mr. Juſtice
<hi>Jones</hi> his time (a Learned Judge
that went Sixteen years together
that Circuit) where the Caſe was;
A cunning deſperate Fellow, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an intention to ſtab another
perſon, and yet to avoid coming
within the danger of that Statute,
had (to that purpoſe) provided
himſelf of a Dagger naked in his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51158:107"/>
Pocket (he being never known to
wear any before) came into an
Alehouſe where the party was he
intended to ſtab, and at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſed very friendly Language
unto him, but afterwards all the
provoking Language he could,
to make the other ſtrike him;
which the other no ſooner held
up his ſtick to have done, but he
ſtabb'd him into the Body with
his Dagger, whereof he dyed:
No malice could be proved, yet ſo
much of his intention by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
and circumſtances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to deſign the ſtabbing of
the other, that it was adjudged to
be within the meaning, though
not within the Letter of the
Statute, the Lord Chief Baron
<hi>Davenport</hi> being the other Judge
of that Circuit) and he was deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Clergy, and after Judgment
was Executed. It being then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the Judges, That imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the making of that
Statute, many deſperate Fellows
(that could read as Clarks) to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51158:107"/>
thoſe they had a mind to quarrel
withal) would uſe all means to
make them ſtrike firſt, and then
ſuddenly ſtab them; and by this
way avoid the ſaid Statute, and
become guilty only of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter
at Common Law, and ſo
receive the benefit of Clergy,
which the Statute takes away.
The other Caſe was in the ſame
Circuit, very lately, before Mr.
Juſtice<note n="y" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Wadham Windham, Kt. one of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Common Pleas.</note> 
               <hi>Windham,</hi> at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes
at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> a little before
his death, Where a Father cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
his Son, for ſome undutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he conceived in him (having
a Knife in his hand, being eating
his dinner) ſtruck his Son over
the back with his knife, and gave
him a ſtab whereof he died: The
Judge apprehended this Offence to
be within the Statute, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that Exception in the
Statute, of a Father correcting or
chaſtiſing his Child or Servant, in
regard it was an unreaſonable
way and means of correction:
whereupon he reprieved the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51158:108"/>
for ſome ſhort time, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
with the reſt of the Judges
at <hi>Serjeants Inn,</hi> and after he had
their Opinions that it was within
the Statute, he forthwith ſent
down a Warrant to the Sheriff to
do Execution, having received
Judgment of Death at the Aſſizes;
and yet the words of the ſaid Act
of Parliament are (<hi>although his
Son, or Servant, dye of ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
he ſhall not be within the
ſaid Act</hi>).</p>
            <p>Obſerve here how neceſſary it
is, That all the circumſtances that
can be in an offence of blood, be
put into an Indictment, and be ſo
found by the Grand Jury (as it is
adviſed by the King's Counſel)
where there is innocent blood ſhed
by the party indicted, that every
part and circumſtance of the Fact,
with all its aggravations, may
come to be conſidered and weighed
by the Court, which otherwiſe
cannot be; as in this Caſe of the
Father killing his Son, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
had not been drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51158:108"/>
the Statute, but at Common
Law, in regard of that Exception
in the Statute (as the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
then would have had it) the
party had been capable of Clergy,
and ſo might have eſcaped that
Judgment of Death. If ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
appear to the Learned
Judges, upon due conſideration of
the Law, and of all circumſtances
in caſes of blood, how much more
will it prove difficult to Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors?
and how little reaſon have
they to expunge, alter, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
circumſtances of aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in ſuch an Indictment, upon
hearing only of one ſide, as they
pleaſe, and ſo prevent the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Court therein, taking
from them the power, even to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
ſuch a circumſtance, as may
(if truly ſtated and examined)
rule the whole Caſe, as before is
obſerved.</p>
            <p>In all the Offences formerly
mentioned, where Clergy is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away by thoſe Statutes, there
is no new offence of Felony or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51158:109"/>
made, that was not ſo before
the making of thoſe Laws, as might
be inſtanced in Murther, Robbery,
Burglary, Sacriledge, Cutting of
Purſes, Stealing of Horſes, Rape,
and the like; but only Clergy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from the Offender
(which is no more but the abuſive
bloody liberty of Clerks in thoſe
times reſtrained) as wilful Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where malice appeared, and
other mixt and ſimple Felonies,
which were then moſt raging and
reigning Offences in the Kingdom,
and cryed out for a greater Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
a ſtricter Law to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them (as appears by the
Preambles of thoſe Statutes that
take away Clergy in thoſe Special
Caſes) that were Murther and
Felony at the Common Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
from whence I conclude,
that the Forms of Indictments of
Felony or<note n="z" place="margin">The name of Murther was not changed, but the Law retains it continually for the heinouſneſs of the Crime. <hi>Stamford fol.</hi> 19. If not the name, then not the words that make it ſo.</note> 
               <hi>Murther,</hi> are no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51158:109"/>
way directed to be altered by
thoſe Statutes that take away
Clergy, but are to continue in the
ſame form as they did before
at the Common Law. And I am
not of their Opinion, That the
words (<hi>ex malitia praecogitata</hi>)
came into Indictments immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after the aforeſaid Statute of
23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">23 H. 8.</note> Certainly there were
Murthers committed, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
of malice fore-thought,
before the making of that Statute,
and thoſe Murtherers had their
Clergy alſo; otherwiſe that Statute
had never been made to take it
away. If the Grand Jurors ſhall
ſay, <hi>They will not find thoſe words,</hi>
Ex malitia praecogitata, <hi>put into the
Indictment, except the malice be
plainly proved to them;</hi> then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
that diſtinction and inference
of implied malice, which the Law
makes, in many Caſes, and which
otherwiſe cannot be made; they
may as well ſay, <hi>That they will
not find ſuch words Treaſon,
that are Treaſonable, becauſe no
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51158:110"/>
Act of Parliament, or expreſs
Caſe at Common Law, ſays
thoſe particular words are Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
or that they will find no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
of Burglary, although
the Goods ſtoln be found with the
Thief, and the dwelling Houſe
broke, becauſe no Witneſs ſtood
by to ſee the breaking of the Houſe,
entring into it, and ſtealing thence
the Goods: Or againſt a Cut-purſe,
though the Purſe or Mony be found
in his hand, or becauſe none ſee
him take it forth of his Pocket;
or to find the Indictment, becauſe
it is laid to be done</hi> Vi &amp; armis,
<hi>with force and arms, and yet ſaid
to be done (in the ſame Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
clam &amp; ſecrete, &amp; ſine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia)
<hi>privily, ſecretly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
notice of the party, which
(in Fact) could not be done if it
were done by force or arms: Or
to find an Indictment of Robbery
done upon the High-way, againſt
thoſe that rob in Vizards, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the mony be owned,
and found about them, becauſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51158:110"/>
the party cannot ſwear he ſaw
their faces, and that theſe were
the men: Or that ſuch a one kill'd
a man, that comes out laſt from
him with a bloody Sword in his
hand, and no perſon beſides with
him.</hi> In all theſe Caſes it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
the Parties accuſed might
find the Goods ſtoln; and ſo might
the bloody Sword be ſound, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
do the Fact; but ſure here
is great and violent preſumption
(ſufficient for an Accuſation) for a
Grand Jury to find an Indictment
(which is but an Accuſation upon
Record) to bring the Delinquent,
or Party ſo ſtrongly ſuſpected, to
a Judicial Trial; and as well may
it be preſumed, when one Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is kill'd by another, it may be
Murther, that there may be a ſeed
of malice in the will of him that
did it, by a voluntary and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous
motion in that act, that
may (upon a greater Debate)
contain ſome circumſtance in it,
that by ſome reaſon in Law (bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known to the Learned Judge,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51158:111"/>
than the Grand Jurors) that may
in Law prove malice expreſſed or
implyed in the criminous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>And if it be ſo difficult in caſes of
blood for Grand Jurors to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what is Murther, and what
is not, let them conſider how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a thing it is for them to
miſcarry in their Preſentment in
caſes of blood, of innocent blood
(as is before manifeſted) and ſo
acquit the Murtherer, and take
the imputation of blood-guiltineſs
with them, from the Aſſizes to
their reſpective Families, where
it may and will cry againſt them
and the whole Kingdom for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:
I do therefore ſubmit it
to their ſerious conſideration, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what hath been ſaid, Whether
it be not much better, and a ſafer
way for them, to ſubmit their
Judgments herein to the Rule of
Law, and the Reſolutions of the
Learned Judges, than by their
extenuating preſentment (for the
Court can go no higher than they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51158:111"/>
preſent) to ſtifle Juſtice in the
birth, and to acquit a Murtherer:
For the Indictment, although no
part of the Trial, yet is the very
Baſis and Foundation of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proceedings. And let them
conſider how ſtrict (formerly) the
very Law of <hi>England</hi> was in King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Second's time in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of blood, where the very will
and intent to kill a man (although
it was not executed) was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Deed) although the
party wounded recovered of his
wounds.</p>
            <p>A memorable Caſe there was
in that King's Reign,<note place="margin">Stamf. fol. 17. Pl. Coron. Tit. Coron. Fitz. V. 15 Ed. 2. p. 383.</note> cited by
Juſtice <hi>Stamford,</hi> where one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
the death of another, and
did ſo grievouſly wound him, that
he left him for dead, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the party recovered; this
was then adjudged Murther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his will appeared ſo plainly
to have kill'd him. For, as <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi>
ſays, <hi>In maleficiis ſpectatur
voluntas, &amp; non exitus,</hi> then was
the Will by our Law (as it is yet
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51158:112"/>
before God) reputed for the Deed:
But now our Law couples the
Will and the Act together in caſes
of blood; but looks more upon
the Act than the Will: For though
the Will do neither intend the
Act (as it is done) nor approve
of it (after it is done) yet if the
Will in any part of the Act be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous,
it makes the Offender
(in our Law) in caſes of blood,
guilty of the whole Fact, with all
the obliquity and evil in it. As if
a man intend only to beat another,<note place="margin">Vid. Tit. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morat. p. 331, 350.</note>
to ſtrike him, but not to kill him,
and the party die of the ſtroke, it
may be murther in him that gave
the ſtroke.<note place="margin">Hales &amp; Petit Caſe le Com. 261. a.</note> So if three men come
to make a Diſſeiſin, and one of
the three kill a man, the other
two perſons are guilty, as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
in the murther, although they
neither conſent to it, will it, or
ſtrike the Party, nor came with
that intent, but only were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to have done another Act.
So if one,<note place="margin">18 El. Pl. 474.</note> to kill his Wife, give her
(lying ſick) Poyſon in a roaſted
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51158:112"/>
Apple, and ſhe eating a little of
it, give the reſt to a little Child of
theirs, which the Husband (leſt
he ſhould be ſuſpected) ſuffereth
the Child to eat, who dieth of
the ſame poyſon, this is murther
though the Wife recover; for the
Poyſon miniſtred upon malice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
to one, which by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency
procureth the death of
another whom he meant not to
kill, nor bear any malice to,
ſhall be as great an Offence as if
it had taken the effect which he
meant, proceeding from a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and malicious intent. So where
two men combat together, upon
the evil and provoking words of a
woman, and the one killeth the
other, the woman in this caſe was
Arraigned of the death of him
that was kill'd; and in this Caſe
the Grand Jurors found it mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So if an ignorant perſon
take upon him to give Phyſick to
one that is not well, and through
his ignorance adminiſtreth that
unto him that (apparently) kills
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51158:113"/>
him, this is murther. And ſo
it might be inſtanced in many ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar
Caſes, which are not to be
diſputed by Grand Jurors, but
preſented by them <hi>in re. forma,</hi>
as the Indictment is adviſed by
the King's Council, and comes to
their hands, where they find (as
before is ſaid) a criminous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Indictment, and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(found) of a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
certainly, or probably kill'd
by him, although the Evidence

the number of twenty Jurors pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily

Indicted or Appealed only for
Manſlaughter (which is not named
in this Act, nor can be rationally
comprehended in the word <hi>Felony</hi>
more than Murther might have
been) may not challenge thirty
five Jurors, as at Common Law?
ſo it may be a <hi>quaere,</hi> where the
Priſoner Indicted only of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,
ſhall ſtand mute, or will
not anſwer directly to the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether notwithſtanding he
ſhall not have his Clergy? for the

other Statutes that take away
Clergy from ſuch offences and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
(as are therein mentioned)
take it away as well from ſuch as

            <p>The Judgment of <hi>Paine fort

That <hi>notorious Felons, openly
known of evil name, who will not
put themſelves upon Enqueſts of
Felonies, which men do proſecute
at the Kings ſuit, ſhall be put in
hard and ſtrong Priſon, as they
which refuſe to be tried by the
Law of the Realm; but this is not
to be intended of Priſoners which
be taken of light Suſpicion.</hi> By

            <p>It is the ſevereſt Judgment
(that I know) the Law paſſes

the one is,</hi> The general liberty,
and conſtant practice Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
have taken ever ſince the
making of the ſaid Statute of the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51158:119"/>
23 <hi>H.</hi>
               <note place="margin">23 H. 8. c. 1.</note> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. to find, as they pleaſe,
either <hi>Murther</hi> or <hi>Manſlaughter;</hi>
not as the Indictment comes to
their hands from the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
but as they apprehend the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that is brought to them,
taking upon themſelves not only
the ſole Judgment of the Fact, and
what the Law is that ariſeth
upon the ſaid Fact, taking the
Judgment of the Law therein
from the Court (although they
hear but one ſide) and putting in
and putting out what they pleaſe
in ſuch Indictments, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it appears to them the
party Indicted is guilty of ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Innocent blood, varying the
ſpecies of Murther and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter
as they pleaſe, until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Arraignment of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
it be too late to amend it, as I
have often known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other Objection is (and

and authority in Law againſt
what hath been ſaid</hi>) That Mr.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51158:119"/>
               <hi>The Pleas of the Crown,</hi> is of
another opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Grand
Jury may find the Special matter
in the Indictment; that is to ſay,
that the Priſoner killed the other
<hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> or <hi>per Infortunium,
&amp;c.</hi> which the party upon his
Arraignment may either confeſs,
or eſtrange himſelf from the fact,
and plead, Not guilty.</p>
            <p>To the firſt Objection, as to the
<hi>liberty and practice of Grand
Jurors to the contrary ſo long uſed,</hi>
I Anſwer, It hath been before in
this Treatiſe ſufficiently made out,
the great Inconvenience and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
in Caſes of Blood, that is
the conſequence of ſuch practice,
and that being granted (as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied) I ſuppoſe no wiſe
man will think, that the long
practice of ſuch an Errour will
juſtifie it, or encourage the longer
continuance of it, in the higheſt
Courts of Law and Juſtice, and
in ſo high and tender an Offence
as the diſquiſition of Blood is,
although in Inferiour County
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51158:120"/>
Courts, where (many times) are
ignorant Judges, and mean Clerks;
and in ordinary Offences this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime
may hold good, that <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Error facit Jus,</hi> that the
common practice of an Error
makes it the Law of the Court,
and not convenient to be altered;
yet I have never obſerved that
Maxime to take place in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Courts of Juſtice in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
before the Judges of the
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Juſtices of
Oyer and Terminer, Juſtices of
Goal-delivery, and Juſtices of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize,
who ſit not to practice, but
to correct and deſtroy Errors of
all kinds, eſpecially in Trials of
mens Lives, in Caſes of Blood, and
whoever ſhall urge that Maxime
againſt what I have here ſaid,
doth by that ſufficiently grant,
what I have here endeavoured
to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> the errour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of ſuch practice,
which ought no more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
than a long cuſtome, when
it is found to be unreaſonable;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51158:120"/>
but I ſhall never allow (neither
can it be proved) that there hath
been in this Kingdom ſuch liberty
and practice, allowed and indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Reverend and Learned
Judges to Grand Jurors, to find
and alter Indictments brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in caſes of Blood, as they
themſelves pleaſe and judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
they being (as hath been
ſaid before) not the Judges, nor
the Triers, but Preſenters of a
fact of Blood, fit for the Judgment
of the Jury of Life and Death,
who only are the proper Judges of
the Fact; for none can be ſaid to
be proper Judges of any Fact in
Controverſie that hear but one
ſide, for Grand Jurors hear no
more, and therefore ought in
Law, Reaſon, and Conſcience
(where they find a guilty perſon
that hath had his hands in Blood,
and unjuſtly taken away the Life
of another perſon) to leave it (as
an entire fact of Murther) to the
Trial and Verdict of the ſecond
Jury to find the truth of the Fact
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51158:121"/>
(upon hearing of both ſides, and
receiving the Judgment of the
Court) in what ſpecies or degree
of Murther it is, which likewiſe
if any doubt or point of Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
in the Caſe (as many times it
doth) they may find it ſpecially
(which a Grand Jury cannot) and
thereupon receive the opinion of
all the Judges of <hi>England (Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
being the Genus of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Species) and in common
acceptation, he is accounted a
Murtherer that kills any man, or
reaſonable Creature unlawfully;
and the Commandment is, <hi>Thou
ſhalt do no Murther,</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
comprehends all unlawful
killing, otherwiſe that command
is not well tranſlated from the
Text, <hi>Non Occides, Thou ſhalt
not Kill;</hi> and in my own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
for above forty and five
years in one Circuit, I have
very often known many Learned
Judges, ſuch as Mr. Juſtice <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deridge,</hi>

<hi>Davenport,</hi> Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:51158:121"/>
Mr. Juſtice <hi>Whitlock,</hi> and many
others, often rebuke and reject
the Preſentments of Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
in Caſes of Blood, and other
Felonies, where they have either
varied from their Evidence, or
from the Law, the Judges before
hand having received ſome light
of the nature and teſtimony of the
Fact, from the Informations and
Examinations therein delivered
into the Court by the Juſtices of
the Peace and Coroners (a very
good Rule for Judges to obſerve)
and often either put it upon an
open Evidence in Court (which is
very inconvenient) or diſcharged
them of ſuch a Bill, and bound
the Witneſſes over to the next
Aſſizes (which is alſo very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient)
in regard Witneſſes may
die, or the Priſoner may die, and
ſo the Forfeiture is loſt, and the
offence unpuniſhed; and in Caſes
of Blood there will be too much
opportunity given for compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and making an Intereſt with
the Proſecuter and Witneſſes;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51158:122"/>
and in theſe modern times, ſince
the happy return of our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Sovereign, King <hi>CHARLES</hi>

learned and pious Judges, ſome
ſince dead, others yet living, and

ſeveral Grand Jurors for their

               <hi>whereas the Statute of</hi> Glouc. c. 9.
<hi>ſaith, That he ought to put himſelf
in an Inqueſt</hi> de bono &amp; malo,
<hi>this is only intended</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>when he is Indicted of</hi> Murther
<hi>or</hi> Manſlaughter, <hi>and not where in

Special matter is found</hi> (as if the
Grand Jury may find eſpecial Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict)
<hi>of</hi> per Infortunium, <hi>or</hi> ſe
defendendo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer to this
Objection, Certainly Mr. Juſtice
<hi>Stamford</hi> (though a very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man) did well conſider this
matter, and his Opinion therein,
when he ſet it down; for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
you not what ſhall become
of ſuch an Indictment, where on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Special matter is found by
the Grand Jury, whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may Traverſe it (for it is but a
Treſpaſs) or confeſs it, and ſo
have his Pardon of Courſe upon
ſuch confeſſion, and then the Judges
that are to make the Report or
Certificate of the nature of the
fact to the King in <hi>Chancery,</hi> muſt
Certifie like blind and deaf men,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51158:123"/>
that never ſaw or heard any thing
of the merit of the cauſe, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
any thing by evidence of
the nature and circumſtance of the
Fact; like the Lay-zealot, muſt
believe as the Prieſt believes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Obedience before Truth;
but ſure no prudent and pious
Judge will make ſuch a blind Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
in caſe of Blood.</p>
            <p>Beſides, whoever ſhall judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and impartially compare and
weigh the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge</hi>
and the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and the reaſons of the
Statute of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
it was made to prevent, and
conſider but the nature of the
thing, will never be of his Opinion
in this particular, there is ſo little
of reaſon or true meaning of either
of thoſe Statutes in it. The words of
the Statute of <hi>Marlebr.</hi> are theſe,
<hi>Murther from henceforth ſhall not
be judged before our Juſtices,
where it is found Misfortune.</hi> In
the time of this Statute, it ſeems,
there were two Juries, the Grand
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51158:123"/>
Jury, and the Jury of Life and
Death, to preſent and try the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of Murther, otherwiſe the
Juſtices could not judge of it, they
never paſſing Judgment upon a
Grand Juries preſentment; which,
by the way, ſhews, that it is left
to the Judges (not the Grand Jury)
upon the examination of the cauſe
in trial by the Jury of Life and
Death, to judge of the nature and
circumſtances of Murther, and of
what ſpecies or degree it is. This
Statute of <hi>Marlebridge</hi> did only
declare a new Law, that where it
was found <hi>per Infortunium,</hi> or
<hi>ſe defendendo,</hi> it ſhould not be Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
and Murther as it was before
that Statute; but that the party
in ſuch caſe ſhould have (upon
Certificate of the Juſtices before
whom he was tried) his Pardon
of courſe; happily then, upon the
Preſentment of the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which might be the occaſion
of this erroneous Opinion of this
Learned Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:51158:124"/>
Then comes the Statute of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
as if the other had not been
truly underſtood, or at leaſt had
not ſufficiently provided for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Blood, and in plain words
(as before is mentioned) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<hi>That he that kills a man
by misfortune, or in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or in any other manner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Felony, ſhall be put in Priſon
until the coming of the Juſtices in
Eyre, or Juſtices of Goal-delivery,
and ſhall put himſelf upon the</hi>
Country <hi>for good and evil,</hi> that is,
<hi>for life and death,</hi> which cannot
poſſibly be underſtood where the
Grand Jury find it but <hi>per Infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
or <hi>ſe defendendo, &amp;c.</hi> for that
is not Felony, and ſo cannot be
Arraigned thereupon, whereby to
put himſelf <hi>de bono &amp; malo,</hi> ſo as
to bring the matter to Iſſue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the King; nor can
the Judge in that caſe (as is ſaid
before) make a true and right Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
of the offence and matter
of fact, which muſt be ſpecially
and truly certified according to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51158:124"/>
Law, whereby to procure a pardon,
as that Statute expreſly requires.
And if the party ſhall plead <hi>Not
guilty</hi> to that Special matter found
by the Grand Jury, what can that
ſignifie (as before hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
for the Jury that is charged
with ſuch Indictment, muſt either
find the party guilty in Special
manner, as it was found before by
the Grand Jury (and that makes
too ſpecially Verdicts;) or elſe
generally <hi>Not guilty;</hi> if they find
him guilty of the Special matter
(as the Grand Jury found before
them) and the Judge and Court
ſhall afterwards adjudge (as they
may, having heard the Evidence)
that <hi>ſuper totam materiam,</hi> it is
either Murther or Manſlaughter;
then no Judgment of Death or
Clergy can be given upon that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
or Verdict, but all muſt
be tried over again, and a new
Circuit of buſineſs upon a ſecond
Indictment of Murther or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter;
and how dilatory and
idle would this be at an Aſſizes, in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51158:125"/>
courſe of Juſtice, and in caſe of
Blood.</p>
            <p>If Judge <hi>Stamford</hi> were alive
again (although a perſon of great
Learning and Judgment) he would
ſurely (with ſome other Errors in
that book) recant this; neither
is it of any advantage to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
to have it found Specially
by the Grand Jury, for he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
plead either ſuch an Acquittal
or Conviction in Bar to an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Murther or Manſlaughter
in the ſame caſe (as before is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;)
and whoever ſhall read and
well conſider this ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
written by Judge <hi>Stamford,</hi> in
<hi>The Pleas of the Crown,</hi> wherein
this Opinion is, eſpecially towards
the end of it, when he comes to
obſerve the Letter of the Statute
of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and how the Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate
of ſuch a Pardon of courſe
ſhall be obtained, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hold his firſt Opinion in that
Chapter (for the Special matter
to be found in the Indictment) to
be very inconſiderately expreſſed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51158:125"/>
for the reaſons aforeſaid. And
why may not this Learned Judge
(for <hi>humanum eſt Errare</hi>) miſtake
