            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is (right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
condition of
all Christians,
howsoeuer disioyned in place,
that they are militant in
one warfare against Sathan
with his Principalities, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and spirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
whose stratagems are
<pb facs="tcp:15499:3"/>
innumerable, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his assaults manifold:
he troubleth not all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
one manner of way; for
so euery one might easily espie
wherein his strength lyeth,
but makes choise of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as by long experience
he hath learned it may bee
most effectuall to worke vpon
our naturall disposition. Like
as on the other hand, the
Grace by which God streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth
his Children to resist
him, is much more manifold;
whereby they are instructed
to vse the Armour of God,
with such variety of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wisedome, that is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to see, how by one and
<pb facs="tcp:15499:3"/>
the selfesame sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods
word, at sundry hands, sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
manner of wayes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
is confounded: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is very needfull that
in the spirituall warfare
there should be a mutuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
among the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Christ, as well for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering
of Sathans seuerall
sleights in assaulting; for the
more his policie is detected,
the better may we eschew it;
as also, for the manifestation
of GODS rich mercy in
assisting.</p>
            <p>For this cause haue I been
induced to communicate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, these Meditations,
as it pleased God by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb facs="tcp:15499:4"/>
to communicate them
vnto me, for in the middest
of darknesse which couered
the mind, and restlesse feare
which disquieted the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the Lord made them so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
to breake out, like
sparkles of light, sent from
his owne Throne of Grace,
bringing with them light,
peace, and ioy, which in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
remoued the former
feares, and pacified the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations
of my troubled
soule. As they were vnto me,
so I wish they may be meanes
of comfort vnto others: but
I know that the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of comfort, which hath
comforted one in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:15499:4"/>
doth not alwaies comfort
another: Nay, not in the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
temptation; for the
Lord will haue his praise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
to himselfe, that hee
onely is the God of al comfort.
It is not the word, (saith
<hi>Dauid</hi>) but God by the word
that did quicken him, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 9. Yea, the most comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
promise of the Gospell is
most terrible to the troubled
conscience, except the Lord
by it worke in the heart a
sence of his mercy: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such as want comfort,
let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seeke it from the God
of comfort. Neuerthelesse,
that which we haue, we giue
euen as we haue receiued it;
<pb facs="tcp:15499:5"/>
that it may stand as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall
of my thankfulnes to
God who shewed his great
mercy vpon me, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my selfe I had receiued the
sentence of death; and a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of my loue toward
them who are militant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sathan: And specially

with the one eye,
thou lookest to thy sins, &amp;
my Fathers iustice: &amp; with
the other lookest not to
me; in whome his iustice is
satisfied, and thy sins pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
already. Tell me (I
pray thee) thinkest thou to

of thy dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
which shall exempt thee
from the feare of his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice?
Or art thou content
to seeke it in me? If in thy

what thou art do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
wilt thou haue the

sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his mercy saued thee
not? if no miserie were in

his mercy be manifested?
and if thy disposition in

should be, then what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth,
but that the prais
of his mercy should fall to
the ground? turne thee
therefore to mee, and
seeke thy life in mee.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt know what is
thine: thou art a sinner; let
my praise bee reserued to
my selfe, I am thy Sauiour.
Esteemest thou that my
wounds are ineffectuall?
or that there is no force in
my sufferings? countest
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15499:12"/>

that my merit and vertue

Phisicion powre out a

where no need is; or else,
where it cannot profit? and
thinkest thou, that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his iustice was satisfied

bloud of Christ; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which

such a sense of mercy, as

mouth with song of

Haue I not made thee to

for thy sins, which
hath broken out into

               <p>Remembrest thou not

                  </gap>, when both

filled thy heart with the

against me? &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
many times of thy weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
thou hast offended,
did I not with a melting

raise thee againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
my former familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with thee; so that thou
canst neuer say, from the
first houre that I begun to
renew thee, that I suffered
thee to lie in thy sin, as I
haue done others that are
strangers from my grace?
And many moe notable
effects of my working in
thee thou canst not deny.</p>
               <p>Are not these the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
tokens of my

according to the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

downe when thou lookest
to thine owne corruption;
I finde no fault with thee,
but I reioyce, &amp; am glad
at the new Workmanship
which I haue begunne in
thee. Indeed, if there were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15499:15"/>
nothing in thee, but that
which thou hast of nature,
thy estate were miserable:
but seeing thou seest a new
workmanship in thee, be
comforted: art thou so in
darknesse, that there is no
light in thee? or doth sin
so possesse thee, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
it, also there is not in
thee a will to do good, &amp;
a loue to righteousnesse? If
thou saist thou hast no sin
in thee, thou art a lier: and
if thou saist that there is no
other thing in thee but sin,
thou art also a lier. And
thinkest thou, that seeing I
haue begunne to translate
thee from darknes into my

thou that I will leaue thee,
vntil I haue done my work
in thee? Therefore, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
giue not such eare
to Sathan, or thine owne
corruption, as to take their
testimonie against me, or
to make thee thinke that
my pledges which I haue
giuen thee, are not worthy
of credit, that by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou
shouldest be assured of
mercy.</p>

It is for thee, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

returne vnto thee: for if I
come, it is for thy consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that continuall heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
through thy manifold

oppresse thee. How oft
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15499:17"/>
hast thou found this, when
thou wert sicke of loue, I
haue strengthened thee
with the Flagons of my

and with my right hand I

Had my Seruant St. <hi>Paul</hi>

&amp; hast not thou need
that by thy inward exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

were alwayes present with

thy heauen &amp; permanent
City were on the earth, &amp;
so cease to enquire for a

take the place of thy

banishment for thy home;
and the earnest for the
principall summe which I
haue promised thee. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this wisely with thy

not alike on thee at all
times, &amp; fil thee not alway
with my ioyes, yet I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
loue thee: for whom
I loue, I loue vnto the end.
If I close the dore of my
Chamber vpon thee, it is
not to hold thee out, but
to learne thee to knock. If
I couer my selfe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vailes, that thou canst

onely to stirre thee vp to

seeke me: &amp; if sometime I

is to prouoke thee to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

to heauen, where thou
shalt inioy me without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission.

he againe so louing, that
when hee saw them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
his affection was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,

grace they haue gotten, it

Seeke not therefore that
in the earth, which I haue

in this life stands not in a

               <p>NOw concerning the

in the apprehension and
the application of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises:
remember that I
am he who will not breake

what smaller thing is there

albeit the measure

               <p>A louing Father will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

the faith of my seruant <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
was very weak, as thou
maist perceiue by the
great feare he conceiued
of <hi>Esau,</hi> yet his weak faith
was able to hold me till I
blessed him? Be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
discouraged; for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15499:26"/>
thou canst not lay hold
on me with the hand of
strong faith, if thou canst
but touch the hem of my
garment with thy finger,
thou shalt draw vertue out
of me. Consider also with
thy selfe, that the Faith of
my children is neuer grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then when their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is weakest, and least
perceiued. It is easie for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one to beleeue in the
middest of glorious fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and vnspeakeable
ioyes; but when a man can
feele no sensible comfort
in mee, and yet beleeueth
in mee, and waiteth on me
for comfort, certainely the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15499:27"/>
Faith of that man is great:
and such was the Faith of
my seruant, who in his
greatest trouble gaue mee
this answere, <hi>Albeit thou
wouldest slay me, O Lord,
yet</hi> both against sence &amp;
feeling <hi>will I trust in thee.</hi>
And did not also that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Canaan with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
Faith cleaue to
my mercy, euen then,
when she had no feeling
of mercy, and I gaue her
no fauourable answer? for
which in the end I called
her faith, a great Faith.</p>

               <p>O deceitfull Serpent!
if I haue found such errour
arising of those sinnes, which
foolishly I did by thy intise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
what should I haue
found, if I had followed thee
in all the rest, from the
which, the LORDS pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15499:30"/>
mercies did keepe
mee? I haue learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that thou art a
faithlesse Traitor; thou dost
tempt a man to sinne, and
for the same sinnes, which he
did by thy instigation, thou
art the first that doth accuse
him.</p>
               <p>The Lord confirme this
good purpose of my heart,
that I neuer harken any
more to thy lying words,
and suffer not my Soule to
bee circumuented with thy
deceitfull snares. And as
for the worke of my saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
seeing it is a worke that
my GOD will worke in
despite of thee, wherefore
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15499:31"/>
shall I regard thy testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie?
Thou didst put it in
question to my Sauiour, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no he was the Sonne
of GOD: and what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
if thou darest say to
his Children, that they are
none of his? Is there any
truth so vndoubted, but thou
darest deny it at any
time? why therefore shall
I enter into disputing with
thee any more? My salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
standeth neither in thy
questioning, nor in any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
but vpon the Lords
vnchangeable decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
               <p>If thou shouldest speake
for mee, yet should I not bee
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15499:31"/>
the better; neyther if thou
speake against me, am I the
worse. When thou didst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that Iesus was the
Sonne of GOD, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
thee, and thought it
no honour to him to haue thy
testimonie. When thou
didst cry out, that <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas</hi> were the seruants of
the most high GOD, albeit
thou spakest the truth, yet
did thy not accept of thy
testimonie: so although
thou wouldest say to mee, that
I were the elect Child of
GOD, shall I thinke my
