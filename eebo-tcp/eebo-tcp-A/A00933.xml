            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the yeare of our Lord 1583, vpon
the euen of the glorious S. Iohn
Baptiſt, the Marques <hi>Santa-cruz</hi>
departed out of the riuer of the Citie of <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi>
with fyue great ſhippes called Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
and two Galiazes, twelue Gallayes,
30 bigge ſhips, 12 Pataxes, and 15 Zabras,
14 Caruels of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and ſeuen flat bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
barkes to land people: and in all theſe
ſhippes were 8976 ſouldiers, Spaniardes,
Almaynes, and Italions of the companye of
the mayſters of the field, <hi>Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lope de Figue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roa,
Don Françiſco de Bobadilla,</hi> &amp; <hi>Don Iuan
de Sandouall:</hi> And hee that was Coronell of
the Almaynes, was the Earle <hi>Geronimo de
Lodron:</hi> And the Italions vpon the charge
of <hi>Luſio Pinatelo:</hi> &amp; ouer a company of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,
was Captaine <hi>Don Felix de Aragon.</hi>
And there were of Mariners 3823: ſo that
there was in all 12799. and 50 particuler
Gentlemen, and 86 others retayned amongſt
them, and they had ſixe monthes vittayles.
And at ſuch time as this armie did ſet ſayle,
and was going foorth to the Sea, the ſippe
called <hi>Santa Maria del Socorro,</hi> did ſtrike vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the catchippes againſt caſt Calles: in the
which ſhippe was the companye of <hi>Don Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guell
<pb facs="tcp:16302:3"/>
de Cordona,</hi> &amp; were conſtrayned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to returne agayne into their Port. And
Sonday being the 26, for that the tyme and
weather did ſeeme to be pleaſant and calme,
the Marques was fully reſolued, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
to ſend the twelue Galies before, in
the charge and gouernment of the Captayne
<hi>Diego de Mediano.</hi> And Monday being the
27 daye, the Vdder of the ſhippe called <hi>Santa
Maria de Acoſta,</hi> did fall from her, for that it
was not well ſet: and ſtraighte waye they
tooke out of her all the people ſhe had, &amp; put
them into the Pataxes &amp; caried them aſhore:
and ſo all the army did follow their vyage,
with very ſcaſe windes, all vpon the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyne,
till it was Wedneſday the 17 of Iuly,
that they did diſcouer the Iland of <hi>S. Mighel.</hi>
And vppon the Thurſeday <hi>Don Iorge Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
he that was generall ouerſeer of al the
hoſt and armye, went before in a ſmall Pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe
for to view the company of the Mayſter
of the field <hi>Auguſtin Inigues,</hi> and to ordayne
his imbarking in the twelue Gallies which
ariued there the fift day of the ſame moneth,
at the citie of <hi>Punta Delgada.</hi> And to ordain
all the Artillery and Moiles for to draw and
cary them, with munitions and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
belonging: and likewiſe to make in a
<pb facs="tcp:16302:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
readineſſe the barkes and other thinges fitte
for the vyage. All the whole Nauie was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at ſea with calmes &amp; windes that came
of the Ilande, and could not by anye meanes
come to an anker, in which time the Viſead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
did gather togeather al the reſt of the
Nauie, till the thirteenth of the month, at
whithe time they came to an Anker at the
towne of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illafranca,</hi> and citie of <hi>Punta Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gada,</hi>
in ſight and diſtaunce the one from the
other foure leagues. And from thence the
Marques did paſſe in one of the Gallies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Punta delgada,</hi> to vnderſtande the ſtate of
the Ilande, as well as the imbarking of the
2300 Souldiers, whiche they founde in the
muſter of the companye of <hi>Auguſtin Iniguez.</hi>
And becauſe that the winde was contrarye,
he ſtayde his going till it was thurſeday the
22 of Iulye, and came thither with all the
whole Nauy together on the Saturday, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the 24 of the ſayd moneth, at nine a clock
of the day: and came to an anker in the play
of the Towne of <hi>Sanſebaſtian</hi> of the Ilande of
<hi>Tercera,</hi> nigh vnto the Artilery of the Forts,
who did ſhoote many Canons at the Galyon
wherein the Marques was, and likewiſe at
the reſt of the Nauye as they entred in, for
that the Ilande was fortifyed rounde aboute
<pb facs="tcp:16302:4"/>
with Fortes and Trenches, and very much
people to defend them. And ſtraighte waye
the Marques did ſende a particuler ſouldier
with a Trumpet, to offer vnto the Frenche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
&amp; Naturalles the pardon and grace that
he would giue them of their liues and goods
as captayne generall: And to giue vnto the
ſtrangers ſhipping and leaue for to departe
with their Enſigns, Armour, Drumme, and
Flute: and he caryed with him the pattents
and pardons in writing, the tenour &amp; fourme
whereof is as followeth.</p>

It is well knowne to all, that his

the <hi>Indies, Orientalles,</hi> and of all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands

<pb facs="tcp:16302:4"/>
but forgetting their duetye herein,
and farre from this acknowledging, there be
ſome of theſe ſayd Ilandes that hath admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into their company, people whiche doeth

in cuſtomes and religion, and hath conſpyred

yet for all this, his catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
being moued with a chriſtian zeale, and
vſing his accuſtomed cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in the ſeruice

to auoyde effuſion of blood, conſidering that

the offence that they doe vnto God, by
the greate inſolence of the Rebels, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

the ryall conſcience, the breuitie to put

eyes this liuely example of diſobedience, for
that he hath procured by all meanes poſſible

your fault will be the greater, for that

men, all which did ariue at this Iland
the two and twenty day of Iune, in this yere
of 1583 with pattents of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Fraunce,
for that the intention of the king and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly
of his mother was to haue theſe Ilands
in their powers, and to ſtrengthen them with
men and ſhips, for to diſturbe and take away
the trafficke and commercio of the Indies,
and how that the principals which doth ayde
