            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>From hence the Governor went to <hi>Paſehatoway,</hi> about 20. leagues higher, where he found many <hi>Indians</hi> aſſembled, and heere he met with one Captaine <hi>Henry Fleete</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> who had lived many yeeres among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and by that meanes ſpake the Countrey language very well, and was much eſteemed of by the natives. Him our Governour ſent a ſhore to invite the <hi>Werowance</hi> to a parley, who thereupon came with him aboard privatly, where he was courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly entertained, and after ſome parley being demanded by the Governour, whether hee would be content that he and his people ſhould ſet downe in his Countrey, in caſe he ſhould find a place conuenient for him, his anſwere was, <q>
                     <hi>that he would not bid him goe, neither would &amp; hee bid him ſtay, but that he might uſe his owne diſcretion.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>While this <hi>Werowance</hi> was aboard, many of his people came to the water ſide, fearing that he might be ſurpriſed, whereupon the <hi>Wero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance</hi> commanded two <hi>Indians</hi> that came with him, to goe on ſhore, to quit them of this feare, but they anſwered, they feared they wou'd kill

them; The <hi>Werowance</hi> therefore ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon the decke, and told them hee was in ſafety, wherewith they were ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the Governour was abroad, the neighbouring <hi>Indians,</hi> where the ſhip lay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to caſt off feare, and to come to their Court of guard, which they kept night and day upon Saint <hi>Clements</hi> Ile, partly to defend their barge, which was brought in pieces out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and there made up; and partly to defend their men which were imployed in felling of trees, and cleaving pales for a Palizado, and at laſt they ventured to come aboard the ſhip.</p>
               <p>The Governour finding it not fit, for many reaſons, to ſeate himſelfe as yet ſo high in the River, reſolued to returne backe againe, and to take a more exact view of the lower parts, and ſo leaving the Ship &amp; Pinnaces there, he tooke his Barge (as moſt fit to ſearch the Creekes, and ſmall rivers) and was conducted by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Fleete</hi> (who knew well the Countrey) to a River on the North-ſide of <hi>Patomeck</hi> river, within 4. or 5. leagues from the mouth thereof, which they called Saint <hi>Georges</hi> River.

               </p>
               <p>At their comming to this place, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour went on ſhoare, and treated friendly

               <p>There was an occaſion that much facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their treaty with theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> which was this: The <hi>Saſquehanocks</hi> (a warlike people that inhabite betweene <hi>Cheſopeack</hi> bay, and <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi> bay) did vſually make warres, and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the neighbouring <hi>Indians,</hi> partly for ſuperiority, partly for to get their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and what other purchaſe they could meet with, which theſe <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Yocomaco</hi> fearing, had the yeere before our arivall there, made a reſolution, for their ſafety, to remove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues higher into the Countrey where it was more populous, and many of them were gone thither before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> arrived.</p>
               <p>Three dayes after their comming to <hi>Yoacoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> the Arke with the two Pinaces arived there.

The <hi>Indians</hi> much wondred to ſee ſuch ſhips, and at the thundering of the Ordnance when they came to an Anchor.</p>

               </p>
               <p>After they had finiſhed the ſtore-houſe, and unladed the ſhip, the Governour thought fit to bring the Colours on ſhore, which were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all the Gentlemen, and the reſt of the ſervants in armes; who received the Colours
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10468:6"/>
with a volley of ſhot, which was anſwered by the Ordnance from the ſhips; At this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony were preſent, the <hi>Werowances</hi> of <hi>Patuxent,</hi> and <hi>Yoacomaco,</hi> with many other Indians; and the <hi>Werowance</hi> of <hi>Patuxent</hi> hereupon tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to adviſe the Indians of <hi>Yoacomaco</hi> to be carefull to keepe the league that they had made with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He ſtayed with them divers dayes, and uſed many Indian Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and at his departure hee ſaid to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. <q>I loue the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo well, that if they ſhould goe about to kill me, if I had but ſo much breath as to ſpeake; I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the people, not to revenge my death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I know they would not doe ſuch a thing, except it were through mine owne default.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They brought thither with them ſome ſtore of Indian Corne, from the <hi>Barbado's,</hi> which at their firſt arivall they began to vſe (thinking fit to reſerve their Engliſh proviſion of Meale and Oatemeale) and the Indian women ſeeing their ſervants to bee unacquainted with the manner of dreſſing it, would make bread there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for them, and teach them how to doe the like: They found alſo the countrey well ſtored with Corne (which they bought with truck, ſuch as there is deſired, the Natiues having no knowledge of the uſe of money) whereof they ſold them ſuch plenty, as that they ſent 1000. buſhells of it to <hi>New-England,</hi> to provide them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10468:7"/>
ſome ſalt-fiſh, and other commodities which they wanted.</p>
               <p>During the time that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtai'd by the Engliſh at <hi>Yoacomaco,</hi> they went dayly to hunt with them for Deere and Turkies, wherof ſome they gaue them for Preſents, and the meaner ſort would ſell them to them, for knives, beades and the like: Alſo of Fiſh, the natives brought them great ſtore, and in all things dealt very friendly with them; their women and children came very frequently amongſt them, which was a certaine ſigne of their confidence of them, it being found by experience, that they never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any ill, where the women are, or may be in danger.</p>
               <p>Their comming thus to ſeate upon an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Towne, where they found ground cleered to their hands, gave them opportunity (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they came late in the yeere) to plant ſome Corne, and to make them gardens, which they ſowed with Engliſh ſeeds of all ſorts, and they proſpered exceeding well. They alſo made what haſte they could to finiſh their houſes; but before they could accompliſh all theſe things, one Captaine <hi>Cleyborne</hi> (who had a deſire to appropriate the trade of thoſe parts unto himſelfe) began to caſt out words amongſt the Indians, ſaying, That thoſe of <hi>Yoacomaco</hi> were <hi>Spaniards</hi> and his enemies; and by this meanes endeavoured to alienate the mindes of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10468:7"/>
the Natives from them, ſo that they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them ſo friendly as formerly they had done. This cauſed them to lay aſide all other workes, and to finiſh their Fort, which they did within the ſpace of one moneth; where they mounted ſome Ordnance, and furniſhed it with ſome murtherers, and ſuch other meanes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence as they thought fit for their ſafeties: which being done, they proceeded with their Houſes and finiſhed them, with convenient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations belonging thereto: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had thus put themſelves in ſafety, yet they ceaſed not to procure to put theſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies out of the Natives minds, by treating and vſing them in the moſt courteous manner they could, and at laſt prevailed therein, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a very firme peace and friendſhip with them. They procured from <hi>Virginia,</hi> Hogges, Poultrey, and ſome Cowes, and ſome male cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, which hath given them a foundation for breed and increaſe; and whoſo deſires it, may furniſh himſelfe with ſtore of Cattell from thence, but the hogges and Poultrey are already increaſed in <hi>Maryland,</hi> to a great ſtocke, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſerve the Colonie very plentifully. They have alſo ſet up a Water-mill for the grinding of Corne, adjoyning to the Towne.</p>
               <p>Thus within the ſpace of ſixe moneths, was laid the foundation of the Colonie in <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and whoſoever intends now to goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

ſhall finde the way ſo troden, that hee may proceed with much more eaſe and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence then theſe firſt adventurers could, who were ignorant both of Place, People, and all things elſe, and could expect to find nothing but what nature produced: beſides, they could not in reaſon but thinke, the Natives would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; whereas now the Countrey is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and friendſhip with the Natives is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, houſes built, and many other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, as Cattell, Hogges, Poultry, Fruits and the like brought thither from <hi>England, Virginea,</hi> and other places, which are vſefull, both for profit and Pleaſure: and without boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it may be ſaid, that this Colony hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to more in ſixe moneths, then <hi>Virginia</hi> did in as many yeeres. If any man ſay, they are beholding to <hi>Virginea</hi> for ſo ſpeedy a ſupply of many of thoſe things which they of <hi>Virginia</hi> were forced to fetch from <hi>England</hi> and other remote places, they will confeſſe it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves glad that <hi>Virginea</hi> is ſo neere a neighbour, and that it is ſo well ſtored of all neceſſaries for to make thoſe parts happy, and the people to live as plentifully as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the world, only they wiſh that they would be content their neighbours might live in peace by them, and then no doubt they ſhould find a great comfort each in other.</p>

               <p>The temper of the Ayre is very good, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees well with the Engliſh, as appeared at their firſt comming thither, when they had no houſes to ſhelter them, and their people were

enforced, not onely to labour in the day, but to watch in their turnes at night, yet had their healths exceeding well: In Summer its hot as in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in Winter there is froſt and ſnow, but it ſeldome laſts long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this laſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the coldeſt that had beene knowne in many yeeres: but the yeere before, there was ſcarce any ſigne of Winter, onely that the leaves fell from the trees, in all other things it appeared to be Summer; and yet the laſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both their Cattell and Hoggs kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the woods, without any fodder, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe, and the Hoggs thrived ſo well, that ſome of them were killed out of the woods for Porke and Bacon, which was excellent good and fat.</p>
               <p>The Windes there are variable; from the South comes Heat, Guſts, and Thunder; from the North, or North-weſt, cold-weather, and in winter, Froſt and Snow; from the Eaſt and South-eaſt, Raine.</p>

                  <p>IN the firſt place I name Corne, as the thing moſt neceſſary to ſuſtaine man; That which the Natives uſe in the Countrey, makes very good bread, and alſo a meate which they call <hi>Omene,</hi> it's like our <hi>Furmety,</hi> and is very ſavory and wholeſome; it will Mault and make good Beere. Alſo the Natives have a ſort of <hi>Pulſe,</hi> which we call <hi>Peaſe</hi> and <hi>Beanes,</hi> that are very good. This Corne yeelds a great increaſe, ſo doth the <hi>Peaſe</hi> and <hi>Beanes:</hi> One man may in a ſeaſon, well plant ſo much as will yeeld a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred buſhells of this Corne, 20 buſhells of <hi>Beanes</hi> and <hi>Peaſe,</hi> and yet attend a crop of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco:</hi> which according to the goodneſſe of the ground may be more or leſſe, but is ordinarily accompted betweene 800 and 1000 pound weight.</p>
                  <p>They have made tryall of Engliſh <hi>Peaſe,</hi> and they grow very well, alſo <hi>Musk-mellons, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellons, Com-cumbers,</hi> with all ſorts of garden Roots and Herbes, as <hi>Carrots, Parſenips, Turnips, Cabbages Radiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> with many more; and in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> they have ſowed Engliſh <hi>Wheate</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and it yeelds twiſe as much increaſe as in <hi>England;</hi> and although there be not many that doe apply themſelves to plant Gardens and Orchards, yet thoſe that doe it, find much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10468:19"/>
and pleaſure thereby: They have Peares, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſeverall ſorts of Plummes, Peaches in abundance, and as good as thoſe of <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo are the Mellons and Pumpions: Apricocks, Figgs and Pomegranates proſper exceedingly; they haue lately planted Orange and Limon trees which thrive very wel: and in fine, there is ſcarce any fruit that growes in <hi>England, France, Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> but hath been tryed there, and proſpers well. You may there alſo have Hemp and Flax, Pitch and Tarre, with little labour; it's apt for Rapeſeed, and Annis-ſeed, Woad, Madder, Saff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, &amp;c. There may be had, Silke-wormes, the Countrey being ſtored with Mulberries: and the ſuperfluity of wood will produce Potaſhes.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Wine,</hi> there is no doubt but it will be made there in plenty, for the ground doth naturally bring foorth Vines, in ſuch aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that they are as frequent there, as Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are here. <hi>Iron</hi> may be made there with little charge; Brave ſhips may be built, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any materialls from other parts: Clab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, Wainſcott, Pipeſtaves and Maſts for ſhips the woods will afford plentifully. In fine, <hi>Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe, Porke</hi> and <hi>Bacon,</hi> to tranſport to other countrys will be no ſmall commodity, which by induſtry may be quickly had there in great plenty, &amp;c. And if there were no other ſtaple commodities to be hoped for, but Silke and Linnen (the materialls of which, apparantly will grow there) it were ſufficient to enrich the inhabitants.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>EE that hath a Curioſity to know all that hath beene obſerued of the Cuſtomes and manners of the <hi>Indians,</hi> may find large diſcourſes thereof in Captaine <hi>Smiths</hi> Booke of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> of <hi>New-England:</hi> but he that is deſirous to goe to <hi>Maryland,</hi> ſhall heere find enough to informe him of what is neceſſary for him to know touching them.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10468:20"/>
By Captaine <hi>Smith's,</hi> and many other Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you may be informed, that the People are War-licke, and have done much harme to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and thereby are made very terrible. Others ſay that they are a baſe and cowardly People, and to be contemned: and it is thought by ſome who would be eſteemed Stateſ-men, that the only point of pollicie that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can uſe, is, to deſtroy the <hi>Indians,</hi> or to drive them out of the Countrey, without which, it is not to be hoped that they can be ſecure. The truth is, if they be injured, they may well be feared, they being People that have able bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and generally, taller, and bigger limbed then the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and want not courage; but the oddes wee have of them in our weapons, keepes them in awe, otherwiſe they would not flie from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they have done in the time of Warres with thoſe of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and out of that reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſmall number of our men being armed, will aduenture upon a great troope of theirs, and for no other reaſon, for they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and ſubtile enough: But from hence to conclude, that there can be no ſafety to live with them, is a very great errour. Experience hath taught us, that by kind and faire uſage, the Natives are not onely become peaceable, but alſo friendly, and have upon all occaſions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as many friendly Offices to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Maryland,</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> as any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10468:21"/>
or friend uſes to doe in the moſt Civill parts of Chriſtendome: Therefore any wiſe man will hold it a far more juſt and reaſonable way to treat the People of the Countrey well, thereby to induce them to civility, and to teach them the uſe of husbandry, and Mechanick trades, whereof they are capable, which may in time be very uſefull to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the Planters to keepe themſelues ſtrong, and united in Townes, at leaſt for a competent number, and then noe man can reaſonably doubt, either ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, or any other ill dealing from them.</p>
               <p>But to proceede, hee that ſees them, may know how men lived whileſt the world was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of Nature; and as by nature, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, all men are free, but yet ſubject to command for the publike defence. Their Government is Monarchicall, he that governes in chiefe, is called the <hi>Werowance,</hi> and is aſſiſted by ſome that conſult with him of the common affaires, who are called <hi>Wiſoes:</hi> They have no Lawes, but the Law of Nature and diſcretion, by which all things are ruled, onely Cuſtome hath introduced a law for the Succeſſion of the Government, which is this; when a <hi>Werowance</hi> dieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his eldeſt ſonne ſucceeds, and after him the ſecond, and ſo the reſt, each for their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> liues, and when all the ſonnes are dead, then the ſons of the <hi>Werowances</hi> eldeſt daughter ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and ſo if he have more daughters; for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10468:21"/>
they hold, that the iſſue of the daughters hath more of his blood in them than the iſſue of his ſonnes. The <hi>Wiſoes</hi> are choſen at the pleaſure of the <hi>Werowance,</hi> yet commonly they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of the ſame family, if they be of yeeres ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable: The yong men generally beare a very great reſpect to the elder.</p>
               <p>They have alſo <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſes</hi> that are their Captains in time of war, to whom they are very obedient; But the <hi>Werowance</hi> himſelfe plants Corne, makes his owne Bow and Arrowes, his Canoo, his Mantle, Shooes, and what ever elſe belongs unto him, as any other common Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and commonly the Commanders are the beſt and moſt ingenious and active in all thoſe things which are in eſteeme amongſt them. The women ſerve their husbands, make their bread, dreſſe their meate, ſuch as they kill in hunting, or get by fiſhing; and if they have more wives then one, as ſome of them have (but that is not generall) then the beſt beloved wife performes all the offices of the houſe, and they take great coment therein. The women alſo (beſide the houſhold buſineſſe) uſe to make Matts, which ſerve to cover their houſes, and for beds; alſo they make baskets, ſome of Ruſhes, others of Silke-graſſe, which are very handſom.</p>
               <p>The Children live with their Parents; the Boyes untill they come to the full growth of men; (for they reckon not by yeeres, as we doe)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10468:22"/>
then they are put into the number of Bow-men, and are called Blacke-boyes (and ſo continue untill they take them wives) When they are to be made Black-boyes, the ancient men that governe the yonger, tell them, That if they will be valiant and obedient to the <hi>Werowance, Wiſos</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſes,</hi> then their god will love them, all men will eſteeme of them, and they ſhall kill Deere, and Turkies, catch Fiſh, and all things ſhall goe well with them; but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then ſhall all goe contrary: which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion mooves in them an incredible obedience to their commands; If they bid them take fire in their hands or mouthes, they will doe it, or any other deſperate thing, although with the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant danger of their lives.</p>
               <p>The women remaine with their Parents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they have husbands, and if the Parents bee dead, then with ſome other of their friends. If the husband die, he leaves all that he hath to his wife, except his bow and arrowes, and ſome Beades (which they uſually bury with them) and ſhe is to keepe the children untill the ſons come to be men, and then they live where they pleaſe, for all mens houſes are free unto them; and the daughters untill they have husbands. The manner of their marriages is thus; he that would have a wife, treates with the father, or if he be dead, with the friend that takes care of her whom he deſires to have to wife, and agrees
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10468:22"/>
with him for a quantity of Beades, or ſome ſuch other thing which is accepted amongſt them; which he is to give for her, and muſt be payed at the day of their marriage; and then the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed, all the friends of both parts meet at the mans houſe that is to have the wife, and each one brings a preſent of meate and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is to be married alſo brings her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: when the company is all come, the man he ſits at the upper end of the houſe, and the womans friends leade her up, and place her by him, then all the company ſit down upon mats, on the ground (as their manner is) and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man riſeth and ſerves dinner, Firſt to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, then to all the company; the reſt of the day they ſpend in ſinging and dancing (which is not unpleaſant) at night the company leaves the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they live very peaceably and lovingly together; Yet it falls out ſometimes, that a man puts away one wife and takes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then ſhe and her children returne to her friends again. They are generally very obedient to their husbands, and you ſhal ſeldome heare a woman ſpeake in the preſence of her husband, except he aske her ſome queſtion.</p>
               <p>This people live to a great age, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, in that although they marry not ſo yong as we doe in <hi>England,</hi> yet you may ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them great-grandfathers to children of good bigneſſe; and continue at that age, very
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10468:23"/>
able and ſtrong men: The Men and Women have all blacke haire, which is much bigger and harſher then ours, it is rare to ſee any of them to waxe gray, although they be very old, but never bauld: It is ſeldome ſeene that any of the men have beards, but they weare long locks, which reach to their ſhoulders, and ſome of them to their waſts: they are of a comely ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, well favoured, and excellently well lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and ſeldome any deformed. In their warres, and hunting, they uſe Bowes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes (but the Arrowes are not poyſoned, as in other places.) The Arrow-heads are made of a Flint-ſtone, the top of a Deares horne, or ſome Fiſh-bone, which they faſten with a ſort of glew, which they make. They alſo uſe in warres, a ſhort club of a cubite long, which they call a <hi>Tomahawk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They live for the moſt part in Townes, like Countrey Villages in <hi>England;</hi> Their houſes are made like our Arboures, covered ſome with matts, others with barke of trees, which defend them from the injury of the weather: The fiers are in the midſt of the houſe, and a hole in the top for the ſmoake to goe out at. In length, ſome of them are 30. others 40. ſome a 100. foote; and in breadth about 12. foote.

Iuſtice each to other, for it is never heard of, that thoſe of a Nation will rob or ſteale one from another; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> doe often truſt them with truck, to deale for them as factors, and they have performed it very juſtly: Alſo they have ſent letters by them to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and into other parts of the Countrey, unto their ſeruants that have beene trading abroad, and they have delivered them, and brought backe anſwere thereof unto thoſe that ſent them; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their conuerſation each with other, is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and free from all ſcurrulous words, which may give offence; They are very hoſpitable to their owne people, and to ſtrangers; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of a grave comportment: Some of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers at a time, was at one of their feaſts, when Two hundred of them did meet together; they eate of but one diſh at a meale, and every man, although there be never ſo many, is ſerued in a diſh by himſelfe; their diſhes are made of wood, but handſomely wrought: The dinner laſted two houres; and after dinner, they ſung and danced about two houres more, in all which time, not one word or action paſt amongſt them that could give the leaſt diſturbance to the company; In the moſt grave aſſembly, no man can expect to find ſo much time paſt with more ſilence and gravitie: Some <hi>Indians</hi> comming on a time to <hi>Iames Towne</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that there then ſate the Councell to heare

               <p>It fell in the way of my diſcourſe, to ſpeake of the <hi>Indian</hi> money of thoſe parts, It is of two ſorts, <hi>Wompompeag</hi> and <hi>Roanoake;</hi> both of them are made of a Fiſh-ſhell, that they gather by the Sea ſide, <hi>Wompompeag</hi> is of the greater ſort, and <hi>Roanoake</hi> of the leſſer, and the <hi>Wompompeag</hi> is three times the value of <hi>Roanoake;</hi> and theſe ſerue as Gold and Siluer doe heere; they barter alſo one commoditie for another, and are very glad of trafficke and commerce, ſo farre as to ſupply their neceſſities: They ſhew no great deſire of heaping wealth, yet ſome they will have to be buryed with them; If they were Chriſtians, and would live ſo free from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and many other vices which abound in Chriſtendome, they would be a brave people.</p>
               <p>I therefore conclude, that ſince God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath made this Countrey ſo large and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10468:26"/>
and that the people be ſuch as you have heard them deſcribed; It is much more Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Charity, to Civilize, and make them Chriſtians, then to kill, robbe, and hunt them from place to place, as you would doe a wolfe. By reducing of them, God ſhall be ſerued, his Majeſties Empire enlarged by the addition of many thouſand Subjects, as well as of large Territories, our Nation honoured, and the Planters themſelues enriched by the trafficke and commerce which may be had with them; and in many other things, they may be uſefull, but prejudiciall they cannot be, if it be not through their owne faults, by negligence of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying themſelues, and not conſeruing milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcipline.</p>
