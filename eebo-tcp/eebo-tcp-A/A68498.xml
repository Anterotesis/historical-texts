            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>About <hi>24</hi> leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence toward the weſt, they hapned vpon a prouince in the countrie language called <hi>Zuni,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zuni.</note> and by the Spaniards named <hi>Cibola,</hi> wherin do inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite very many Indians. In this citie had <hi>Frances Vaſques Coronado</hi> erected many croſſes and other tokens of Chriſtianitie which yet remaine.

Of them our men vnderſtood that <hi>60</hi> daies iourneis of, there was a very great lake &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhores thereof many goodly townes, alſo that the enhabitans of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame had plentie of gold, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better to be knowen becauſe they al did were brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets &amp; earerings thereof: alſo that <hi>Frances Vaſques Coronado</hi> being certified thereof had gone out of this land of <hi>Cibola</hi> &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded

               <hi>14</hi> iournies thitherward, and then through want of water was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, determining neuertheleſſe to make a ſecond voiage thither being better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, which he neuer perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, being preuented therein by death.</p>
            <p>Vnto the news of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches aforeſaid did the ſaid <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Eſpeio</hi> apply himſelf, to whoſe opinion the moſt part of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany condiſcended, except the Frier, who alledged y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was now time to returne to new <hi>Byſcay,</hi> from whence they came, there to giue accompt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they had ſéene, whereto moſt of them conſented, leauing their capteine with onely <hi>9</hi> companions y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> willingly followed him, who after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches aforeſaid, departed with his ſaid companions, &amp; traueiling directly toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weſt, after hee had iourneied <hi>28.</hi> leagues, found another very great Lande, which by eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conteined <hi>50000</hi> ſouls &amp; more. The inhabitans vnderſtanding of their approch, ſent them word vpon paine of death to come no néerer their townes, wherto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> capteine anſwered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was no way to harme them, as they ſhould wel perceiue, &amp; therefore requeſted them not to moleſt them, &amp; withal gaue to

the meſſenger ſome ſuch rewards as they had at hand, who vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, gaue ſo good words of our people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he mollified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harts of the rebellious India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; obteined leaue for them to come among them, which they did with <hi>150</hi> of their frendes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouince of <hi>Cibola</hi> aforeſaid, and the thrée <hi>Mexican</hi> Indians before mentioned.</p>
            <p>When they came within one league of the firſt towne, there came foorth to méete them aboue <hi>2000</hi> Indians with neceſſarie prouiſion, as victuals, &amp;c. who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the capteine rewarded with ſome things of ſmal value, which vnto them neuertheleſſe ſéemed of greater account then ſo much gold.
