         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

elſe, what need had there been of an <hi>Oath,</hi> or any Extraordinary Way of Evidence, when every Syllable was freighted with Truth and Integrity? It had been a meer taking of God's Holy Name in vain: Truth then flowed naturally, and wanted no ſuch Expedient to Extort its Evidence.</p>

               <p>I.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64138:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould be the Decreaſing and Aboliſhing of Oaths; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe there would be no Truth in the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, nor Reaſon in that ancient <hi>Maxim,</hi> Ceſſante ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Legis ceſſat lex; <hi>That the Ceaſing of the Reaſon of the Law is the Ceſſation of the Law</hi>: Expedients are no longer uſeful then to obtain what they are deſigned to. Means are ſwallowed up of their Ends; Diſeaſed Men only want Remedies, and Lame Men Crutches; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty needs neither Whip nor Spur, She is Security for her ſelf; and Men of Virtue will ſpeak Truth without Extortings; for Oaths are a ſort of Racks to the Mind, altogether uſeleſs where Integrity ſwayes.</p>
               <p>This we preſume no man of Reaſon will deny, viz. That <hi>Swearing came in, and ought to go out with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs</hi>; and we hope it will be as eaſie to grant, at leaſt it will be very eaſie to prove, That God hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, both by Prophets and Apoſtles, reproved men for ſuch Impieties, and ſtrictly required Truth and Righteouſneſs; as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59, 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.3, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3 8, 9, 10. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.14. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.25. and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of other Places in Holy Scripture. And that God ſhould enjoyn man any thing that he hath not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him to perform, is unworthy of any man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a God, ſo much as to conceive. It is true, that the unprofitable Servant in the Parable is repreſented to entertain ſo blaſphemous a Thought of his Maker, that he was ſo <hi>hard a Maſter, as to reap where he did not ſow</hi>; but the ſame Parable alſo acquaints us of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequence of that Preſumption: The Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> preached another Doctrine,<note place="margin">Mic. 6.8.</note>

He that makes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of that Law that forbids Lying, will he make any Conſcience of Forſwearing? Veracity is the beſt Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and Truth ſpeaking the Nobleſt Tye and Firmeſt Teſtimony that can be given. This we declare to you to be both our Judgment and Attainment; We ſpeak not Boaſtingly, but with Humility before the Great Lord of Heaven and Earth, to whoſe alone Power we do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly aſſcribe the Honour: He hath taught us to ſpeak the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, as plainly and readily without an Oath as with an Oath, and to abhor Lying as much as Perjury; ſo that for us to ſwear, were to take his Holy Name in vain: Nor are we therein ſingular; for that not only <hi>Chriſtian Fathers, Mar-</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> but alſo <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> have had this Senſe of the Riſe and Uſe of Oaths, as will hereafter ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear.</p>

At preſent People lie all in a Heap; and the Greateſt Truth finds no more Favour then the greateſt Fraud; Fidelity muſt wear the Shackles worldly Prudence hath made againſt the Evil Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Couzennage, and ſubject her ſelf to the Cuſtoms brought up through Fraud, or go to Gaol. Be pleaſed to conſider, that Truſtineſs did not all at once quit the World, nor will it return univerſally in the Twinkle of an Eye; Things muſt be allowed their Time for Riſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and Perfection: And if ever you would ſee the World planted with Primitive Simplicity and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rather cheriſh then make men Sufferers for Refuſing to <hi>Swear,</hi> eſpecially if they offer the ſame Caution to the Law with him that will ſwear. We dare not Swear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we dare not Lye, and that it may appear to the World, that we can ſpeak the Truth upon eaſier Terms then an Oath: For us then to be forc'd to ſwear, is to make us do a needleſs thing, or to ſuſpect our own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. The firſt we dare not, becauſe, as we have ſaid, it is to take God's Name in vain; and we have no Reaſon to diſtruſt our ſelves, being no wayes conſcious of frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Purpoſes: Why then ſhould we ſwear? But much rather,<note place="margin">Biſh. Gaud. <hi>of Oaths,</hi> p. 41.</note> why ſhould we be impoſed upon? It is a Saying aſſcribed to <hi>Solon,</hi> That <hi>a good man ſhould have that Repute as not to need an Oath; that it is a Diminution to his Credit to be put to Swear.</hi> It becomes not an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Man to Swear, was a primitive <hi>Axiom</hi>; but more of that anon: In the mean while pleaſe to remember, you have a Practice among you, to exempt your Lords in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Caſes, placing the Value of an Oath in their bare Avouchment upon their Honour, ſuppoſing that men of thoſe Titles ſhould have ſo much Worth, as that their <hi>Word</hi> might be of equal Force with a Common Man's

It was Evangelically ſpoaken of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> That <hi>a Good Life is a firm Oath</hi>; which was memorably verified by the Judges of <hi>Athens,</hi> who, though <hi>Heathens,</hi> forbad the <hi>Tendering of</hi> Xenocrates <hi>an Oath, becauſe of their great Opinion of his Integrity,</hi> which was Three Hundred Years before Chriſt came in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>III. Our <hi>third</hi> Reaſon for Non conformity to your Cuſtom is, <hi>the Fear we have, leſt by Complying we ſhould be guilty of Rebellion againſt the Diſcoveries God hath made to our Souls of his ancient holy Way of Truth; &amp; conſequently of concealing his Goodneſs to us, and depriving him of that Glory &amp; the World of that Advantage this honeſt Teſtimony may bring to him &amp; them.</hi> He has redeem'd us from Fraud; 'Tis he only that hath begotten this Conſcientiouſneſs in us; and we dare not put this Light under a Buſhel, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we deny his Work, or him to have the Honour of it.

                  <hi>Oaths</hi> with their <hi>Faſhions</hi>: Nay, the moſt <hi>judicial Oaths</hi> are commonly adminiſtred and taken with ſo <hi>little Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Devotion</hi> (to ſay nothing of the <hi>Perjuries,</hi> that through Ignorance or Deſign, are too frequently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that we can't but cry out, <hi>Oh the great Depravity that is in the World! How low is Man faln from the primitive</hi> Rule <hi>of Life</hi>? Well may the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Complaint be ours, for, <hi>If ever Land mourned becauſe of</hi> OATHS, with great Sadneſs we ſay it, <hi>this doth.</hi> And what more effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy can any People propoſe againſt the notorious Abuſe and evil Conſequence of <hi>Swearing,</hi> then <hi>Truth-ſpeaking</hi>? for thoſe that dare not <hi>Lye,</hi> need not <hi>Swear</hi>; and <hi>they that make no Conſcience of Lying, do not much fear an Oath,</hi> at leaſt their <hi>Conſciences</hi> are very crazy in taking it. This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reaſon, were we deſtitute of all other Allegations, would be a ſtrong Diſſwaſive from <hi>Swearing</hi>; for we hold God's Honour, and our Profeſſion greatly concern'd to prove to ſo <hi>Falſe</hi> an Age, that there is a People who are ſo far from <hi>vain and falſe Swearing,</hi> that they dare not <hi>ſwear the Truth</hi>; but whoſe <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> ſhall weigh againſt other mens <hi>Oaths,</hi> and that with a free Offer of <hi>ſuſtaining double Puniſhment in caſe of Miſcarriage.</hi> Expedients may laſt a while, but <hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH</hi> only ſhall have the Honour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>Falſhood,</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> will and muſt be greater then an <hi>OATH.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. The <hi>Omnipreſency of God</hi> rightly underſtood, ſhows the Uſeleſneſs of an <hi>Oath,</hi> and is with us a good Argument <hi>againſt Swearing</hi>; for what need is there of that Man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aw'd into true Evidence by ſuch ſort of Atteſtations and Imprecations as make up the common Form of <hi>Oaths,</hi> who knows <hi>God to be always preſent</hi> to reſide and preſide in his Soul, according to that New and Everlaſting Covenant which he hath made, that his People ſhould be his Temple, <hi>that he would dwell IN them, and walk IN them.</hi> Did the Children of men know the Power, Glory and Majeſty of <hi>God,</hi>

               <p>VI. We do not find that <hi>Oaths</hi> anſwer this part of the End for which they are impoſed, viz. <hi>To convince thoſe for whoſe ſakes they are taken, of the Weight and Truth of a Man's Teſtimony by Force of God's Witneſs joyn'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi>: For they don't behold God's concurring Witneſs by ſuch an Aſſiſtance or Avenge of that Party, as the Truth or Falſhood of his Teſtimony deſerveth; for the Judgments of God are ſecret, and rarely ſo publickly ſeen to Men, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps once in an Age, that he ſhould give any memorable Diſcovery of his good Will or Diſpleaſure in ſuch a Caſe; but whenever he doth it, it is not at Man's Appointment: And it is an evident Sign that God approveth not of that ſort of Invocation, becauſe he doth not anſwer them that invoke him, according to their Wiſh; as neither did he in the old Law or Cuſtom of <hi>Combating</hi> appear on his ſide that had the better Title or Cauſe,<note place="margin">Numb. 5 21, 22.</note> as he promiſed in the Law of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> that their Thigh ſhould rot, and their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwell, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VII. We look upon it to be no leſs then a preſumtuous <hi>Tempting</hi> of God, <hi>To ſummon him as a Witneſs,</hi> not only to our Terrene, but trivial Buſineſſes; ſuch as we ſhould doubtleſs account it an high Indignity alwaies to ſolicit an Earthly Prince to give his Attendence about. What! Make God, the Great God of Heaven and Earth our Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in worldly Controverſies, as if we would bind him to obtain our own Ends? It is to make too bold with him, and to carry an undue Diſtance in our Minds towards him that made us; An Irreverence we can by no means away with, and upon which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is moſt ſharp, as will be ſeen anon. Beſides it is vain and <hi>inſolent</hi> to think that a <hi>man</hi> when he pleaſeth, can make the <hi>Great God of Heaven</hi> a

time, thou ſhalt not Forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths; but I ſay unto you,</hi> SWEAR NOT AT ALL; as plain, general and emphatical a Prohibition as can be found in Holy Scripture. However, thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that uſually advocate for the Continuance of <hi>Oaths</hi> under the Goſpel, tell us, it is not a <hi>general Prohibition, but is limited to Swearing by Creatures, either by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, Jeruſalem or Head, &amp;c.</hi> VVhich is wholy inconſiſtent with the Scope of the Place, as we ſhall make appear from theſe Four Conſiderations: 1<hi>ſt,</hi> The <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> reaches as well to ſerious as vain Oaths, ſuch as men made, if they ſwore at all, and ought to make to God only; for to him alone ſhould they perform them, and are they accountable for them: Theſe very al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Oaths of Old Time, are the firſt prohibited by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; <hi>It was ſaid of Old, thou ſhalt not Forſwear thy ſelf; but I ſay, SWEAR NOT AT ALL.</hi> 'Tis true, it is not particularized what <hi>Oaths</hi> they were to keep of old; but in general Terms, that they were not <hi>to Forſwear</hi> themſelves; and it is clear that God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them that would Swear, that they ſhould only Swear by <hi>his Name.</hi> Now what can be hence inferred more evidently, then that men ought not to ſwear thoſe Oaths under the Goſpel, which they might ſwear, and ought not to forſwear, but to perform unto the Lord in the Law. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Chriſt himſelf gives the Explanation of his own Words, Chap. 23.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. where he teacheth us, That <hi>he that ſwears by the Temple, ſwears by it, and by him that dwells therein; and he that ſhall ſwear by Heaven, ſwears by the Throne of God, and by him that ſits thereon</hi>: So that he that ſwears <hi>by the Head,</hi> ſwears by him <hi>that made it:</hi> and he that ſwears <hi>by the Earth,</hi> ſwears by him <hi>that created it</hi>; which leaves no room for the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> for it is as if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, <hi>I not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you not to Forſwear, but perform, as it was ſaid to them of old time; but I charge you,</hi> NOT TO SWEAR AT ALL: I mean, <hi>not only that you ſhould not ſwear by God, and thoſe Oaths that the Phariſees account binding; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64138:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that you ſhould not ſo much as ſwear by thoſe leſſer Oaths, as they eſteem them, and which they are wont to ſwear by; for they are not leſs nor more allowable, in that they that ſwear by them, ſwear by him that is the Author and Maker of them: wherefore being of the ſame Nature with the other, I forbid you to ſwear by them as well as by thoſe Oaths that were of old time made, and ought not to be broak, but perform'd unto the Lord; for this is one of my great Commandments, which they muſt keep that will be my Diſciples, that is to ſay,</hi> SWEAR NOT AT ALL. Our 3<hi>d</hi> Inducement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this to have been the Intention of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is the concurrent <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> which is not only a Repetition of his Maſter's Doctrine, but an <hi>Addition and Illuſtration,</hi> we hope ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin the preſent Queſtion with every unprejudic'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <hi>But above all things, my Brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſwear not</hi>; which runs parallel with <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> The Negative is as general &amp; forcible. He proceeds, <hi>neither by Heaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Earth</hi>; Words of equal Import with the latter part of Chriſt's Prohibition: and as if he had foreſeen the Cavils of our Swearing Adverſaries, he adds, <hi>neither by any other Oath</hi>; which though as clear as the Sun, if yet for their laſt ſhift they ſhould tell us, that he only meant <hi>any other Oath</hi> of that kind, not that he prohibited <hi>Swearing by the Name of the Lord,</hi> it will not do their Buſineſs; for that Chriſt hath already aſſured us, <hi>Whoſoever ſwears by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſwears by him that ſits thereon</hi>; and the very next words ſhow that it was not his Deſign only to prohibit <hi>vain,</hi> but plainly to exclude <hi>all</hi> Swearing, <hi>But let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay, Nay, leſt ye fall into Condemnation</hi>; elſe why had he not ſaid, <hi>but you may ſwear by the Name of God before a Magiſtrate</hi>? Why muſt <hi>Neither by any other Oath</hi> be added after ſuch a plain Prohibition, as, <hi>My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Above all things Swear not</hi>? And why muſt <hi>Yea and Nay</hi> be ſubſtituted in the room of an <hi>Oath,</hi> if it was yet intended by the Apoſtle, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might riſe higher in their Evidence then a bare <hi>Affirming</hi> or <hi>Denying</hi>? that is, Though their <hi>Yea</hi> be never ſo truly <hi>Yea,</hi> and their <hi>Nay</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64138:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
never ſo ſincerely <hi>Nay,</hi> or the very Truth of the Matter be ſpoaken, which is the Import of the Words; yet that <hi>they ought to ſwear.</hi> What is this but to <hi>contradict</hi> the natural Tendency of the Command of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? which is plainly this; <hi>If your</hi> Yea <hi>be</hi> Yea, <hi>it is enough; if your</hi> Nay <hi>be</hi> Nay, <hi>it is ſufficient</hi>; for <hi>Chriſtians ought not to ſwear,</hi> if they do, <hi>they fall into Condemnation,</hi> in that they break their Maſter's Command, who hath told them, that <hi>Whatſoever is more then</hi> Yea <hi>or</hi> Nay, <hi>cometh of Evil,</hi> which is the Ground of all Oaths; for they ought to mean ſo ſimply and honeſtly in what they <hi>ſay,</hi> as that they ſhould never need to <hi>ſwear</hi> in order to tell the Truth. Our 4<hi>th</hi> and laſt Conſideration, and that which to us ſeemeth of great Moment to clear up our Lord and Saviour's ſenſe, and reſcue the Paſſage from the Violence of <hi>Objectors,</hi> is this Clauſe, <hi>For whatſoever is MORE then Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay, cometh of Evil.</hi> This cannot be intended of more Words then <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay, Nay,</hi> provided they are not of an higher Strain, but of the ſame Degree of Speach importing a plain Aſſertion or Denyal of a thing; for it is not the Number, but Nature of the Words ſpoaken, that is here prohibited: Nor can it be only underſtood of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi>; for every body knows that to be evil in it ſelf, which is <hi>more</hi> then that which <hi>cometh</hi> OF, or <hi>becauſe of Evil</hi>: Therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt be underſtood as well of <hi>Swearing,</hi> as of <hi>Forſwearing,</hi> which is not Evil it ſelf, yet cometh <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>by Reaſon</hi> of Evil in the World: Nor is there any thing <hi>more then Yea and Nay</hi> beſides <hi>Perjury,</hi> which can be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but an <hi>Oath</hi>; and therefore that was intended. Chriſt doth not only prohibit Evil it ſelf, but that which is Evil by <hi>Superfluity</hi> to Evangelical Sincerity, and that <hi>Swearing</hi> is (be it of what ſort it will) wherever <hi>Yea</hi> is <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi> is <hi>Nay.</hi> In ſhort, If what is <hi>More then Yea and Nay, cometh of Evil</hi>; then becauſe any <hi>Swearing,</hi> as well as Forſwearing, is <hi>more</hi> then <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay</hi>; it follows, that <hi>any</hi> Swearing <hi>cometh of Evil,</hi> and therefore ought to be rejected of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> Nor will our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of <gap reason="foreign">

To conclude; People <hi>ſwear</hi> to the End they may <hi>ſpeak Truth</hi>; Chriſt would have men <hi>ſpeak Truth,</hi> to the End they might <hi>not ſwear</hi>: he would not have his Followers upon ſuch baſe Reſerves, but their Word to carry the Weight of an Oath in it; that as others ought not to be guilty of Perjury, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought not to be guilty of Lying: For ſuch is the Advance from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Chriſt, Jew</hi> to <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that as the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> needs not the <hi>Jew's</hi> Curb, ſo his Lye is greater then the <hi>Jew</hi>'s Perjury, becauſe his Yea or Nay ought to be of more Value then the other's Oath.</p>

If the Righteouſneſs of the Law ought to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, we ought not to ſwear, becauſe we ought to be ſo Righteous as not to Lye. This is Evangelical; for as he that conceives not a foul or revengeful Thought, need not to purge himſelf of Adultery and Murder: Neither is there any Reaſon, that man ſhould purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Lying by Sweating, that doth not ſo much as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance an untrue Thought.

is built upon <hi>Lying</hi>; Take away <hi>Lying,</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more Ground for <hi>Swearing; Truth-ſpeaking</hi> comes in the room thereof: And this not only the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Doctrine</hi> teaches and requires; but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the bleſſed Author of it, is ready to <hi>work in the Hearts of the Children of Men,</hi> would they but come and learn of him, <hi>who is Meek, Lowly, filled with Grace and Truth.</hi> And we muſt needs ſay, It is a ſhameful thing, and very Diſhonourable to the Chriſtian-Religion, that thoſe who pretend themſelves to be the Followers of Chriſt, for ſo true Chriſtians ought to be, ſhould ſo degenerate from his Example and Doctrine as to want and uſe ſcarcing Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, diſpenced with in ſome of the weakeſt Times of Knowledge, and ſuch horrible Imprecations (never known to ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) to aſcertain one another of their Faith and Truth: Religion muſt needs have ſuffered a great Ebb, and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> a fearful Ecclips ſince thoſe brighter Ages of its Profeſſion: For Biſhop <hi>Gauden</hi> himſelf, in his Diſcourſe of <hi>Oaths,</hi> confeſſes, That <hi>the ancient</hi> Chriſtians <hi>were ſo ſtrict and exact, that there was no need of an Oath among them; yea, they ſo kept up the Sanctity and Credit of their Profeſſion among <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that it was Security enough in all Caſes to ſay,</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus ſum, <hi>I am a Chriſtian.</hi>

               <p>But to fortifie what we have hitherto urged in Defence of our Judgment and Practice; and to the End it may more fully appear, that our Tenderneſs in this great Caſe of <hi>Oaths</hi> comes not from any Sower, Sullen or Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Humor, or that we would trouble the World with any New fangled Opinion, we ſhall produce the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of ſeveral Famous and Good Men for above theſe Two Thouſand Years, among <hi>Gentiles, Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> enough to make an <hi>Occumenical Council</hi>; We ſhall cite them out of the beſt Editions we have been able to procure, and as truly and punctually as we can render them, digeſted in Order of Time.</p>

                     <p>We know it is objected by ſome, That he refuſed to Swear only becauſe he could not ſwear by that Oath, which is a Gueſs, and no Confutation of what we alledge: But if that had been <hi>Polycarpus</hi>'s Reaſon, why did he not rather ſay, The Law of God forbids Swearing by Idols?

'Tis certain, the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would not Swear, but thought <hi>Polycarpus</hi>'s Anſwer Security enough to them that demanded their Oath: He refuſed all Oaths as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; therefore ſaying, he was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> was Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient why he would not take that Oath.</p>

And in Chap. 23. he proves,

Which if <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had committed indeed, it is unlikely that <hi>Tertullian</hi> would have made ſuch a ſleight and ſhort preterition with a Sentence of Eight Words.

or to Swear by Idols; but true <hi>Chriſtians, not to ſwear, becauſe it was unlawful; for Chriſt had forbidden it</hi>: And as his Argument in the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> aforeſaid, was, <hi>It is Unlawful to Swear, much more to Forſwear</hi>; ſo here, <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath preſcribed not to Swear,</hi> then ſure not to Swear and ſubſcribe <hi>Gentile</hi> Oaths. So <hi>Baſilides, Becauſe I am a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>it is not lawful for me to ſwear</hi>; then not your Oath: this is the juſt Senſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it.

B. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt ſtrangely! A.</hi> No Wonder; that is the Nature of God peculiarly, that he cannot lye: There is none that can deny this. B. <hi>But what wilt thou ſay to me of the old Covenant? Surely it doth not prohibit an Oath, but requires a true one? A.</hi> No Wonder: At that time only it was preſcribed in the Law concerning Murder; but now it is not lawful for any Cauſe ſo much as to ſmite or beat: then the End of an Evil Deed only came into Judgment; but now that alſo which moveth to the End.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64138:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This is my Judgment: for now we have made, a long Progreſs; wherefore a Wiſe Man will abſtain from Oaths. B. <hi>What then? Doſt thou give to ſome as Infants a kind of firſt Food, that they may at length receive a ſucceeding kind of Meat? A.</hi> Thou judgeſt right and wiſely.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64138:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Blindneſs of their Hearts, their Unbelief and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to follow the Courſe of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and ſwear by their Gods. Let it not be forgotten, that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> not only inveighs againſt them that bring forth the Book to ſwear by, becauſe it is a Creature; but that he alſo upbraided them with Impudence and Audaciouſneſs, that dare make uſe of that Law to adminiſter an Oath by, <hi>that ſo ſtrictly forbids an Oath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ridiculous it is, to make them deny Swearing only in private Caſes, and to be ready to ſwear in Caſe of Life and Death: For where is there any Shadow of ſuch a Law?

The Doctors, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Judgment, whom they had moſtly in their Mouths, we have repeated here at large, in which is not the leaſt Reſtriction. Theſe Good Men then muſt needs be underſtood to take the Law of Chriſt either to have forbidden Swearing in any Caſe, and then not to ſwear in Caſe of Life; or not to forbid Swearing at all, and then they not only might ſwear to ſave their Lives, but Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Eſtates, and ought ſo to do.

                        <q>Now ye ſhall hear another thing. Commandment was given unto your Elders, none otherwiſe; but if they had made an Oath, they ſhould perform it, and not be Forſworn; for now they are bound to God, and not to man only: Wherefore among the <hi>Jews</hi> only Perjury is puniſhable; but he that deceives his Neighbour without any Oath made, he goes unpuniſhed; but yet the Law of the Goſpel condemneth him; the which, that ye may be the more remote from Perjury, doth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

condemn all manner of Oaths; <hi>that it is not lawful to Swear, neither by God, nor by thoſe things which ſeem to the Common Sort to be things of leſs Religion,</hi> that is, <hi>Neither by Heaven, becauſe it is the Seat of God; nor by the Earth, becauſe it is his Foot-ſtool; nor by</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>becauſe it is the City of the Great King,</hi> that is to ſay, of him that hath made all things: Neither as the <hi>Heathen</hi> ſwear, by the <hi>Head</hi> of another Man, whereof thou haſt no Authority; but it is conſecrate to God, that hath made all things as he would; for thou canſt not make one White Hair Black, nor the contrary: And becauſe all things are conſecrate to God, the Maker, thou oughteſt to be fearful to ſwear by any thing. And what needeth any Oath among them, <hi>where no man, becauſe of their Simplicity, can diſtruſt</hi>; nor no man can deſire to deceive, though they might do it? Such is their Sincerity and Perfectneſs, ſpecially in thoſe things of the which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves to be Deſpiſers. Therefore among you, <hi>plain and ſimple Speech ought to be more holy and more ſure then the devout and ſolemn Oath among the</hi> Jews: For, among you, whoſe Hearts and Mouths ought to agree, there is no other uſe of Speech, but to expreſs your Minds each to other. In your Bargains ye need no Oath, ye need no Execration, or Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or ſuch like, to bind the Promiſer, or to aſſure him to whom the Promiſe is made: Two Words be ſufficient, <hi>Nay</hi> and <hi>Yea,</hi> whereby

                        <q>It is the part of a Spiritual Man, not only Not to Swear in a Vain Thing, but alſo not in any Serious thing; for, you which are ſuch, are true: Unto true men it's ſufficient that a true man gain Belief, if he ſay, that the Lord hath commanded <hi>Yea, Yea,</hi> in Affirming; <hi>Nay, Nay,</hi> in Denying: But if with incredulous and Evil men a Speech alſo be had concerning a ſerious and neceſſary Matter, why ſhall one Swear for their Badneſs, that he may gain Belief with them? Who ever ſpake more ſeriouſly then our Saviour? Who more neceſſary things? Yet he never uſed other Speech then that, <hi>Verely, verely, I ſay unto you,</hi> or ſome other ſuch like, which was a true Form or Manner to them, that ſwore not. Therefore that now ſome Swear, to gain Belief concerning ſome profitable and neceſſary things, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64138:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they think is to be given rather to the Oath then to the Perſon: Perhaps alſo there is a Danger when an Oath is required in Judgment, leſt he that exacteth it, ſin; For if it be manifeſt, that he that is called into Judgment be verely good and true, it is enough to hear of him <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi>; but if that be not evident, or that it be evident, that he is bad, perhaps that's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him which ought not to be required. What then? It is lawful to Adjure: For the Lord made Anſwer to an Adjuration, but he did not Swear; and Adjurations are found in the New Law: But if any one being Adjured of another, ſpeak the Truth, by anſwearing <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> or by declaring the thing requir'd, neither the one nor the other offendeth; but if he ſpeak a Falſity, he offends, and incurs the Offence of a Falſe Teſtimony, but perchance he ſinneth leſs then if by Swearing he had alſo fallen into the Guilt of Perjury: For, as he that (being adjured) anſwereth in Truth, doth not Swear; ſo he that anſwereth in Falſneſs, doth not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear, but he is a Falſe Witneſs: but he alſo who hath adjured, is altogether guitleſs; for, there is no doubt but he hath required that which was lawful to require.
