            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I doe offer vnto your LA:
the first worke of mine that
ever came in Print; because
your rare example, hath given an excellent
approbation to the matter contained in this
Booke; for you haue passed by all excuses, and
haue ventured vpon, &amp; doe goe on with that
loving act of a loving mother; in giving the
sweete milke of your owne breasts, to your
owne childe; wherein you haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the greatest number of honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of your place, in these latter times. But I
wish many may follow you, in this good

to read this little short treatise; may be
put in minde of a duty, which all mothers are
bound to performe; and I shall be glad if any
will consider, and put in practice, that which
is both naturall and comfortable. I hope they
will at the least commend with me such as do
this good deede, and no more speake scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of that which is worthy of great praise;
and for my part I thinke it an honour vnto
you, to doe that which hath proued you to
be full of care to please God, and of naturall
affection, and to bee well stored with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and patience, all which are highly to be
praised; to giue praise to any person or thing
deseruing praise, I dare doe it, &amp; for this loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
action of yours I can with much thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
praise God, for all his gracious guifts
of grace and Nature, wherby he hath inabled
you, to doe the same: desiring also with my

of the holy God, which are Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Gods loue, and doth challenge a very
great esteeme from me, amongst the rest, that
can truly iudge and rightly discerne what is

Trust in God for strength to grow and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

            <p>THE Generall Consent of too many

(most Christian Reader) hath caused
one of the <hi>Noblest</hi> and <hi>Fairest</hi>

As ashamed to see her sex far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

their kind, hath made <hi>Honour</hi> it selfe stoop to these paines;
which now shee sends thee to pervse. <hi>Three things</hi> easily
Inuite to Read what to view is offred. <hi>Eminency,</hi> or <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
in the Author. <hi>Rarity</hi> in the handled Matter; <hi>Breuity</hi>
in the quicke dispatch. These three meet in this won. The
Author so <hi>Eminent</hi> in <hi>Honour;</hi> thou canst hardly be anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<hi>Honourable;</hi> and not be interested in her <hi>Honours

a peculiar tract of this subiect, I belieue, is not in

a Reader, let me acquaint thee next, is here to be <hi>found.</hi>

can doe to making <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Through,</hi> this is
<hi>Such.</hi> The <hi>Accommodation</hi> to these particulars (Gentle

            <head>THE COVNTESSE OF
Lincolnes Nurserie.</head>
            <p>BEcause it hath pleased God
to blesse me with many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and so caused me to
obserue many things falling
out to mothers, and to their
children; I thought good to
open my minde concerning a speciall matter
belonging to all childe-bearing women, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to consider of: and to manifest my
minde the better, even to write of this matter,
so farre as God shall please to direct me; in
summe, the matter I meane, <hi>Is the duty of nursing
due by mothers to their owne children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In setting downe whereof, I wil first shew,
that every woman ought to nurse her owne
childe; and secondly, I will endeavour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
such obiections, as are vsed to be cast
out against this dutie to disgrace the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:17137:6"/>
The first point is easily performed. For it is
the expresse <hi>ordinance</hi> of God that mothers
should nurse their owne children, &amp; being his
ordinance they are bound to it in conscience.
This should stop the mouthes of all replyers,
for <hi>God is most wise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa.31.2.</note> and therefore must needs
know what is fittest and best for vs to doe: &amp;
to prevent all foolish feares, or shifts, we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to vnderstand that he is also <hi>All sufficient,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen.17.1.</note>
&amp; therefore infinitely able to blesse his owne
ordinance, and to afford vs meanes in our
selues (as continuall experience confirmeth)
toward the obseruance thereof.</p>
            <p>If this (as it ought) bee granted, then how
venterous are those women that dare venter
to doe otherwise, and so to refuse, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to dispise that order, which the most
wise and allmighty God hath appointed, and
in steed thereof to chuse their owne pleasures?
Oh what peace can there be to these womens
consciences, vnlesse through the darknes of
their vnderstanding they judge it no disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
            <p>And then they will driue me to proue that
this nursing, and nourishing of their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17137:6"/>
in their own bosomes is Gods ordinance;
They are very willful, or very ignorant, if they
make a question of it. For it is proued suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to be their dutie, both by Gods word,
and also by his workes.</p>
            <p>By his word it is proued, first by <hi>Examples,</hi>
namely the example of <hi>Eue.</hi> For who suckled
her sonnes Cain, Abel, Seth, &amp;c. but her selfe?
Which shee did not only of meere necessitie,
because yet no other woman was created;
but especially because shee was their mother,
and so sawe it was her duty: and because
shee had a true naturall affection, which
moved her to doe it gladly. Next the example
of <hi>Sarah</hi> the wife of <hi>Abraham;</hi> For shee both
gaue her sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> suck,<note place="margin">Gen.21.7.</note> as doing the dutie
commanded of God: And also tooke great
comfort, and delight therein, as in a duty well
pleasing to her selfe; whence shee spake of it,
as of an action worthy to be named in her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reioycing. Now if <hi>Sarah,</hi> so great a <hi>Princesse,</hi>
did nurse her own childe, why should any of
vs neglect to doe the like, except (which God
forbid) we thinke scorne to follow her, whose
daughters it is our glory to be, and which we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17137:7"/>
be only vpon this condition, that we imitate
her well-doing.<note place="margin">1.Pet.3.6.</note> Let vs looke therefore to our
worthy Pattern, noting withall, that shee put
her selfe to this worke when shee was very
old, and so might the better haue excused her
selfe, then we yonger women can: being also
more able to hire, and keepe a nurse, then any
of vs. But why is shee not followed by most
in the practise of this duty? Euen because they
want her vertue, and piety. This want is the
common hinderance to this point of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
obedience; for this want makes them
want loue to Gods precepts, want loue to his
doctrine, and like step-mothers, want due loue
to their own children.</p>
            <p>But now to another worthy example,
namely that excellent woman <hi>Hannah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.Sam.1.23.</note> who
hauing after much affliction of minde obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a sonne of God, whom shee vowed vnto
God; shee did not put him to another to nurse,
but nursed him her owne selfe vntill shee had
weaned him, &amp; carried him to be consecrate
vnto the Lord: As well knowing that this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of giuing her childe sucke, was so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, as for the cause thereof shee did
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17137:7"/>
not sinne in staying with it at home from the
yearely sacrifice: but now women, especially
of any place, and of little grace, doe not hold
this duty acceptable to God, because it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
to themselues: as if they would
haue the Lord to like, and dislike, according
to their vaine lusts.</p>
            <p>To proceed, take notice of one example
more, that is, of the <hi>blessed Virgin:</hi> as her womb
bare our <hi>blessed Sauiour,</hi> so her papps gaue him
sucke. Now who shall deny the own mothers
suckling of their owne children: to bee their
duty, since euery godly matrone hath walked
in these steps before them: <hi>Eue</hi> the mother of
al the liuing; <hi>Sarah</hi> the mother of al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
<hi>Hannah</hi> so gratiously heard of God; <hi>Mary</hi>
blessed among women, and called blessed of
all ages. And who can say but that the rest of
holy women mentioned in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
did the like; since no doubt that speech
of that noble Dame, saying, who would
haue said to <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>Sarah</hi> should haue
giuen children sucke? was taken from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

And so much for proofe of this office, and
duty to be Gods ordinance, by his own <hi>VVord</hi>
according to the argument of <hi>Examples:</hi> I
hope I shall likewise proue it by the same
word from plaine <hi>Precepts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.Tim.5.14.</note> First from that
<hi>Precept,</hi> which willeth the younger women to
marry, and to <hi>Beare</hi> children, that is, not only
to <hi>Beare</hi> them in the wombe, and to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
forth; but also to <hi>Beare</hi> them on their knee, in
their armes,<note place="margin">Ver.10.</note> and at their breasts: for this <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
a little before is called nourishing, and
bringing vp: and to inforce it the better vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
womens consciences, it is numbred as the
first of the good workes, for which godly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
should be well reported of. And well it
may be the first, because if holy Ministers, or
other Christians doe heare of a good woman
to be brought to bed, and her child to bee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
their first question vsually is, whether
she her selfe giue it sucke, yea, or no? if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
be she doth, then they commend her: if
the answer be she doth not, then they are sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for her.</p>
            <p>And thus I come to a second <hi>Precept.</hi> I pray
you, who that iudges aright; doth not hold
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17137:8"/>
the suckling of her owne childe the part of a
true mother, of an honest mother, of a iust
mother, of a syncere mother, of a mother wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of loue, of a mother deseruing good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
of a vertuous mother, of a mother win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
praise for it? All this is assented to by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of good vnderstanding. Therefore this is
also a <hi>Precept,</hi> as for other duties, so for <hi>This</hi> of
mothers to their children; which saith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
things are true,<note place="margin">Philip.4.8.</note> whatsoeuer things are
honest, whatsoeuer things are iust, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
things are pure, whatsoeuer things be wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy
of loue, whatsoeuer things be of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
if there be any vertue, if there bee any
praise, thinke on these things, these things
doe and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
            <p>So farre for my promise, to proue by the
word of God, that it is his ordinance that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
should nurse their owne children: now
I will endeauour to proue it by his <hi>workes:</hi>
First by his <hi>workes of iudgement;</hi> if it were not
his ordinance for mothers to giue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
sucke, it were no <hi>iudgement</hi> to bereaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of their milke, but it is specified to be a great
<hi>iudgement</hi> to bereaue them hereof, &amp; to giue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17137:9"/>
them dry breasts, therefore it is to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
euen from hence, that it is his ordinance,
since to depriue them of meanes to doe it, is a
punishment of them.</p>
            <p>I adde to this <hi>the worke that God worketh in
the very nature of mothers,</hi> which proueth also
that he hath ordained that they should nurse
their owne children: for by his secret operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the mothers affection it so knit by natures
law to her tender babe, as she findes no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to deny to suckle it, no not when shee is in
hazard to lose her owne life, by attending on
it; for in such a case it is not said, let the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fly, and leaue her infant to the perill, as if
she were dispensed with: but onely it is said
<hi>woe to her,</hi> as if she were to be pittied, that for
nature to her child, she must be vnnaturall to
her selfe: now if any then being euen at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in peace, with all plenty, shall deny to
giue sucke to their owne children, they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
nature: and shew that God hath not
done so much for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as to worke any good,<note place="margin">Lam.7.3.</note>
no not in their nature, but left them more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
then the Dragons, and as cruell to their
little ones as the Ostriches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17137:9"/>
Now another <hi>worke</hi> of God, prouing this
point is the <hi>worke of his prouision,</hi> for euery
kinde to be apt, and able to nourish their own
fruit: there is no beast that feeds their young
with milke, but the Lord, euen from the first
ground of the order of nature; <hi>Growe, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie;</hi>
hath prouided it of milke to suckle their
owne young, which euery beast takes so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
vnto, as if another beast come toward
their young to offer the office of a Damme
vnto it, they shew according to their fashion,
a plaine dislike of it: as if nature did speake in
them, and say it is contrary to Gods order in
nature, commanding each kinde to increase,
and multiplie in their owne bodies, and by
their owne breasts, not to bring forth by one
Damme, and to bring vp by another: but it is
his ordinance that euery kinde should both
bring forth, and also nurse its owne fruit.</p>
            <p>Much more should this work of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
to perswade women, made as man in
the image of God, and therefore should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to bee put to schoole to learne good
nature of the vnreasonable creature. In vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
as we knowe by experience, God prouideth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17137:10"/>
milke in our breasts against the time of our
childrens birth, and this hee hath done euer
since it was said to vs also, <hi>Increase, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
so that this worke of his prouision shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that hee tieth vs likewise to nourish the
children of our owne wombe, with our own
breasts, euen by the order of nature: yea it
sheweth that he so careth for, and regardeth
little children euen from the wombe, that he
would haue them nursed by those that in all
reason will looke to them with the kindest
affection, namely their mothers; &amp; in giuing
them milke for it, hee doth plainely tell them
that herequires it.</p>
            <p>Oh consider, how comes our milke? is it
not by the direct prouidence of God? Why
prouides he it, but for the child? The mothers
then that refuse to nurse their owne children,
doe they not despise Gods prouidence? Doe
they not deny Gods will? Doe they not as it
were say, <hi>I see, O God, by the meanes thou hast put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, that thou wouldst haue me nurse the child thou
hast giuen me, but I will not doe so much for thee.</hi>
Oh impious, and impudent vnthankfulnesse;
yea monstrous vnnaturalnesse, both to their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17137:10"/>
own natural fruit borne so neare their breasts,
and fed in their owne wombes, and yet may
not be suffered to sucke their owne milke.</p>
            <p>And this vnthankfulnesse, and vnnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is oftner the sinne of the <hi>Higher,</hi> and the
<hi>richer sort,</hi> then of the meaner, and poorer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
some nice and prowd idle dames, who
will imitate their betters, till they make their
poore husbands beggars. And this is one hurt
which the better ranke doe by their ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
egge, and imbolden the lower ones to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them to their losse: were it not better for
<hi>Vs greater persons</hi> to keepe Gods ordinance, &amp;
to shew the meaner their dutie in our good
example? I am sure wee haue more helpes to
performe it, and haue fewer probable reasons
to alleage against it, then women that liue by
hard labour, &amp; painfull toile. If such mothers
as refuse this office of loue, &amp; of nature to their
children, should hereafter be refused, despised,
and neglected of those their children, were
they not iustly required according to their
owne vnkind dealing? I might say more in
handling this first point of my promise; but
I leaue the larger, and learneder discourse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17137:11"/>
vnto men of art, and learning: only I speake
of so much as I reade, and know in my owne
experience, which if any of my sexe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
do receaue good by, I am glad: if they
scorne it, they shall haue the reward of scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
I write in modestie, and can reape no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
by their immodest folly.</p>
            <p>And so I come to the last part of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
which is to answer obiections made by
diuers against this duty of mothers to their
children.</p>
            <p>First it is obiected that <hi>Rebeckah</hi> had a nurse,
and that therefore her mother did not giue
her suck of her owne breasts, and so good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in the first ages, did not hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this
office of nursing their owne children. To this
I answer; that if her mother had milk, and
health, and yet did put this duty from her to
another, it was her fault, &amp; so proueth nothing
against me. But it is manifest that she that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckah</hi>
calleth her nurse, was called so, either
for that she most tended her while her mother
suckled her: or for that she weaned her: or for
that during her nonage, and childhood, shee
did minister to her continually such good
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17137:11"/>
things as delighted, and nourished her vp. For
to any one of these the name of a nourse is
fitly giuen: whence a good wife is called her
husbands nourse: and that <hi>Rebeckahs</hi> nourse
was only such a one,<note place="margin">Gen.24.61.</note> appeareth, because after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
she is not named a <hi>nourse,</hi> but a <hi>maide,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Then <hi>Rebeckah</hi> rose, and her maides; now
maids giue not suck out of their breasts, never
any virgin, or honest maide gaue suck, but
that <hi>blessed one</hi> from an extraordinary, &amp; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
power.</p>
            <p>Secondly it is obiected, that it is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
that it is noysome to ones clothes; that
it makes one looke old, &amp;c. All such reasons
are vncomely, and vnchristian to be obiected:
and therefore vnworthy to be answered, they
argue <hi>vnmotherly affection, idlenesse, desire to haue
liberty to gadd from home, pride, foolish finenesse, lust,
wantonnesse,</hi> &amp; the like euills. Aske <hi>Sarah, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi>
the <hi>blessed virgin,</hi> and any modest louing
mother, what trouble they accounted it to
giue their little ones sucke: behold most nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
mothers and they be as cleane and sweet
in their cloathes, and carry their age, and hold
their beautie, as well as those that suckle not:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17137:12"/>
and most likely are they so to doe; because
keeping Gods <hi>Ordinance,</hi> they are sure of Gods
<hi>Blessing:</hi> and it hath beene obserued in some
women that they grew more beautifull, and
better fauoured, by very nursing their owne
children.</p>
            <p>But there are some women that obiect
feare: saying that they are so weake, &amp; so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that they are afraid to venter to giue their
children suck, least they indanger their health
thereby. Of these, I demand, why then they
did venter to marry, and so to beare children;
and if they say they could not chuse, and that
they thought not that marriage would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
their health: I answere, that for the same
reasons they should set themselues to nurse
their owne children, because they should not
chuse but doe what God would haue them
to doe: and they should beleeue that this
worke will be for their health also, seeing it is
ordinary with the Lord to giue <hi>good stomach,
health,</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> to almost all mothers that
take this paines with their children.</p>
            <p>One answere more to all the obiections
that vse to bee made against giuing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17137:12"/>
sucke, is this, that now the hardnes, to
effect this matter, is much remooued by a
late example of a <hi>tender young Lady,</hi> and you
may all be encouraged to follow after, in that
wherein she hath gone before you, &amp; so made
the way more easie, and more hopefull by
that which shee findeth possible and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
by Gods blessing, and no offence to her
<hi>Lord</hi> nor her <hi>selfe:</hi> shee might haue had as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doubts, and lets, as any of you, but she was
willing to try how God would enable her, &amp;
he hath giuen her good successe, as I hope he
will doe to others that are willing to trust in
God for his helpe.</p>
            <p>Now if any reading these few lines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
against me, that it may bee I my selfe
haue giuen my own children suck: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am bolder, and more busie to meddle in
vrging this point, to the end to insult ouer, &amp;
to make them to bee blamed that haue not
done it. I answer, that whether I haue, or haue
not performed this my bounden duty, I will
not deny to tell my own practise. I knowe &amp;
acknowledge that I should haue done it, and
hauing not done it; it was not for want of will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17137:13"/>
in my selfe, but <hi>partly I was ouerruled by anothers
authority,</hi> and <hi>partly deceiued by somes ill counsell,</hi> &amp;
<hi>partly I had not so well considered of my duty in this
motherly office,</hi> as since I did, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was too late
for me to put it in execution. Wherefore being
pricked in hart for my vndutifullnesse, this
way I studie to redeeme my peace, first by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
towards God, humbly and often cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his pardon for this my offence: secondly
by <hi>studying how to shew double loue to my children,</hi> to
make them amends for neglect of this part of
loue to them, when they should haue hung on
my breasts, &amp; haue beene nourished in mine
owne bosome: thirdly <hi>by doing my indeauour to
prevent many christian mothers</hi> from sining in the
same kinde, against our most louing, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious God.</p>
            <p>And for this cause I add vnto my perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
promise, this short exhortation: namely
I beseech all godly women to remember, how
we <hi>elder</hi> ones are commaunded to instruct the
<hi>yonger,</hi> to loue their children, now therefore
loue them so as to do this office to them when
they are borne, more gladly for <hi>loue</hi> sake, then
a <hi>strunger,</hi> who bore them not, shall do for <hi>lucre</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:17137:13"/>
sake. Also I pray you to set no more so light
by Gods blessing in your owne breasts, which
the holy Spirit ranketh with other excellent
blessings; if it be vnlawfull to trample vnder
feete a cluster of grapes, in which a little wine
is found; then how vnlawfull is it to destroye
and drie vp those breasts, in which your owne
child (and perhaps one of Gods very elect, to
whom to be a noursing father, is a Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and to whom to be a noursing mother,
is a Queens honour) might finde food of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
milke, euen from Gods immediate proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
vntill it were fitter for stronger meat?
I doe knowe that the Lord may deny some
women, either to haue any milke in their
breasts at all, or to haue any passage for their
milke, or to haue any health, or to haue a
right minde: and so they may be letted from
this duty, by <hi>want,</hi> by <hi>sicknesse,</hi> by <hi>lunacy,</hi> &amp;c.
But I speake not to these: I speake to you,
Whose <hi>consciences</hi> witnesse against you, that
you cannot iustly alleage any of those impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</p>
            <p>Doe you submit your selues, to the paine
and trouble of this ordinance of God? trust
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17137:14"/>
not other women, whom <hi>wages hyres</hi> to doe it,
better then your selues, whom <hi>God, and nature
ties</hi> to doe it. I haue found by grieuous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
such dissembling in nurses, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sufficiency of milke, when indeed they
had too much scarcitie; pretending willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
towardnesse, wakefulnesse, when indeed
they haue beene most wilfull, most froward,
and most slothfull, as I feare the death of one
or two of my little Babes came by the defalt
of their nurses. Of all those which I had for
eighteene children, I had but two which were
throughly willing, and carefull: diuers haue
had their children miscarry in the nurses
hands, and are such mothers (if it were by the
nurses carelesnesse) guiltlesse? I knowe not
how they should, since they will shut them
out of the <hi>armes of nature,</hi> and leaue them to
the will of a <hi>stranger;</hi> yea to one that will
seeme to <hi>estrange</hi> her selfe from her <hi>owne child,</hi>
to giue sucke to the <hi>nurse-child:</hi> This she may
faine to doe vpon a <hi>couetous composition,</hi> but
she frets at it in her minde, if she haue any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
affection.</p>
            <p>Therefore be no longer at the trouble, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17137:14"/>
at the care to hire others to doe your <hi>owne
worke:</hi>
bee not so <hi>vnnaturall</hi> to thrust away
your owne children: be not so <hi>hardy</hi> as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a <hi>tender Babe</hi> to a <hi>lesse tender heart:</hi> bee not
<hi>accessary</hi> to that disorder of causing a <hi>poorer
woman to banish her owne infant,</hi> for the entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a <hi>richer womans child,</hi> as it were, bidding
her <hi>vnloue her owne to loue yours.</hi> Wee haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Eue</hi> in transgression, let vs follow her
in obedience. VVhen God laid the sorrowes
of conception, of breeding of bringing forth,
and of bringing vp her children vpon her, &amp;
so vpon vs in her loynes, did shee reply any
word against? Not a word; so I pray you all
mine owne <hi>Daughters,</hi> and others that are still
child-bearing reply not against the duty of
suckling them, when God hath sent you
them.</p>
            <p>Indeed I see some, if the wether be wet, or
cold; if the way be fowle; if the Church be far
off, I see they are so coy, so nice, so luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme,
they will not take paines for their <hi>own
soules.</hi> alas, no maruell if these will not bee at
trouble, and paine to nourish their <hi>childrens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
but feare God, bee diligent to serue him;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17137:15"/>
approue all his ordinances; seeke to please
him; account it no trouble, or paine to doe
any thing that hath the promise of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
and then you will, no doubt, doe this
<hi>good, laudable, naturall, louing duty</hi> to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
If yet you be not satisfied, inquire not of
such as refuse to doe this: consult not with
your owne conceit aduise not with flatterers:
but aske counsell of syncere, and faithfull
Preachers. If you be satisfied; then take this
with you, to make you doe it cheerefully.
Thinke alwaies, that hauing the child at your
breast, and hauing it in your armes, you haue
<hi>Gods blessing</hi> there. For children are Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
Thinke againe how your Babe crying
for your breast, sucking hartily the milke out
of it, and growing by it, is the <hi>Lords owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
euery houre, and euery day, that you
are suckling it, instructing you to shew that
you are his <hi>new borne Babes,</hi> by your earnest
desire after his word; &amp; the syncere doctrine
thereof, and by your daily growing in grace
and goodnesse thereby, so shall you reape
pleasure, and profit. Againe, you may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that when your child is at your breast, it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17137:15"/>
is a fit occasion to moue your heart to pray
for a blessing vpon that worke; and to giue
thanks for your child, and for ability &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
vnto that, which many a mother would
haue done and could not; who haue tried &amp;
ventured their health, &amp; taken much paines,
and yet haue not obtained their desire. But
they that are fitted euery way for this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
act,</hi> haue certainely great cause to be
thankfull: and I much desire that God may
haue glory and praise for euery good worke,
and you much comfort, that doe seeke to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God in all things.</p>
