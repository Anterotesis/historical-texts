            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas the Doctrine of a right unto Chriſtians to hold a propriety of Goods and ſubſtance, doth ſuppoſe a conceſſion of the like right unto them to wage Law in the defence thereof, provided their matters be of weight unto them (according to their eſtates) and their caſes of neceſſity, and that waging of Law is it, that ordinarily giveth ſuch occaſion as is juſt, for men to be Sworn, I have in a word and by the way touched upon both theſe Rights; to inſiſt upon either would require another Treatiſe, and that may prove needleſs, if in this matter of Swearing, which is moſt in controverſy, and of greateſt difficulty, I may be heard; in order whereunto, I hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if not of thoſe that gainſay, yet of thoſe that ſcruple the lawfulneſs of Swearing in any caſe, that they will weigh my Reaſons or Arguments without prejudice, and the rather becauſe of their ſo doing, they may have this benefit, namely, be ſet free in Conſcience by Oath, both to ſet an end to ſtrife in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes of difference, and alſo to ſerve the publick, in undergoing ſuch Offices and Services thereof, as they may be called unto: For the performance whereof, the more men fear an Oath, the more they are to be truſted, and the better to be accepted: To fear an Oath in this caſe is very commendable; but to refuſe to ſwear at all, to deprave and exclaim againſt it is intollerable, the publick is not only hindred, but alſo affronted by this. And how can men be ſo impudently ſilly, as to think wilfully and opinionatively to incommode the publick, and yet themſelves to take no harm by it? I hope ſuch will no longer perſiſt in the one, to occaſion the other, when by this Treatiſe they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that for Conſcience ſake they have no need to do ſo. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

            <p>OUr Saviour ſaith, <hi>(Mat</hi> 5. 17.) <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law, I am not come to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to ſet it out to the full. I am not come to looſe men from any Obligations or duties of the moral Law, which formerly lay upon them; but I am come to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Law from ſuch corruptions as the vitiouſneſs of times, men and manners, hath brought upon it, as in this particular of Swearing.</p>
            <p>It was acknowledged by the <hi>Jews,</hi> that men ought neither to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear themſelves, nor yet to take Gods name in vain in any wiſe, and yet vain-Swearing was much in uſe among them, ſo much in uſe, that they did not think much the worſe of themſelves for it, (provided that they did not uſe the name of God in it.)</p>
            <p>To avoid this therefore, forbearing the name of God, they uſed the names of other things, infinitely below God, and yet of no ſmall eſteem with them, as by Heaven, by the Earth, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Temple, the Altar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thinking by this ſhift, if not to ſwear without ſinning, yet to extenuate the ſin of Swearing.</p>
            <p>This device poſſibly they had from the Heathens, who were wont to be very ſparing in ſwearing by their Gods, chooſing rather to make their vain and light Oaths by ſuch things as were obvious to them, and preſent before them; the Grecians ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner <hi>Philo</hi> reports of the <hi>Jews, viz.</hi> That in ſwearing vain and cuſtomary Oaths, they did it not by God, but by Heaven, by the Earth, by <hi>Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though theſe forms and faſhions of Swearing in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> were born with by thoſe that read the Law unto them of old time, yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63292:3"/>
did not that make them to be lawful, therefore Chriſt being come to fulfil the Law, utterly declares againſt them, ſaying, <hi>Swear not at all, neither by Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Swearing is the ſubject of the Text above writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the lawfulneſs and unlawfulneſs whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> in diverſe reſpects, I purpoſe (by Gods help) to deliver in two propoſitions, whereof the one is expreſt by the words of the aforementioned Text, and the other by a juſt conſequence to be deduced from them:</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition is, That no manner of vain and light Swearing under what form or notion ſoever was or is tolerated by the Law of God; In this ſenſe it is that our Saviour (who is the beſt expounder of the Law) ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſition is, That the action of Swearing, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelf, without any evil circumſtances to deprave it, is no more forbidden unto us under the New Teſtament, than it was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old. Our Saviour taketh not away Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, but the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>Though of the firſt Propoſition there needs little or nothing to be ſpoken (our Saviours words being ſo plain and peremptory) for proof of Doctrine, yet may a few words be made of it, by way of illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for inſtruction in righteouſneſs. Thus therefore</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerveth, That in all ages, and in moſt Nations, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of people are very apt to have an uſe, and a cuſtome of idle and vain Swearing, ſuch is their incogitancy that they do not duly weigh how great a crime it is to abuſe the name of God, and if herein (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing the name of God) they uſe the names of other things, they are never the nearer to be quit from blame; nay, in ſo doing they commit two evils at once, firſt they give to the creature the honour due to the Creator; and then under the names and pretence of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they abuſe God himſelf, it being impoſſible for us to ſwear by them without reflecting upon him: Saith St <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 
               <q>If a man ſwear by a ſtone, and do it either vainly or falſly, God is concerned in it, the ſtone heareth not, but God will puniſh the deceiver, he will puniſh the profane Swearer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That God is abuſed under the name and pretence of his creatures, when they are ſworn by, appears by our Saviour Chriſt, both ſhewing how it is done, and alſo giving a reaſon why it ought not to be done; the manner how it is done, he ſhews to be by Heaven, by the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon why this ought not to be done he giveth, ſaying, <hi>For Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is Gods Throne, the Earth is his footſtool, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſomewhat of this indirect and ſlight kind of Swearing yet among us notwithſtanding the reformation of Religion, and the light of the Goſpel, ſo clearly ſhining unto us; to ſpare the name of God, we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63292:4"/>
Swear one while by one Saint, and another while by another; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are ſo modeſt that to ſpare the Saints, we Swear by inanimate things, as may be by this Light, by this Fire, by this Cup, by this Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, juſt the heatheniſh kind of Swearing <hi>viz.</hi> by ſuch things as are obvious to us, and preſent before us:</p>
            <p>The Jews heretofore by the devices and ſhifts they uſed in Swearing inſtead of being able to delude the Law of God, did onely ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be groſly ignorant in what they did, ſo ignorant that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calls them fools, and blind upon that account, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. from ver. the 16th to the 22th. <hi>Wo unto you, ye blind guides which ſay, whoſoever ſhall Swear by the Temple, it is nothing, but whoſoever ſhail Swear by the Gold of the Temple, he is a debter. Ye fools, and blind: For whether is greater, the Gold, or the Temple that ſanctifieth the Gold? And whoſoever ſhall Swear by the Altar,</hi> &amp;c. To level this compariſon, and to end the ſtrife, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore do men indulge themſelves this idle cuſtom of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? what is it good for? there is no man thought to ſpeak leſs truth, than he that hardly ſpeaks any thing without an Oath, ſuch a one is ne'r the nearer to be truſted for being ſworn: ſay'th <hi>Juvenal</hi> to ſuch a one, <hi>Quamvis jurato nolim tibi cedere teſti,</hi> for matter of truſt it is as good for a man to ſay nothing, as to ſwear every thing he ſaith.</p>
            <p>Sober men look not for Oaths one from another upon common occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions either of diſcourſe, or dealing, ordinarily their communication is no more than yea, and nay; and when oaths are due from them, though they pay them, yet doe they it, not without fear, and trembling; of very great weight and moment they think it to be for them ſolemnly to call upon God to be a witneſs to what they ſay.</p>
            <p>To be deter'd from prophane, common and cuſtomary Oaths, as alſo from indirect forms and faſhions of Swearing, let men conſider how ſtrictly our Saviour Chriſt doth ſorbid them, ſo ſtrictly as to admit of no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of former times to preſcribe for them; <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all.</hi> To this Prohibition ſo ſtrict, and Authentick, our Saviour is pleaſed to give alſo a reaſon, why ſuch vain Swearing ought to be forborn, <hi>viz: becauſe it comes of Evil:</hi> it comes of Evil, not ſingle, but double, of Evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, and from Evil without us; from within us, it comes of all manner of Licentiouſneſs, and unrulineſs of paſſion, Pride, Arrogance, Preſumption, Irreverence towards God, diſdain towards Men, Prophaneneſs, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from without us, it comes of the inſtigation of the Devil, that evil one, who deſireth nothing more than the diſhonouring of God, and that by us Men, for whom God hath done ſo much as nothing might be done more. The inſtigation of the Devil is apparent in this ſin of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63292:4"/>
Swearing, ſo as hardly in any other ſin ſo much; It is a ſin that is ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt God that it ſeems to have no greater deſign than to abuſe him to his face.</p>
            <p>If any man that is a Common ſwearer ſhall ſay that in Swearing he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no ſuch thing; I would ask ſuch a one, why doth he Swear then? is he ſo vain as to Swear intending nothing? if he ſay he intends the confirmation of what he ſaith, I would ask him again, If he be of ſo little credit as to have need by Oath to confirm every word he ſpeaks, or doth he think thoſe he converſeth withall to be ſo like himſelf, as not to truſt him otherwiſe?</p>
            <p>But it being no news for either prophane, common and cuſtomary Swearing, to be reprov'd, or for indirect and deviſed forms and faſhions of Oaths to be expoſs'd, I will diſmiſs them at preſent and apply my ſelf to the ſecond propoſition, wherein as there is much queſtion made among us now adays; ſo would it be worth while to render it (as it ought to be) <hi>viz.</hi> queſtionleſs: If men be ſcrupulous in <hi>Theſi, viz.</hi> Whether it be lawful to Swear at all or not, what ſhall they do in this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that may require an oath?</p>
            <p>The Second propoſition therefore is, That the Action of Swearing ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered in it ſelf without any evil circumſtances to deprave it, is no more forbidden unto us under the new Teſtament than it was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to the Jews under the Old, our Saviour takes not away Swearing it ſelf, but the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>From our Saviours words read ſo far as <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and no farther, the <hi>Manichees</hi> long time, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of late, and a Sect of Gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers among us at preſent, doe hold opinion, that though Gods people heretofore under the old Teſtament might Swear upon juſt, and weighty occaſions, yet Chriſtians now under the new Teſtament may not Swear at all, as if the one Teſtament did condemn the other, and not (as the truth is) the latter expound the former.</p>
            <p>Under colour of theſe words of our Saviour partially taken and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>viz.</hi> reading, <hi>Swear not all,</hi> and leaving out the reſt of the Text wherein our Saviour's ſentence is contain'd, they ſpare not to call into queſtion the general practice of all Kingdoms, States, Policies, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Societies throughout all Chriſtendom, in the conſtitutions whereof there is hardly any thing of moment wont to be eſtabliſhed without an Oath.</p>
            <p>If according to their opinion, Swearing be a thing that is, ſimply and abſolutely evil in it ſelf, then for us to ſay that Civil States and Policies cannot be maintained without it, is no more excuſe, than to ſay that: Civil Policy and true Chriſtianity cannot conſiſt together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63292:5"/>
A thing that is abſolutely ſinful, is not to be continued in, no not, though the world were to be preſerved by it, and abſolutely ſinful Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, if it be abſolutely forbidden by Chriſt; how therefore it is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by him is the thing that is to be enquir'd into, the ſinding out whereof decides the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>We ſee that this matter of Swearing is the Subject of one inſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong divers more that our Saviour giveth to the Jews to ſhew how the Law of God was abus'd among them; the occaſion therefore of theſe words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> our Saviour took not from the Action of Swearing ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, but from the abuſe of it among the Jews; partly through vain and cuſtomary Oaths, and partly through indirect and deviſed forms and faſhions of Swearing.</p>
            <p>In the very action of Swearing they neither taught nor did otherwiſe than as God himſelf did expreſly command, or at leaſt allow them to doe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God and ſerve him, and ſhalt Swear by his Name.</hi> From hence it muſt needs follow (our Saviours buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this Sermon being not to deſtroy, but to reform, and explain things) that he did not mean to take away Swearing it ſelf, but onely the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>That it was ſaid by them of old time, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf;</hi> it was right, their fault was that they did not ſay alſo, Thou ſhalt not ſwear at all by the Heaven's, by the Earth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or uſe any other ſuch indirect, and deviſed kind of Swearing; our Saviour blameth them not ſimply for Swearing, but for Swearing in ſuch manner as they did, by Heaven, by the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a manner inconſiſtent with ſo holy and reverend a thing as the making Oath may be.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour in ſaying, <hi>Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor by the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> doth no more take away all manner of Swearing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, than he doth all manner of dominion and authority from among his Diſciples in ſaying unto them that in the exerciſe of thoſe things it ſhould not be among them as it was among the Gentiles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>There is a right manner of Swearing as well as a wrong, a holy and reverend taking of Gods name, as well as a taking of it in vain; <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> is not all that our Saviour ſaith in this matter; if it were it would be the harder on our ſide: but that which he ſaith is, <hi>Swear not at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Swear not at all as ye are wont to do, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Creatures, that among them ye make a difference, as if it were a greater matter to Swear by one of them than by another, is to no purpoſe; I ſay unto you, in this kind, <hi>Swear not all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſentence of our Saviour's ſpeech is to forbid altogether ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed forms, and faſhions of Cuſtomary, and vain ſwearing as were then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63292:5"/>
in uſe among the Jews, and might be afterwards among Chriſtians, if he did not forbid them.</p>
            <p>If our Saviour's ſentence were full and whole in theſe words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> then wherefore doth he inſtance in ſuch things as men were wont to make vain Oaths by? If he meant that there ſhould be no Swearing at all, then wherefore ſerveth his inſtancing in particulars, as by Heaven, by the Earth? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not that to ſhew what manner of Oaths he would have to be forborn? where care is taken for the reforming of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it implieth that the thing it ſelf is left to ſtand.</p>
            <p>Certainly our Saviours ſentence muſt needs go along with the inſtance that he giveth, and what is't that he would have to be reform'd, but that and the like manner of Swearing that he doth inſtance in?</p>
            <p>A reformation is a taking away not of the ſubſtance of things, but of ſuch evil qualities and conditions of manners, as have been brought in upon them, our Saviour by the words above mentioned takes not away Swearing it ſelf, but only that which is faulty, and frivolous in it, he lets it be, (as he doth in the caſe of Matrimony) as it was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but not as mens devices made it to be in proceſs of time.</p>
            <p>If a Phyſician forbid his patient either to eat groſs Meat, or to drink Wine, ſaying, Neither eat groſs Meat, nor drink Wine at all, doth he therefore forbid him altogether either to eat, or to drink? doth not his inſtancing in <hi>groſs Meat, and Wine,</hi> imply that he leaveth him liberty to eat and drink otherwiſe? reſtraining him only in thoſe things that he doth inſtance in, namely, <hi>groſs Meat, and Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here, our Saviours inſtancing in what manner of Swearing is to be forborn, implieth, that Swearing it ſelf is left to remain, but of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral forms, or faſhions of Swearing deviſed by men, there is not one allowed more than other; to the utter undoing of all theſe our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, let me compare this inſtance concerning Swearing, with ſuch inſtances of other things as our Saviour giveth to the Jews, to ſhew how the Law of God was abus'd among them.</p>
            <p>The firſt is concerning murther, <hi>Ye have heard</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>how it hath been ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not kill, But I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall be angry with his Brother without a cauſe, &amp;c.</hi> if our Saviour had ſaid whoſoever ſhall be angry with his Brother (and no more) ſhall be in danger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we might think the very paſſion of anger to be forbidden quite; but in ſaying, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be angry with his Brother without a cauſe ſhall be in danger, &amp;c.</hi> We ſee that the prohibition lieth not againſt anger it ſelf, but againſt ſuch anger as is without a cauſe.</p>
            <p>The paſſion of anger is as human as any other paſſion may be. A man may be angry ſo as not to ſin in it, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Be angry and ſin not;</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63292:6"/>
my Argument here hence is, that as to be angry for juſt cauſe is no ſin, ſo neither is it to Swear upon juſt grounds, and in a due manner.</p>
            <p>The ſecond inſtance is in the caſe of Adultery, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Ye have heard by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her,</hi> &amp;c. To look on a woman ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, is no more harm than to look on ſome other thing; the harm is to look on her ſo as to luſt after her, and that adulterouſly too. Now who knoweth not that our Saviour's reſtraint lieth not againſt that which is innocent, but only againſt that which is harmful and evil?</p>
            <p>The third inſtance is in the caſe of Divorcement, wherein our Saviour ſaith, <hi>It hath been ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorcement; But I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall put away his wife, ſaving for the cauſe of fornication, cauſeth her to commit adultry, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here our Saviour doth not abſolutely forbid men to put away their wives but to put them away in ſuch manner as they were wont to do, <hi>viz.</hi> lightly either for no cauſe at all, or elſe for no ſuch cauſe as might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve unto their wives ſo great a diſcomfort, &amp; there being no ſuch cauſe, ſaving the cauſe of fornication, our Saviour reſtrains it onely unto that.</p>
            <p>So then when as in the three inſtances going before, our Saviour doth not aboliſh the things inſtanced in, but reſtrain them, forbidding them not abſolutely but conditionally, in divers reſpects binding and looſing the ſame thing, the forbidding of that which is abuſefull and evil, always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, the granting of that which is uſeful, and good.</p>
            <p>What reaſon have we to underſtand him otherwiſe in this inſtance concerning Swearing? he alloweth us to be angry, but not without a cauſe; to look on a woman, but not to luſt after her; to put away wives, but not except for the cauſe of fornication.</p>
            <p>So in this caſe of Swearing, to ſwear idly, vainly, prophanely, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly, raſhly, and inconſiderately, as it is ſinful and evil in it ſelf; So is it forbidden by our Saviour Chriſt: but to Swear by the name of God and in his fear, ſoberly, and judiciouſly, either in an aſſertory Oath for the vindication of a truth, and the deciſion of ſtrife, or in a promiſſory Oath for confirmation of faith giving, and promiſe making, this is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good, and therefore by our Saviour Chriſt it is left as ſuppoſed, granted, allow'd.</p>
            <p>That it is ſo, appears, in that our Saviour in this inſtance as in the reſt is pleaſed to explain himſelf ſo far as to expreſs what abuſe it is that he would have to be reform'd, namely to Swear by Heaven, by the Earth or any other ſuch Oath.</p>
            <p>Herewith doth altogether agree even <hi>in terminis</hi> that which St <hi>James</hi> writes, Chap. the 5. ver. 12. ſaying, <hi>Above all things my brethren, Swear not,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63292:6"/>
neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath,</hi> (i. e.) of that kind, form, or manner, <hi>But let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay,</hi> (i. e.) let your ſpeech be ſingle, without the addition of idle Oaths; leſt ye fall into Condemnation, (i. e.) leſt ye be found to ſin againſt God, and be convict thereof; for idle Swearing, ſuch as that by the Creatures is, is not a thing indifferent, or an offence not to be taken notice of, as ye may be apt to think it is.</p>
            <p>By St. <hi>James</hi> his delivering himſelf thus in the matter of Swearing, almoſt in the very words of Chriſt, and by our Saviours explaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he doth, I think that againſt mens partial application of the words, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> reading them ſo far, and no farther, my propoſition ſtands firm and ſound; <hi>viz.</hi> That the action of Swearing ſimply conſidered in it ſelf without any evil circumſtance to deprave it, is no more forbidden unto us under the new Teſtament than it was unto the people of God under the Old.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour by expounding the Law took not away Swearing it ſelf, but the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>Our Saviours ſentence endeth not at <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> to look to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſentence of our Saviours words without reading them along to <hi>by Heaven, by the Earth &amp;c,</hi> I take to be great partialitie: a Comma is the utmoſt point that can be between theſe words, and that not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than becauſe of the diſtinction following, <hi>viz. neither by Heaven, nor by the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To make a ſentence of the words <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> without reading far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a meer fallacy, <hi>viz.</hi> of dividing thoſe things that ought to be joyned together.</p>
            <p>Another argument yet I may draw from the Laws being altogether one and the ſame, both before, and after the coming of Chriſt: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf ſaith, <hi>He came not to deſtroy the Law,</hi> therefore it abides; The old Commandment of the Law, and the new Commandment of the Goſpel is but one and the ſame Commandment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 7. 8.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour came to fulfil the Law; Whereas it had been ſaid by them of old time, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. our Saviour ſaith not, But I ſay unto you, thou ſhalt forſwear thy ſelf, that had been to deſtroy the Law indeed; He leaveth that to ſtand, and addeth unto it that which ſhould have been alſo ſaid, namely, neither ſhalt thou Swear vainly at all, no though it were but indirectly (i. e.) not by God himſelf, but by Heaven, by the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this indirect kind of Swearing the Jews deviſed on purpoſe to favour their fond humour of Swearing, ſo as to make of it but a light thing</p>
            <p>Saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> the whole Law agreeth with the Goſpel both in condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame vices, and alſo in commanding the ſame vertues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63292:7"/>
It was the part of the Meſſias at his coming, to take away nothing of the Moral Law, but to explain, to reform, and to reſtore it in all things. Saith <hi>Ireneus,</hi> Chriſt fulfilled the Natural and Moral things of the Law, by ſetting them out more clearly and fully than they were before: and ſaith St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> even as a Painter in making a Picture, by making a ſecond draught doth not blot out the firſt, but illuſtrate and make it plain; no more doth our Saviour Chriſt in what he doth by the Law, it is ſtill the ſame Law for him, only it is more fully and amply ſet forth by him as in a ſecond Edition.</p>
            <p>I contract my Argument into an Enthymeme thus, <hi>viz.</hi> To Swear by the God of Heaven and Earth was allowed by the Law, unto the people of God of old time as a thing natural and moral, (they being duly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto it,) therefore it is allowed unto us in like manner.</p>
            <p>From whence had <hi>Abraham</hi> his warrant to Swear his Servant? was it not from Nature? (ſuch Swearing being a natural worſhipping of God) the like may be ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> Swearing to <hi>Abimelech:</hi> of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> alſo and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſwearing each to other, of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſwearing to <hi>Laban, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I preſume the Arguments I have uſed hitherto may paſs for demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative, what I ſhall add, ſhall be but illuſtrative, <hi>viz.</hi> Arguments ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from things ſo familiar, that the conſequence of them is eaſy, and the deduction manifeſt. As thus,</p>
            <p>If the action of Swearing were a thing that were ſimply evil, then ſhould not the Angels be made to do it, as is done <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 5, 6. much leſs would God himſelf do it, as is done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21. And what did our Saviour when the High Prieſt adjured him by the living God to tell whether he were the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſſed, yea or not? did he refuſe to ſubmit to this adjuration, or did he make direct and plain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what was thus rigorouſly demanded of him?</p>
            <p>Among the Jews, the perſon that was adjured thought himſelf as much concerned, as if he had taken an Oath, and indeed in effect what was or is it leſs? Our Saviour therefore having held his peace other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, (even unto <hi>Pilates</hi> wonder) yet when by the High-prieſt he was adjur'd by God, he made anſwer ſtraight, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 63, 64.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we think of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> to aſſure them that he did alwayes make mention of them in his prayers, takes God to witneſs, ſaying, <hi>For God is my Witneſs, Rom.</hi> 1. 9. and <hi>2Cor.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>I call God for a record upon my Soul:</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 20 he ſaith, <hi>Before God I lye not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas St <hi>Paul</hi> Swears not but in things of a Spiritual concern, there have been thoſe (and thoſe good men too) that would reſtrain the lawfulneſs of ſwearing only unto things of that nature, urging that things temporal and carnal, (the things wherein we are ſo fond of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63292:7"/>
having propriety, and about the which we are ſo apt to ſtrive) are not worth ſo great a confirmation as an Oath may be: In favour of this they quoted ſome words ſpoken by St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and they might the like ſpoken by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and many others; good men have been always very preciſe to forbid all lightneſs and eaſineſs of Swearing.</p>
            <p>Swearing by the Creatures they would have to be none at all, and for the Creatures <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for our Rights and intereſts in them, they would have Swearing to be as ſeldom, and as ſparing as may be, and in this we ſubſcribe unto them; yea, I hold that a Chriſtian ought to chuſe to ſuſtain ſome loſs and damage, rather than to ſave it by the taking of an Oath.</p>
            <p>What St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaith, concerning going to Law, the ſame may not unaptly be applyed alſo to this matter of ſwearing, (which is a thing that doth neceſſarily accompany the other) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing going to Law, he ſaith, <hi>why do ye not rather take wrong?</hi> &amp;c. It is <hi>rather,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, not <hi>altogether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ſecond Argument for illuſtration is, That by Swearing upon juſt grounds, and in due manner ſuch as is preſcribed, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Glory is given unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Glory is given unto God, when his properties of omniſcience, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence, omnipotence, a perfect love of truth, and hatred of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are aſcribed unto him, and declared of him, all which is done when we ſolemnly call upon him to be witneſs unto that which we have occaſion to ſay, in ſomething that is either ſecret or doubtful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and therefore queſtionable ſo far, that the debate ceaſeth not until his holy and bleſſed name be interpoſed, the which thing doing, muſt neceſſarily put an end to that ſtrife, <hi>Exod</hi> 20. 11. This Text is quoted <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. like as alſo that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Phil.</hi> 2. viz. <hi>That every Tongue ſhall confeſs,</hi> or Swear <hi>unto God;</hi> every Tongue, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of every Nation, and of every Generation.</p>
            <p>That to ſwear by God was not peculiar to the Jews, ſo as to end with their Policy or Commonweal, but to laſt and be among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when they ſhould convert and turn to the true God, appears, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 2. in the latter part of the Verſe.</p>
            <p>There is nothing of the ceremonial Law in this matter of Swearing, no nor yet of the judicial Law, in any thing that was proper unto the Jews, for what either cauſe or need had they to make uſe of it then, more than we have now? To them it was a ſpecial method of giving glory to God, and ſo it is to us; to them it was an end of ſtrife, and ſo it is unto us.</p>
            <p>There is nothing among men more ſacred, reverend and holy than an Oath duely taken and kept: The Religion and Conſcience of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63292:8"/>
is many times in the Holy Scripture ſynechdochically taken for the whole ſumm of Gods Worſhip and Service. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45. 23.</p>
            <p>Here it may be objected, That if that which we call juſt and lawful Swearing be a worſhipping, or a ſervice doing to God, then the oftner it is done the better, we cannot call upon God in prayer, praiſe and thankſgiving too often, therefore neither can we Swear too oft, for that alſo is a calling upon God, and that ſo as to give Glory unto him.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, By denying the Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> that though Swearing after a due manner be a worſhipping of God, yet doth it not follow that therefore the oftner Swearing is uſed, the better: My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this is, That as things are not to be done, but according as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are given for them, and there being not like occaſions for Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as are for Praying and Praiſing, it cannot be inferred of the one, as of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> That the oftner it is done, the better.</p>
            <p>The occaſions for prayer and praiſe are continual, and they meet to be done upon every occaſion; but with ſwearing it is not ſo, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for it are but rare and ſeldom, nor yet is it meet to be done upon every occaſion.</p>
            <p>In every need a man may pray, and for every benefit he ought to praiſe and give thanks, <hi>Pray alwayes, and in all things give thanks,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 17, 18. But as for ſwearing, it is poſſible a man may lead ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and quiet an eſtate of life, as not to have ſuch an occaſion for Swearing, as may make it lawful, in all his days.</p>
            <p>God is not honoured by our ſwearing, but when it is done in ſuch a matter, and in ſuch a caſe, as may both deſerve, and have need of ſo great a Teſt as an appeal to be made unto him, who is over all from the beginning, and before whom are all the wayes of men open and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; an approver of the truth, and a revenger of falſhood and wrong.</p>
            <p>I would ask thoſe that are againſt all manner of Swearing, that whereas our Saviour in the cloſe of his ſpeech concerning Swearing ſaith, <hi>But let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay, for whatſoever is more than theſe cometh of evil;</hi> doth he ſay this in oppoſition to ſwear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing by the Heaven, by the Earth, and other ſuch indirect Oaths? or doth he ſay it againſt all manner of Swearing whatſoever? if they ſay the former, then the difference b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tween us and them is at an end, for we ſay ſo too. But if they ſay the latter, then how cometh it to paſs, that our Saviours own communication was more than that, <hi>viz.</hi> more than yea and nay, for ſometimes he uſed aſſeverations, and thoſe not ſingle, but double, ſaying, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you: viz.</hi> when the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63292:8"/>
matter propounded by him did require more than ordinary heed to be given unto it.</p>
            <p>I demand, were our Saviours aſſeverations of <hi>verily, verily,</hi> needful in ſuch a caſe, or were they not? If the opponents ſay they were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then will I infer that bare yea and nay, being not ſufficient upon ſome occaſions, for our Saviours own communication, how much leſs may they be for ours? If they ſay they were not needful, then how will they ſave themſelves from charging our Saviours communication with having more in it than it ought to have?</p>
            <p>My third Argument for illuſtration I take from a known Maxim of the Decalogue, <hi>viz.</hi> That every ſuch precept as is expreſly affirmative, doth implicitely contain in it the negative of that which it doth affirm, and ſo on the contrary. My Argument here-hence is, that as the third Commandment being a negative Precept, doth expreſly forbid the taking of Gods name in vain, ſo doth it implicitly command the taking of it ſo, as that God may be magnified and honoured thereby. Parallel to this is the ninth Commandment, which alſo being expreſly negative, as it forbids to bear falſe witneſs againſt our Neighbour; ſo doth it implicitly command us to bear true witneſs, either for him or againſt him according as he giveth occaſion.</p>
            <p>This alſo ſeems to include in it ſomewhat of an Argument to prove not only the lawfulneſs, but alſo an expediency in ſome caſes of making Oaths. To bear witneſs to the truth is a thing that is expedient, yea, neceſſary to be done. <hi>A true Witneſs delivereth Souls,</hi> Prov. 14. 25. <hi>Shall I forbear to deliver Souls, (i. e.)</hi> To ſave mens lives for want of taking an Oath, without the which my teſtimony may not be received in Law, ſo as to put an end to ſtrife? And yet notwithſtanding my aſſerting the lawfulneſs of making Oath, yea, and of waging Law too, upon juſt and neceſſary occaſions. I will confeſs again and again, that it behoveth Chriſtians to be meek Spirited, quietly diſpoſed, yea to ſtudy to be quiet: Saith St. <hi>Paul, If it be poſſible, and as much as lyeth in you, live peaceably with all men;</hi> he doth not ſimply and abſolutely ſay, <hi>live peaceably,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if it be poſſible, and as much as lyeth in you, Rom.</hi> 12. 18.</p>
            <p>It behoveth a Chriſtian to take ſome wrong, rather than either go to Law, or make Oath upon every light occaſion; yea, in matters of weight, let him not vindicate himſelf by theſe means (as juſt and as lawful as they be) until he hath uſed all the means of patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance that may be.</p>
            <p>If in this caſe I ſhould recommend to the practice of the men of this Generation, our Saviours Method preſcribed <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. I ſhould not be heard at all, nevertheleſs I will mention it; as thus, namely, That the injured perſon do tell his offending brother his fault in private, if that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63292:9"/>
avail not, then that he take unto him one or two more; and if that will not do, then that he tell the Church; and if after all this the offender ſtill remain refractory, our Saviours Sentence is, That he be no more regarded than a Heathen man, or a Publican, and why ſhould not a man go to Law with ſuch a one, there being no expectation left him of coming by his right by any other means? nay, what ſhall a man do in ſuch a caſe but ſeek his remedy where God hath ordained it for him, namely from the Magiſtrate? <hi>The powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> Rom. 13. 1.</p>
            <p>Is the Magiſtrate Gods Miniſter ordained unto him for good, and ſhall not he make uſe of him for his protection?</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity is not a deſtruction to Magiſtracy and civil policy, but rather a help and an eaſe unto them, Chriſtians being ſo moderate about their concerns, and walking by ſuch rules of forbearance that they moleſt them not with Complaints and Suits, either cauſleſs, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Chriſtianity doth not forbid men to have any thing of their own, but only requires them to be moderate about what they have; though St. <hi>Paul</hi> made no more reckoning of carnal and earthly things than of dung, in compariſon of his having Chriſt, yet did he not renounce all manner of propriety in them to himſelf, much leſs did he enjoin it unto others, but upon occaſion, he ſaith, that he did labour with his hands thereby to get his living; which implyeth that he held a propriety in what he did earn and get; and for matter of Right, he ſaith, that he had power to forbear working, and yet to eat and drink nevertheleſs, which implyeth that he held a Right for him to live by his Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>And for ſuffering, as conſtant as he was to endure, he neither neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected nor diſdained to ſave himſelf by ſuch means as he might uſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offending God: To avoid going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there to be judged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Feſtus,</hi> by whom and in which place he was ſure to periſh, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed unto <hi>Caſar,</hi> and that very reſolutely, ſaying, <hi>No man may deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me unto them, viz.</hi> unto the Jews, <hi>I appeal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 11.</p>
