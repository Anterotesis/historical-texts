            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To the Female Sex.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Ladies;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF you inquire who I am, I ſhall only tell
you in general, that I am one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet came within the Clutches of a
<hi>Husband;</hi> and therefore what I write
may be the more favourably interpreted as
not coming from a Party concern'd. Nor
really do I hope to make my Condition the
eaſier if ever I reſign my ſelf into the Arms
of one of the other Sex. No, I am very
well ſatisfy'd that there are a great many
<hi>Brave Men,</hi> whoſe Generous Principles
make 'em ſcorn the Methods that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
condemns. Not that I can boaſt of any
great Beauty, or a vaſt Fortune, two things
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:38614:4"/>
(eſpecially the latter) which are able to make
us Conquerors thro the World. But I have
endeavour'd to furniſh my ſelf with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more valuable: I ſhall not brag that
I underſtand a little <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>
(Languages being only the effects of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
having made ſome attempt to look
into the more ſolid parts of Learning, and
having adventur'd a little abroad into the
World, and endeavour'd to underſtand Men
and Manners. And having ſeen ſomething
of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Humors, I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
profeſs I never obſerv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor
<hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, a Slavery ſo abject as this
Author would fain perſuade us to.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe of you that are already in
the Houſe of Bondage, and have found all
the Charms of Innocence and good Humour,
and the moſt exact Prudence ineffectual long
to recommend you to the Smiles of your
new Lords and Maſters; I think indeed
'twill be very well if you can, as he adviſes
you, bring down the very <hi>Deſires</hi> of your
Hearts to their Will and Pleaſure, and fancy
your ſelves happy in the midſt of all.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe of you that are happily
married, your Life and Actions are a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:38614:4"/>
Contradiction to this Gentleman; while
you let the World ſee that you can pleaſe your
Husbands without that <hi>extraordinaay</hi> way
which he recommends in his Sermon, that was
thought ſo unmanly and ſcandalous, that (as
I am inform'd) Mr. <hi>L</hi>—the Miniſter who
is reſident at <hi>Sherborn,</hi> look'd on himſelf as
oblig'd to tell the World in the public News,
that he was not the Author of that Diſcourſe,
leſt, it being preach'd where he lives, they
who knew not his Name might impute it to
him.</p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>Ladies,</hi> I would recommend
to your Thoughts ſomething that is great
and noble, <hi>viz.</hi> to furniſh your Minds with
true Knowledg, that (as an Ingenious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
tells us) you may know ſomething more
than a well-choſen Petticoat, or a faſhionable
Commode. Learning becomes us as well as
the Men. Several of the <hi>French</hi> Ladies,
and with us the late incomparable Mrs. <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
and the Lady that is Mr. <hi>Norris</hi>'s
Correſpondent, and many more, are Witneſſes
of this. Hereby we ſhall be far enough from
being charm'd with a great Eſtate, or mov'd
with the flowing Nonſenſe and Romantic
Bombaſt of every Foppiſh Beau; and ſhall
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:38614:5"/>
learn (if we chooſe Companions for our
Lives) to ſelect the Great, the Generous,
the Brave and Deſerving Souls, Men who
will as much hate to ſee us uneaſy, as this
Gentleman is afraid of coming under the
Diſcipline of the Apron.</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
ON
A late Rude and Diſingenuous
DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEing preſented with the Book I am
now going to conſider, by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
who I am ſure was very far
in it from the deſign of the Author,
I took the liberty to paſs a few Remarks on
ſo ſingular and extraordinary a Piece; tho
ſome think it beyond the bounds of <hi>Female</hi>
Patience to peruſe it. But (like a jealous
Husband) I was willing to know all againſt
our ſelves, eſpecially that ſo celebrated an
Author can produce. And indeed, when
I had follow'd him to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I could not but wonder to find a Sex
attack'd from the Pulpit with more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Impudence than ever they were on the
Stage, tho with far leſs Wit and Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:38614:6"/>
When I had in as little Time as Patience
turn'd over all thoſe bitter Leaves, tho I
eaſily found his Deſign, yet for my heart I
could never once find the ſtrength of the
Arguments by which he endeavours to drive
it; ſo that after all I think a reſolute and
headſtrong <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi> would have done as
well altogether. Hereupon I laid aſide the
Book as a moſt ſelf-confuting Piece, till I
found that Miracles were not ceas'd, and
that ſome People were ſo charm'd with it,
that they thought it worth their while to
teeze every poor Woman they met with it.
Upon this I began to have ſome deſign of
taking Arms, and alarming the whole <hi>Power</hi>
of Females againſt him. But upon ſecond
thoughts I reſolv'd to ſave 'em the trouble,
and enter into a ſingle Combat with this
great <hi>Goliah,</hi> this man of mighty Fame.</p>
            <p>As humble thoughts as I have of my ſelf,
I began to be afraid that he would think
himſelf honour'd by an Antagoniſt, and
conclude for certain that there muſt needs
be ſome mighty Force in his Arguments if
any Reſiſtance was made. But at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
his haughty Temper, and knowing
'twas impoſſible he ſhould have greater
thoughts of his laſt Piece than he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
I began to lay aſide that fear, and
only expected that he would fancy himſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38614:6"/>
the Emperor of the Moon, and whoever
writes againſt him to be one of the little
ſnarling Animals that are angry at its Light
and Glory. 'Tis not the firſt time a Woman
has appear'd in Public, and 'twill be hard
for any to accuſe us for taking up Weapons
ſince they are only defenſive, and we are
provok'd into the Field by ſo great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
a Champion. Beſides, the itch of
being in Print which the Men have infected
us with, and the Glory of having but lifted
up a Pen againſt ſo great a Man, muſt needs
be a ſufficient Excuſe beyond all Reply.</p>
            <p>But you may eaſily imagin, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all theſe Thoughts and ſtrong Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how I began to tremble when I came
within ſight of the Enemy, and perceiv'd
with what a Front he appear'd. Not <hi>Don
Quixot</hi> was more ſcar'd at the firſt ſight of
the Giant <hi>Caraculiambro.</hi> However the
greater Danger, the greater Honour: So
on I went with a mighty Courage till I
came within reach of him, and began the
Battel, which if it be not orderly and well
pitch'd, 'tis owing to the motions of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whom I muſt follow up hill and down
hill till he comes to the ſame place again.</p>
            <p>To begin therfore with his <hi>forlorn Hope;</hi>
he tells the World in his Preface that we
may eaſily ſee cauſe enough to believe 'twas
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38614:7"/>
deſign'd for the Pulpit, not for the Preſs.
No, certainly, he meant no ſuch thing at
all as to affront the Ladies in public: and
indeed he muſt be poſſeſt of very ſtrange
Thoughts, and exceding vain in his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that could hope to do the leaſt good
by ſuch a Diſcourſe from the Pulpit, and
yet much <hi>vainer</hi> to hope it from the Preſs.
And yet that very Reaſon which ſhould have
deter'd him for ever from the leaſt thought
of preaching, at this rate is made an excuſe
why he ſhould print it. It hath, he ſays,
<hi>ſo fallen out</hi> (and that one half blind might
have ſeen before-hand) <hi>that the Doctrine
therein contain'd is unhappily repreſented to the
World by ſome ill-natur'd Females.</hi> Now, by
the way, this is a very pleaſant Invention
for any well-diſpos'd Perſon to get into the
World by: 'Tis but to utter ſome Doctrine
or other that a Man may be ſure before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
will be juſtly ſpoken againſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis unhappily repreſented by ſome ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd
People, away to <hi>W. B—y</hi>'s of
<hi>Briſtol</hi> with it, or any other Printer that
has no other Buſineſs but Mountebanks Bills,
Wedding-Sermons, and Ballads, with ſuch
other honourable things; and ſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet up for an Author, and expect that
every one ſhould complement him on the
occaſion. Ay, and this is a moſt clever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38614:7"/>
excuſe too for a ſecond and third Edition
with Additions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Gentleman ſhould have the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to find at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> that ſome <hi>ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
Females</hi> had been ſo ſpiteful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
as to have put his excellent Diſcourſe
at the bottom of minc'd Pies; he may
hereupon tell the World, that they have
found out a wicked way to obſcure the
Glory of ſo dread an Author; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for this and many other reaſons him
thereunto moving, he reſolves to reprint
it, and 'tis no hard matter to propheſy
with what Succeſs. But that it may not be
thought that I ſuppoſe the Author has not
purchas'd that Reputation which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
and which he ſeems to be ſo very
apprehenſive of, when he talks ſo prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
of purchaſing the <hi>Character of a dull
Blockhead,</hi> I think it will without much
diſpute be granted that his words were omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;
only this I muſt add, that Dulneſs
and Malice are commonly very near Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and help out one another at a
dead lift: And yet he hopes he ſays (good
Gentleman!) that he ſhall avoid the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Impudence, yes, tho it be by one
of the groſſeſt Inſtances of it that a Perſon
of his Character is capable of. As a proof
of which in the next words, he makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38614:8"/>
               <hi>Be it known unto all Men that I
have not met with one Woman among all my
Accuſers, whoſe Husband is able to give her
the Character of a dutiful and obedient Wife.</hi>
And this alſo is a moſt infallible way
of defending any thing in the World.
Juſt ſo, when the Doctrine of Paſſive
Obedience and Non-reſiſtance was cry'd
up and down with a mighty Confidence,
'twas but to ſay that all that ſpoke againſt
this Doctrine were diſloyal and rebellious,
and the buſineſs was compleatly done and
ended, and needed no further Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So, becauſe the Ladies can't bear ſo
harſh and imperious a Doctrine as his is,
therfore it ſhall be a Juſtification of his
Doctrine that they cannot, and prov'd to
be reaſonable becauſe 'tis intolerable.
Strong Thoughts! a mighty Argument!
eſpecially if we conſider that the Husbands
he ſpeaks of, 'tis likely, meaſure the Duties
of their Wives by the boundleſs Limits
which this Gentleman has laid out for them;
and if ſo, no wonder if they are not able
to give them the Character of dutiful and
obedient Wives. Then he tells us that
<hi>good Wives are not offended with his Diſcourſe;</hi>
now by <hi>good Wives</hi> he certainly means ſuch
as he deſcribes, and then no wonder they
ſay not much againſt him, ſince a word
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38614:8"/>
againſt his Doctrine is enough to purchaſe
them a very rough and unwelcome Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from their <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Maſters.</hi> But I
believe it would be no hard task to make a
Catalogue of very good Wives who have
cenſur'd him as an Inſtrument of Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Tyranny to others, tho they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are not under it. However he is in
a good humour for once, and tells us he'll
promiſe to ſay as much to the Men (I'll
forgive him if he does) <hi>when this Diſcourſe</hi>
of his has <hi>reform'd imperious Wives.</hi> Now
this is a moſt dexterous turn, and has very
much in it; and ſuppoſing his Notions to
be ever ſo juſt and reaſonable, yet hereby
he'll excuſe himſelf from ever publiſhing
any thing for the inſtruction of <hi>Mankind</hi>
how to behave themſelves towards us, for
doubtleſs there are and will be ſtill ſome
imprudent and unreaſonable Creatures on
both ſides. Now as he makes this a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why he will not ſpeak to the Men, ſo if
he had begun with them, he might have
made it a Reaſon why he would never have
vouchſafed to dictate to the Women. In
the Concluſion of his Preface he begins a
Triumph, tho it may not ſeem a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place for it, eſpecially conſidering the
Foundation on which he grounds it. He
finds, he ſays, <hi>upon the whole that 'tis Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38614:9"/>
Guilt that puts 'em to ſo much Pain
which they feel in their Conſciences, for which
he knows no better an Antidote</hi> (you muſt
know he has an inſight into Phyſic) <hi>than a
ſpeedy Repentance and Reformation:</hi> very
well, but I wonder how he came to know
that the Women feel ſuch Pain in their
Conſciences, for I ſuppoſe very few will
make him their Father-Confeſſor. This
Gentleman has a moſt abſolute way to
diſcipline his Conſort; if ſhe ever is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy
at any of his Impoſitions, 'tis but for
him to tell her, this is a Pain in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and then the ſpiritual <hi>Antidote</hi> is
whatever he ſhall command her to repent
of or reform. But the Concluſion is bolder
than all; he is not contented to make
them bear the Croſs, and ſuffer Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this Life, but he tells them, theſe
things ſhall <hi>purſue them to Judgement.</hi> But
under favour, he muſt firſt of all perſwade
us that what he ſays is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> before
he can fright any of us with a Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hereafter, for not being willing to endure
a Hell upon Earth while we are here.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make but one Remark more on his
Preface, and the ſtrength of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he makes uſe of. As to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
he has this to ſay for it, that 'twas
not deſign'd for the Preſs; ſo that 'tis to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38614:9"/>
be expected that the Preface, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
was deſign'd for it, ſhould be much
more ſtrong and labour'd than his careleſs
Diſcourſe, which he deliver'd from the
Pulpit. I have conſider'd it, I think, with
abundance of Patience and Fairneſs; ſo that
we may judg by the ſtrength of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the one what we are to expect in
the other, which he has attempted to force
from theſe words,</p>
            <bibl>1 Cor. vii. 34.</bibl>
            <q>But ſhe that is married, careth for the
things of the World, how ſhe may pleaſe
her Husband.</q>
            <p>This the Author makes the bottom of
his Harangue; and to give us a taſte of his
Learning, he tells us <hi>(p. 1.)</hi> the original
meaning of the hard and obſcure word
<hi>[careth]</hi> and by a moſt deep and doughty
Criticiſm neatly contrives his Doctrine,
which he makes ſo very much haſte to be
at, that he ſeems to leap quite over the
Connexion between the Text and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
The Criticiſm is this, that the
word <hi>[careth]</hi> (take notice Ladies) <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
more than ordinary Care, and implies a
dividing of the Mind into divers thoughts,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38614:10"/>
caſting this way, and that way, and every way,
how to give beſt Content:</hi> that is to ſay,
Fetch and bring, Go, and ſhe goeth, Come,
and ſhe cometh; To the Right, to the
Left, as you were, and ſo on. Now to
uſe a hard word, this is a moſt <hi>Etymologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Argument, and worthy of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus ſome Divines tell us the word
ſignifies a dividing, diſtracting Care; whence
at this way of arguing, we might be told
that Marriage was a divided diſtracted
Condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would not be a
Doctrine calculated to increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of this Gentleman's Female Proſelytes.
I could by the ſame method prove a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
not very pleaſing to him: for in the
words before,<hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>He that is married
careth for the things of the World, how he may
pleaſe his Wife;</hi> the original
word is the very<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> ſame:
therefore I ſay that a Man
ought to <hi>divide his Mind, to caſt this way, and
that way, and every way,</hi> how to pleaſe and
content his Wife, ſince he tells us this is
the true and proper ſignification of the
word, and if it be not, 'tis his own fault.
But however, he thinks this one Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm
ſo great a thing, and has ſo much in't,
that he tells us he can meet with no other
verbal Difficulties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:38614:10"/>
               <hi>[Careth for the things of the World, how
ſhe may pleaſe her Husband]</hi> intimating, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Reverend Author's way of
arguing, that without the things of the
World, a Husband will not be pleas'd.
But it ſeems he was reſolv'd that this Point
ſhould moſt clearly ſpring from his Text,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is d Duty ineumbent on all married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to be extraordinary careful to content
and pleaſe their Husbands.</hi> And if they are
all ſuch as this Gentleman, how can they
chooſe! From this Doctrine he ſays he'll
<hi>faithfully repreſent the Woman's Duty,</hi> and a
very faithful Repreſenter he is: and by
the way, may not this be the reaſon, why
the celebrated Author of the <hi>Iriſh Scuffle</hi>
gives him the renowned name of <hi>Fido</hi> in
that unparallel'd Book?</p>
            <p>Our Author finding that 'twould be
look'd upon as a very rude and barbarous
thing to treat the weak and defenceleſs
Sex with ſuch a Diſcourſe as he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for 'em, without ſaying any thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to the other ſide, and how little it
would become the Honour of a Gentleman,
the Gravity of a Miniſter, or the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Chriſtian to aggravate the Faults of
ſome and impute them to the Sex, and ſay
every thing imaginable to exaſperate the
<hi>Government</hi> (for ſo let the Husbands be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38614:11"/>
call'd) againſt them, and never once touch
the notorious and viſible Faults and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of a great many <hi>He-Brutes;</hi> he
doubtleſs foreſaw this, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he advanc'd his precious Matter, he
thought it neceſſary to anſwer an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he brings in the Women making,
and offers at ſome Reaſons why he thought
it not all convenient for his purpoſe (as
to be ſure it was not) to rip up his own
and other Mens Faults, and ſo condemn
himſelf out of his own mouth.</p>
            <p>The firſt Reaſon he gives for the leaving
out the Maſculine part of his Sermon, is
<hi>becauſe the Woman's Duty is harder and more
difficult than that of the Man.</hi> But I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought that it was ſometimes as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
for Governors to carry themſelves
well as for the Governed, and that in ſome
Tempers to avoid Tyranny and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Commands was as great a Virtue as a
vile Submiſſion in a Woman; and therefore
I think that Reaſon vaniſhes. However I
ſhall take notice by the way, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
which he thinks belongs to a Woman
is a <hi>very hard and difficult thing,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Women are the more excuſable if
they are not always ſo very much under
the Hatches, ſince he owns they are but of
very weak Abilities to learn. <hi>You Women,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:38614:11"/>
ſays he, <hi>will acknowledg that Men can learn
to command and rule faſt enough.</hi> Inſolent
Man! To preach us gravely into Slavery
and Chains, and then deride and banter
us, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> did the Captive <hi>Jews</hi>
when they had 'em faſt in their power.
And not contented with this, he makes the
Word of God come in for a ſhare, while
he is inſulting over us: <hi>Women,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>have need of Line upon Line, Precept upon
Precept, here a little and there a little, and
all little enough to make them perfect in
their Leſſon.</hi> Now here is for certain a
touch of Antiquity, and ſome of the true
<hi>Veteran Jingle</hi> in <hi>little</hi> and <hi>little</hi> and <hi>little
enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon he brings, is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Women are of weaker Capacities to learn
than Men.</hi> P. 5. This is exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
indeed; I ſuppoſe, if Men were to
learn the ſame Leſſon, their Capacities
would be as weak. This brings to my
mind the Story of the General, who when
he had condemn'd the Soldiers of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Gariſon to leap down from a vaſt
high Tower, one of them going to leap after
his dead Companions made three or four
Recoils; and being threaten'd with a more
cruel Death by the General, reply'd, I'll
give you twice as many times to do it.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38614:12"/>
The Application is eaſy. According to
this rule, what ſtrange Inferences do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
follow. Suppoſe a Maſter and his
Servants, a Lawyer and his Clients, a
Phyſician and his Patients; 'tis you'll ſay
the duty of theſe Servants, Clients, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
to be govern'd and ſubmit: But a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
may be abus'd by his Maſter, a Client
cheated and impoveriſh'd by his Lawyer,
and the Patient genteely diſpatch'd by his
Doctor. Now certainly any Man would
be of a <hi>weak Capacity</hi> to endure theſe things,
and therefore the Duties of Servants, Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and Patients muſt be always rung in
their Ears, and the Duties of Maſters,
Lawyers, and Phyſicians, never. Who ſees
not the mighty force, and feels not the
cloſe girds of ſo ſinewy an Argument?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His third Reaſon is,</hi> becauſe according to
the Obſervation that he has made, moſt of the
Diſtractions and Diſturbances of a married
Life are owing to the Indiſcretion and Folly of
diſobedient Wives.</p>
            <p>Now if this Gentleman has ſpent the time
paſt of his Life in making theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he may have made a great many in
his time, and deſerves the name of the
<hi>New Obſervator:</hi> and then no wonder,
having been otherwiſe employ'd, that his
Lucubrations produce ſuch Sermons as this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38614:12"/>
on ſo ſolemn an occaſion. I ſuppoſe in his
Obſervations he always happen'd to have
the Women on that ſide he could ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and either knew not or wink'd at the
Mens Miſmanagements. But ſuppoſe it
were true that his Obſervations had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
him with few or none of the Mens
Faults, it dos not follow that no ones Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
elſe has.</p>
            <p>However he has an unqueſtionable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in ſtore, which is this: <hi>I ſhall not ſcruple
to affirm</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that the number of bad Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
which their Wives have made ſo, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by far than the number of thoſe whom their
Wives have found ſo.</hi> Under which Head
he is to be plac'd I need not determine.
I had heard indeed before of a very ſhort
way of proving things, and that is by <hi>ſtrong
Affirmation:</hi> And this is an Argument ſo
ready at hand, that it has been his inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible
Refuge in ſeveral places through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Book. Yet I think here he has
paſs'd an <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> upon himſelf, and
has forgot that he uſes this very Argument
of <hi>ſtrong Affirmation</hi> in a thing quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this, when he ſays of <hi>Eve</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or Women in general, that <hi>if they will
have Husbands, and have them good, they muſt
take a great deal of Care and Pains to make
'em ſo.</hi> P. 18. Therfore certainly they find
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38614:13"/>
them very bad if they muſt take ſo much
pains to make them good: And yet here
he ſays, <hi>the number of bad Husbands whom
their Wives have found ſo is little or nothing
compar'd with thoſe they make ſo.</hi> But the
Pages lying at a convenient diſtance from
one another, and hoping it's like what ſort
of Readers he was like to have, he might
think no notice would be taken of it, or
that none would peruſe the Book but thoſe
that wanted ſenſe to diſcover the Miſtake.
But I am willing to be more merciful to him
than he is to us, and ſhall no further inſiſt
on his Failings than to manifeſt that they
are ſuch, and for our own Defence againſt
a Man whoſe Arguments are like a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edg'd
Sword, and cut at once two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ways.</p>
            <p>And therefore I paſs on to the fourth
Reaſon, which is, <hi>Becauſe the Love of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
does very much depend upon the Obedience
of a Wife.</hi> P. 6. If by Obedience he means
a ſervile Subjection, 'tis a very clear Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and will be very perſuaſive no doubt.
But if he means only reaſonable and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Compliance, ſuch as is produc'd by
the noble and reſiſtleſs Charms of mutual
Love, I grant him 'tis true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Love of a Husband very much depends on
the Love of a Wife. But my Underſtanding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38614:13"/>
is not ſo far enlightened, as to ſee any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in this why the Women ſhould be teez'd,
and the Men for ever eſcape. And here
agen he hath another Paradox, and tells
us that if the Wife becomes <hi>pliant and
yielding</hi> (that is, becomes a good eaſy
tractable Slave) <hi>to her Husbands Deſire, ſhe
then may do e'en what ſhe pleaſes with him:</hi>
Which is as much as to ſay, If ſhe be a
perfect Slave, ſhe may have her Liberty.
I ſhall never be perſuaded that ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who deſire the ſubjection of their
Wives, and are willing to confine them to
the treatment of Servants, have any great
opinion of their Perſons or their Liberty.
And yet after all, this well-bred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
this Learned Doctor tells us, we are
<hi>more afraid than hurt;</hi> and if we are, I am
ſure 'tis not owing to his Temper, his
Wiſhes, nor his Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The 5<hi>th</hi> and the laſt Reaſon he names is
this: <hi>Becauſe that all he pretends to is to lay
our Duty before us.</hi> Very well! But where
the conſequence is (ſuppoſing this be his
true and upright Intention) I can't tell.
It's true, I grant him, 'twould prove that
we ought to hearken to it; but however,
it does not offer any Reaſon why the other
part ſhould not be inſiſted on: for the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
Argument would bring the Men upon
the ſtage. If he had but ſaid, You Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38614:14"/>
Husbands, I deſign to ſay nothing but
<hi>what's your Duty;</hi> this would have been
thought a very ſtrange Argument why no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould be ſaid to us. But ſo it is,
and away he goes with it, and tells us, as
for good Wives, <hi>The knowledg and practice
of their Duty is ſo comfortable and pleaſant
to them, that they are not liſted in the number
of theſe Objectors.</hi> And hereby he affirms,
that 'tis impoſſible to be a good Wife, and
yet object againſt the omiſſion of the Mens
part; which is a Miſtake ſo groſs that it
may be felt. And in the midſt of all this
Goodneſs and Charity which this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
here profeſſes, he cannot forbear, but
breaks out, and ſays that he wiſhes <hi>where
there is one good Wife, there were a thouſand;</hi>
whereby he moſt uncharitably inſinuates,
that there is but one among a thouſand
good. So that if it be as he thinks and
ſays, he has a very ſtrong opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to imagine that one ſingle Sermon,
with its <hi>poor Endeavours</hi> (as he expreſſeth
it) can make ſo many bad Women good,
when the number of the Bad, according to
his Computation, is a thouſand to one.
Theſe five Reaſons he imagins to be ſo
groſs, ſolid, and thick, that he reſolves to
venture under their ſhelter in the face of
his Female Adverſaries: mighty Courage,
and an Heroic Attempt! But whether I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38614:14"/>
have not ſhot this maſſy fivefold Shield
through and through, let the World judg,
I mean the juſt and generous part of it,
who have at leaſt common ſenſe, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
portion of Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>Having thus, like a Man of Valour, and
one of the ſeven Champions, cleared his way
through all manner of Reaſons, Arguments,
Objections, Remonſtrances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he now
again ſets up his Standard with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>That 'tis a Duty incumbent on all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Women to be extraordinary careful to pleaſe
their Husbands.</hi> I ſuppoſe the Phraſe here
is ſomthing extraordinary and ſignificant;
that Expreſſion, <hi>incumbent on married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
hath ſomething in it, and he thought
it perhaps very ſuitable to a Nuptial Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and any one that conſiders with what
an Emphaſis he pronounc'd the word <hi>[In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent]</hi>
will eaſily judg what ſort of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
he intended, and to what he made
the Alluſion. But however, for once, I
ſhall think it a Duty <hi>incumbent</hi> on me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what he ſays to us, and follow him
thro the whole ſet of Arguments that he
has rang'd in order; and I promiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the force and ſtrength of them, and
not to conceal any part of it that I can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.
And here in the firſt place he ſays
he ſhall <hi>prove it by Reaſon and Argument,</hi>
which really are two excellent things when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38614:15"/>
they are well managed. 2<hi>dly.</hi> He promiſes
<hi>to ſhow how and which way</hi> married Women
muſt endeavour to pleaſe their Husbands
(<hi>how and which way,</hi> two excellent Heads
well explained.) 3<hi>dly,</hi> To make ſome <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi>
of the whole, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make the
beſt of a bad matter.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place he comes to his <hi>Reaſon
and Argument,</hi> the firſt of which is, <hi>That
Woman was made for the Comfort and Benefit
of Man.</hi> And if ſo, then 'tis to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Woman anſwers the end of her
Creation when ſhe does bring Comfort and
Benefit to Man; and a very noble requital
does Man make to her when he follows this
Gentleman's Inſtructions. Now I own 'tis
true that Woman was made for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and Benefit of Man: but I think it a
much nobler Comfort to have a Companion,
a Perſon in whom a Man can confide, to
whom he can communicate his very Soul,
and open his Breaſt and moſt inward
Thoughts, than to have a Slave ſitting at
his Footſtool, and trembling at every word
that comes like Thunder and Lightning
from the mouth of the domeſtic <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
An honourable and noble Companion was
doubtleſs intended by the wiſe Creator. <hi>It
is not good that Man ſhould be alone, I will
make him an help meet for him:</hi> Certainly
this is meant of a Creature that ſhould be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38614:15"/>
a ſocial help, not a ſervile one. And the
argument he takes from the Woman's being
made for the profit of Man, is not ſo very
ſtrong, if we conſider the ground upon
which it depends, which is, that Man was
created firſt. Now if it had ſo pleaſed the
Eternal Father to have made the Woman
firſt, then becauſe Man was made laſt, tho
he be, as he thinks, the nobler Creature,
yet by this Argument he had been to have
taken <hi>extraordinary</hi> Care to pleaſe his Wife.
Now there are ſome Divines that tell us,
that in the frame of this lower World God
proceeded from the leſs to the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and therefore, according to them,
the Woman's being created laſt will not be
a very great argument to debaſe the dignity
of the Female Sex. If ſome of the Men
do own this, 'tis the more likely to be true:
The Great <hi>Milton,</hi> a very grave Author,
brings in <hi>Adam</hi> thus ſpeaking to <hi>Eve,</hi> in
his <hi>Paradiſe Loft,</hi> lib. 9.</p>
            <q>
               <l>O faireſt of Creation! laſt and beſt</l>
               <l>Of all God's Works—</l>
            </q>
            <p>'Tis granted the Woman was created for
the Man, but we deny that this is any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to uſe the limited Power which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
has given him to the Unhappineſs and
Ruin of a Creature that was made for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:38614:16"/>
If the Scripture tells us, that tho the Beaſts
are made for Man, yet a good Man is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to his Beaſt; much more regard is
there to be had of a nobler Creature, which
tho inferior in Brutal Strength of Body,
yet in Strength and Beauty of Reaſon (when
cultivated) equals the ſuperior Sex. It's
true, a Woman that abridges her Husband
of his reaſonable Authority, and has Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough to put on the Breeches, does
certainly pervert the end of her Creation;
and ſuch, without any Defence, I leave to
the Mercy of this Gentleman, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
their Husbands think fit to exerciſe
upon them.</p>
            <p>Tho Women are for the Comfort and
Benefit of Men, yet that's no reaſon why
they ſhould be their moſt obedient Slaves
and Vaſſals. I ſuppoſe the Author will
grant that Men are to be for the <hi>Comfort
and Benefit</hi> of Women; and yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
will not be allow'd, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Man is to <hi>caſt this way, and that way,
and every way, how to pleaſe his Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2<hi>d</hi> Argument he brings is, P. 12.
<hi>Becauſe by the Woman's occaſion the Man was
ruined and undone.</hi> 'Tis true both Sexes
have reaſon to remember the firſt Apoſtacy
from God with all imaginable regret; but
I never heard or read that there was a
particular Original Sin imputed to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38614:16"/>
and another to the Man. I thought
learned Men had held that Original Guilt
was convey'd alike to both Sexes, however
it be explain'd, which I pretend not to do,
only following his Argument, which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Imputation of original Sin. And
certainly it muſt be granted that <hi>Adam</hi> was
guilty of a very great Crime, to hearken
to a Woman more than his God, and let go
his Innocence upon the word of a guilty
Creature. And if it be true, as ſome of
the <hi>Divines</hi> tell us, that the Woman was
created with leſs noble Faculties of Mind,
weaker Judgment, and duller Thoughts,
no wonder that ſhe was more obnoxious to
the Tempter, and that ſhe fell firſt of all:
He that, according to them, had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Strength, muſt of conſequence ſtand
longer. But, according to this Argument
driven home, all the barbarous Actions,
Wickedneſs and Rebellion committed in
former Ages, muſt be imputed to this Age;
and they muſt ſuffer for it. So that I don't
argue for our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> to defend her
Tranſgreſſion, but to ſhow the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
of the Inference from it. All the
other Sex ſprang from her as well as we,
and are therefore, I think, equally guilty
of her Tranſgreſſion; and I would be
glad to ſee any one ſtrongly prove, that
becauſe we are of the ſame Sex, therefore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38614:17"/>
that Sin in imputed to us more than the
Men. Beſides this, I think 'tis beyond
doubt, that tho the Woman had retained
her Innocence, yet it had not been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for the Man to have tranſgreſſed: for
tho he was a happy Creature; yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immutable, but left to himſelf and the
Power he had given him from Heaven, he
might have fallen ſingly, and by himſelf.
All this, I think, ſomething leſſens the
force of the Argument; and it has not ſo
ſharp an edg as our Adverſary would threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
us with.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 14.</note> And as to that
place he quotes out of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
I think there the Apoſtle
ſpeaks of Womens learning in ſilence and
ſubjection, and not uſurping Authority over
the Man. This they'l own to be their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for they are not ambitious of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Church, nor envy any Man
the Glory, eſpecially of ſuch Sermons as
this I am now conſidering. However,
ſince it hath pleaſed God ſo far to repair the
honour of our Sex, as to ſend a Saviour
into the World by the means of a Woman,
methinks that ſhould more than recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
for the conſequences of the other,
ſince we are told that the Happineſs we are
advanced to by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is much
more great and certain than that which
the firſt poſſeſſed. If God hath ſo far par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38614:17"/>
the fatal Tranſgreſſion of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
it looks a little too bold and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for Man to pretend not to do it, but to
exact ſo many unreaſonable things on this
pretence. Nay a late learned Man, whom
I ſuppoſe the Author honours, has on the
Verſe following in <hi>Timothy,</hi> theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
That by a Woman a Saviour came into the
World, which is ſome <hi>reparation of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Sex.</hi> Now this coming from a
Man, and one that was known not to be
blaſs'd by any Paſſion for Women, it is the
more noted and ſingular a Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>Then he tells us that God impos'd this
Task upon her as a Puniſhment for ſeducing
her Husband. (Very true!) <hi>And thy Deſire
ſhall be to thy Husband, and he ſhall rule over
thee:</hi> Gen. 3. 16. And the Comment on this
is very admirable indeed: Wherein is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
ſays he, <hi>not only Subjection to him in
obeying his Commands, but it reacheth farther to
the bringing under unto him the very Deſires of
her Heart to be regulated by him ſo far, that it
ſhould not be lawful for her to will or deſire what
ſhe her ſelf liked, but only what her Husband
ſhould approve and allow.</hi> P. 13. I ſuppoſe this
good Gentleman believes that theſe words
contain part of the Curſe for the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Treſpaſs; and by conſequence he
thinks it the Duty of a Man to execute the
Curſe of God upon his Wife. But let us
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38614:18"/>
try the Conſequence which he makes, and
ſee if the Thred of the Argument is not
ſtretch'd very far. Suppoſe that be the
meaning of the words, that our Sex ſhall
have an univerſal deſire to theirs (tho I
believe if they were all ſuch obliging
Sparks as the Author, 'twould cure them
of their Paſſion quickly) yet it no way fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
(with ſubmiſſion to the ruling Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Men) that therefore it ſhall
not be lawful for her to will or deſire any
thing but what her Husband approves of;
I think in ſome caſes 'tis an Impoſſibility.
Let it be granted that 'tis the part of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
being the weaker Veſſel, to ſubmit
and learn as well as ſhe can the hard Leſſon
of <hi>Paſſive Obedience;</hi> yet I defy the meekeſt
Woman in the World, if ſhe meets with
an unreaſonable, imperious, domineering,
inſolent Creature, I defy ſuch a Lady with
all her Virtue and Patience to forbear <hi>wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
at leaſt it were otherwiſe: No, ſhe muſt
not, our Author tells us, never groan, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſigh for a happy deliverance from her
hated Chains. To uſe the ſame Phraſe,
ſuppoſe, I ſay, my Deſire is towards my
Friend, does it therefore follow that I muſt
neceſſarily wiſh nothing whatever till I
know 'tis agreeable to her Humors? But
by virtue of his Office, this Gentleman I
ſee can interpret <hi>this way, and that way, and
every way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38614:18"/>
'Tis to be conſider'd upon this Head, that
whatever was pronounc'd in general then,
can't be applied to every individual now.
For inſtance (with modeſty be it ſpoken)
the Curſe of Child-birth, which God may
be thought to have denounc'd on the whole
Sex, we are told ſome entire Nations have
eſcap'd, as the Great <hi>Montaign</hi> tells us in
his Eſſays (I think) <hi>Liv.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. And
with like force of Reaſon might it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that becauſe God hath curſed the
Ground, and ſaid it ſhall bring forth <hi>Briars
and Thorns,</hi> therefore it is utterly unlawful
to root them out, and ſinful to poſſeſs any
Ground but what is overgrown with them.
The Country People would quickly diſcern
the force of ſuch Reaſoning in ſpite of all
their Duties. So that tho we grant this to
be the true ſenſe of the place, yet it does
not follow that the very Deſires, and every
Deſire of the Heart of a Woman, muſt be
according to the will and pleaſure of the
Man <hi>this way, and that way, and every way.</hi>
But if I ſhould meet this Gentleman out of
the Pulpit, with his Hands tied behind him,
and his Cane ſecur'd (that he might not
uſe that method of Conviction which he
thinks proper for a Woman) I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
preſume to tell him there is a far other
meaning of the place, and that not a late
Fancy, but a very antient Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:38614:19"/>
The LXX (and they were all of his own
Sex) take it thus, and thy <hi>Refuge or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
[<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] ſhall be to thy Husband;</hi>
he ſhall be thy Refuge in Dangers. This
old <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tranſlation no queſtion he
knew well enough; and I ſuppoſe ſome will
make bold to think it more eaſy and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
than the forc'd Conſtruction, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable
meaning he puts upon the
words. Methinks it ſhould ſuffice that the
Women don't contradict their Lords and
Maſters, that they tamely ſubmit, and bear
with Patience what is impos'd on them:
No, unleſs they are enamour'd of their
Miſeries, and the very Deſires of their
Hearts brought under, and in ſubjection,
they are threaten'd in our Author's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
with Judgment, and Damnation. This
is a Tyranny, I think, that extends farther
than the moſt abſolute Monarchs in the
World; for if they can but fill their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
with Slaves, and chain them faſt to the
Oar, they ſeldom have ſo large a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to expect they ſhould take any great
pleaſure in their preſent Condition, and
that the very <hi>Deſires of their Hearts</hi> ſhould
ſtrike an Harmony with the clattering
Muſic of their Fetters. Certainly, he ſaid
very true when he told us that Women were
of <hi>weak Abilities to learn,</hi> as they muſt needs
have ſo hard and impoſſible a Task.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:38614:19"/>
After all this he acknowledges in plain
words, that <hi>ſince the Fall, Man is grown more
humorſom and hard to be pleas'd,</hi> which (tho
he feelingly knows it) he would never
have own'd, if he had not deſign'd to make
even that an Argument againſt us: for,
ſays he, <hi>'tis not the Woman's pleading that
her Husband is hard to be pleaſed that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
her;</hi> no, tho it be impoſſible for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
Angel to bring him into a good. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
and cure him of his Frowardneſs.
And if the impoſſibility of a thing be not
an excuſe, I know not what is; yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
there are ſome Inſtances to be given of
ſuch Tempers. This may, he ſays, be a
<hi>Memento to her of her original Guilt;</hi> and why
may not the Humors, and unſufferable
Paſſions of ſome Men be a <hi>Memento</hi> to them
of theirs too? But however he is reſolv'd
to advance an unheard-of Notion, That
the ill Humors of ſome Men, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of pleaſing them, is a Motive to the
Women to endeavour to pleaſe them; a
very ſtrong Motive no doubt! and 'tis very
ſtrange he recommends it to the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he has found it a mighty Obligation to
Obedience in his own virtuous Conſort.
This is a very fine touch indeed: If Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeneſs
and Ill-humor be a very good and
great Motive to Obedience, then the higher
degree of it the greater Motive; and ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38614:20"/>
the more barbarous and cruel any Husband
is, the more a Woman ought to reſpect,
and love, and rejoice in him. Precious
Doctrine no doubt! and eaſily believ'd by
every one who has once caſt off thoſe fooliſh
things call'd Liberty, Reaſon, and common
Senſe. What he ſays of the happy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and charming Soveraignty of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and the good humor the firſt and beſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was always in, ſeems only mention'd
with a ſpiteful deſign to grate upon the
Minds of the tender Sex, and vex them with
the compariſon between what Man is now,
and what he was then: for immediately he
repeats it over again, <hi>Man's Temper now is
harſh and ſevere, and his Humors troubleſom
and tedious.</hi> He ſeems here to ſpeak in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as if he either thought all Men fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with thoſe excellent Talents of Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and troubleſom Humors (which if
he has attain'd, I wiſh him much comfort in
them) or elſe endeavour'd to infuſe ſuch
into them. It looks a little uncharitable to
his own Sex, among whom yet I hope he
cannot find ſo many as he imagins whoſe
Humors are ſo very troubleſom and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for there are ſome great and generous
Minds that ſcorn to take pleaſure in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of a poor feeble Woman: tho he is
of another mind, and thinks that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of uſing a <hi>great deal of Art and Skill,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38614:20"/>
Diligence and Induſtry, and various Methods
in order to pleaſe a Husband, is a Truth expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
by moſt Women.</hi> P. 17. And then he
falls a raking afreſh in the ſacred Aſhes of
his Mother <hi>Eve</hi> (whom we hope God has
pardon'd, and ſo ſhould he too) and tells us
we <hi>may thank her for it;</hi> and that now, if
any of her Daughters will have Husbands,
and have them good, they muſt take a great
deal of care and pains to make them ſo.
But if I can perſuade thoſe poor tame Souls
he talks of, ſuch ſort of Men ſhall enjoy
their Humours by themſelves, and all the
Care and Pains he talks of ſhall be ſaved,
and beſtowed on ſomething that better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
it: for after their Care and Pains,
they'l be nobly rewarded no doubt, and
ſuch Husbands will ſtill ſay that all their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and Moroſeneſs are little enough to
make a poor Slave <hi>perfect in her Leſſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 3<hi>d</hi> Reaſon he gives is, <hi>Becauſe upon
the doing or neglecting of this, the Happineſs or
Miſery of a married Life does depend:</hi> and what
then? Becauſe ſuch a ſtate of Life cannot
be very happy, unleſs both endeavour to
make it ſo, therefore the Woman muſt be
a Slave, therefore her <hi>Deſires</hi> muſt be
brought under, that ſhe muſt not <hi>wiſh</hi> for
better uſage; for that's his meaning, P. 13.
and in that latitude I underſtand him all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
when he ſpeaks of the Woman's
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38614:21"/>
Duty to her Husband. And here for once
(that he might not be guilty himſelf of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Complement to our Sex) he makes a
Quotation, or at leaſt brings it out with a
<hi>[ſays one]</hi> which will do as well, and tells
us that the Women are indeed very bright
and ſhining Creatures: <hi>A good Wife ſhould
be like a Mirror</hi> (a wonderful Diſcovery,
that a Woman ſhould be ſo exactly like a
Looking-glaſs!) But mark the Deſign of it
in the following words; <hi>Which has no Image
of its own, but receives its Stamp and Image
from the Face that looks into it.</hi> Now by this
rule, whenever 'tis a frowning, peeviſh,
fretful, ſtormy Face, that looks into this
Glaſs, the Mirrour muſt ſend back the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſame agen, or elſe 'twill be a falſe Glaſs.
She muſt, he ſays, <hi>rejoice when he rejoices</hi>
(ay moſt certainly, tho it be in abuſing her,
and doing all he can to make her Life a
Torment to her, tho it be in careſſing her
Rival before her Face) <hi>and grieve and be
troubled when he is offended and vexed.</hi> No
doubt on't, he is here in the right; the
moſt patient Woman in the World would
grieve, and be troubled, when ſome Men
are offended and vexed: So that 'tis plain
he would never have paſſed this Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Looking-glaſs on us, if he had
not intended it as an Argument for, or at
leaſt Illuſtration of our Miſery. But now
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38614:21"/>
he begins to recollect ſome of his former
Courtſhip and Gallantry, and tells us a very
fair Story indeed, that if we will follow his
advice, we ſhould obtain <hi>e'en what we will of
our Husbands; and that ſuch Wives would be
ſooner tired in making their Requeſts than their
Husbands in granting.</hi> (Dear, Tender, Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sir!) But here I ſhrewdly ſuſpect, to
ſolve this, it muſt be remembred, that the
Women he means that endeavour, in his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>
ſenſe, to pleaſe their Husbands,
will not dare to make any requeſt, but ſuch
as they know before-hand are according to
their Husbands minds; no, their very Deſires
muſt be in ſubjection, and ſo there is no great
danger of their Husbands tyring with grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Requeſts, when according to him the
Women muſt not deſire to form one Petition
to their Husbands. By this Interpretation
that he has helpt me to, we may eaſily judg
of his meaning in all thoſe kind Expreſſions
which he hath upon this occaſion. The reſt
of this Head he ſpends in the deſcription of a
compleat <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> and here he fights with
the Wind; for every one, of any ſober
Reaſon or handſom Education, will ſcorn to
ſpend ſuch Language on a good Husband, and
on a bad one 'tis to no purpoſe: and if this
Gentleman has lived where there are ſo many
Examples of this kind, let him petition the
Government for an augmentation of Ducking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtools,
and let him ſolace himſelf, and quench
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38614:22"/>
his Rage with ſeeing the watry Puniſhment
executed upon them; and I know none will
reſcue the Offenders out of his hands.</p>
            <p>I heartily pity the poor Gentleman he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
p. 22. who had ſo very tender a Heart,
that the Breath of a Woman ſhatter'd it in
pieces; and indeed he has done very well to
leave his Memory to Poſterity, ſince in this
Iron Age there are few examples of ſo tender
Spirits as to be capable of ſuch dreadful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
from the Tongue of a Woman. He
would make the World believe that moſt of
our Sex are very <hi>Mother Damnables,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ringing the Bells backwards in their
Husbands ears, <hi>P.</hi> 6. But the Gentleman he
mentions was doubtleſs a man of a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and delicate Compoſition, ſuch as is not
now a-days to be found.</p>
            <p>He gives a very pleaſant reaſon why an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful
Wife is ſo very terrible a thing, p. 23.
Becauſe <hi>all Evils, as Elements, are moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
out of their proper places, as Profaneneſs in
Miniſters, Injuſtice in Judges, and Diſcomfort in
a Wife.</hi> Now this way of talking ſeems to
imply, that Profaneneſs and Injuſtice in ſome
perſons look very well, and are in their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places;</hi> by which what he intends is beyond
my weak Ability to learn. If his meaning
be good, I am ſure his utterance and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
are not very proper here; but however,
'twas done with an upright Intention, and a
Deſign to bring down the <hi>Deſires</hi> of all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38614:22"/>
hearts into ſubjection to the <hi>high and
mighty Sex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Proverb of <hi>Solomon</hi> he quotes, there
is no doubt of the truth of it, nor his Comment
upon it; but really I can ſee no great Piety
nor Ingenuity in that Sentence he has from
his <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Ingenious Author, That 'tis a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pities the Tongues of ſuch Shrows had not as
many Bliſters as their Jaws have Teeth; and 'tis
never better with their Husbands than when they are
hoarſe.</hi> If this be not <hi>Billingſgate</hi> of the coarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Alloy, I know not what is; only coming
from the Pulpit, 'tis ſanctified, and becomes
a very Pious and Ingenious Saying. What he
ſays in the concluſion of this part of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that a clamorous and turbulent Wife,
that ſpits Paſſion and Poiſon, is a Torment to
her ſelf and her Husband, is a moſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Truth, and they are juſtly Self-Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
only this I muſt add, that I think there
needs no farther Torment for a Woman, than
only being oblig'd, on pain of Damnation, to
bring under her very <hi>Deſires</hi> to the unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Humours of a wild and giddy Fop, who
becomes more inſolent by Submiſſion, and
grows more intolerable by being born with.</p>
            <p>Thus I have followed this courteous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
thro all the pleaſant Paths he hath here
laid down for us. The next thing he tells us,
is, how and which way married Women
ſhould endeavour to pleaſe their Husbands;
And here he pitches on three very Canonical
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38614:23"/>
Heads, <hi>Love, honour, and obey:</hi> And tells
us a very learned Story, that he hath heard
ſome Women ſay, They never would nor
did repeat the ſacred Words; and that if
he had been to officiate, he would have kept
them to the Text, or made them lie alone all
their Days, to their unſpeakable Terror and
Afrightment. This is a fine Period to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the Pulpit; but being ſet off with
a vehement Accent and a very earneſt Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it paſſed no doubt very well, and mightily
affected the Auditory. I am not about to
quarrel with the Compilers of the Liturgy,
only I ſhall take notice, that they were <hi>Men</hi>
who had a hand in it, and by conſequence
would not omit the binding our Sex as faſt as
poſſible: But 'tis alſo to be obſerved, that
thoſe words <hi>[with my Body I thee worſhip]</hi> if
they have any meaning in them, can never be
applied to ſuch a ſort of Creature as is a
Slave, tho our Author ſhould caſt in his mind
<hi>this way, and that way, and every way,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the ſenſe of them.</p>
            <p>He tells us, that every married Woman,
in order to pleaſe her Husband, ought to love
him. A notable Diſcovery! and who ever
doubted or denied it? But however, a Man
muſt be a perſon of extraordinary Merit, all
Love and Kindneſs, and a thouſand good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
to bring a Woman to that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
height of Paſſion, as to be contented
and pleas'd, tho <hi>all the World beſides were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated.</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:38614:23"/>
P. 28. And he ſeems to ſuggeſt
ſome odd unlucky thing or other in this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
which gives a very ſtrong Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the poor Ladies to be diſcontented as
ſoon as ever they come under the Yoke; and
accordingly he ſays, by all means a Woman,
<hi>newly married eſpecially,</hi> is to avoid all occaſion of
Difference with her Husband; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
makes a very grave and learned Citation
out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> for the edification of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory,
concerning his acquaintance with the
antient Fathers; for ſo, it may be, he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that at leaſt we poor ignorant Souls do
think and know no better. Now by his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſo obvious and unconteſted a Matter with
ſuch vehemence, it looks as if he had a mind
to repreſent us as a Generation of Vipers,
that, as ſoon as ever any charitable Man is ſo
kind as to lodg us poor willing Creatures in
his Boſom, immediatly ſting him to death.</p>
            <p>Then he breaks out into the moſt ſcurrilous
and ungenteel Language imaginable <hi>(P.</hi> 30,
&amp; 31.) and tells the World that young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
before Marriage do all they can to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the Affections of a Husband; ſo that in
their Looks, Dreſs, and Behavior, you may
read <hi>Come love me.</hi> Very coming and eaſy
Creatures! Certainly if they were ſo very
willing, abundance of little arts which the
Men uſe, might very well be ſpared. 'Tis
very eaſy for any Knight-Errant to fancy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
happy, and that ſome great Lady loves
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38614:24"/>
him moſt deſperately, if ſhe is but civil in
her behavior, cleanly in her dreſs, and has
an air of Candor; eſpecially if ſhe happens to
ſmile, tho it be at his Follies. And according
to this rule, the Author ſhould have made a
more civil return to the Sex; for I doubt not
but he has read <hi>Come love me,</hi> many a time,
if this does expreſs it. But is it not the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Men that makes the Women (if
any of them are ſo vain) to uſe thoſe petty
Arts he here ſets down? I hope this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
does not ſpeak by experience, when he
ſays, that as ſoon as ever they are married,
their pleaſant Looks are turned into <hi>Frowns,</hi>
and the Neatneſs of their Dreſs into <hi>Sluttery,</hi>
&amp;c. Notwithſtanding all this, there are ſome
Ladies not ſo very eaſy of acceſs, but hold
out deſperatly againſt all the arts of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
Sex, and the puling Lovers cannot
ſpell <hi>Come love me,</hi> till they have given ſome
very remarkable proofs of their Integrity;
which, if they prove afterwards to be but
Shams, are no very contemptible Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the new-married Woman to blot out
the Impreſſions of undeſerved Love, which
Hypocriſy only had made in her Heart.</p>
            <p>But in my Obſervation (for let me bring
that as an Argument as well as he does his)
I have found very few, if any Women, who
have had obliging and <hi>reſpectful</hi> Husbands (for
that's his own Phraſe <hi>P.</hi> 20.) that have begun
firſt to withdraw their Affections, as ſome have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38614:24"/>
done, no queſtion, who by the undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Arts of deſigning Men have been betray'd,
and afterwards ſlighted to the utmoſt degree.
But it becomes thoſe who are guilty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to talk at this huffing rate, and ſilence
all Complaints by the impudent Accuſations
they bring againſt thoſe they injure. Thus
he talks and raves, like one that has forgotten
common Civility, and the generous Education
of the Men of his Coat, and concludes this
Head with a very <hi>wooden Simile,</hi> for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and Edification of all well-meaning
Carpenters and Joyners, viz. <hi>That when two
Boards are firſt glued together, a ſmall matter
will looſen them</hi> (eſpecially ſuch a confounded
Jog as the Author gives us) <hi>but if carefully
lookt to till they are well faſtened, and the Glue
be hardened, 'twill not be an eaſy matter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joint
or ſever them.</hi> A moſt inſtructing Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude!
and the truth of which hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by very many Witneſſes of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
as they are ready to atteſt. Either the
Auditory he preached this to were perſons of
very wooden Underſtandings, or elſe they
were in danger of apprehending the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
to be very much akin to the Author.</p>
            <p>Then he tells us, Married Women are to
pleaſe their Husbands <hi>by honouring them</hi> (by
all means, Honour to whom Honour is due.)
But I think he goes a little too far when he
makes it a Woman's duty to lie like a Spaniel
at her Husband's feet, and ſuffer her ſelf very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38614:25"/>
civilly to be trampled on. This he intimates
by the authentic ſtory of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ladies,
who had the ſimilitude of a Foot worn on the
top of their Coronets, P. 34. and by the bold
and inſolent Comment he makes on it. Now
this you know is a moſt clear and <hi>oriental</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and proves juſt as much as the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>Hieroglyphics</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Is it impos'd on
them, or do they wear it willingly? If the
former, where's the Virtue? If the latter, I
can hardly think it proves what he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
us, unleſs the Gentlemen of <hi>Perſia</hi> are
very obliging indeed. Here again we ſee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
clearly what this Gentleman would be at:
A Woman, when once ſhe is enter'd within
the Grates, and the Parſon has turn'd the Key
upon her, is no longer to look on her ſelf as
a Companion, but the higheſt place ſhe can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
is to be trodden under foot. This is the
height of Glory, this is the Advancement our
Sex is to meet with, if all Men were of ſuch
wonderful Temper, and noble Principles, as
this our truſty and well-beloved Friend is.
And under this Head he confeſſes ſomething
(in my opinion) not much to his deſign; for,
ſays he, the Apoſtle calls the Woman the
<hi>Glory of the Man,</hi> becauſe 'tis an high Honour
to him that ſo <hi>excellent a Creature as a Woman</hi>
ſhould be his Inferior. But if a Woman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this honeſt Confeſſion, be ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Creature, then hence I think it may
very fairly be infer'd, that ſome acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38614:25"/>
is due to a Woman when ſhe condeſcends
to make her ſelf inferior to any of them.
And can it be the Glory of a Man to trample
upon, and enſlave, and render the Life of ſuch
an excellent Creature as miſerable as he can?
And here he inſinuates that we take a great
deal of freedom in our Thoughts. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if we had not freedom there, we were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Slaves, and even that he would abridg us
of (not that I think a Woman may harbor
any wicked thoughts of her Lord and Maſter:)
But 'tis very hard, and a ſtrange Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that they muſt not be allow'd to have
contemptible thoughts, no not of Perſons and
Things that are in themſelves contemptible
to the laſt degree. The Inſtance of <hi>Michal</hi>
is quite another caſe, for there was the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Religion in it, ſhe deſpiſed <hi>David</hi> 'tis
like for putting on the Linen Ephod, and
ſubmitting to meddle with ſacred things as
he did. However, if any of the Husbands
are ſuch brave and generous Men, of ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
Principles, and ſuch mighty Charms as
<hi>David</hi> had, I think their Wives will find it a
very difficult matter ſo much as to deſpiſe
them in their Hearts. Reverence and Love
are not things infus'd into our Breaſts by hard
Words, high Menaces, and huffing Language;
that dear and tender Eſteem is won by the
Charms of an agreeable Temper, the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a noble Generoſity, and thoſe other
powerful things which 'tis impoſſible to reſiſt,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38614:26"/>
and which will always ſecure Honor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
from very Strangers, much more in
thoſe who have the happineſs of ſo intimate
a Relation.</p>
            <p>Then, he tells us, beſides this internal there
muſt be an external Honor; and that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
muſt uſe thoſe <hi>Titles which may expreſs the
Dignity and Excellency of her Husband's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
But ſuppoſe a poor Lady ſhould meet
with a Spark that is not at all <hi>dignified or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd</hi>
from the common herd of Mankind,
that hath no Virtue, no Excellency to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for, that is of a baſe, ungenerous
and ſordid Spirit; yes, ſhe muſt give him
thoſe Titles which may beſpeak the Dignity
and Excellence of his Perſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhe muſt
banter him to his face, and provoke every one
to reflect upon his real faults by attempting
to cover them with the vain Names of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Dignity. He brings the Example of
<hi>Sarah</hi> calling <hi>Abraham</hi> Lord. But it muſt be
conſider'd that <hi>Abraham</hi> was indeed a great
Man, and rich; and that it would look a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
odd for a Man of low degree to be greeted,
<hi>My Lord, Your Lordſhip's moſt obedient Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
&amp;c. by his Lady in a blew Apron, or a
high-crown'd Hat. And by the way, he has
loſt a moſt admirable Argument (which runs
thus, according to the way of arguing by the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Shoo) in <hi>England</hi> the Women many
of them (in that part however where he is)
wear the ſimilitude of a Steeple on their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38614:26"/>
Heads, implying by the like Conſequence,
that Churchmen are peculiarly privileged to
lord it over their Wives. This would have
been a home thruſt, and moſt pertinent to the
matter in hand, for 'twould have inveſted his
Brother Dear (whom he then married) with
full Power and Authority to trample upon,
and lead captive the deluded Siſter. But to
return from this Digreſſion (which I have
made only to let him ſee wherein he has fail'd)
'tis to be conſider'd that the Apoſtles might
injoyn more than ordinary Submiſſion in the
Primitive Times, that ſo by their humble
Carriage they might charm their Husbands
into a love of Chriſtianity, <hi>What knoweſt
thou, O Wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</hi>
ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 16. But I ſhall
never believe they deſign'd ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Men as this Gentleman and his
Followers would fain erect.</p>
            <p>Then he bitterly inveighs againſt one of
the moſt innocent things in the World, at
Womens calling their Husbands by their
<hi>Chriſtian Names,</hi> and their uſing familiar
terms one to another. This is certainly the
effect of Tenderneſs and Freedom, which will
baniſh all the names of haughty Diſtance and
ſervile Subjection. And his Conſequence is
very harſh, and diſingenuous, that therefore
they <hi>eſteem them but as their Servants</hi> becauſe
they uſe ſuch familiar Titles; and complains
bitterly that ſome will call them by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38614:27"/>
Names of <hi>Fool, Sloven, Clown, Sot,</hi> &amp;c.
I hope he never gives his Lady any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to beſtow any of theſe venerable Titles
upon his Worſhip. But what if ſo ſtrange a
thing ſhould happen that a Man ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a Fool, muſt a Woman call him <hi>Solomon?</hi>
If he be a Sloven, or a Clown, or a Sot, muſt
ſhe cry him up for a ſpruce, genteel, ſenſible,
and temperate Man? Yes! ſhe muſt give him
thoſe Titles that do imply the <hi>Dignity and
Excellence of his perſon,</hi> which in ſome Men I
am ſure the Titles of Clown and Sot do fully
expreſs. They may modeſtly remember the
Infirmities of their Husbands, and yet not
uſurp their Authority, tho they forget the
Title of Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>Now (that I may give one bold ſtroke for
once) to prove that 'tis not always ſuch an
unpardonable Crime for a Woman to call her
Husband by an ungrateful Name, on ſome
juſt, great, and neceſſary occaſion, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him an Inſtance very ſutable to a Man of
his Profeſſion, and that is of an <hi>Abigail. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
was a fooliſh Churl; now according to
this Mr. <hi>Crape,</hi> his Wife <hi>Abigail</hi> muſt give
him the Titles ſutable to the <hi>Dignity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
of his Perſon,</hi> which we find ſhe does:
Her words to <hi>David</hi> are, <hi>Let not my Lord, I
pray thee, regard this Man of</hi> Belial, <hi>even</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal:
<hi>for as is his Name, ſo is he;</hi> Nabal <hi>is his
Name, and Folly is with him:</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 25.
Hence (with ſubmiſſion) I infer, that if an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38614:27"/>
               <hi>Abigal</hi> does meet with a <hi>Nabal,</hi> a Man of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi>
a <hi>Fool,</hi> a <hi>Sot,</hi> 'tis not in all caſes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
Sin to call him ſo; not that a bad
Man's failings are to be inſiſted on upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
occaſion, tho a modeſt repetition of them
be ſometimes neceſſary, as in this caſe, for
Self-preſervation, which old-faſhion'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
this modiſh Gentleman would fain have
us caſt away for ever and ever. So that 'tis
hence very plain, that as the Scripture hath
recorded ſome Inſtances of the profound, and
deſerv'd Reſpect that Men of noble Minds
have obtain'd from their Wives; ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, where Husbands deſerve ſuch unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Names as this Gentleman complains of,
'tis ſomething difficult to conceive how the
Women of moderate Conſciences can heartily
attribute to them Titles which imply ſome
mighty Excellence they never once had the
leaſt ſhadow of in their Lives. Nor is there
any thing formidable in that Reaſon he gives,
<hi>viz.</hi> for fear leſt the Man ſhould come under
the <hi>Diſcipline of the Apron,</hi> which either he is
not, or elſe (as I am inform'd) his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was a great way off when he deliver'd
this Diſcourſe. If he be under ſuch Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
he has doubtleſs had many a ſevere
Curtain-Lecture for it ſince; tho moſt are of
opinion that he is in very little Terror on
that account. Theſe comfortable, and eaſy
things he has been inſiſting on, will, he tells
us, facilitate the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:38614:28"/>
Third Duty, which is to <hi>obey them,</hi> (which
I confeſs is due to them that deſerve to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
and here he does make a bold ſtroke
at once, and tells us, that Subjection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto Husbands is required <hi>as peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
as unto Chriſt himſelf,</hi> P. 40. I thought
the Authority of Husbands had been at leaſt
one degree inferior to the Authority of Chriſt;
but ſee whither a hot Brain, and inſulting
Temper will lead Men. The Authority or
Husbands is as peremptorily aſſerted as the
Authority of Chriſt! what elſe can be the
meaning of it? A little more Modeſty would
have helpt him to another Interpretation of
that place, <hi>Submit your ſelves to your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
as unto the Lord;</hi> Eph. 5. 22. Who does
not ſee that 'tis meant ſo far as the Laws of
Heaven require it, and in obedience to the
Commands of Chriſt? So that if the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Husbands be limited, and that of
Chriſt not, I think Obedience is not requir'd
ſo abſolutely and peremptorily as to Chriſt
himſelf; which he ſeems to be apprehenſive
of, and ſo drops the <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> and very
prudently owns that a Man is to go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than what comes within the compaſs of
his Authority to command: <hi>P.</hi> 41. And
here he ſays, that nothing but what is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to God's Laws, or impoſſible in it ſelf,
is excluded from the compaſs of a Husband's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
A goodly Dominion certainly! for
according to this Rule, a Woman (if a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38614:28"/>
Husband pleaſes) is bound to do a thouſand
fooliſh and ridiculous things. If it be his
Will and Pleaſure, his Houſe muſt be her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
all the days of her Life, ſhe muſt never
ſpeak a word but to him, ſhe muſt never eat
but what he leaves, and the Dogs and ſhe
may ſcramble for the Bones; or ſhe may be
oblig'd to carry his Cloak after him when he
goes abroad, and ſave the charge of a Groom
by taking care of and rubbing down his
Horſe; and then upon the leaſt diſguſt, ſhe
may be oblig'd to go barefoot twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Miles to ſome eminent Wood, and thence
cut and lug home a bundle of ſticks, each of
which may be made uſe of as a <hi>Paſtoral Staff</hi>
to diſcipline her Bones withal. Theſe, and
a multitude of other cruel and ridiculous
things a Woman may be oblig'd to, becauſe
they are not impoſſible. If it be reply'd that
theſe things, when impos'd, are contrary to
the Divine Law; 'Tis all we deſire to be
granted. Then he tells us, that for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to obey in what ſhe thinks fit, falls <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
ſhort of the Apoſtle's Intent;</hi> P. 43.
Whence again 'tis plain that he means (as
any one may gueſs) that a Husband's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is unlimited, and infinite; for that muſt
be infinite which another thing falls <hi>infinitely
ſhort of;</hi> tho juſt before he had ſet limits to
this boundleſs Authority. Then he ſeems to
tell us, that Ignorance is the Mother of all
this <hi>Female Devotion,</hi> that a Woman muſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38614:29"/>
not uſe her Reaſon ſo far as to judg of the
Laws that are pronounc'd to her: No! muſt
obey by implicit Faith. This indeed, as he
confeſſes, <hi>ſeems difficult on the firſt view,</hi> (and
I dare ſay 'twill not ſeem eaſy on a ſecond)
yet for their comfort he tells them that this in
conjunction with the two former will be very
eaſy and pleaſant, and <hi>will or ſhould be ſufficient
to pleaſe their Husbands;</hi> P. 44. Ay good Sir!
no doubt on't, unleſs they are Men that fall
infinitely ſhort of the leaſt ſhare of Reaſon,
Conſcience and Humanity.</p>
            <p>And here at laſt he tells us that he'll diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Shoo, provided we
will but once bring it in faſhion to wear
Ribbons on our Heads, with a <hi>Love, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Obey</hi> woven into them. An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Invention, and for which (when it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains)
he will doubtleſs be mention'd with
Honour to Poſterity, as every one ought to
be that invents any thing extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Now he comes to the Improvement of the
whole matter; and, firſt, he applies himſelf
to the <hi>ſingle Men, and the unmarried,</hi> and tells
them what a fine time they'll have on't when
they can perſuade any willing Creatures to
ſubmit to their Yoke, and become their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
for ever. And here he runs out againſt
<hi>the wild and extravagant Inclinations</hi> of the
Women, and what thoſe Inclinations are
may be gueſs'd from his Diſcourſe all along.
There is indeed a very ſtrong Inclination
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38614:29"/>
in us for the preſervation of thoſe things
call'd Reaſon, and the Liberty of Rational
Creatures; which wild and extravagant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
this Gentleman would by all means
have timely corrected as a thing that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
inconſiſtent with his moſt exalted No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and pious Deſign: Yet in the mean
time, I leave the World to judg whether
he has not given an infinite ſcope to the moſt
wild and exorbitant Inclinations of ſome
Men, tho, as he ſays, they can <hi>learn to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
faſt enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his cloſing Periods (where he addreſſes
himſelf to the Married) he ſeems a little to
tack about, and endeavors to roll up his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pill in a few ſugar'd Sentences: and bids
the Men remember <hi>that our Duty is hard,</hi>
(moſt undoubtedly true, according to his
Deſcription of it) <hi>our Frailty great,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Task muſt not be made more <hi>difficult
than neceſſity does require,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>becauſe they are</hi>
(ſays he to the <hi>He-yoke-fellows) a part of your
ſelves.</hi> This is certainly all very good. But
if it be ſo, and this be a Man's Duty, then
hence I collect, that a Man goes beyond his
Bounds when he impoſes things unneceſſary,
tho they be not impoſſible; which does not
much reſemble what he has told us, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but vitious or impoſſible things are
excluded from the compaſs (or the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
Circle) <hi>of a Husband's Authority.</hi>
This makes me conclude that he would never
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38614:30"/>
have once mentioned the Mens Duty, when
he tells them,
<q>
                  <p>They muſt bear with and pardon our Weakneſs;</p>
                  <p>And ſubmit to many Inconveniences for our
ſakes;</p>
                  <p>And interpoſe between us and Dangers;</p>
                  <p>And endeavour to promote our ſpiritual Good
and Welfare.</p>
               </q> (Indeed I have heard of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholic who attempted to perſuade a
Proteſtant that Marriage was a Sacrament,
becauſe it did adminiſter Grace; and being
demanded what Grace, replied, the Grace of
<hi>Repentance.</hi> Now in this ſenſe the obliging
Husbands that follow his Directions, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
promote their Wives ſpiritual Good and
Welfare; for I'll engage, that any Women of
ſenſe enough to diſtinguiſh between Liberty
and Bondage, after they have been a while
within the compaſs of ſuch a Husbands Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
ſhall attain to the perfect exerciſe of
a moſt <hi>true and unfeigned Repentance.)</hi> But
theſe Duties of the Men he would, I ſuppoſe,
never have mentioned, if it had not been for
the ſake of a moſt ſurprizingly witty Jeſt,
which he deſigned to break, and leave
with us for the parting Bleſſing: It is this;
That he <hi>muſt forbear Enlargement</hi> (he means
on the Duty of Mankind) <hi>leſt by overlading
the Memories of the Women, he ſhould cauſe
them to forget that Duty which hath been ſet
before them.</hi> He might very well have ſpared
this Jeſt, with which he does conclude his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38614:30"/>
pious and ingenious Diſcourſe; for no doubt
the Women will not forget him in haſt, nor
the Doctrine he has delivered, as he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
find, if ever he ſhould have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
once more to attempt to perſuade
any one of them to renew the Experiment
how obliging and extraordinary a Husband he
would prove.</p>
            <p>Thus I have haſtily conſidered this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Piece, in which, I ſuppoſe, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
takes abundance of Pleaſure and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:
But what could move him to vent
ſuch high-flown ranting ſtuff as we find here,
I cannot imagin. If the Parliamert were all
of his mind, we ſhould have the <hi>Salique</hi> Law
eſtabliſht on this ſide the Water, tho he
ſcarcely hoped ſo great an effect of his firſt
Endeavors. But I ſuppoſe he was reſolved,
ſince what he had hitherto publiſhed had not
made him ſo famous as he deſerved, he would
now do ſomething that ſhould for ever mark
him to poſterity, and get him a Name, let it
be what it will; as he that burnt the Temple
of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> purely that the memory
of the Fact might eternize his Name. Or
perhaps, he ſo dearly loves his preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
that he was reſolv'd, ſhould he loſe
her, never once to think of another; and to
that end and purpoſe, hath done ſomething
to make it impoſſible for him to hope any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would ever ſmile upon him, or that he
ſhould read <hi>Come love me</hi> in any of them. But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38614:31"/>
I know not what he will ſay to juſtify the
Reverence of the Pulpit, after he has preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Sermon calculated to ſpoil the Gravity,
and debauch the Devotion of a Saint. Thoſe
perſons that could refrain from a loud Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at many of his Periods, muſt have a greater
degree of command over themſelves than the
Author has. Had he reſolved to have talkt
thus, the only time had been while he was
ſlabbering the Sack-poſſet, or untying the
Bride-woman's Garters: And it looks the
more awkward, becauſe he has here and there
mingled Gravity even to Terror, and ever
now and then all the Levity and Buffoonery
of one that harangues the People from a
large wooden High-place at <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair;
which in the Pulpit is not, I think, in its
<hi>proper place.</hi> Such a Diſcourſe might have
paſſed well enough in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Muſcovy</hi> (where
the Diſcipline of the Crab-tree is patiently
ſuffer'd by the Women) and he loſt a mighty
opportunity in not tranſporting himſelf with
the <hi>Czar.</hi> But the miſchief on't is, that here
in <hi>England,</hi> tho he has done his endeavor to
make it no more the <hi>Paradiſe of Women,</hi> yet
there are many of the Men ſo generous that
they were aſhamed of his Deſign, and (as
'tis reported) earneſtly perſuaded him to let
it die, and be buried in deſerved Oblivion;
but certainly one poſſeſt of ſuch Notions is
utterly beyond all advice.</p>

Notwithſtanding all the good he may think
he has done by the preaching and publiſhing
this learned Sermon, I ſuppoſe it will not be
very hard to prove that he has done ſome
miſchief by it: As, ſuppoſe he hath cauſed
hereby ſeveral poor patient Creatures to be
made <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and to be cudgel'd two or
three times a week more than uſually: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he has inflam'd the domineering Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and heighten'd the inſulting Carriage of
many a barbarous Husband. Why all this is
nothing: They muſt thank their Mother <hi>Eve</hi>
for it; tho in truth, if ſuch Principles as his
had never come abroad in the World, they
might have ſcap'd tolerably well for all <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Eve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, the poor diſtreſſed Lady, for
whom this was preach'd, is doubtleſs very
much edified by it. To come from <hi>Your
humble Servant, and Yours to Command, tho it
be my Life,</hi> &amp;c. to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Shoo, and the
new-faſhion'd <hi>Motto,</hi> was a vaſt change.
From the melting Accents of a deſperate
Lover, to the harſh Cadence of ſuch rugged
Sentences, and ſuch threatning Pronounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!
From ſuch <hi>Prayers</hi> to ſuch <hi>Preaching,</hi>
was a mighty Leap, and no doubt gave the
poor tender Heart a moſt abominable Jolt.</p>
            <p>'Tis very natural alſo, from this Diſcourſe,
to obſerve the vaſt alteration there is in ſome
men after they are ſure of their Game: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
they'l do all the mean things in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38614:32"/>
World, and afterwards all the ungrateful
and diſingenuous ones.</p>
            <p>I am ſure (whatever a Woman is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
obliged to) that when the Men ſhall
promiſe and vow, when they ſhall proteſt by
the moſt ſacred things, that ſuch ſhall be
their Indulgence and Tenderneſs, as ſhall
never give the leaſt cauſe of Repentance;
when they ſhall declare and ſwear to be for
ever their Servants; they hereby oblige
themſelves before-hand to conſider the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
that ſhall be made to them, if they are
ſevere. So that in this ſort of Tyranny, a
Man not only violates common Juſtice, but
his own Vows and Obligations. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
knows the vaſt difference between
<hi>[Bright and Tranſcendental Madam!]</hi> and the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Shoo; between <hi>[Yours to the Center of
the Earth, and your Servant to the Antipodes]</hi>
and <hi>know your Lord and Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now thoſe that are of this abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
Gentleman's mind, if they'l be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and honeſt, ought to tell the Ladies
they addreſs, what ſort of Life they are like
to lead, what ſort of Bonds they are to come
under, what vaſt Authority muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
and that the very Deſires of their Hearts
muſt be under Government Maſculine; and
if after all this they'l come under <hi>Male-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,</hi>
and then complain, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the perſons moſt concerned in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Diſcourſe, and ought to conſider it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38614:32"/>
and reap the benefit of it accordingly.</p>
            <p>Thus I have caſt away a few leiſure hours
on theſe Reflections which I have ventured to
make, and done this Author an honour he
could not expect: And being engaged in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Sex, if he ſhall preach ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Sermon, I hope ſome generous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or other will ſave me the trouble, and let
the World ſee, that even among his own Sex,
there are ſome who are not Partakers with
him, but hate the mean and diſhonourable
Deſign with which he was certainly big, when
he uttered ſo ungenteel and unmanly a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
