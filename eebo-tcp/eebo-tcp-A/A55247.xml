            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>Fantane Religio potuit ſuadere Malorum.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <l>Aid me, <hi>Apollo,</hi> lay aſide thy Lyre,</l>
            <l>With Numbers high, yet ſad, my Muſe inſpire;</l>
            <l>In moving ſtrains, aſſiſt me to repeat</l>
            <l>A Noble's fall, (would he were Good as Great!)</l>
            <l>Oh <hi>Stafford! Stafford!</hi> how could'ſt thou, when Death</l>
            <l>Led in by Time, ſtood waiting for thy Breath;</l>
            <l>By ſuch ignoble ways and Methods ſtrive,</l>
            <l>To cut off thoſe few Years thou had'ſt to live:</l>
            <l>Alas! what Bliſs couldſt thou expect to come,</l>
            <l>(O're-preſs'd with Age) when Nature's powerful <hi>doom,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Had left thee nought to hope for but a Tomb.</l>
            <l>Why ſhould'ſt thou then in ſuch a horrid Cauſe,</l>
            <l>Turn Traytor to Divine and Humane Laws?</l>
            <l>Ah! how could'ſt thou, thou, ſo unnatural be</l>
            <l>To him who was ſo good, ſo kind to thee?</l>
            <l>How could'ſt thou plot 'gainſt ſuch a King as he?</l>
            <l>One who had heap'd ſuch Honours on thy Head,</l>
            <l>And yet could'ſt thou, ingrateful, wiſh him Dead,</l>
            <l>Not onely wiſh him ſo, but in that ſtrife,</l>
            <l>To act a part that was to take his Life;</l>
            <l>Yet, 'cauſe thy Blood from noble ſprings doth flow,</l>
            <l>Would Error and not Malice made thee ſo!</l>
            <l>Would thou wert over-reach'd, that ſo the ſin</l>
            <l>Might be leſs thine then theirs that drew thee in:</l>
            <l>Fain would I think it were with thee, as they,</l>
            <l>An <hi>Ignis Fatuns</hi> leads out o'th' way:</l>
            <l>Too credulous they follow the falſe Light,</l>
            <l>And bleſs themſelves for ſuch a Guide i'th Night,</l>
            <l>And think where e're it leads they'r ſtill i'th right.</l>
            <l>And yet at laſt, (with toyl and trouble croſt,)</l>
            <l>They feel the Pain, but find the Labour loſt:</l>
            <l>They ſee the flatt'ring Light o'th ſudden gone,</l>
            <l>And they to their Diſpair are left alone</l>
            <l>In Fens, or Brakes, or Floods, to make their moan.</l>
            <l>So thou O're-ſway'd by'th Pious-ſeeming Wits,</l>
            <l>Of Hells chief Agents, (Juggling Jeſuits)</l>
            <l>(By ſpecious Arguments, and pious fraud,</l>
            <l>Such as <hi>Romes</hi> Pandemonium does applaud)</l>
            <l>Wer't in that Helliſh Brood drawn in to be</l>
            <l>An Actor in that Diſmal Tragedy,</l>
            <l>That boldly aim'd at Sacred Majeſty;</l>
            <l>But Heaven ſtep'd in and ſav'd the tottering Throne,</l>
            <l>(Juſt when it could be ſav'd by Heaven alone)</l>
            <l>And all the Plots of <hi>Rome</hi> and Hell were known.</l>
            <l>All did I ſay! Ah! no; yet ſuch, ſo Vile,</l>
            <l>So baſe, ſo dire, were found in <hi>Albions Iſle?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As <hi>Scithia</hi> (where the Sun dares ſcarce appear,</l>
            <l>Where Horrid Winter broods,) would bluſh to hear;</l>
            <l>That thoſe whom Heaven had plac'd ſo near the <hi>Crown</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With Impious Hands ſhould ſtrive to pull it down.</l>
            <l>Unhappy <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Monarchs,</hi> who do good,</l>
            <l>Even to thoſe that ſtrive to ſhed their Blood,</l>
            <l>And they not know it, but with gentle breath,</l>
            <l>Speak thoſe foul Serpents fair that plot their Death.</l>
            <l>Ah! <hi>Stafford!</hi> how couldſt thou ſo baſe become?</l>
            <l>(So falſe to <hi>England!</hi> to be True to <hi>ROME?</hi>)</l>
            <l>How couldſt thou Plot his Death who always ſtrove</l>
            <l>Not to Command, but fairly win thy Love?</l>
            <l>Ah! how couldſt thou ſo baſe and Treacherous prove!</l>
            <l>Couldſt thou think Heaven aſleep at ſuch a time?</l>
            <l>Or could'ſt believe it did approve thy Crime?</l>
            <l>Or to ſuch Treaſons would Succeſs have given?</l>
            <l>Ah! no; a King's the Subſtitute of Heaven,</l>
            <l>And Angels are his Guard.</l>
            <l>The Gyants ſo of Old wag'd War with <hi>JOVE,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Striving by Arms, to win the Seats Above:</l>
            <l>Though Bold, yet vainly, in th' Attempt they fell,</l>
            <l>And for their hop'd of Heaven, were plung'd in Hell.</l>
            <l>The Dreadful Thunder ruin'd their Deſigns,</l>
            <l>And in their torments Heavens juſt vengeance ſhines.</l>
            <l>Conſider this, Oh! <hi>Stafford,</hi> and Repent,</l>
            <l>Uſe well that little time that Heaven hath lent;</l>
            <l>That little time, (for long it cannot be,</l>
            <l>E're thou muſt enter Vaſt Eternity.)</l>
            <l>Oh! uſe it well, let it to Tears be given,</l>
            <l>Be Penitent, and make thy peace with Heaven;</l>
            <l>That when the fatal ſtroke ſhall end thy Days,</l>
