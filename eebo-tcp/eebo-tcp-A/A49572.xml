            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT may be necessary to inform the Reader, that after the first Representation of this Play, the Conclusion was altered: <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> is left to continue in a Swoon, and the Scene is clos'd with these few lines spoken by <hi>Ulysses,</hi> immediately upon the Departure of <hi>Chruseis,</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Uly. The Ills that Love has done, Love has aton'd,</l>
               <l>And Glory calls, to make us full amends.</l>
               <l>Look to the King, be that your care <hi>Talthybius, (To</hi> Tal.</l>
               <l>And let all Ages, in this Truth agree</l>
               <l>Love never gain'd, a Nobler Victory.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The Reasons for this Alteration were these. The Author was of Opinion, that some might think it more Natural that <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> (considering the Excess of Love which fills his Character) should upon coming to himself, rather run after his Mistress, than into the Battel: He declares that in the same Circumstance he should have done so himself, and it is a pretty true Observation,
<pb facs="tcp:95603:3"/>
that in the Frame of our Heroes, we commonly draw our own Pictures. Another Reason was Brevity, some having complain'd of the length of that Act. There was indeed such effectual Care taken not to seem tedious to the Audience, that the last Scene may be more properly said to have been Murder'd than Cut, for the Conveniency of Acting, as will evidently appear to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Some have objected, that it is unnatural for a Hero to Swoon; those Persons are entreated to inform us of what stuff they take Heroes to be made: Hitherto they have pass'd for Men, and by consequence subject to humane Infirmities. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thello</hi> in one of his Agonies of Jeloufie, falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Swoon: and indeed in some Cases where the Passion must be presum'd so Violent or so Tender, that words can but faintly represent it, it is then a Beauty to express it in this manner, and by far more Pathetick, than any Speech thô never so Rhetorical. Others have complain'd, that they want to know what becomes afterwards of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon.</hi> They are desir'd to accept of this short reply, That the Author never undertook to
<pb facs="tcp:95603:3"/>
write the Life of <hi>Agamemnon.</hi> A Tragedy is the Representation of one single particular Action, and not of every Circumstance of a Man's Life: But however, to satisfie their Curiosity, these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons if they can give themselves the trouble to observe, may find mixt up and down in the Play, either by way of Relation or Prophecy, all the remarkable Passages of the Life of <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> from the Beginning to the End, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so much as his Forefathers and his Posterity: and what would they have more? It has likewise been objected, that the Characters are too few. Let those Criticks be pleas'd to consider, that a single Action will allow of but few Persons, and a regular Play is confin'd to a single Action: Let them examine what number of Characters the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and all who have written in their Imitation, were wont to introduce, and then let them judge. It may be further observ'd; that whosoever crowds his Play with a Multitude of Persons, will be forc'd to draw his Characters so little, and as it were in miniature, that it will scarce be percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there are any Characters at all: for to shew Men at full Length and in just Proportion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb facs="tcp:95603:4"/>
room, which can only be found when the Characters are few.</p>
            <p>There is indeed one Personage which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thinks himself oblig'd to make some Apology for to the Judicious Reader, thô it happens to be the Part which in the Representation meets the loudest Applause; and this is the Character of <hi>Briseis,</hi> which may seem to some a little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd, and extended larger than the Life. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he cannot help owning that in his Opinion he verily believes there are many who think full as vainly of themselves; Some Men he is sure he has met with of that Character, but La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are Sacred Things, and he would not be thought to suggest the least uncivil Supposition of any of that Sex. To proceed then to give some account of the true Reason of his choice of so extraordinary a Person, the plain Truth of the whole matter is this; Had he form'd her a moving Character, should he have brought her in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting her Misfortune and attracting Compassion, this would have prejudic'd the Chief Hero of the Play: for all the Pity which she had excited, must necessarily have rais'd so much Indignation against
<pb facs="tcp:95603:4"/>
him. The Author thus was under a Necessity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present her in such a manner, that no body might be concern'd, or take any part in her Misfortune, and he therefore chose to make her of a Piece with her Lover; for in reality, her Character is form'd out of his, as presuming and arrogant with her Beauty, as <hi>Achilles</hi> with the Opinion of his Courage. There was scarce any other way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing her without giving occasion for pity, which was absolutely to be avoided; and therefore the Author hopes in such a Case he is pardonable. This Excuse is addrest to the Judicious, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the World needed it not, this being the Part in the Play which found the best Reception. It often indeed happens, that the Audience is best pleas'd where the Author is most out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that part of the Performance which the Writer Suspects, the Spectator chiefly approves. When we observe how little notice is taken of the noble and sublime Thoughts and Expressions of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and what Applause is given to the Rants and the Fustian of Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> what can we say, but that Madmen are only fit to write, when nothing is esteem'd Great and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick but what is un-intelligible.</p>

               <l>AUspicious Poet, wert thou not my Friend,</l>
               <l>How could I envy, what I must commend!</l>
               <l>But since 'tis Natures Law in Love and Wit</l>
               <l>That Youth shou'd Reign, and with'ring Age submit,</l>
               <l>With less regret, those Lawrels <hi>I</hi> resign,</l>
               <l>Which dying on my Brows, revive on thine.</l>
               <l>With better Grace an Ancient Chief may yield</l>
               <l>The long contended Honours of the Field,</l>
               <l>Than venture all his Fortune at a Cast,</l>
               <l>And Fight, like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to lose at last.</l>
               <l>Young Princes Obstinate to win the Prize,</l>
               <l>Thô Yearly beaten, Yearly yet they rise:</l>
               <l>Old Monarchs though Successful, still in Doubt,</l>
               <l>Catch at a Peace; and wisely turn Devout.</l>
               <l>Thine be the Lawrel then; thy blooming Age</l>
               <l>Can best, if any can, support the Stage:</l>
               <l>Which so declines, that shortly we may see,</l>
               <l>Players and Plays reduc'd to second Infancy.</l>
               <l>Sharp to the World, but thoughtless of Renown,</l>
               <l>They Plot not on the Stage, but on the Town,</l>
               <l>And in Despair their Empty Pit to fill,</l>
               <l>Set up some Foreign Monster in a Bill:</l>
               <l>Thus they jog on; still tricking, never thriving;</l>
               <l>And Murd'ring Plays, which they miscal Reviving.</l>
               <l>Our Sense is Nonsense, through their Pipes convey'd;</l>
               <l>Scarce can a Poet know the Play He made;</l>
               <l>'Tis so disguis'd in Death: Nor thinks 'tis He</l>
               <l>That suffers in the Mangled Tragedy.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Itys</hi> first was kill'd, and after dress'd</l>
               <l>For his own Sire the Chief Invited Guest.</l>
               <l>I say not this of thy successful Scenes;</l>
               <l>Where thine was all the Glory, theirs the Gains;</l>
               <l>With length of Time, much Judgment, and more Toil,</l>
               <l>Not ill they Acted, what they cou'd not spoil:</l>
               <l>Their Setting-Sun still shoots a Glim'ring Ray,</l>
               <l>Like Ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> Majestick in decay:</l>
               <l>And better gleanings, their worn Soil can boast,</l>
               <l>Then the Crab-Vintage of the Neighb'ring Coast.</l>

            <byline>
               <hi>By</hi> Bevill Higgons, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </byline>
            <lg>
               <l>WHat will the Galleries, nay Boxes say?</l>
               <l>There's not one Man destroy'd in all our Play.</l>
               <l>Murder and Blood have long possess'd the Stage,</l>
               <l>And pleas'd the Genius of a Barbarous Age,</l>
               <l>But since the Poet's task's the Soul to move,</l>
               <l>And with his Objects, make you Grieve or Love,</l>
               <l>Surviving Wretches should more pity find</l>
               <l>Than they who die, and leave their Woes behind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>On <hi>Athen's</hi> Stage, when <hi>Greece</hi> the World gave Law.</l>
               <l>Hr sprightly Dames our <hi>Agamemnon</hi> saw;</l>
               <l>They shar'd his Sorrows, did his Fate bemoan,</l>
               <l>And always made the Hero's wrongs their own.</l>
               <l>But then the World was Gay, and Nature Young,</l>
               <l>Mens Passions were more high, and Fancy strong;</l>
               <l>Poets could either raise, or make so sad,</l>
               <l>That going Home, whole Audiences ran Mad.</l>
               <l>In vain we would your colder Hearts inspire,</l>
               <l>And blow up Flames, without the Seeds of Fire.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Three thousand Years ago, illustrious Dames</l>
               <l>Attended Camps, and gave the Heroes Flames;</l>
               <l>Now every Wench; when Batter'd and Decay'd,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Flanders</hi> fled, where straight the Rampant Jade</l>
               <l>At once the Colonel serv'd, and the Brigade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If Poets have the Privilege of Laws</l>
               <l>To challenge Juries; who must try their Cause,</l>
               <l>To judge of Wit, the Critick be debarr'd,</l>
               <l>Who often Damns, what he ne'er saw nor heard;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:95603:6"/>
Besides, he still to Poets bears a spite,</l>
               <l>For never yet was Critick, who could write.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For You, the Viler Rabble of the Pit,</l>
               <l>Who want good Nature, tho' you have no Wit,</l>
               <l>Maliciously you imitate the Times,</l>
               <l>Like Judges try the Men, and not their Crimes;</l>
               <l>With No<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <l>And if demanded, give no reason why,</l>
               <l>But when no pity can the Torrent stem,</l>
               <l>Attaint the Poet, whom you can't condemn.</l>
               <l>'Tis on that shining Circle we depend, <hi>[To the Ladies.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For You——</l>
               <l>Our Poet writes, in gratitude defend:</l>
               <l>Of Love and Honour, he a Pattern meant,</l>
               <l>And took the bright Ideas, that you lent:</l>
               <l>Your Picture drawn, show then the Painter Grace</l>
               <l>Who fails, in an inimitable Face.</l>

               <l>Then farewel all my hopes; And all ye joys</l>
               <l>Of Love, for ever—Ah! farewel—</l>
               <l>Love, what is Love? state me that question right,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95603:25"/>
Let me consider—Is it to quench desire,</l>
               <l>To follow Nature roving after Sense?</l>
               <l>This is self-love, unquiet to possess</l>
               <l>For its own ease; the brutal Love of Beasts.</l>
               <l>'Tis vile, 'tis shameful, I abhor the thought.</l>
               <l>Then what is Love? Stay—let me think again.</l>
               <l>Is it to fix our Wishes on one Object?</l>
               <l>Pleas'd only when the thing we love is pleas'd;</l>
               <l>Partaking of its sorrows, seeking its good;</l>
               <l>Desirous more to give than to receive;</l>
               <l>Willing to part with all, with Fortune, Life;</l>
               <l>Chusing all Miseries, satisfy'd, rejoic'd</l>
               <l>With any Ruin that's the means of Safety</l>
               <l>To the Man belov'd.—Ay—this is Love,</l>
               <l>True Love, Heroick Love: 'Tis Generous, 'tis Divine.</l>
               <l>Say, <hi>Artemis;</hi> think'st thou no Woman yet</l>
               <l>Lov'd thus?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Art.</speaker>
               <l>None, Madam,—that I e're heard of.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chru.</speaker>
               <l>I tell thee then, there will be one e're Night,</l>
               <l>Thanks to your kindness, Gods.—But that's a secret.</l>
               <l>Why, why am I pick'd out to be the first?</l>
               <l>The first,—perhaps, and last.—The Custom is,</l>
               <l>From Man to Man to wander with our wishes,</l>
               <l>Meeting, and parting, as it seems convenient:</l>
               <l>These are call'd happy; these enjoy the Goods</l>
               <l>Of Life and Fortune; all the World's their own;</l>
               <l>Pleasure's their Mate; their hearts are still at ease.</l>
               <l>But have these Virtue? No.—Is Virtue then</l>
               <l>Given to make us wretched? Ah! sad Portion,</l>
               <l>Fatal to all that have thee! shunn'd on Earth,</l>
               <l>Depress'd, and shown but in severest Trials,</l>
               <l>Condemn'd to solitude, then shining most</l>
               <l>When black Obscurity surrounds—Poor, poor,</l>
               <l>But ever beautiful.</l>

               <l>But to the purpose—</l>
               <l>Something I must resolve, quickly resolve,</l>
               <l>For Fate comes on apace, and treads us near.</l>
               <l>To stay is to undo the Man I love;</l>

               <l>Ha! thou hast rouz'd a thought! no; 'tis impossible:</l>
               <l>To doubt's an injury: to suspect a Friend</l>
               <l>Is breach of Friendship: Jealousy's a Seed</l>
               <l>Sown but in vicious Minds: prone to mistrust,</l>
               <l>Because apt to deceive—I'll think no more on't.</l>
               <l>Draw near, <hi>Ulysses,</hi> let me view thee well.</l>
               <l>Look up, look on my facè, erect and bold,</l>
               <l>That humble Cringe, and that malicious Smile,</l>
               <l>Those downcast Eyes betray thy treacherous Soul:</l>
               <l>I tell thee, <hi>Greek,</hi> thou hast a lying look.</l>
               <l>My Love's above thy Malice.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Uly.</speaker>
               <l>Far be all Malice from my honest meaning;</l>
               <l>But thus unwelcome Truths are still receiv'd:</l>
               <l>No Secret have I told, nor idle Rumour,</l>
               <l>But publick Certainties.—<hi>Briseis</hi> Rape</l>
               <l>Is now the common talk of every tongue;</l>
               <l>But for what end, what purpose;—far be't from me</l>
               <l>T' interpret;—such Violence indeed</l>
               <l>Looks strange, exceeding strange, to have no meaning.</l>
               <l>And thus much may I add, without offence;</l>
               <l>When Ladies can foresee approaching Change,</l>
               <l>'Tis good to be before-hand with a Lover;</l>
               <l>Better to leave than to be left. But you know best;</l>
               <l>I advise nothing—He has sworn, say you,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95603:26"/>
Not to forsake; and having rais'd your hopes</l>
               <l>To that degree, 'twere cruel to delude:</l>
               <l>Yet I have known many an eager Lover</l>
               <l>Protesting Love to death, defying Ruin,</l>
               <l>When Reason and all Remedies have fail'd,</l>
               <l>Cur'd by another Love. Nothing so common</l>
               <l>As Love excluding Love. For just as Poyson</l>
               <l>Is expell'd by Poyson; so one Woman</l>
               <l>Drives another out. Frown not, nor be displeas'd;</l>
               <l>What I suggest, is meant but to forewarn.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chru.</speaker>
               <l>What you suggest, is false; is false, <hi>Ulysses.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Beware the Vengeance of an injur'd Lover:</l>
               <l>Not Blasphemy's more hateful to the Gods,</l>
               <l>Than to a Lover is his Faith traduc'd.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Uly.</speaker>
               <l>It may be false, and it may not. 'Tis wise to arm</l>
               <l>'Gainst every Ill that's barely possible.</l>
               <l>You have his Word; the Gods his Oath: he loves you,</l>
               <l>And loves he not the Gods? Both ways engag'd;</l>
               <l>To part, and not to part. But now we saw him</l>
               <l>Doubting and unresolv'd, perplex'd to chuse:</l>
               <l>Who once has doubted, may do so again.</l>
               <l>And why this other Woman? Why <hi>Briseis</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Just at this time, just now, the very moment</l>
               <l>When Fate pronounc'd your parting? Implies it not</l>
               <l>Design of Change? Intention to supply</l>
               <l>The space in Love, that Destiny has doom'd?</l>
               <l>And seems it not to say,—Take, take her, Gods,</l>
               <l>But let me first provide a Successor.</l>
               <l>Love, like an eager Gamester, overlooks;</l>
               <l>But Reason, an impartial stander-by,</l>
               <l>Sees this and more.</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chru.</speaker>
               <l>Reason seems Malice when it comes from thee;</l>
               <l>This might have weight from any other mouth.</l>
               <l>From men professing treachery and deceit,</l>
               <l>Even Truth it self's suspected.—</l>

               <l>The King is just, and you are just to think it:</l>
               <l>Oh 'tis a wondrous proof of strong Esteem,</l>
               <l>Not to mistrust a Friend, though there were ground:</l>
               <l>And here are grounds, weighty appearances;</l>
               <l>I say, in any other man 'twould look suspicious;</l>
               <l>That's all—But sure the King is full of honour.</l>
               <l>Oaths indeed in Love, differ from other Cases;</l>
               <l>They bind, that's true. But as in vanquish'd Towns,</l>
               <l>The Conquer'd to the Conqueror takes an Oath:</l>
               <l>Yet if another comes, of greater Power,</l>
               <l>And drives him out, that former Oath is null'd:</l>
               <l>Nor is it Perjury to swear anew,</l>
               <l>For who can help his Fate: Just so in Love,</l>
               <l>Men swear.—And so observ'd.—'Tis Constancy.</l>
