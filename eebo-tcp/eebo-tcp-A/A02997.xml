            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lmighty God who giueth and preſerueth all Scepters and Crownes, and diſpoſeth of them as ſemeth beſt to his pleaſure, who in his hands holdeth the hartes of kings, hauing miraculouſly guided and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the king to the lawfull ſucceſsion of this Monarchy &amp;c. which was ſtill quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled at, and challenged by certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, ſupported by the capitall and auncient ennemies of France, &amp;c. He was entreated, deſired and aduiſed by the Princes of his bloud, the Officers of his Crowne, the Lordes of his Counſel, and the moſt notable perſonages of his Courts of Parliament to frame himſelfe to his annointing, in like manner as other kinges his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors haue allwayes vſed to procéede to their annointing and coronation, ſoone after their comming to the Crowne: which ſaid annointing is the token of their Royalty and of the publike appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the French nation.</p>
            <p>His Maieſty therefore reſolued to be annoynted, and could haue wiſhed that the ſaid ceremony might haue béene perfourmed in the Church of Rheims, the rather for that of long time, the kinges haue neuer béene other where annoynted but there, albeit they bée no way tyed or bound to the ſayd Church, either to the Archbiſhop of Rheims, as many examples and reaſons doo euidently teſtifie. And his Maieſtie, who ſeeketh to preſerue all the auncient and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtomes of his predeceſſors, and the Realme, could haue beene contented not to breake this, in caſe the Rebells that poſſeſſe the ſame towne, would together therewith, haue giuen him opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to haue béene there annoynted and crowned. Héerevppon for the effecting of the reſolution of his annoynting, it was aduiſed
<pb facs="tcp:23340:3"/>
and determined, that in as much as Rheims was ſtill enclined to perſiſt in her rebellion, the ſame ſhould be perfourmed at our Lady Church in Chartres, a Church famous throughout the whole Realme, as alſo in diuers partes of Chriſtendome: the towne bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituated in place commodious, and as it were in the nauell of thoſe partes of the Realme, from whence his Maieſtie had called the Princes, Lordes, and principall perſonages of his Courtes of Parliament, to be aſſiſtant at this ſolemne ceremony.</p>
            <p>The preparatiues for all thinges neceſſary to the ſayd annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, béeing ſet forward in the ſayd towne and Church, his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty arriued there, vppon Thurſday the ſeauentéenth of February laſt, without any triumphant entry, which the French kinges doo vſe to make, at the towne where they are to bee annoynted, the day before the ſolemnization thereof: but in reſpect that at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the ſayd towne into his Maieſties obedience, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready there made his entry, as alſo that ſince he hath many times gone thether, and there ſoiourned a long tyme together, he now néeded not to doo it agayne.</p>
            <p>Vppon Saterday the nynetéenth of the ſayd moneth, the Holy Voyalt, (ſo tearmed there) preciouſly preſerued in the Abbay of Marmouſtier néere the citty of Tours, euer ſence that miraculou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly it wrought Saint Martins health, was brought to the citty of Chartres, béeing thether conducted, from the auncient dwelling place thereof, by the Lord of Souure, Gouernour and the Kinges Lieuetenant Generall in the land and Duchy of Tourayne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with foure Fryers of the ſayd Abbay, who had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody thereof, And béeing arriued at Chartres, it was there with great ceremony, carried by one of the ſayd Fryers, from the gate of the towne, to Saint Peters Abbay, béeing attended by the Clergy, and a great number of people, the ſtréetes béeing all the way hanged, in honor and reuerence of ſo precious a rellike.</p>
            <p>From the day of his Maieſties arriuall, vntill Saterday the ſixe and twentieth of the ſayd moneth, they finiſhed all the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues for the ceremonies of the annoynting, before begunne. Thether was brought the Imperiall cloſe Crowne, the middle Crowne, the Royall Scepter, the hand of Iuſtice, the cloake
<pb facs="tcp:23340:4"/>
Royall, the Shirt, the Sandalls, the Spurres, the Swoord, the Tunicle, and the Dalmatike, with all other the ornamentes Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, all which were to bée new made, as fayre and ritch as might bée, by reaſon that the fellonious minds of the rebelles had molten, defaced, &amp; waſted the others, which time out of minde had bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the Church of S. Dennis in France to ſerue for the kings annoynting. Howbeit by this particular and ſo execrable a déede, they haue declared that they meant to root out as well the tokens, markes, and ornaments of royalty, as the effect and name thereof. And as moſt accurſedly they found meanes to murther the ſacred perſon and Maieſty of him that before held it, ſo haue they ſence his death diuerſly attempted the like againſt the perſon of him that now holdeth it.</p>
            <p>Vppon Saterday the ſixeteenth of the ſayde moneth about eight of the clocke at night, the king came to the ſayd Church of our Lady, there to doo his deuotions and to be ſhriuen, he would haue heard Euenſong according to the auncient cuſtome, as other kinges did vſe to heare them in the Church appoynted for their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting vpon the Eeue, if the rule of the holy time of Lent could ſo haue permitted: After his prayers deuoutly made, he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Oratory, erected vnder a tent of twoo fadome and a halfe ſquare of purple damaſke, with a border aboue of violet veluet, ſet full of Fleure de Luces, and there was ſhriuen by hys Confeſſor Monſieur Benedict, Curate of Saint Euſtace in Paris, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated biſhop of Troy. After ſhrift, hee returned to his lodging in the Biſhop of Chartres Pallace.</p>
            <p>Furthermore foraſmuch as all the Carpets, Tapiſtry for clothes of Eſtate, for Chayres, Pillowes, Cuſhions and other like kept to ſerue at the ceremony of the kinges annoyntinges, had likewiſe bene ſtollen, pilfered, and purloyned by the rebells, as were the ornaments royall, they were driuen to make new, not ſo ſtately as the former, but ſuch as the ſhortneſſe of tyme, and tyme it ſelfe could permit.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Quier of the ſayd Church, was all decked and hanged with ritch Tapiſtry.</p>
            <p>All before the ſayd Aultar vnto the ſtepp whereupon ſtood the
<pb facs="tcp:23340:4"/>
Holy water ſtocke, was couered with Carpets and aboue and néere to the ſaid high Aulter was ſet and placed the Chaire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Biſhop of Chartres, then ſubrogated in ſtéede of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Duke of Rheims, firſt Péere Eccleſiaſticall was to execute, being couered with a rich Carpet. Where, note that hence foorth throughout this diſcourſe, we will terme the ſaid Lorde Biſhop of Chartres Archbiſhop of Rheims, in reſpect that he tooke his place and executed his Office.</p>
            <p>Ouer againſt the ſaid Chaire, ſome nine or tenne foote behinde, was erected a high Cloth of eſtate of halfe a foote déepe, and two fadome and a halfe ſquare, couered with ritch Tapiſtrye, where was placed an other Chaire richly adorned and couered with a Cloth of eſtate: Alſo betwéene the Kinges Chaire and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops was placed an oratorie Deſke couered with Cloth of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all Damaſked with red leaues, and two Cuſhions of the ſame, whereof the loweſt was ſome fiue quarters long, to ſerue both for his Maieſtie and for the ſaid Lord Archbiſhop, when hee lyeth groueling with his Maieſtie during the Letanie according as by the ceremonie is expedient and hereafter ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Behind the King was there placed a ſtoole couered with blew Satten pouldered with flowers de Luce, whereupon ſhould ſit (as afterward he did) hee that ſupplyed the place of Conſtable: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome thrée foote behinde that, was there an other ſtoole ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as the former, for the Lord Chaunceler. And againe ſome thrée foote behinde that was there an other ſeate ſo couered for the Lords great maſter, great Chamberline, and chiefe Gentleman of the Chamber. And thus were they afterward placed as hereafter ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
            <p>On the right ſide of the high Aulter was there a great ſeate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with Carpets, whereupon were ſet the Péeres Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, except the Archbiſhop of Rheims, who was to be ſometimes at the Aulter, ſometimes elſewhere, according as by the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to execute.</p>

the Counſellers that were of the law, the preſidents and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Courte of Parliament, tranſlated to Tours, whome the King had ſent for to aſſiſt this ceremony.</p>
            <p>In the Biſhops and ordinaries ſeates on the right ſide of the Aulter were placed the Secretaries of eſtate.</p>
            <p>Betwéene the foreſaid formes and the Biſhops ſeate ſtoode the Singing men of the Kings Chappell, among whome were alſo ſome of his Chamber, ready to ſing as time ſhould require.</p>
            <p>On the left ſide of the high Aulter ſtoode an other long forme, furniſhed as that on the right ſide for the Péeres laye.</p>
            <p>Behinde the ſame vpon a little forme cloſe to the Pauillion of the oratorie ſat the Venetian Ambaſſador alone, being the onely Ambaſſadour reſident about his Maieſtie. And in the ſame rowe vpon an other forme ſat the Lord Duke of Montbaſon ſonne to the Lord Prince of Guemene, the Lord of O, and the Lord of Reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laure. The firſt being appointed after the Communion to receiue the Kings Crowne, and to carrie it before him into the hall of the pallace Royal, where the dinner was to be kept: The ſecond to eaſe the King at the offering, at the Communion and at his departure from Church of the Scepter Royall: The third likewiſe of the hand of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>Behind that forme vpon two other formes ſat certaine knights of the holy Ghoſt with other Lords as well of other callings as of the Counſell.</p>
            <p>There were alſo round about the quiere ſcaffolds whereto they aſcended on the out ſide by fower paire of Timber ſtaires.</p>
            <p>Vpon neereſt on the right hand were placed the Ladies, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, Ladies of the Court and ſundry Lords, Gentlemen and Gentlewemen.</p>
            <p>On the ſaide ſide néere the Princeſſes ſtoode my Maiſters of the great Counſell and of the Treaſury, with other notable parſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that then were in the towne both men and women, who were thether admitted by the Captaine of the Guard and the Maſters of the ceremonies.</p>

            <p>The ſayd conuocation ended, the Archbiſhop did riſe out of his chayre, and turned to the High Aultar, from whence hée tooke the cloſe Crowne, and held it ouer the kinges head, without touching the ſame, whereto imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately all the Péeres both temporall and ſpirituall ſet their handes to ſupporte it, and the ſaide Archbiſhop ſayd thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coronet te Deus corona gloriae. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This prayer ended, the ſayd Archbiſhop ſet and placed the Crowne vpon the Kinges head, ſtill ſtaying it with his left hand, whereto all the other Péeres likewiſe ſet their handes, and the Archbiſhop ſaid the prayer following</p>

            </p>
            <p>After the coronation, he ſayd this prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oremus. Deus perpetuitabis &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The bleſsing, <hi>Extendet omnipotens &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Benedic domine &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe prayers finiſhed and ended, the ſaid Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop tooke the king by the ſléeue of his right arme, and the ſayd Lord ſtill held in his handes the Scepter, and the Hand of Iuſtice: and the ſaid Péeres both temporall and Spirituall, were round about the ſaid Lord, and as much as in them lay, did put their handes to the Crowne: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him marched the Lord Conſtable, with the Sworde naked in his hand: then the Lord Chauncelor alone: then the Lord Great Maſter, on his right hand the Lord great Chamberlaine, and on his left, the chiefe Gentleman of his chamber.</p>
            <p>Then did the Archbiſhop bring the king to his throne and High Seate, prepared vpon the ſtage as is aforeſayd, the traine of whoſe cloke royall was carried by the Lord of Saint Luke: and as the king was aboue, and his back turned to the body of the church, the ſaid Archbiſhop ſtill holding of him, ſaid as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sta &amp; retine a modo ſtatum quem huc vſque &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the ſaid Archbiſhop holding the king by the hand cauſed him to ſit downe, ſaying:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In hoc regni ſolio confirmet te &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This prayer ended and the king being ſet in his throne the ſaid Archbiſhop tooke off his Mitre, and after great reuerence and honor by him done to his Maieſty, he kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and then ſayd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vinat rex in aeternum &amp;c,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him all the other Péeres kiſſed him, the Péeres Eccleſiaſticall firſt beginning, ſaying thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23340:12"/>
               <hi>Viuat Rex in aeternum &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the people gaue a great ſhout, crying, God ſaue the king: and immediately the Harguebuzes ſhot off, and after them the great Ordinance, and the Trumpets, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, hautbois, drommes and other inſtruments ſounded, and the ſaid Lord Archbiſhop began.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> béeing accompanied with the Organs and other Muſicke.</p>
            <p>During all this ioy and acclamation, the Herrauldes cryed a Largeſſe, wherevppon were caſt foorth a great number of péeces of Gold and Siluer, ſome mony cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, others coyned purpoſely and marked with the kings picture.</p>
            <p>After the ſayd Lord Archbiſhop had inthronized the king in his ſeat royall, and perfourmed euery thing as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, he went downe and returned to the high Aultar, there to ſolemnize the High Maſſe, and in the meane time, was the kings Ordinary low Maſſe ſaid at the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar prouided vpon the ſtage, at the right hand as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, the Scepter and Hand of Iuſtice béeing layd vpright at each ſide of the ſayd Lords Oratory Deske: And when they came to the Goſpell of the High Maſſe his Maieſty aroſe, and the Prince of Conty, repreſenting the Duke of Burgundy, tooke off his crowne and ſet it vpon the cuſſion that lay vpon the ſayd Deske or leaning pew.</p>
            <p>Here we are to note that ſo often as the king returned neuer ſo little to the body of the church, the people béeing an infinite number, cryed, God ſaue the King. And the church rung with theyr cries, and with Harguebuze ſhot.</p>
            <p>Vpon the top of the ſtayre, on the right hand, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding toward the Quier, vpon the firſt ſtep, ſtood vpright and bare head, the Lord of Rhodes, Great Maſter of the ceremonies, with a ſtaffe in his hand, bending downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: vppon the left ſtayre ſtood the Lord of Surenne

            <p>The Deane of our Lady Church of Chartres red the Epiſtle, and the Abbot of Saint Genoueſe of Paris read the Goſpell, which doone, the Harrouldes firſt came downe from the two ſtaires, then the Lord of Rhodes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him the Archbiſhop Patriarcke of Bourges, the Kings great Amner, apparelled in his pontificals of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let coullour, attended vpon by diuers notable Clergie men, came to the Aulter, where the foreſaid Abbot tooke the booke of the Goſpels and carried it from the ſaid Aulter vp to the ſtage betwéene his hands, the ſaid Archbiſhop of Bourges ſtill following him.

Then came the King enuironed with all his Péeres, bearing the Scepter in his right hand, and the hand of Iuſtice in the left: And there remained at the ſaid throne as it were to kéepe it, the Lord great Chamberline and the chiefe Gentleman of the Chamber.
