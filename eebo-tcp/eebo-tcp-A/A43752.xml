         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>From NEW-GATE,
A
PRISONERS
Juſt Cauſe
PLEADED,
Againſt all his
PERSECUTORS. And let the Witneſſe of God in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
be judge in this matter.</head>
            <p>Firſt, BE it known unto you all, that I with many
more of <hi>the people of God</hi> (called <hi>Quakers</hi>) are
not here upon the Fact of <hi>Felony,</hi> or <hi>Murther,</hi>
or <hi>Whoredom,</hi> or <hi>Drunkenneſſe,</hi> or for <hi>Swearing,</hi>
&amp;c. but for <hi>the freedom of our conſciences</hi> in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Swear,</hi> according to Chriſts Doctrine: and now whether
we are guilty or not guilty in this matter of the breach of a
righteous Law, and ſo deſerving impriſonment or bonds, let
the <hi>Witneſse of God</hi> in the conſcience be judge even in this
matter.</p>
            <p>Again, be it known unto you all, that I with many more
of the People of God before mentioned, did never <hi>Act, Plot</hi>
or <hi>Agitate miſchief</hi> againſt the KING, or any other Perſon
within his Dominion; but we are <hi>peaceable men,</hi> and only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and require our juſt Freedom in the Nation of our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and alſo the exerciſe of our conſciences towards God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96919:2"/>
without moleſtation, and for to be preſerved in peace, as we
are peaceable Subjects of the Nation; We in our ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
pay Cuſtome and Tribute to thoſe in Authority, that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
may not be done unto us; yet, behold, what havock
is made of us? how are our goods ſpoiled, and our bodies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
and many ſick and weak amongſt us, and ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
hereby expoſed to poverty and want, if God take not
a ſpecial care for them? And now whether we or our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
are guilty of ſin and wickedneſs againſt God (in this
matter) let his witneſſe in the conſcience be judge even in this
our cauſe.</p>
            <p>Again, it is well known (to almoſt all) that the KING
before his coming into <hi>England,</hi> whilſt he was yet at <hi>Breda,</hi>
that he gave forth a Declaration there, promiſing <hi>free liberty to
tender conſciences in matters of Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>provided they live
peaceably in the Kingdom,</hi> and this Declaration is revived ſince
his coming to <hi>England.</hi> But ſurely this is made of none
effect, for we can plead guiltleſs, both before God, Angels
and men, that we have not forfeited our liberty therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
by any Act, Plot or agitation againſt the KING, or
any other Perſon within the Dominion of <hi>England;</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
let the Goals in <hi>England</hi> teſtifie what heaps are caſt
into them, and what havock is made of the Innocent that
make conſcience of an <hi>oath.</hi> Aud indeed it is true, beſides all
this (before mentioned) in the Declaration promiſing liberty,
that we had <hi>the word of a King,</hi> even from his own mouth, that
we ſhould not ſuffer for the exerciſe of our conſciences in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alas, alas, what doth this word avail
us now, whilſt the rude multitude are let looſe upon us, yea
inſomuch that it may be truly ſaid, <hi>if God were not on our ſide,
they would ſwallow us up</hi> through their unſatiable deſires. On
this may be taken up as a lamentation over <hi>England</hi> at this
day, that her Rulers ſhould make no more conſcience of their
promiſes and engagements, ſurely the guilt hereof cannot but
lie heavy upon their conſciences: and ſo let the witneſs of
God in all conſciences ariſe, and judge for us in this matter.</p>
            <p>And again conſider, what a lingring Impriſonment we are
in, men and women caſt in by heaps together, and through
the ſtraitneſs of room, they are much thronged together, both
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96919:2"/>
in this Goal and others; and ſundry Perſons of us are weak
and ſickly, and by all outward appearance, if we are thus
continued in ſuch ſtraitneſs, weakneſſes and ſickneſs may
much more abound. And alas, what commiſeration is there in
the hearts of men in Authority towards us; do we not ſee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(as it were) turned into cruelty, even towards them that
never deſerved wrath at their hands? and may we not hereby
in truth conclude with the Prophet of old, <hi>that the beſt of them
is as a briar, and the moſt upright as a thorn hedge,</hi> Mic. 7. 4. Oh
that the witneſs of God in our enemies and perſecutors might
be awakened to plead our innocent cauſe! and this is that
which we wait for, and ſuffer in patience to ſee, even the
wicked ſmitten and wounded in their own hearts, that their
wickedneſs, curelty and perſecution may come to an end;
and Truth, and Equity and Righteouſneſs to be exalted, even
to bear rule in the hearts of both Kings and Princes: Then,
O then rejoyce ye that love righteouſneſſe, when our <hi>Lord
and King</hi> reigns in righteouſneſs in the Kingdoms of men:
Oh bleſſed day ſhall that be called, when Kings raign in the
Dominion of Gods pure, righteous, holy Spirit, then ſhall
the meek of the earth inherit their freedom, and he that is
a peaceable man ſhall have the <hi>praiſe,</hi> and the <hi>terrour</hi> ſhall be to
the evil doer, which never ſhall be renowned. O ſink down,
ſink down to Gods witneſs in your own hearts, which will
bring you into a ſence of your own conditions, and alſo
break the bonds of oppreſſion. Oh let not the cry of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
be alwayes againſt you, <hi>for our God is mighty to ſave his
people, and to deſtroy his enemies:</hi> but if he will not take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
we ſhall freely forgive them; for the Lord our God
hath given us of his Spirit, to bear the contradiction of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
yea all their hard ſpeeches and cruelties, and to ſuffer
long in patience, until the meaſure of their iniquity be fully
finiſhed. And hereby know we, that we are of God, becauſe
he has given us of his Spirit, which leads into unity and peace
with himſelf, and one with another, out of the enmity, wrath,
malice, hatred, revenge and perſecution, which are all works of
darkneſs, and brought forth by the children of darkneſſe; for
we know ſuch as live in theſe things, are not led by Chriſts ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
&amp; ſo are none of his, but againſt him in the enmity; no true
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96919:3"/>
Chriſtians, but of Antichriſt and in the Heatheniſh nature;
and theſe make war againſt the Saints, who follow the Lamb,
who cannot lift up a carnal weapon againſt any man; <hi>yet in
the patient ſuffering under the perſecutor ſhall our victory be obtained.</hi>
But this may be a myſtery to the children of darkneſs; yet
hear a little further, and I ſhall ſhew you, thus it is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
ſuffering of Gods people <hi>ſhall reach to the witneſſe
of God</hi> even in their perſecutors; and when they <hi>ſmite and
wound</hi> the innocent, God ſhall <hi>ſmite and wound them,</hi> even
the wicked in their own hearts; and thus the Lord will fight
our battles, and work freedom and redemption to his people.
Therefore hear, hear and fear the living God of the whole
earth, who is a Spirit, and will judge the wicked in their own
hearts; yea, that is he that convinces the Tranſgreſſor for the
evil of his waies, and he it is that will make himſelf manifeſt
to be <hi>a God near at hand,</hi> though men have been looking, and
ſeeking of him as one afar off, yet our God <hi>is drawing near unto
judgement,</hi> and the wicked ſhall know it, and feel the rod of
his wrath, even in their own hearts; this is the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, whom the Nations, in the ignorance of their minds
make mention of, but are eſtranged from him; and therefore
doth iniquity, tranſgreſſion, abomination, falſe worſhip, and
idolatry abound in this Generation; and this hath grieved
the Spirit of the Lord, who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and will be worſhipped,
reverenced, ſerved, and ſubmitted unto in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being out of this, all their outward obſervations and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings
of aſſemblies, and talking of Church and Church-worſhip
is a practice not acceptable with the Lord, whilſt man
is found out of the ſubjection to him <hi>in the Spirit;</hi> therefore
let none deceive themſelves, the Lord our God will indeed
not be mocked; but ſearch your ſelves, and ſee whom you
yeild ſubjection unto <hi>within,</hi> whether it be unto him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
for ſin, or unto him that leads into ſin? and ſo he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom obedience is yeilded, the ſame is thy God; and the
day is come that people are to be tried and ſearched <hi>within,</hi>
for the Lord requires obedience there, even <hi>in the heart,</hi> that
ſo man may be brought by the leading of his eternal power
and Spirit, out of the darkneſſe, out of the ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
out of the houſe of bondage, yea, to be quickned and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96919:3"/>
made alive unto God again, and here is the <hi>new man</hi> brought
forth <hi>in Gods image,</hi> to glorifie his Maker, to live unto him
and to ſerve him, yea to delight in the way of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements:
But all that are out of this, are excluded out
of the Kingdom, all wicked and envious ones, perſecuters
and murderers, ſwearers and liars, and all that are in the
tranſgreſſion of the pure Law written in the heart, theſe are
ſhut out of Gods Kingdom, whatever their profeſſions are,
names, and words, and fair profeſſions in outward appearance,
cannot adminiſter an entrance into the everlaſting Kingdom
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore now come to that which
is more excellent and acceptable with God, even <hi>the Light and
Spirit in the inward parts,</hi> thereby to be led out of ſin, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
and all the works of darkneſſe, out of wrath, malice,
envy, perſecution, and oppreſſion; for the Light and Spirit
of the Lord leads out of theſe things, into truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
meekneſſe and patience, into unity and peace with
God, and one with another; and theſe are the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that are thus led, and thus purified from uncleanneſſe, by
the Spirit and power of God in the <hi>inward parts;</hi> and here's
the true worſhip of God <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> and here have <hi>the children
of light</hi> that walk in the <hi>light,</hi> fellowſhip with God, and one
with another, in the <hi>light,</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and unto this
muſt the gathering of the Nations be, <hi>for all the Nations of them
that are ſaved, muſt walk in the light of the Lord,</hi> which leads out
of the ſeparation, uncleanneſſe, and deeds of darkneſſe, and
brings back again unto God, into the new and everlaſting
Covenant; and here is the new and living way, wherein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
with God is found.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, This doth the Lord require from you
all, grieve not his Spirit, provoke him not to wrath by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of his Servants, do them no harm; they are as dear to
him as the apple of his eye; therefore oh take heed, let not the
guilt of theſe things lie upon your Conſciences; for we teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
of a truth, whether you will hear or forbear, <hi>that our God
will viſit for theſe things;</hi> and behold, this is the crying ſin that
draws down Gods judgement upon a people, as in the dayes
of old, was it not ſo with the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> who lived in pride and
fulneſſe of bread? This God ſuffered long, but when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96919:4"/>
righteous Lot, this brought his long-ſuffering to an
end, and judgement from heaven was revealed upon them;
and this was an example for all that might follow after, living
in their ungodly converſation that they might take warning
not to perſecute the righteous, leaſt they periſh by the ſame
revelation of the righteous judgement of God. Oh that men
would conſider of the things which belong unto their peace,
before the decree of God be ſealed againſt them unto eternal
condemnation.</p>
            <p>And as for us, who are at this day a perſecuted people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
Righteouſneſſe ſake, for the Name of Chriſt, we have received
the Teſtimony of his Eternal Spirit, <hi>that wrath is not in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us,</hi> though he may ſuffer the enemy to exerciſe cruelty
upon us for a ſeaſon, yet behold the Lot of our inheritance
ſhall not be alwaies here: <hi>Therefore look above all theſe things, ye
children of the Light, ye Sons of Sions King, and Daughters of new
Jeruſalem, which ſhall be gloriouſly ſcituated, even upon the Holy
Mountain, where none ſhall make afraid, and the glory of the Lord
ſhall be upon his people, and with his Righteouſneſſe as with a garment
ſhall they be covered.</hi> Oh the infiniteneſſe of that inviſible glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and eternal inheritance of the Saints, which no mortal eye
can behold! Yet great things hath God revealed unto us by
his Spirit, and he hath ſealed us for his own; Therefore let all
the Saints rejoyce in heart, and bleſſe, and praiſe, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Name, who lives for ever.</p>
            <p>And what if the wicked will be wicked ſtill, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
hate to be reformed, let us leave them to the execution of
the eternal judgement from the Lord our God; yet as we are
moved in tender love to their ſouls, let us warn them to bring
forth fruits meet for Repentance; and ſuch as reject our meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
which is the meſſage of the Lord, their bloud be upon
their own heads; and the day cometh, when this wofull lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſhall be taken up by them, <hi>How have we hated inſtruction
and deſpiſed the day of healing?</hi>

what became of the perſecuting <hi>Sodomites,</hi> who beſet <hi>Lots</hi>
houſe where the Servants of God were, and demanded them
out of his houſe, for to do unto them even as their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hearts were bent; but the Angel of God ſmote theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
with blindneſſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. and moreover the Angel
ſaid unto <hi>Lot, Take thy Wife and thy Daughters &amp;c. and go forth
of the City, for the wickedneſſe thereof is full, and it ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
and <hi>Lot</hi> did accordingly; and Gods judgement was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from heaven in flames of fire upon the <hi>Sodomites, verſ.</hi>
24, 25.</p>
               <p>And conſider King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that great perſecutor and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor
of Gods people, how God plagued him, and his hoſts
of mighty men, becauſe of their grievous oppreſſion of the ſeed
that God had choſen and bleſſed; therefore was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
his mighty men plagued ſeven times, and at laſt an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
came upon them, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt with all
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drowned in the Red ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 27.</p>
               <p>And conſider what became of envious <hi>Haman,</hi> who prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a gallows for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who was more righteous then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And <hi>Haman</hi> incenſed the King againſt <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and gained an order to deſtroy the <hi>Jews</hi> throughout all
his dominion; but the God of heaven gave not licenſe to this,
but confounded their conſpiracies, and turned their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
backward; and <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged upon the gallows
which he built for <hi>Mordecai, Eſth.</hi> 5. 14. And thus Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was revealed upon him, and them that perſecuted thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96919:5"/>
that were more righteous then themſelves, read <hi>Eſter</hi> 3. 4. and
5. Chapters.</p>
               <p>And in the daies of the <hi>Prophets</hi> amongſt the Jews, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
his righteous judgement upon them that perſecuted
about Religion, becauſe they perſecuted the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and juſt
men whom God ſent unto them, therefore Gods wrath was
kindled againſt them, and the judgements written in the Book
came upon them; deſtruction upon deſtruction, they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of their Country, and were captives in a ſtrange land,
their Temple was deſtroyed, and deſolation came upon their
Princely places, and a voice of woe, and miſery, and great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
was heard in all their borders; and this people God
often warned by his Prophets and Servants (as this generation
hath been) before his irrevocable decree came upon them to
utter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And take notice of Gods judgement upon <hi>Herod,</hi> for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
and murthering of the people of God, read <hi>Acts</hi> 12.
<hi>And it came to paſſe that the Angel of God ſmote him, and he was
eaten up of worms.</hi> This hapned unto a perſecuting King, <hi>Acts</hi>
12. 13.</p>
               <p>Theſe examples of Gods judgement may ſerve to warn this
generation, leaſt by their perſecuting of Gods people they draw
down the ſame judgements upon them; for this is that crying
ſin which fills up the meaſure of iniquity, and draws down
Gods righteous judgement upon a rebellious people. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
had a day, and the <hi>Jews</hi> of old had a day of viſitation, before
deſtruction came upon them; but Gods love was not regarded
and his judgement broke forth upon them: And now <hi>England</hi>
hath a day, or a little time before Gods judgment be revealed
unto deſtruction upon all his enemies, except they repent.</p>
