            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If by a <hi>right underſtanding one of another,</hi> you mean <hi>properly, viz.</hi> a calling of every thing by its right name, aggravating nothing, nor looking through multiplying glaſſes upon the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113173:4"/>
of each others oppoſite opinion I am for you, and ſhal call you a man of peace: Or, if you ſpeak <hi>Metonymically,</hi> uſing the <hi>Cauſe</hi> for the <hi>Effect,</hi> and by right underſtanding, mean an incorporation into one opinion; yet if you carry this <hi>impartially,</hi> and beg not the Queſtion, but put them into an equall ballance, reſolving your ſelf, as well as deſiring others to imbrace whatſoever ſhall appeare to be the truth, you do well: But if you will <hi>anticipate</hi> and foreſtall the judgement of your Reader, and nothing will pleaſe you but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to your opinion, what ſingular thing, or what <hi>new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> towards an agreement do you offer more then the rigideſt <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> confident of his own Way, and abounding in his own ſenſe, hath done before you? Certainly, if wee could turn <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> wee queſtion not but the ſtrife were ended: But here were a part worthy of a man of parts, in caſe we cannot be of one minde, to find out a Way of peace and love, and <hi>to move brethren to beare with one another,</hi> as you ſay, contiguouſly with the former, but have little endeavoured it yet, and not a little the contrary.</p>
            <p>Pag. 3. <hi>The honour of the Church,</hi> for which you <hi>profeſſe you contend,</hi> is an unſavory expreſſion, too much ſymbolizing with the ſtile of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as doth the practice of ſome men with theirs alſo. And whereas you ſay [the honour of <hi>that</hi> Church] you ſpeak ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ambiguouſly, and improperly, not determining where, or who <hi>that</hi> Church is, whether in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or elſewhere, or every where, whether <hi>Catholike</hi> or <hi>Nationall,</hi> tell us, that we may honour <hi>it</hi> with you.</p>
            <p>Pag. ead. Some few lines below, where you undertake to reckon <hi>all the undeceiveable marks of the true Church,</hi> ſaying expreſsly, <hi>theſe are all thoſe undeceiveable marks,</hi> &amp;c. Yet having named only three, you eeke them out with an [<hi>all other requiſites</hi>] not naming the reſt, like the Biſhops <hi>Et caetera;</hi> who juggles now?</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay contiguouſly, <hi>From ſuch a Church as hath the Goſpel purely preached and believed, the Sacraments rightly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and in the which there is the true invocation of God and all other requiſites,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there is no juſt ſeparation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, There is a whole <hi>Category</hi> of <hi>Amphibolies</hi> in your ſpeech; For neither by <hi>all the Requiſites,</hi> do you ſay whether you mean <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentialls</hi> or <hi>Integralls:</hi> Nor by <hi>ſeparation,</hi> whether you mean <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and totall</hi> ſeparation, or <hi>partiall;</hi> from <hi>Communion ordinary</hi> or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113173:4"/>
from <hi>all communion;</hi> from <hi>internall</hi> or <hi>externall;</hi> therefore I might juſtly take no notice of this, till you ſpeak plainer; yet to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the world, we give this account and anſwer: An <hi>internall</hi> communion there is, and ought to be acknowledged between all the members of the body <hi>myſticall,</hi> whether they be in bodies <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall</hi> or no: an <hi>externall</hi> communion in all the <hi>common</hi> duties of Religion; as <hi>praying, hearing, conference, admonition,</hi> may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with all Chriſtians, and with all men occaſionally to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: An <hi>externall</hi> communion in <hi>Church-ordinances,</hi> as ſacraments and cenſures, may not be ſubſtracted or withdrawn from a Church right for the <hi>eſſentialls,</hi> as if it were <hi>no Church,</hi> or under ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but as from an <hi>imperfect</hi> Church, if it want <hi>integralls;</hi> or a <hi>corrupt,</hi> if it be <hi>redundant</hi> with <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> &amp;c. ſo it may: Laſtly, an <hi>occaſionall</hi> communion even in the Lords Supper, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with a Church that <hi>walks up to their light,</hi> with whom yet, perhaps, we cannot with comfort ſit down <hi>ordinarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>your Apologie for the non-dedication of your Book, in regard of your ſufferings for your former,</hi> I ſay only this upon it: It was far better with you when you ſuffered <hi>for Presbyterie</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Prelaticall tyranny,</hi> then now, if you would make <hi>others</hi> ſuffer <hi>by Presbytery,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Congregationall</hi> government; only I doubt, in the ſequele of your <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> you will not be found to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> to your book, (as in terms you profeſſe.) If ſo, I hope there will be no quarrell between us; for all wee contend for, is that the <hi>Government</hi> may be <hi>left</hi> where it is <hi>laid</hi> by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Iſai. 9. 6.</note> even <hi>upon his ſhoulders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> which you joyn together, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. ſaying, <hi>You have learned to believe God and Faith upon their word and bond:</hi> I know not what that <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould mean; we ordinarily take <hi>faith</hi> for that <hi>whereby</hi> we believe, and not that <hi>which</hi> we believe: or if you take it ſo (<hi>metonymically objectively</hi>) what is it other then <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>will of God,</hi> which I ſuppoſe you mean the <hi>Word of God?</hi> For God, or his will in its <hi>Eſſence</hi> is not immediately objected to us, but hee reveales his will in his Word; but to the ſubſtance of this boaſt, and that that followes (if there be any ſubſtance in it) if you will <hi>believe God and the ſufficiency of his inſtitutions, without the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humane reaſon and authority, as you do here equivalently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,</hi> you will not be offended at the <hi>Congregationall</hi> Way for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113173:5"/>
that <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> and <hi>deficiency</hi> that is carnally objected againſt it.</p>
            <p>As for that you ſay, <hi>pag. 6. That this is no new opinion of yours,</hi> it is no more then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may ſay for their <hi>Myſterie of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for your <hi>ſufferings for it,</hi> which you boaſt of; alas, <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> are ſubject to the ſame vanity and bondage of corruption as <hi>doings;</hi> yea, and the whole creation are (<hi>i.</hi>) to be applyed to ill things, and graffed with an ill cauſe, though I ſay not it was ill as oppoſing <hi>Prelacie,</hi> or as it was a graduall recidivation from that tyranny.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>acceptance of your endeavours and ſufferings,</hi> in that cauſe, and your <hi>inference</hi> thereupon, <hi>That therefore you ſee no good</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. eadem.</note> 
               <hi>reaſon why a truth then ſhould not be counted a truth now;</hi> You beg the Queſtion: Prove firſt <hi>it was a truth,</hi> otherwiſe 'tis no wonder if that which <hi>ſeemed to be</hi> a truth ſix or ſeven yeers ago, finde not the ſame acknowledgement now, as might be inſtanced in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>Next you come to ſtate the Queſtion, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. and immediately you give that which you call a <hi>ſimile</hi> of it, but if it be, it is 1. a <hi>carnall</hi> one, and I had rather heare, and it would better become a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> man to <hi>compare ſpirituall things with ſpirituall:</hi> for Chriſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 13.</note> muſt not be exacted by the Laſt and Rule of humane or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> the pattern of the Tabernacle in the Mount, he doth not ſend him to take a pattern for it from any<note place="margin">Exod 25. 40. 26. 30.</note> earthly frame or fabrick, though there were far more coſtly and curious, but the Tabernacle was to have, and had a faſhion by it ſelf that differed from all: When we know the true nature of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, of the devices of God, as I may call them, wee may finde a reſemblance of them in things here below, which are made after them, but wee cannot fetch the knowledge of heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures from theſe earthly things.</p>
            <p>2. Yet neither is this <hi>bed</hi> of your <hi>ſimile</hi> large <hi>enough</hi> for the <hi>tall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 28. 20.</note> and <hi>proper</hi> limbs of your <hi>Presbytery</hi> to <hi>ſtretch</hi> themſelves upon: For though the <hi>ſeverall Companies in each city,</hi> as you ſay, (though wee have not many ſuch cities in <hi>England,</hi> except you have more of them in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein there are ſuch <hi>ſeverall Companies</hi> that have all their ſeverall halls, <hi>(e. g.)</hi> Merchant Taylors, Groſſers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for to yeeld the matter of this <hi>ſimile) are not independent,</hi> but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate and combined in a common councell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet there are Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113173:5"/>
as ſmall as theſe Companies in the Kingdome, that are <hi>Independent,</hi> and doe not act in aſſociation or coordination. So that if the Churches in the <hi>Citie</hi> muſt, to hold correſpondence with the forme of Civill Government, be in aſſociation and act in a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> yet this Simile will not carry any ſuch thing to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary underſtanding, that in the <hi>Countrey</hi> (where they live three or foure, or more miles aſunder, and act their Civill affaires inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently) they muſt doe ſo. Nay then, we will argue from the <hi>Simile:</hi> If the <hi>Townes</hi> in the Countrey be independent in their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Government, that is, act ſingly and independently (in reſpect of any other Townes intermedling) their own buſineſſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, as they doe, why ſhould not the <hi>Churches</hi> in thoſe Townes doe ſo too? then at leaſt the Churches in the <hi>Countrey</hi> muſt be exampted from <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 3. I anſwer to your <hi>ſimile,</hi> That as it is ſhorter then that <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as you would be willing to extend it in the <hi>praxis,</hi> may ſtretch it ſelfe upon, ſo it is <hi>abs re,</hi> farre from illuſtrating the ſenſe you intend. For your ſimile in the true reſolution of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes no other then <hi>whether Inferiors may act independent of their Superiors.</hi> For all thoſe appeales, whereof you ſpeake, are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into a <hi>higher</hi> notion, power, and authoritie, (<hi>e. g.</hi>) The Lord Major, Court of Aldermen, and Common Councell, are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to any Company or Companies of the Citie, in <hi>degree</hi> as their <hi>rulers,</hi> or amount to a ſuperioritie in <hi>value</hi> and ſumme, as the <hi>repreſentative</hi> of the Citie, the whole, which is better then any part: therefore your ſimile is not fit for this purpoſe. But now if you would propoſe a proper ſimile, it ſhould be thus; <hi>Whether Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Corporations, equall and coordinate, may not and doe not act their owne proper affaires and concernments independently in reſpect of one another? (i.)</hi> Whether if a Citizen of Merchant-taylors Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, be aggrieved by the carriage of any thing in that Company, he can ſo appeale to the Company of the Stationers, and the Company of the Vintners, and two or three more, or the Heads of theſe, as to ſubject the Company of Merchant-taylors to the juriſdiction and arbitrament of thoſe Companies? for this is the caſe here.</p>
            <p>As ſuppoſe there be <hi>no imparity (i.)</hi> ſuperioritie or inferioritie in the Churches, but all are coordinate, all are one Spouſe to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113173:6"/>
Chriſt, and he intruſts one Congregation as well and as much as another, and gives them as large a ſhare of common intereſt in ſpirituall government, or managing the matters of his Kingdome, one Church as another, and hath made no Common Councell, no Court of Aldermen, no Lord Major in his Church, nor no Officers or diſtinctions anſwering to theſe. And ſuppoſe further, that as neither male nor female, bond nor free, ſo ſuch a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whole and part, have no place in this matter, but Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the quickening Spirit be, as <hi>in all,</hi> ſo <hi>all</hi> in all, and each of theſe particular bodies; and as a <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt went for the ranſome of each particular Beleever, and a whole Chriſt is in every beleever, (as the ſoule <hi>tota in toto</hi>) ſo the <hi>whole and intire glory</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt be intruſted with every particular Congregation, (<hi>i.</hi>) an intire and perfect adminiſtration of all government be committed to them, and the intire <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1. 4.</note> ſpirit of government be in each ſuch Congregation. Suppoſe, I ſay, it be thus (as I conceive it will be found to be,) that each part be to Chriſt as the whole; Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indiviſible, and recollecting his whole ſelfe in himſelfe, and in every part of himſelfe (which the ſpirit of humane power, order, and authority cannot doe) and ſo we cannot weigh Chriſt againſt<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note> Chriſt, Chriſts power againſt Chriſts power, nor many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations againſt one. I ſay, Suppoſe theſe things be ſo, then is it any Queſtion, whether <hi>ſuch</hi> Congregations may act independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? When as wee know that Companies doe act independent of their <hi>fellow</hi>-Companies, and Corporations in the Countries doe act independent of other <hi>neighbour</hi>-Corporations: indeed they act not independently incontroulably of the <hi>higher names</hi> above them; but a Company is not indicted by a Company, a Corporation by a Corporation. Untill therefore you ſhall prove that Churches are not coordinate, or that there are higher names then Churches and Church-<hi>Presbyters,</hi> or that the ſame perſons are in higher place and office in a <hi>Claſſis,</hi> then in their owne <hi>particular ſpheares</hi> and Congregations, (which if it were ſo, then why ſhould they not have ſuteable names, that might import the ſuperiority of the Relation (even as the Common-Councell-Men, though they be Maſters and Members of the ſeverall Companies, yet when joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a Common Councell, they are not called the <hi>Maſters of the Companies</hi> of the Citie, but by a diſtinct name of intereſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

I know wee have ſuch names, as <hi>Claſſes</hi> and <hi>Synods,</hi> adapted and adopted to this <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Hierarchy,</hi> but they being onely <hi>jure humano,</hi> will not paſſe with us for grounds of Authority or ſuperiority in the things that are called by them.</p>
            <p>Next after your <hi>Simile</hi> you come to your <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and to divide your poſition into <hi>foure Branches,</hi> which yet you fall off from again by a digreſſion of ſixteen or ſeventeen pages long, to prove, <hi>viz. That all the Churches we read of in the New Teſtament, were pregnant Churches, or accumulated of many, govern'd by a Common Presbytery:</hi> Which labour you might have ſaved, if you had hopes to make good the <hi>foure Branches</hi> propounded, (two of which are, <hi>That the Mother-Church was ſuch a Church, and ſo govern'd;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>That all other Churches are to be govern'd as that was:</hi>) at leaſt you might have kept this for a <hi>reſerve,</hi> if they had failed. But beſides that, you prove neither part of your Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> Either <hi>that they were aggregated Churches,</hi> or <hi>that the Presbytery to which they were committed, was a joynt Presbytery,</hi> and not each Church to its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, (for thoſe many Scriptures you quote, do neither of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſound ſo, nor for ought I ſee, doe you put ſuch a twang into them:) you commit theſe errors by the way.</p>
            <p>1. You impoſe upon your Reader, without any authoritie or reaſon, that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was an <hi>Independent,</hi> and that was the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell<note place="margin">3 Epiſt. Joh.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> had againſt him; and that his Church was in the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, when as wee have no mention of <hi>his Church</hi> at all, nor of his prating againſt the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> And for the crime obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, of <hi>ſeeking the preheminence,</hi> if the Lord keepe us that the world be never able to charge us with a <hi>likelier</hi> fault, we ſhall not be afraid to make our Accuſers our Judges; Alas, our offence is, that we are <hi>againſt preheminence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. You confidently <hi>exclude the people</hi> from having any hand in the Government, (in which you account <hi>the ſolving of difficulties in doctrine,</hi> as well as other matters to be a part) when yet in the places quoted, eſpecially and moſt expreſly, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 22. the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>the Brethren</hi> and the <hi>whole Church</hi> is ſpoken of, not <hi>in actu ſignato</hi> onely, but <hi>in actu exercito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. You make <hi>the names of Paſtors and Shepheards, when</hi>

               <hi>applyed to Church-Officers, to import that Authoritie, power, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as they doe when applyed to Magiſtrates:</hi> at leaſt you make the <hi>ſymbolizing</hi> of Church-Officers with Civill Magiſtrates in thoſe Names an Argument of communicating with them in ſuch a <hi>kinde</hi> of power as they have, though not the ſame <hi>degree;</hi> but how weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let all men judge.</p>

            </p>
            <p>5. In the ſame page you put ſuch an Objection upon the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents about requiring Miracles, as the condition and qualification of Elders now adayes,</hi> els not to be acknowledged <hi>Elders,</hi> as I am confident the <hi>Congregationall</hi> judgement will not, nor ever did they owne, what ever <hi>ſome other Independents</hi> (for it is a <hi>genericall</hi> name, appliable to whomſoever the inventers of it pleaſe, and <hi>more properly to ſome others,</hi> then they that are commonly called by it) may doe; but that it might be a ſcandall to <hi>all of the Name,</hi> you doe very wiſely, and take the right courſe, not to name the booke or Author, where you finde that Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 29. You <hi>lure</hi> after your reader (who might very well be turning his back upon your diſcourſe) that <hi>now you come in order to prove the foure propoſitions,</hi> but you keepe not this order long. The firſt propoſition is; <hi>That there were many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies in the Church of Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. For the proofe whereof you bring the multitudes of Converts to <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme; <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeruſalem, all of them, and all Judea,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby (ſay you,) <hi>they all became Chriſtians,</hi> or <hi>Members of the Chriſtian Church:</hi> For (ſay you,) <hi>Johns Baptiſme was into Jeſus Chriſt, and the very ſame with that of the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee anſwer to your Reaſon;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme was into Chriſt, but it was <hi>in Chriſtum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riturum,</hi> not <hi>in Chriſtum mortuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To ſay it was the ſame with Chriſts and the Apoſtles, is flat<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 25. Act. 18. 25.</note> contrary to the Aſſertion of <hi>John</hi> himſelfe, and the Apoſtles; <hi>I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you with water</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>but there comes one after me, who ſhall baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Therefore now by <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme they were not all made Chriſtians, no more then the body of the <hi>Jewes</hi> before <hi>John</hi> were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113173:7"/>
turn'd Chriſtians by being baptized in the red Sea, &amp;c. for they were baptized into Chriſt by their Baptiſmes. I deny not but this bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3.</note> of <hi>John</hi> was to prepare men for Chriſt, and did beare a more immediate relation to ſuch a worke, then any Ordinance before, but it did not make them abſolute Chriſtians; It did not abſolve and perfect the new Church, I meane not ſo farre as that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſme was to doe afterwards.</p>
            <p>4. The learned and judicious know, that <hi>John</hi> was but the <hi>Meſſenger before Chriſts face,</hi> and his Baptiſme was but as the<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> ſtreamings of light in the Heavens before the day, and he did one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring and reſtore all things to their <hi>legall</hi> perfection by <hi>water,</hi> the Element of the Law; but Chriſt Jeſus he comes and baptizes with fire, <hi>Conſummates</hi> all things with this transforming power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Element, even his <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. So farre was it that all that were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> were made Chriſtians, that even <hi>Johns</hi> owne Diſciples (who had the beſt and frequenteſt inſtruction,) not onely heſitated, but were downright <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3. 26.</note> ſcandalized at the true Meſſias; and others did under that forme of <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme, fight againſt the true Baptiſme and baptizer the Lord Jeſus: ſo that I conceive this Argument (were it granted that all the people received <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme) will ſtand in little ſtead to prove the Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were made Chriſtians, much leſſe caſt into a Church-mould, according to the New Teſtament forme, and leaſt of all that they were all members of one Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But note an abſurdity in the ſequell of the diſcourſe, where the Doctor having got a multiplying glaſſe in his hand, goes on to make ſtrange diſcoveries of the increaſe of Chriſtian Beleevers, <hi>Pag.</hi> 36. he tells us, That Chriſt made many more Diſciples and beleevers then <hi>John,</hi> and added daily to the Church that was then in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuch as ſhould be ſaved. Here's two Paradoxes. Firſt, That Chriſt made more Diſciples then <hi>John:</hi> Out of whom ſhould he make them, when as <hi>John</hi> had ſwept all along with him, as you affirme before, <hi>pag. 32. med.</hi> not taking it ſynecdochically, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you determine of it here.) Secondly, That Chriſt ſhould adde daily to the Church that was then in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is not this a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous anticipation and miſtake, to apply that which was done by the Diſciples after Chriſts aſcenſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. laſt, unto the Miniſtry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113173:8"/>
of Chriſt himſelfe, and yet in the ſequell you reckon this to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alſo expreſly, <hi>pag.</hi> 56. Judge if here be not falſe Muſters. And let me tell you, you give us occaſion ſhrewdly to ſuſpect your ignorance (to ſay no worſe) to talke of a Church in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> beſides the Nationall Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the life-time of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>And thus farre I have taken notice of moſt of the Materiall <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipienda</hi> in your Booke: I had thought to have beſtowed as much time on the reſt, but that other Conſiderations forbad me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall onely briefly examine the maine Propoſitions that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, omitting the Amplifications and Collaterall Notions that fall in the handling thereof. And ſo I ſhall leave this Propoſition, without taking any further Exceptions to it, or any more paſſages in the aſſerting of it, and the rather, becauſe there are, and thoſe ſo able, already ingaged in the diſpute thereof; and come to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition, <hi>viz. That all theſe Congregations and ſeverall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi>
               <note place="margin">To the ſecond Propoſition.</note> 
               <hi>made up but one Church:</hi> Which Propoſition, except the former ſtand good, is to little purpoſe, as the Doctor foreſeeing is therefore very briefe in the manifeſtation of it, I ſhall not therefore be long in the Examination of it, though in that little compaſſe of lines he gives cauſe of manifold Exceptions. For firſt whereas you ſay, The Brethren themſelves acknowledge, that all the Beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were all members of that Church: If you meane the Church ſpoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 4. I deny, and ſay, it is a groſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and begging of the Queſtion, to ſay, that wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all the Beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be Members of that one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Church, eſpecially if you reckon all <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples and Converts to theſe Beleevers: For as there was a good ſpace of time after there were multitudes of Beleevers, ere there was ſuch a Church, ſo for any thing hath yet been brought to the contrary, it is probable enough that the true Beleevers, (which were not ſo many after you have cut off <hi>Johns</hi> Converts, I meane thoſe that did ſtick in <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, which were multitudes, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Beleevers, which ceaſed to walke with Chriſt, which were not a few, and ſtrangers, which did afterwards diſperſe themſelves into ſeverall Countries) thoſe that did remaine at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did gradually grow up unto Church-fellowſhip. And it amounts to no leſſe then the former begging and preſumption, that which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113173:8"/>
followes, <hi>viz. That this Propoſition is manifeſt out of the Scripture,</hi> viz. <hi>that they that were convented, are ſaid to be added to the Church.</hi> For what if that be to be underſtood of the Church Catholick, and not a particular Church? It may not be denyed, that the word <hi>Church,</hi> is often ſo uſed in the New Teſtament, and it is ſuſpicious that the three thouſand converted at once, were not ſo ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Church-followſhip as converted. As for that which followes, <hi>that they continued in the Churches Communion, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine:</hi> The Doctor hath moulded the Text for his own advantage, and indeed hath falſified it; for 'twas <hi>in the Apoſtles</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 42.</note> 
               <hi>doctrine and fellowſhip,</hi> not in the <hi>Churches</hi> fellowſhip, except you are content it ſhould be underſtood in the communion of the Church <hi>Catholicke,</hi> which is no more then in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in generall: and for ought I know, that is all that is meant there: And tell me any act wherein the multitude of beleevers did communicate, that can beſpeake it neceſſarily to be any more then a Chriſtian Communion in generall, or what Chriſtians may have together, though not of the ſame Church; and the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſays before, <hi>The chiefe publique Ordinance they communicated in was preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the third Aſſertion or Branch, <hi>Pag.</hi> 82. which is, <hi>That the Apoſtles and Presbyters, governed, ordered, and ruled this Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, conſiſting of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, by a Common Councell and Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; Firſt, I am not ſatisfied by any thing hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that that Church conſiſted of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, and that upon the ſcruples before inſtanced.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In aſſerting <hi>that the Presbyters did rule that Church, and ordinarily other Churches,</hi> whom doe you hit? Sure not the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi> as you call them; We grant, 'tis <hi>their</hi> part to rule: but we diſtinguiſh between <hi>Authority and juriſdiction</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>power and intereſt</hi> on the other: this latter belongs to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the other is proper to the Officers, which yet they exerciſe in the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> So they, (<hi>i.</hi>) the Officers ordaine, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, (<hi>i.</hi>) pronounce Excommunication, they <hi>lead</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> in all Government and diſputes, <hi>they have the executive power,</hi> as you demand <hi>pag.</hi> 93.

Rather on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, Chriſt many times writes and directs his Commands to the <hi>Officers,</hi> when they appertaine to the <hi>whole Church,</hi> and are ſo to be underſtood, onely written and ſent to them, as being <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts</hi> of the Churches, by and from whom they are <hi>ex Officio,</hi> to be communicated to the whole.

            <p>For that anticipating aſſertion, <hi>That the Apoſtles ruled this Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aggregate, not by vertue of their Apoſtleſhip, but by vertue of its union.</hi> I ſhall referre it to the next head, <hi>viz. That the Church of Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:113173:9"/>
               <hi>and the government of the ſame, is to be a pattern for all Congregations and Aſſemblies in any city or vicinity to unite into one Church, and for the Officers and Presbyters of thoſe Congregations to govern that Church joyntly in a Colledge or Presbyterie,</hi> which is your fourth and laſt branch of your firſt <hi>Queſtion,</hi> pag. 97.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They are not an example of uniting or aggregation, except it be found that <hi>there were</hi> many churches aggregated, which a very facile and ſwaſible reader may well doubt of, for any thing that hath yet been ſaid to make it good.</p>
            <p>2. If this were granted that many Churches did aggregate and unite <hi>in the beginning,</hi> yet would not this example be <hi>bindingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidentiall:</hi> For as many things were done out of that ordinary courſe that was after ſetled, in the creation, and in a ſingular way by themſelves, as the enlightening of the world <hi>without a Sun,</hi> the watering of the earth <hi>with a miſt</hi> before it rained, the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of fruits <hi>ex tempore;</hi> which things afterwards ceaſed, being digeſted into orderly rules and courſes; ſo might it be in the firſt plantation of churches: Many things might <hi>pro tempore</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, which might not afterwards be continued. <hi>(e. g.)</hi> The Apoſtles did <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>ſerve Tables</hi> at firſt, but afterwards an office was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for that on purpoſe: So ſuppoſe there were in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a <hi>greater</hi> multitude then could meet in one place, and yet all <hi>one</hi> church, and ruled <hi>joyntly</hi> by the Apoſtles and Elders thereof, (which yet wee do not admit) yet could not this from hence be drawne into preſident, becauſe, that howſoever the <hi>Acts</hi> of government which the Apoſtles exerciſed, together with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in and over this Church, were common and <hi>ordinary</hi> and done after the ordinary manner (as the Doctor contends) yet I ſhall make bold to remember him again of that which it ſeemes hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members very well to have been anſwered in this caſe formerly (though he make not ſo good an uſe of it) <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>extent of their power</hi> in the exerciſing of theſe <hi>Acts</hi> there and elſewhere was <hi>extraordinary</hi> as was their perſons and calling to Apoſtleſhip. And we do not ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by this diſtinction, that hee ſhould not know where to have us, for 'tis eaſily apprehended what we ſay is imitable, and what not imitable in theſe Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>And now for that cavill; <hi>That the Apoſtles did not this by vertue of their Apoſtleſhip, but by vertue of the union of thoſe aſſemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:113173:10"/>I anſwer, that in aſſerting it thus <hi>excluſively</hi> of their Apoſtleſhip, you ſuppoſe the Apoſtles to have been the officers ordinary, or at leaſtwiſe extraordinary of this Church of <hi>Jeruſalem only,</hi> and ſo that <hi>they could not elſewhere</hi> exerciſe the like power, or not otherwiſe then by vertue of an <hi>union</hi> of churches, which is no greater prerogative then you will grant to ordinary officers now; and ſo the Apoſtles ſhall have no greater a Commiſſion then we, which is as to ſay, their perſons were no more extraordinary, nor their office, then common <hi>Presbyters</hi> now adayes.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, to abound in the anſwer of this ſame matter, if that many churches in <hi>Jeruſalem did</hi> unite and tranſact their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or <hi>ſome</hi> of them <hi>joyntly,</hi> and that therefore we <hi>may</hi> do ſo, yet it followes not that wee <hi>muſt,</hi> whether we will or no, for this is to urge us <hi>beyond</hi> the pattern. The churches in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (admit) <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, ſpontaneouſly</hi> through the opportunity and advantage of the Apoſtles help, and through the ſtrength of the ſpirit of love and confidence which they had one to, and towards another, and for other good cauſes and conſiderations, <hi>did act</hi> many things (that concern'd the churches) in an aſſociated way, therefore all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, will they nill they, have they the ſame grounds, reaſons and incouragements, yea or no, <hi>muſt</hi> do ſo: Is this good Logick? And that you may not think here is prevarication or <hi>jugling</hi> in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, I for mine owne part muſt ingenuouſly grant and confeſſe, that I am not very ſolicitous concerning the anſwer of this matter; for whether it were ſo, or it were not ſo then, that they did, or did not aſſociate, I think it might be ſo now; I mean, ſome kinde of aggregation and union might be, though wee might tread more confidently, having the ſteps of the Primitive Churches before us, that is, to ſpeak more plainly, <hi>The Churches of Chriſt now, though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of an entire independent Church-power in each body; yet may, when, and where, and with whom, and in what caſes or things God ſhall perſwade them, tranſact ſuch affaires as they ſhall think fit joyntly and ſociouſly; provided, that hereby they deveſt not themſelves of, nor prejudice themſelves in any priviledge of an entire, ſole, and and ſingle adminiſtration, or the like, which Chriſt hath given them, but retain that power of reſuming and recollecting themſelves to themſelves, when they ſhall ſee o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>caſion.</hi> And if the churches in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113173:10"/>
did ſo, wee have cauſe to think this was all they did; and if the Brethren of <hi>Antioch</hi> did appeale (<hi>Asts</hi> 15.) we have cauſe to judge it was a <hi>free and voluntary</hi> appeal, and they were not call'd and compell'd thereto. And that they, and wee in imitation of them, might do this, is no <hi>wave of the ſea,</hi> but ſtands upon this bottome and foundation, <hi>viz. That no priviledge is a hinderance in that thing wherein it is ordained for a priviledge:</hi> and ſo the <hi>intireneſſe of a Congregation</hi> whereby it is able to recollect it ſelf, as having the <hi>whole</hi> ſpirit of government in it, is not to be made a <hi>barre</hi> to a church or churches, that ſhall finde it convenient, and for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to joyn with other churches (where God ſhall knit their hearts reciprocally) in the common tranſaction of ſuch affaires as they ſhall <hi>think fit</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> unto: But this cannot be preſcribed and injoyn'd upon them by man, but is to be done <hi>electively</hi> by them, as flowing indeed, from a ſpeciall love and pleaſure, which thoſe churches take in one another, and beare to one another.</p>
            <p>This we ſay in their <hi>ordinary</hi> affaires they <hi>may</hi> do, we ſpeak not of caſes <hi>extraordinary</hi> for difficulty and moment; wherein, if their own means ſuffice not, they are <hi>bound</hi> to ſeek the help of other Churches.</p>
            <p>Briefly, to ſhut up all, Had we a Collegde of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi> men, wee ſhould make <hi>as much uſe</hi> of them, and reference to them as they did; and were there more churches of <hi>ſuch a temper</hi> and quality as they ought, (that might be the foundation of ſuch a mutuall dearneſſe, pleaſure and confidence) wee might do <hi>more</hi> in this Way of aſſociating then we do; but wee hold it our right, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and priviledge, to do what wee do in this kinde <hi>freely,</hi> and not to be compelled thereto; nor indeed would it be any other then a meere <hi>formall</hi> aſſociation did it ariſe otherwiſe. <hi>Win</hi> us therefore to an aſſociation by the <hi>beauty</hi> of your fellowſhips, and you ſhall not need to <hi>compell</hi> us.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THe ſecond Queſtion which takes up full one third part of his Book, is <hi>of the manner of gathering Churches, and of admitting Members and Officers</hi> propoſed by him: 1.

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:113173:11"/>
The nature in which the things are, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Quere,</hi> incourages mee the rather to do ſomething in them, for that I hope the Doctor wil not be great of his own ſenſe, but take an anſwer of theſe things from thoſe that know the way better then himſelf, who it ſeems, is but a <hi>Caetechumenos</hi> therein. I ſhall here therefore indeavour to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct</hi> him in ſtead of <hi>refuting</hi> him, for as much as to me it ſeemes unmeet, <hi>that a man ſhould be polemically exerciſed before hee be poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Quere</hi> which muſt go but for one, though it be <hi>Legion,</hi> I muſt anſwer to, part by part, as followes: <hi>Whether for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Churches, there be either precept or preſident in the Word of God? A.</hi> Yes; Is not the word a <hi>gathering</hi> ordinance? are not the people thereby invited, yea, compelled to <hi>come in,</hi> and called to<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 23. 1 Ep.

But all this hitherto you would be as ſorry it ſhould once come into queſtion as I: for who or what ſhould be ſaddled for the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but ſuch a like thing as they call a church at leaſt?

I demand therefore further: ought not Church-ſocieties to be <hi>particular, certain,</hi> and <hi>definite,</hi> for as much as that which is <hi>every ones</hi> work, is done by <hi>no body;</hi> and to profeſſe to owe equall and immediate duty <hi>to all,</hi> is both the <hi>way</hi> to perform it to <hi>none,</hi> and a <hi>ſigne</hi> that a man intends ſo?</p>
               <p>But if that that followes muſt be taken for the meaning of this <hi>Quere,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether Preachers and Miniſters of the Goſpel did ever leave their own ordinary charges (to which they are called, and whereto they are fixed with a command not to leave them) and under pretence of a new way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did run about, and alienate the mindes of the people well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected formerly to their ſeverall Miniſters,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, by no means is this warrantable: But I count a vaſt difference between a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Miniſters, going abroad of their own heads, and meerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretences in a ſecret clandeſtine way to get the hearts of men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113173:11"/>
from their ſound and orthodox Teachers, for this was the practice of the falſe <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 17.</note> Apoſtles; and on the other hand, a Miniſter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters going forth with the conſent and approbation of a Church or churches, when, or where Chriſt ſhall make an opportunity, and open a doore for the peaceable, comely and orderly doing thereof, either to vindicate ſome Truthes under reproach and diſgrace through a cloud of ignorance and prejudice hanging over <hi>the eyes</hi> of men; or to diſcover and lay open certain errours or uſurpations wherein Chriſt is injured, and the Saints liberties infringed; and this in a free ingenuous way of preaching and diſpute, offering and commending their Doctrine and Way to the impartiall ſearch and examination of all, both Paſtors and people, (that heare or will heare them) by the Word, and all this not to ſuch an end to breed any diſaffection or alienation between people and their Miniſters, but to make them both free by the truth, that they may both of them know and practice their ſeverall duties, and Chriſt may reap the fruit of it in the honouring of his Name, and themſelves in the comfort of their own ſoules, through obedience and faith. The former is diſhoneſt and abominable, but this is honourable, and a duty for which wee have <hi>Pauls</hi> example, not only by a publique Epiſtle, undeceiving the <hi>Galatians</hi> of that errour they had ſuckt in from men, perhaps, of a worſe quality, but even withſtanding <hi>Peter</hi> (an Apoſtle) to his face, for haking in the matter of circumciſion.</p>
               <p>For the third and laſt diviſion of this <hi>Quere, Whether it was ever heard of in the Apoſtles and Primitive times, that any believing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were in great numbers congregated from among other believing Chriſtians?</hi> I anſwer;</p>
               <p>1. That 'tis well known there hath been, and may be, great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, even in believers themſelves; and ſuch, as that they may need even to be caſt into a new mould, as witneſſe the <hi>Galatians,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle did <hi>travell in birth again, till Chriſt were formed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It will be granted, that believing Chriſtians ſhould deſire and indeavour to be inſtructed in <hi>the whole will of God,</hi> that they may touch <hi>no unclean thing;</hi> and as they know, to be ſtill true to their<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 17.</note> Principles; and if in any thing their Principles exceed or go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others, they muſt not come down to them, although they carry the <hi>Odium</hi> and prejudice of a ſeparation for it, but it is the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113173:12"/>
duty of the others to come to them, which if they will not, liking rather to correſpond with the world, how can it be helpt, or whoſe fault is it?</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Whether for the making any man or woman a member of the Church, it be requiſite and neceſſary (to their believing and being baptized) that they ſhould walke ſome dayes, weeks, moneths, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps yeers with them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who holds it ſo? but only that they appeare to the Church that receives them to be believers, let the means of the churches knowlege, or diſcovery, be what it will, (as it is various) ſo that it be not extraordinary and miraculous, we dare not truſt <hi>Enthuſiaſmes</hi> nor blind <hi>charity.</hi> And to the other part of this <hi>Quere, Whether confeſſion are required,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, confeſſions are good, and may be to edification, but are not abſolutely neceſſary, therefore not inſiſted upon as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of admiſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being of fact and practice, let a briefe account ſuffice.</p>
               <p>For the third <hi>Queſtion, Whether to the admiſſion of any to mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip or office-bearing in a church, the conſent of the congregation or the major part thereof, as well as officers, be requiſite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee hold it yea, and that as well in regard every one takes a <hi>charge</hi> upon him, as in reſpect of <hi>intereſt.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I know not why it ſhould be <hi>more inconvenient</hi> then a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Nationall Covenant,</hi> which the Doctor by Nation is bred to approve highly of. But <hi>neceſſary</hi> we hold it not, therefore not as the condition of admiſſion, ſo that wee ſee cauſe to judge it not to be ſcrupled in a way of <hi>proviſion for an arbitrary libertie</hi> of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and unſetled minde to ſlip the knot, when they diſlike and diſpenſe from dutie and obligation when they pleaſe, but that it be meerly a conſcientious ſcruple, becauſe they ſee not ſufficient ground for it out of the Word to make it neceſſary, yet will <hi>owne a particular tye</hi> and relation for ſpirituall edification, in ſuch caſe who will deny theſe admiſſion?</p>
               <p>For the fifth Queſtion, <hi>Of womens votes whether they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Elections, &amp;c.</hi> I remember a Queſtion once in the Schooles,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113173:12"/>
                  <hi>An Doctoris uxor eodem gaudeat privilegio quo Maritus;</hi> but as for this, of <hi>Womens voting in the Church,</hi> wee have no ſuch cuſtome, nor any of the Churches of God that I know of.</p>
               <p>For the laſt Queſtion or Quarrelſome captious <hi>Quere</hi> rather, <hi>Whether the practice and preaching of all theſe things, &amp;c. be to ſet up Chriſt as King upon his throne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, No Queſtion but the purging and purifying of Church-Ordinances and fellowſhip, which ſome contend for, is to ſet Chriſt upon a higher throne viſible to the world, then by ſome other wayes he is; though wee deny not he may have a throne in many Congregations not of this mould, and may be very highly advanced in the hearts of many of our Brethren, who never yet gave their names to the <hi>Congregationall way.</hi> In relation to whom my prayer is, That if they be in the right, the Lord would make them joyfull inſtruments of inſtructing us with meekneſſe; Or if wee, that the Lord would by us ſhew them his will, who would doe it, and have already received hearts from him to ſubmit to truth, from whomſoever miniſtred to them.</p>
