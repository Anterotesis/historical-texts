            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is by <hi>Authority,</hi> that theſe Tryals are Publiſhed; and exact care has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the <hi>Criminals</hi> may be as fairly uſed in the <hi>Narrative,</hi> as they were at the <hi>Bar;</hi> and how they were there dealt with, let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>It may be noted in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, that of <hi>Four Lives</hi> forfeited to the <hi>Law,</hi> the Kings incomparable Clemency would take but <hi>One:</hi> for (as the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hide,</hi> often, and excellently obſerved) It was only his Majeſties <hi>Mercy</hi> toward the <hi>other three,</hi> to call that a <hi>Miſdemeanour,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> calls <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>next</hi> place may be obſerved, the Tenderneſs of the Court, not only in the large allowances of <hi>Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> to the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> while they were upon their <hi>Tryals,</hi> but in the <hi>Adjournment</hi> of the <hi>Seſſions</hi> from <hi>Saturday</hi> till <hi>Munday,</hi> only for their
<pb facs="tcp:99166:3"/>
ſakes; that they might want nothing, which even they themſelves thought neceſſary for their defence.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly;</hi> It is conſiderable, That the <hi>One half</hi> of the <hi>Jury</hi> were <hi>Book-ſellers</hi> and <hi>Printers,</hi> whoſe Intereſt lay againſt the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> if they had not been Governed by a ſtronger Impulſe of <hi>Loyaltie</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi>

It is, <hi>The Compaſſing and Imagining the Death of the King, to deprive him of his Crown and Royal Government, and to Alter and Change the Antient Legal and Fundamental Government of this Kingdome:</hi> which he has indeavoured to do and did intend to do, by Printing a Traiterous and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Book, which in it ſelf contains as many and as great Treaſons as it was poſſible either for the Malice of the Devil or the Corrupt and Treaſonable thoughts of Blood-thirſty Men to invent; It contains Treaſons againſt the King in his own Royal Perſon; againſt his Government, both Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Civil; full of Treaſons, (as my Lord Chief Juſtice was pleaſed to obſerve to you) Treaſons againſt the Queen, Scandals againſt all manner of Profeſſion both in Church and Kingdom, of Magiſtracy, and Miniſtry: My Lord, there are in this Indictment <hi>Thirteen</hi> Paragraphs of that Treaſonable Book Recited, and each of them contains as many Treaſons, as there be lines in it; nay (My Lord) this Treaſonable Book, it was intended to ſet a Flame in this Nation; to raiſe and ſtir up Rebellion in this Kingdom againſt the King and his Government. I ſhall obſerve to your Lordſhip, the <hi>Time</hi> when it was to be <hi>Printed:</hi> It was in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> your Lordſhip knows, and I do not doubt but the Jury have heard, that there was a great and dangerous deſign in this Nation, ſet on foot by men of dangerous Principles, to Imbroyle this Nation in a <hi>New Warr,</hi> for the deſtruction of the King and his Government; It was Executed in part, as farr as Time and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would give way and leave to the undertakers; (the 12. of <hi>October</hi> laſt) and my Lord, it was proved upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99166:11"/>
there was a Council here in <hi>London,</hi> that ſat to prepare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for an Univerſal Rebellion all <hi>England</hi> over; they ſent their Agitators into the <hi>North, Weſt,</hi> all parts; to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to their Party to be ready to Riſe at a certain time; ſeveral dayes were appointed, but it ſeems they could not be ready till that 12th. of <hi>Octob.</hi> for <hi>the Seditious Books that were to lead on that Deſign, and the Libels and Declarations could not be Printed before that day;</hi> and truely that had been Printed and Publiſhed too, if there had not been great Diligence uſed by the Kings Agents and Miniſters, to take them juſt as they were preparing it. This Book, Gentlemen, doth contain a great deal of Scandal upon the Kings Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſperſing Falſe and Baſe Rumours, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of it. It is a rule in my Lord <hi>Cooke,</hi> that <hi>the diſperſing of falſe and evil Rumours againſt the King and Government; and Libels upon Juſtices of the Kingdom; they are the forerunners of Rebellion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall now go the <hi>proof;</hi> we ſhall prove that this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar, to Print this Book, had two Preſſes in one Roome; that he himſelf did work at one of thoſe Preſſes, his Servants at the other, by his Command and in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: That he did Compoſe part of it. Print the ſheets, Correct the Proofs, and Reviſe them all in his own houſe, which were corrected and brought back into the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe by himſelf, in ſo ſhort a time that they could not be carryed abroad to Correct, ſo that he muſt needs Correct them himſelf: That this Work was done in the Night time, (and it was proper, it was a deed of great darkneſſe and not fit indeed to ſee the light, and it was well it was ſtrangled in the Birth, or elſe for ought I know we might by this time have been wallowing in our blood) We ſhall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this man when Mr. <hi>Le-Strange</hi> came to ſearch his houſe, brake the Forms, conveyed away as many of the Sheets as he could from the Preſſe to other places; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, Gods Providence was ſo great in the thing that he left there three or four ſheets, which Mr. <hi>Le Strange,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99166:11"/>
then ſeized on, and many more within a little time after: And ſomewhat of the ſame matter, remained upon part of a Form of I etter, which his haſt would not give him leave to break; When he was charged with it by Mr. <hi>Le Strange,</hi> he confeſſed that he had printed ſome ſheets of this Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Book, and being demanded by Mr. <hi>Le Strange,</hi> what he thought of it? He told him, he thought <hi>it was mettleſome ſtuff;</hi> he had great joy in it, he confeſſed he had received money for printing of this; and much other matter, taken upon Examination before Mr. <hi>Secretary.</hi> We ſhall call our Witneſſes; I ſhould have obſerved to you, that this man would have it done with all the privacy that could be, and to be done forthwith; there was great haſt of it, about the beginning of <hi>October</hi> and the deſigne in the <hi>North,</hi> was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Twelfth,</hi> ſo that it was clearly intended for that Deſigne.</p>

                  <p>My Lord I do remember that three or four daies or thereabouts before the twelfth of <hi>October</hi> laſt, I had notice of a Preſs that had been at work for ſeveral nights in <hi>Cloth fair,</hi> and imployed a perſon to watch the houſe; who told me that they ſtill gave over early in the morning, at day light, or ſoon after; At length, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was brought me in theſe very words, That <hi>now they were at it as hard as they could drive</hi> (which was about four in the morning) I aroſe, went to one of the Kings Meſſengers, and deſired him to take a Printer by the way, who did ſo, and I call'd up a Conſtable, and ſo went to <hi>Twyns</hi> houſe, where we heard them at work: I knocked a matter of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, and they would not open the door, ſo that I was fain to ſend for a Smith to force it; but they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that, opened the door and let us in; there was a light when we came, but before the door was opened it was put out: when I was got up ſtairs, and a candle lighted, I found a form broken, (that is, the letters diſperſed) only one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it ſtanding intire, which was compared by a Printer that was there, with a corner of a page newly printed, and appear'd to be the ſame; This form was brought down out of the Preſs room into the compoſing room. As yet we could not find the whole Impreſſion, but at laſt they were found thrown down a pair of back ſtairs, (I remember) they told me the Impreſſion was <hi>a thouſand:</hi> I asked him where he had the <hi>copy?</hi> he told me <hi>he knew not: it was brought to him by an unknown hand;</hi> I told him he muſt give an account of it; he told me at laſt <hi>he had it from</hi> Calverts <hi>Maid;</hi> I ask'd him where the copy was, he told me <hi>he could</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99166:29"/>

                  <p>The grand part of the Indictment lies that it was done Maliciouſly, and Seditiouſly, and then it ſaies Knowingly; Though it be granted I did do it, and ſell it, yet it does not follow that I did it Maliciouſly, and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly; I did it in my Trade, we do not uſe to read what we put to Print or Sell; I ſay my Lord, ſelling of Books is our Trade, and for the bare Exerciſing of it, knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

of evil in it, it came out in a time too, when there were no Licenſers, or appointed rules; ſo that what ever was done we are not accountable for, for we read very ſeldome more than the Title; that ſome of the Jury knows, ſo that I hope I cannot be ſaid to do it maliciouſly or knowingly.

                  <p>You of the Jury, you ſee the Indictment is for cauſing a libellous and ſeditious Book to be printed, under ſuch a Title, that is, <hi>The Speeches and Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. It is for cauſing this, ſeditiouſly, factiouſly and wickedly to be printed: and for ſelling and publiſhing it abroad to the Kings people: For the matter of Evidence, you have heard it; I will not repeat the particulars to you, only ſomething to what he has ſaid, that you may not be miſled. Firſt, He ſaies it does not appear, that he did it <hi>maliciouſly</hi> or <hi>knowingly,</hi> there are ſome things that you that are of the Jury are not to expect Evidence for, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99166:30"/>
to know but by the Act it ſelf: malice is conceived in the heart; no man knows it unleſs he declares it. As in Murder; I have malice to a man, no man knows it; I meet this man, and kill him; the Law calls this <hi>malice.</hi> If a man ſpeak ſcandalous words againſt a man in his calling, or trade, he laies his action, <hi>Malice,</hi> though he cannot prove it but by the words themſelves. If I ſay a Printer, or Stationer is an ignorant perſon, has no skill in his Trade, I would not have any man to deal with him, he underſtands not how to Set Letters, or the like: here is nothing of malice at all appears, yet if you bring your Action, you muſt lay it, <hi>Maliciouſly,</hi> it is the deſtroying your Trade, and you will have damages. I inſtance in this particular, that you may ſee there is <hi>malice, ſuppoſed</hi> to a particular <hi>private</hi> perſon in that ſlander, much more to the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>State.</hi> The thing it ſelf, in cauſing a Book to be printed, that is ſo full of ſcandals and lies, to inveigle, miſguide, and deceive the people, this is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Law, <hi>Malice;</hi> though no malice appear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The next is this; <hi>factiouſly, ſeditiouſly, knowingly;</hi> This carries <hi>ſedition,</hi> as well as <hi>malice.</hi> Such a barbarous tranſcendent wretch, that murdered his Prince, without the leaſt colour of Juſtice, to declare that <hi>he rejoyced in his bonds,</hi> and that <hi>the Martyrs would willingly come from Heaven to ſuffer for it:</hi> horrid blaſphemy! <hi>all the Saints that ingaged in it, to wiſh that they had ſealed it with their blood!</hi> what can you have more to incourage and incite the people to the killing of Kings, and murdering their lawful Prince! This they publiſh, and ſay it was ſpoken publickly, let it be upon his own ſoul that did it; for in caſe he did it, no man knew it but thoſe that heard it: But to <hi>publiſh</hi> it all over <hi>England,</hi> (3000, of the firſt Impreſſion, and a ſecond) This is to fill all the Kings Subjects with the juſtification of that horrid murther; I will be bold to ſay, <hi>Not ſo horrid a villany has been done upon the face of the earth, ſince the crucifying</hi>

                     <hi>of our Saviour.</hi> To <hi>Print,</hi> and <hi>publiſh</hi> this, is <hi>Sedition.</hi> The next thing is your <hi>Trade.</hi> I have a Calling to uſe, and I may juſtifie the uſing of it, ſo long as I uſe it lawfully; but that muſt not juſtifie me in all manner of wickedneſs againſt the King, and State. As if a <hi>Lawyer</hi> (I will put it in my own Coat) pleads a mans Cauſe, and againſt the King; this is juſtifiable, he ought to plead for his Client, but he muſt plead as becomes him; if a Lawyer in defence of his Client will ſpeak <hi>Sedition,</hi> do you think he is free from being puniſhed: ſo of a <hi>Printer;</hi> if a Printer prints <hi>ſeditious</hi> and <hi>factious</hi> Books, he muſt look to himſelf; that's no part of his Calling, to poiſon the Kings people; ſo though printing of a Book be lawful, he muſt uſe it as the Law appoints him, and not to incite the people to faction: Writing of Letters, you know it is common and lawful, but if I write Treaſonable Letters, give notice to Riſe, do ſuch and ſuch unlawful acts, I am to be puniſhed for theſe Letters: A Printer he is a publick Agent, he is to do what he is able to anſwer, or elſe he muſt take what follows. He ſaies there was <hi>no Act againſt bim;</hi> It is true, you ſee he is not Indicted upon the <hi>Statute,</hi> but at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> for an offence in the nature of a <hi>Libel.</hi> If I were a Printer and would compile a Pamphlet againſt a man, though not in Authority, and diſparage him, this is the <hi>publiſhing</hi> of a <hi>Libel;</hi> and an offence for which he ought to be Indicted, and puniſhed by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and he that <hi>prints</hi> that <hi>Libel</hi> againſt me as a publick perſon, or againſt me as Sir <hi>Robert Hide;</hi> That Printer, and he that ſets him at work muſt anſwer it, much more when againſt the King, and the State. Another thing is this, he talks to you of <hi>dying mens words;</hi> if men will be ſo vile to be as wicked at their deaths, as they had been in their lives; put the Caſe of that man on <hi>Saturday,</hi> convicted for print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a horrible villainous thing, if he will be ſo unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to himſelf, as to juſtifie this at his death, or to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99166:31"/>
                     <hi>ſpeak</hi> as <hi>bad</hi> as he had cauſed to be printed, is that a Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to <hi>publiſh</hi> them, becauſe they are the words of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man! God forbid; a Robber declares at the Gallows, it is for a Noble Cauſe, for taking a Purſe upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that it is an unjuſt Law to condemn to death for ſuch Crimes: Shall any man publiſh this in Print, and not be lyable to be puniſhed for it?

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury, here is another Bill of Indictment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred againſt <hi>Tho. Brewſter,</hi> it is that contrary to the duty of his Allegiance to his Soveraign Lord the King, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to incite the people to Sedition, and to withdraw them from their natural Allegiance to the King, he hath cauſed to be imprinted, maliciouſly, falſly, and ſcandalou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, a certain ſcandalous book entituled, <hi>The Phoenix,</hi> &amp;c. And this he hath done to diſturb the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to withdraw the people from their Allegiance, and to the ſcandal of his Majeſty and Government, he hath cauſed this book to be Printed, uttered, and ſold, and this we take to be a great offence againſt the King, his Crown, and Dignity. Gentlemen, the diſperſing of Seditious Books is of great danger to the Kingdom; falſe Rumours they are the main incentives that ſtir up the people to Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rebellion, that raiſe diſcontentments among the people, and then preſently they are up in Arms. Diſperſing ſeditious Books is very near a kin to raiſing of Tumults, they are as like as Brother and Siſter; Raiſing of Tumults is the more Maſculine, and Printing and Diſperſing Seditious books, is the Feminine part of every Rebellion. But we ſhall produce our Witneſſes; We ſhall prove that this <hi>Tho. Brewſter cauſed</hi> this book to be <hi>Printed,</hi> that when it was <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> he did <hi>receive</hi> three hundred; that theſe he cauſed to be <hi>ſtiched up;</hi> that he <hi>uttered,</hi> and <hi>ſold</hi> them, part in his own Shop, and part elſewhere. It being an offence of that great and dangerous conſequence, which tends to the diſturbance of the Peace of the Kingdom: I hope you will take it into your ſerious conſideration, and if the matter ſtand proved againſt him, you will give him his due demerit.</p>

Theſe books were Printed before, &amp; ſo they were common enough, and therefore you muſt needs

know what was in them. The third full part was brought to you, and delivered by your appointment; you gave a note how they ſhould be diſpoſed of; and you owned them not in publick.

Firſt, He doth declare, `That the King abuſing his `Power, the people may reſiſt and take up Armes againſt him; that's expreſs Treaſon without any more ado: Then he tells you what a horrid thing it is to break that <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant;</hi> juſtifies the raiſing of Armes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the late King, un-Throning, and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him.

                  <p>Yes, you do! The Printer Swears he was to go Share and Share like; he had his part, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes them to ſome particular Friends; I ſay he Juſtifies this. He tells you in his Defence, that it was commonly printed, that it was done by printed Copie; and that done formerly by Licence; and when things are printed by Licence, they do not expect or need any New, or ſecond Licence; they were commonly ſold aſunder, here they are only printed together: That he ſayes is nothing. What is this but Juſtifying the printing of it? Obſerve, Weigh, and ſee what kind of Defence here is. The Title, what is it? The <hi>Phenix, or Solemn League and Covenant;</hi> you all know it, and rue it; When was it printed? It was when the Wicked Rebels here could not Seduce ſufficient numbers of the Kings Subjects to ſupport their Rebellion, and then they Invite their Dear Brethren (as they called them) the <hi>Scots</hi> to Unite with them. The <hi>Scots</hi> were Cunning, they

                     </hi> in a <hi>League,</hi> and then they conſent to Unite with the Rebels here; This <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> was indeed in defence of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but how long? ſo long as he defended them <hi>(the</hi> Presbytery <hi>and</hi> Scotch Diſcipline) when they had got this Good King into their hands, they put what terms upon him they pleaſed; and then were theſe Seditious Sermons printed. <hi>Douglas</hi> his was printed in <hi>Scotland;</hi> Was it Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed here? No, it was done there, and brought hither. Then for the other Sermon, by what Licence was that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Obſerve the time when it was printed, <hi>was it not to ſet forward Rebellion? to ſet up the</hi> Scotch <hi>Presbytery?</hi> And this in 45. when they were in Arms againſt the King, after the King put himſelf upon his defence, and was at <hi>Oxford;</hi> Do you tell me of the Licenſe of <hi>Rebels?) Then</hi> for your <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification;</hi> Now; when the King is ſo happily returned, now to publiſh theſe things a freſh to the people, that they might do the ſame again!

                  <p>There is nothing of that proved; admit <hi>I</hi> was guilty of it, it was done when there was no Act or Law in being touching Printing. The witneſſes do not ſwear poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that <hi>I</hi> did do it; one ſayes, he did not ſee me, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he only believed it; that he did ſee ſome ſheets upon the line, and they were the ſame for ought he knew; Does not remember the time or place of our diſcourſe, <hi>I</hi> do not know that ever <hi>I</hi> had half an hours diſcourſe with him in my life: <hi>I</hi> never had any meeting with him about any ſuch matter, nor had any converſe with him.

                  <p>You of the Jury, <hi>I</hi> will not ſpend time (it is too late) in repeating the Evidence, you have heard the Evidence particularly, and his anſwer; he doth in part make the ſame anſwer with his fellowes; which was, that it is his Trade: It's true, no doubt but he ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his Wiſe and Children, by his lawful Calling; but if a Thief ſhould tell you that he maintained his Wife by Stealing, is that lawful? Printing books lawfully, no man will call him to account for it; but if he prints that that is abuſive to the King and his Government, that's no part of his trade, and his trade will not bear him out in it: He is charged for Printing and publiſhing of theſe ſcandalous books, that he did it <hi>Knowingly, Maliciouſly, Falſly, Fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly,</hi> and <hi>Seditiouſly; I</hi> told you, that although all theſe things be not proved, yet if he did it, the Law calls it <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Faction,</hi> and <hi>Sedition;</hi> Conſider the circumſtances, you ſee it is done in the dark; the ſheets delivered at his houſe, and diſcourſe about delivery of them, he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them unleſs <hi>Brewſter</hi> and <hi>Calvert</hi> were agreed; <hi>I</hi> leave the Evidence to you, in this caſe, pregnant ſtrong undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Circumſtances, are good Evidences: Though a man doth not come and tell you, he declared to him he knew what was contained in this book, yet if there be ſufficient Evidence to ſatisfie you in your Conſciences, that he knew what was in it, and was privy to the Printing and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; there's enough for you to find the Indictment.
