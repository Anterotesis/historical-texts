            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Reason of this Work.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N that short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance I had with that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, Learned ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Christ, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Vsher,</hi> he was oft from first to last importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to write a directory for the several ranks of Professed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which might distinctly give each one their portion: beginning with the Unconverted, and then proceeding to the babes in Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:59290:5"/>
and then to the strong: and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some special helps against the several sins that they are addicted to. By the suddenness of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at our first congress, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was in his mind before: And I told him, both that it is abundantly done by many alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and that his unacquainted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with my weakness, might make him think me fitter for it then I was. But this did not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, but still he made it his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. I confess I was not moved by his Reasons, nor did I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any great need of doing more then is done in that way: nor that I was likely to do more. And therefore I parted from him without the least purpose to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his desire. But since his death, his words oft came into my mind: and the great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I bore to him, did the more incline me to think with some
<pb facs="tcp:59290:5"/>
complacency of his motion. And having of late intended to write a Family Directory, I began to apprehend how congruously the forementioned work should lead the way; and the several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of mens souls be spoken of, before we come to the several Relations. Hereupon I resolved by Gods assistance to proceed in the order following. First, to speak to the impenitent Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted sinners, who are not yet so much as purposing to Turn, or at least are not setting about the work. And with these I thought a wakening Perswasive was a more necessary means then meer Directions. For Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons suppose men willing to obey them: but the persons that we have first to deal with, are wilful and asleep in sin, and as men that are past feeling, having given themselves over to sin
<pb facs="tcp:59290:6"/>
with greediness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.19. My next work must be for those that have some purposes to Turn and are about the work, to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them for a through and true Conversion, that they miscarry not in the birth. The third part must be Directions for the younger and weaker sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that they may be stablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, built up, and persevere. The fourth part, Directions for lapsed and back-sliding Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for their safe recovery. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these there is intended some short Perswasives and Directions against some spec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al errours of the times, and against some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon killing sins. As for Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Doubting troubled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, that is done already. And the strong I shall not write Directions for; because they are so much taught of God already. And then the last part is intended
<pb facs="tcp:59290:6"/>
more specially for Families as such, Directing the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in their Duties. Some of these are already written: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I shall have life and leisure for the rest, God only knoweth. And therefore I shall publish the several parts by themselves, as I write them: and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are intended for men of different states, and because I would not deter them by the bulk or price, from reading what is written for their benefit. The use that this part is published for, is 1. For Masters and Parents to read often in their Families, if they have servants or children that are yet unconverted. 2. For all such Unconverted persons to read and consider of themselves. 3. For the richer sort that have any pitty on such miserable souls, to give to the unsanctified that need them: (if they have not

The Lord standeth over you, and seeth how you forget him and your latter end, and how light you make of Everlasting things, as men that understand not what they have to do or suffer: He seeth how bold you are in sin, and how fearless of his threatnings, and how careless of your souls, and how the works of Infidels are in your lives, while the

belief of Christians is in your mouths. He seeth the dreadful day at hand, when your sorrows will begin, and you must lament all this with fruitless cries in torment and desperation, and when the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your folly will tear your hearts, if true Conversion now prevent it not; in comparison of your sinful miserable souls, the Lord that better knows your case then you can know it, hath made it our duty to speak to you in his name, (2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.19.) and to tell y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having bought you at so dear a rate as the blood of his Son Iesus Christ, and made you so free and general a promise of pardon, and grace, and everlasting glory, he commandeth as to tender all this to you, as the gift of God, and to intreate you to consider
<pb facs="tcp:59290:10"/>
of the necessity and worth of what he offereth. He seeth and pittieth you, while you are drowned in worldly cares and pleasures, and eagerly following childish toyes, and wasting that short and precious time for a thing of nought, in which you should make ready for an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life: and therefore he hath commanded us to Call after you, and tell you, how you lose your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and are about to lose your souls, and to tell you what greater and better things you might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have, if you would hearken to his Call, (<hi>Isaiah</hi> 55 1, 2.3.) We believe and obey the voice of God; and come to you daily on his message, who hath charged us to preach and be instant with you in season and out of season, and to lift up our voice like a Trumpet, and shew you your transgressions and your sins, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.1. 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. But, wo and alas! to the grief of

our souls, and your own undoing, you stop your ears, you stiffen your necks, you harden your hearts, and break our hearts, and send us back to God with groans to tell him that we have done his message, but can do no good on you, nor scarcely get a sober hearing. O that our eyes were as a fountain of tears, that we might lament our ignorant careless people; that have Christ before them, and pardon, and life, and heaven before them, and have not hearts to know and value them! that might have Christ, and grace, and glory, as well as others, if it were not for their wilful negligence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt! O that the Lord would fill our hearts with more compassion to these miserable souls, that we might cast our selves even at their feet, and follow them to their houses, and speak to them with our <hi>bitter tears:</hi> For long have we preached to many of them as in vain; we study

As soon as Death hath draw this curtain, thou shalt see that which will quickly leave thee speechless. And how quickly will that day and hour come? When thou hast had but a few more merry hours, and but a few more pleasant draughts and morsels, and a little more of the honours or riches of the world, thy portion will be spent, and thy pleasures ended and all is then gone that thou settest thy heart upon; of all that thou soldst thy Saviour and Salvation for, there's nothing left, but the heavy reckoning. As a thief, that sits merrily drinking the money in an Ale-house which he hath stoln, when men are riding in post haste to apprehend him; so is it with you. While you are drowned in cares or fleshly pleasures, and making
<pb facs="tcp:59290:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
merry with your own shame, death is coming in post haste to seize upon you, and carry your souls to such a place and state, as now you little know or think of. Suppose when you are hold and busie in your sin, that a messenger were but coming post from <hi>London</hi> to apprehend you, and take away your lives: though you <hi>saw</hi> him not, yet if you <hi>knew</hi> that he was coming, it would marr your mirth, and you would be thinking of the haste he makes, and hearkning when he knocked as your door: O that you could but see what haste death makes, though yet it have not overtaken you! No post so swift! No messenger more sure! As sure as the Sun will be with you in the morning, though it hath many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and hundred thousand miles to go in the night; so sure will death be quickly with you, and <hi>then</hi> where is your sport and pleasure! <hi>then</hi> will you jest and brave it out!

Oh that you did but know, a <hi>little</hi> know, the certainty, and the glory, and blessedness of that everlasting life, which now you will not set your hearts upon, nor be perswaded first and diligently to seek! (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. &amp; 12.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33.) Did you but know the endless Life with God which, you now neglect, how quickly would you cast away your sin: how quickly would you change your mind and life, your course and company, and turn the stream of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and lay out your care another way? How resolutely would you scorn to yield to such temptations as now deceive you and carry you away? How zealously would you bestir your selves for that most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed life? How earnest would you be with God in Prayer? How diligent in hearing, and learning, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? How serious in meditating on
<pb facs="tcp:59290:16"/>
the Laws of God? <hi>(Psal.</hi> 1.2.) How fearful of sinning in thought, word, or deed? and how careful to please God, and grow in Holiness? O what a changed people you would be! And why should not the certain Word of God be believed by you, and prevail with you, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to you these glorious and eternal things?</p>
            <p>Yea let me tell you, that even here on earth, you little know the difference between the Life which you refuse, and the Life which you choose? The Sanctified are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with God, when you dare scarce think of him, and when you are conversing but with earth and flesh. Their Conversation is in heaven, when you are utter strangers to it, and your belly is your God, and you are minding earthly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19.20. They are seeking after the face of God, when you seek for nothing higher then this world. They
<pb facs="tcp:59290:16"/>
are busily laying out for an endless life, where they shall be equal with the Angels, (<hi>Luke</hi> 20.36.) when you take up with a shadow, and a transitory thing of nought. How low and base is your earthly, fleshly, sinful life, in comparison of the noble spiritual life of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers? Many a time have I looked on such men with grief and pitty, to see them trudge about the world and spend their lives, and care, and labour, for nothing but a little food and rayment, or a little fading pelf, or fleshly pleasure, or aiery honours, as if they had no higher things to mind. What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is there between the lives of these men, and of the beasts that perish, that spend their time in working, and eating, and living but that they may live? You taste not of the inward heavenly pleasures which Believers taste and live upon. I had rather have a little of their
<pb facs="tcp:59290:17"/>
comforts, which the fore-thoughts of their Heavenly inheritance doth afford them, though I had all their Scorns and Sufferings with it, then to have all your pleasures and treacherous Prosperity: I would not have one of your secret gripes and pangs of conscience, and dark and dreadfull thoughts of death, and the Life to come, for all that ever the world hath done for you, or all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I were in your Vnconverted Carnal state, and knew but what I know, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but what I now believe, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks my life would be a foretaste of Hell: How oft should I be thinking of the Terrours of the Lord, and of the dismal day that's hasting on! Sure Death and Hell would be still before me: I should think of them by day, and dream of them by night; I should lie down in fear, and rise in fear, and live in
<pb facs="tcp:59290:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fear, lest death should come before I were Converted. I should have small felicity in any thing that I possessed; and little pleasure in any company, and a little joy in any thing in the world; as long as I knew my se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I should be still afraid of hearing that voice, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20 <hi>[Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee.]</hi> And that fearfull sentence would be written upon my conscience, <hi>Isa.</hi> 48.22. and 57.21. <hi>[There is no Peace saith my God, to the wicked.]</hi> O poor sinners! it is a joyfuller life then this that you might live, if you were but <hi>willing,</hi> but <hi>truly willing</hi> to hearken to Christ and come home to God. You might then draw near to God with boldness and call him your <hi>Father,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably trust him with your souls and bodies. If you look upon <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> you may say, <hi>they are all

mine.</hi> If upon the curse, you may say, <hi>[From this I am delivered!]</hi> When you read the Law, you may see what you are saved from: when you read the Gospel, you may see him that Redeemed you, and see the course of his Love, and holy Life, and sufferings, and trace him in his temptations, tears and blood, in the work of your salvation: You may see death conquered, and Heaven opened, and your Resurrection and Glorification provided for in the Resurrection and Glorification of your Lord. If you look on the Saints, you may say, <hi>[They are my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Companions.]</hi> If on the unsanctified, you may rejoyce to think that you are saved from that state. If you look upon the heavens, the Sun, and Moon, and Stars innumerable, you may think and say, <hi>[My Fathers face is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more glorious: Its higher matters that he hath prepared for

experience, what it was to choose the better part, and to be a sincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Saint. What say you sirs, is not this a more delightfull life to be assured of Salvation, and ready to die, then to live as the ungodly that have their hearts <hi>overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and so that day comes upon them una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares</hi>?

               </gap>6. Might you not live a comfortable life, if once you were made the Heirs of Heaven, and sure to be saved when you leave the world? O look about you then, and think what you do, and cast not away such hopes as these for very nothing. The flesh and world can give you no such Hopes or Comforts.</p>
            <p>And besides all the misery that you bring upon your selves, you are the troublers of others as long as you are Vnconverted. You trouble Magistrates to rule you by their
<pb facs="tcp:59290:19"/>
Laws. You trouble Ministers by resisting the light and guidance which they offer you: Your sin and misery is the greatest grief and trouble to them in the world. You trouble the Common-wealth, and draw the Iudgements of God upon us: Its you that most disturb the holy peace and order of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and hinder our Vnion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and are the shame and trouble of the Churches where you intrude, and of the places where you are. Ah Lord! How heavy and sad a case is this, that even in <hi>England</hi> where the Gospel doth abound, above any other Nation in the world, where Teaching is so plain and common, and all the helps we can desire are at hand; when the sword hath been hewing us, and Iudgement hath run as a fire through the Land; when deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances have relieved us, and so many admirable mercies have engaged us
<pb facs="tcp:59290:20"/>
to God and to the Gospel, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, that yet after all this, our Cities, and Towns, and Countries should abound with multitudes of unsanctified men, and swarm with so much sensuality as everywhere to our grief we see. One would have thought that after all this Light, and all this experience, and all these Iudgements and Mercies of God, the people of this Nation should have joyned together as one man to Turn to the Lord; and should have come to their godly Teachers, and lamented all their former sin, and desired him to joyn with them in publike Humiliation, to confess them openly, and beg pardon of them from the Lord; and should have craved his Instruction for the time to come, and be glad to be Ruled by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within, and the Ministers of Christ without, according to the Word of God. One would think that after such Reason and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

How few are the Families that fear the Lord and enquire at his Word and Ministers, how they should live, and what they should do, and are willing to be taught and ruled, and that heartily look after ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life? And those few that God hath made so happy, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the by-word of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; when we see some live in drunkenness, and some in pride and worldliness, and most of them have little care of their salvation; though
<pb facs="tcp:59290:21"/>
the cause be gross and past all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, yet will they hardly be convinced of their misery, and more hardly recovered and reformed: But when we have done all that we are able to save them from their sins, we leave the most of them as we find them. And if according to the Law of God, we cast them out of the Communion of the Church, when they have obstinately rejected all our admonitions, they rage at us as if we were their enemies, and their hearts are filled with malice against us; and they will sooner set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the Lord, and his Laws and Church, and Ministers, then against their deadly si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. This is the dolefull case of <hi>England.</hi> We have Magistrates that countenance the ways of Godliness; and a happy opportunity for Vnity and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is before us, and faithfull Ministers long to see the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the
<pb facs="tcp:59290:22"/>
Ordinances of God; but the power of sin in our people doth frustrate almost all. Nowhere almost can a faithfull Minister set up the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable Discipline of Christ, or put back the most scandalous impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinners from the Communion of the Church, and participation of the Sacraments, but the most of the people rail at them, and revise them; as if these ignorant careless souls were wiser then their teachers, or then God himself; and fitter to rule the Church then they. And thus in the day of our visitation, when God calls upon us to Reform his Church, though Magistrates seem willing, and faithful Ministers are willing, yet are the multitude of the people still unwilling, and sin hath so blinded them and hardned their hearts, that even in these days of Light and Grace, they are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate enemies of Light and Grace, and will not be brought by the Calls

If he do then sure he careth whether thou <hi>behave thy self as a man.</hi> No man is so foolish as to make any instrument, or build an house, or a ship, and not to care when he hath done, whether it be good for the use he made it for? Do not for shame then impute such folly to the God of Wisdom, as if he made so noble a creature as man, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him with such noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all for nothing; and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not what becometh of him when he hath done. Why should God give thee a mind that can know him; and a heart that can love him, if he cared not whether thou know him, and love him or not? Do you not see that in the course of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ature every thing is fitted to its use? The <hi>beasts</hi> know not God, nor
<pb facs="tcp:59290:24"/>
are capable of loving him, beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se they were made for no such use; but <hi>thy capacity</hi> shews that thou wast made for God, and for a life to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Dost thou think that God is <hi>everywhere present, and infinite, and Al-sufficient?</hi> If not, thou dost not believe that he is God; And it is u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sonable to imagine that God hath made a world that is greater and more extensive or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive then himself: for none can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate more then he hath. But if thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t forced to confess that God is everywhere, and as sufficient for every single m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> confess then that he is not careless of the hearts and wayes of the Sons of men: For they are things that are still before his eyes. It is base and blasphemous thoughts of God, as if he were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, absent or insufficient, that
<pb facs="tcp:59290:24"/>
makes men think him so regardless of their hearts and ways.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Dost thou think that God <hi>careth what becomes of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</hi> Whether thou be sick or well? whether thou live or die? If not, then how comest thou by thy life, and health, and mercies? If they come from any other fountain-tell us from whence; Is it not to God that thou prayest for life and health? Darest thou say to him, <hi>I will not depend upon thee? I will not be beholden to thee for the life and mercies of another day?</hi> If so, then thou art a blinded Atheist. But if thou think God cares for thy body, canst thou think he cares not more for thy soul? If he must regard to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish thee with mercies, he will sure have a regard whether thou Love and Live to him that gave them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Dost thou believe that <hi>God is the Governour of the world or
<pb facs="tcp:59290:25"/>
not?</hi> If not, then there can be <hi>no rightfull Government.</hi> For as no Iustice of Peace can have Power but from the Soveraign, so no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign can have power but from God, nor be a lawful Governour but under him. And then all the world would be turned into confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if thou must needs confess that God is the Governour of the world, what an unwise, unrighteous Governour wouldst thou make him, if thou think that he regardeth not the hearts and ways of those whom he doth govern? This still is but to deny him to be God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If God do not care so much what is in our hearts, or what we do, <hi>Why then would he make a Law for our hearts, and words, and ways?</hi> Would he <hi>command</hi> us that which he doth not care for? Would be so strictly <hi>forb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

holy and obedient, if he care not whether we be holy and obedient or no? would he <hi>threaten</hi> Hell to all that are ungodly, if he care not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we were godly or not? Darest thou say that the Almighty Holy God is fain to rule the world by a Lie, and to deceive men into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Yea the very Law of nature it self doth contain not only <hi>precepts</hi> of our duty, but the Hopes and fears of a Life to come, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thout which the world could not be governed! And certainly they are no deceits, by which are infinite Wisdom, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Goodness doth govern the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If God did not much regard our hearts and lives, why doth <hi>he make all the world to be our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?</hi> Doth he give us Sun, and Moon, and Stars, the earth and all the creatures to attend us, and serve us with their lives and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and yet doth he not care for
<pb facs="tcp:59290:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our hearts or service? This is as foolish as to say, that he hath made all the world in vain, and careth not for it now he hath made it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If he cared not for the frame of our hearts and lives, he would not have <hi>sent his Son to Redeem us,</hi> and to cleanse us from all iniquity, and sanctifie us a peculiar people to himself, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. Surely the price that was paid for sinners, and the wonderful design of God in our Redemption, doth shew that he makes not light of sin, and that he is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in love with holiness.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If God did not regard our hearts and lives, he would not have made it the <hi>office of his Ministers, to call us daily to Repentance and an holy life;</hi> Nor commanded them to make such a stir with sinners to win them unto God; He would not have appointed all his Ordinances, publick and private also to this end. Doth God command all this
<pb facs="tcp:59290:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ado, for a thing that he regards not?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Nor would he <hi>punish</hi> the world with <hi>Hell hereafter,</hi> or so many <hi>dreadful judgements here,</hi> as thousands feel, if he cared not what they think or do? Methinks men that are so often groaning under his rod, should feel that he looks after their hearts and wayes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And how can the <hi>Holy Ghost be our Sanctifier,</hi> if God be so indifferent whether we be clean or unclean? Dare you think that the Holy Ghost doth take upon him a needless work?</p>
            <p n="11">11. Methinks you might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive even in <hi>the malice of the Tempter,</hi> that God is holy, and hateth iniquity, and his Word is true that telleth us of the eternal punishment of sin. This Scripture tells us of the Angels fall, and that many of them are become De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by their sin, and are malicious
<pb facs="tcp:59290:27"/>
enemies of mans salvation. And do you not easily perceive it to be true? How come they else to be such importunate Tempters of men: which we feel, alas, by too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? Or if this evidence be not palpable enough to convince the Infidel, How come they to make so many bargains with Conjurers and Witches, to draw them from God and Salvation, as they have done? How come they to appear in terrible shapes to so many as they have done, and still upon designs that declare their own dejected base Condition, and their enmity to God and man, and their eager desire to engage men in a way of sin? If any Infidel will not believe that really there have been <hi>Witches and Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and consequently that there are Devils who are miserable and malicious spirits; who by sin are cast out of the favour of God, and would draw men into their miserable

case, let them come and reason the case with me, and I shall quickly tell them of so many, sure undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able instances, and give them so much proof of the truth of it, as shall leave them nothing to say against it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>less they will still say, [<hi>We will not believe.</hi>] Yea so much, as that I will not be beholden to the vilest Atheist or Infidel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, if he will not quite renounce his Reason, but give it leave to see the Light.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Lastly, if yet you think that God (the Soveraign Ruler of the world, that is everywhere present and preserveth all) doth care so little what men are, or what they do, whether they are holy or unholy, obedient or disobedient to his Laws, then methinks that you your selves, and all the rest of your fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should little care. Two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions therefore I must here propound to you. 1. Do not you care what
<pb facs="tcp:59290:28"/>
men say of you, or do to you? Are <hi>you</hi> contented that men slander <hi>you</hi> and abase <hi>you,</hi> or set your houses or Towns on fire, or destroy your cattle, or wives and children, and imprison, wound or kill your selves? If you will make a great matter of what men say or do against you, can you be so mad (for it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) as to think that the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Holy God should little regard what's said or done against himself, and against h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s servants, and that by such silly worms as men, that are his workmanship? Did not <hi>selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> make you blind and partial, you would know, that one sin against God, deserves more punishment, then ten thousand thousand times as much, against such silly things as you. Do you make no matter of difference between a bad servant and a good? an obedient, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient child? a Son that would lay down his life for you, and a Son
<pb facs="tcp:59290:28"/>
that longs for your death that he may have your Lands? between a faithful friend and a deadly enemy? If you do <hi>not,</hi> you are not men but something else in humane shape. If you <hi>do,</hi> then you are somewhat worse then men, if yet you would have the Blessed God to make no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between those that love him above all the world, and those that regard him not; between the Holy and unholy soul.</p>
            <p>And 2. I would ask you, Whether you would have the Rulers of the world to take no care what men say or do, or would you not? If not, then you would have all the world turned loose, and you would have every man that is poorer then you, have leave to rob you: and every man that hateth you, have leave to beat you or to kill you: and every man that liketh your house, or lands, or goods, or cattle, to have leave to take them from you; and every man to defile your
<pb facs="tcp:59290:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wives or daughters that hath a mind to it? And so we should see whether it is that Infidelity leads men. But if you like not this, then you are most unreasonable, if you would have Magistrates to be regardful of mens actions, and not God. If Magistrates must <hi>hang</hi> men for wronging <hi>you,</hi> and the Eternal Majesty must not punish them for wronging him, and breaking his Laws, which is infinitely a greater matter. As if you would have a Constable punish men, and the King or Iudge to have no regard of it. For Kings are under God, as Constables are under Kings; and a thousandfold lower.</p>
            <p>The truth is, wicked men are fallen so far from God to themselves, that they are as gods to themselves, in their own esteem, and besides themselves they know no God: and therefore any wrong that is done against <hi>them,</hi> or any good that is
<pb facs="tcp:59290:29"/>
done for <hi>them,</hi> they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; but the wrong and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that is against <hi>God,</hi> they would have nothing made of. And they have such narrow blasphemous thoughts of God, as if he were a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite creature like themselves, that can be but in one place at once; that makes them so blaspheme his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and think he minds not Good or Evil, and will not reward the godly or punish the ungodly; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere like the Idols of the Heathen, that have eyes and see not, ears and hear not, and hands without an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power. But when the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial Book of God is opened, which is written for them that fear the Lord, and think upon his name, and when the Lord shall say of them, <hi>These are mine,</hi> as he is making up his Iewels, and spareth them as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> man spareth his Son that serveth him, then shall (those Infidels) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>turn (to their wits) and the
<pb facs="tcp:59290:30"/>
righteous shall return from their fears and sufferings, and shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between the Righteous and the Wicked, between those that served God, and those that served him <hi>not, Mal.</hi> 3.16 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Another Objection I find most common in the mouths of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, especially of late years. They say, [<hi>We can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God; We cannot have grace if God will not give it us: and if he will, we shall quickly Turn: If he have not predestinated us, and will not Turn us, how can we Turn our selves or be saved? It is not in him that wills, nor in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m that runs;</hi>] And thus they think they are excused.</p>
            <p>I have answered this formerly, and in this book; but let me now say this much. 1. Though you cannot <hi>cure</hi> your selves, you can hurt and poison your selves. Its God that must <hi>sanctifie</hi> your hearts; but who <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59290:30"/>
them? Will you wilfully take Poison because you cannot cure your selves? Me think you should the more forbear it. You should the more take heed of sinning, if you cannot mend what sin doth marr. 2. Though you cannot be converted without the special Grace of God, yet you must know that God giveth this Grace in the use of his holy means which he hath appointed to that end; and common grace may enable you to forbear your gross sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as to the outward act) and to use those means. Can you truly say that you do as much as you are able to do? Are you not able to go by an Ale-house door, or to shut your mouths and keep out the drink; or to forbear the company that hardneth you in sin? Are you not able to go to hear the word, and think of what you heard when you come home, and to consider with your selves of your own condition, and of everlasting
<pb facs="tcp:59290:31"/>
things? Are you not able to read good Books from day to day, at least on the Lords day, and to convers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with those that fear the Lord? You cannot say that you have done what you were able. 3. And therefore you must know that you <hi>can forfeit</hi> the Grace and help of God by your wilful sinning or negligence, though you cannot without Grace turn to God. If you will not do what you can, its just with God to deny you that grace by which you might do more. 4. And for Gods Decrees, you must know that they separate not the end and means, but tie them together. God never decreed to save any but the sanctified, nor to damn any but the unsanctified. God doth as truly Decree from everlasting whether your Land this year shall be barren or fruitful, and just how long you shall live in the world, as he hath Decreed whether you shall be saved or not. And yet you would
<pb facs="tcp:59290:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
think that man but a fool that would forbear plowing and sowing, and say, <hi>If God have Decreed that my ground shall bear corn, it will bear it, whether I plough and sow or not. If God have decreed that I shall live, I shall live, whether I eat or not; but if he have not, it is not eating that will keep me alive.</hi> Do you know how to answer such a man, or do you not? If you <hi>do,</hi> then you know how to answer your selves; for the case is alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods Decree is as peremptory about your bodies, as your souls. If you <hi>do not,</hi> then try first these conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions upon your bodies, before you venture to try them on your souls: see first whether God will keep you alive without food or rayment, and whether he will give you corn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tillage and labour, and whether he will bring you to your journeys and without your travel or carriage: and if you speed well in this, then
<pb facs="tcp:59290:32"/>
try whether he will bring you to heaven without your diligent use of means, and sit down and say, we cannot sanctifie our selves.</p>
            <p>And for the point of <hi>Free-will</hi> which you harp so long upon, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are not so much disagreed about it, as you imagine. <hi>Augustine</hi> as well as <hi>Pelagius, Calvin</hi> as well as <hi>Arminius,</hi> the Dominicans as well as the Iesuits, all do generally maintain that man hath Free-will; but the Orthodox say, that Free-will is corrupted and disposed to evil. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> condemned <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> for saying that man had lost the image of God, and makes it a point of Heresie. And yet one may truly say, <hi>that man hath lost Gods image,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> may truly say that <hi>he hath not lost it.</hi> For there is a twofold image of God on man; the one is <hi>Natural,</hi> and that is, Our <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Free-will,</hi> and this is not lost. The other is <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litative</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59290:32"/>
and <hi>Ethical,</hi> and this is our <hi>Holiness,</hi> and this is lost, and by Grace restored; No man of brains denyeth that man hath a will that's Naturally free; Its free from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and its a self determining Principle. But it is not free from evil Dispositions. It is Habitually averse to God and Holiness, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to earthly fleshly things. It is enslaved by a sinful byas. This no man me thinks that it a Christian should deny; and of the Aged, I see not how an Infidel can deny it. Alas, we easily confess to you, that you have not this Spiritual Moral-Free will, which is but your right Inclination, and your Habitual Willingness it self. If you had a will that were freed from wicked Inclinations, I had no need to write such Books a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this to perswade you to be willing in a case which your own salvation lyeth on. To the grief of our souls, we perceive after all
<pb facs="tcp:59290:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our preaching and perswasions, that the ungodly have not this spiritual free wil. But this is nothing, but your willingness it self, &amp; inclination to be willing, and therefore the want of it is so far from excusing you, that the more you want it (that is, the more you are wilful in sin) the worse you are, and the sorer will be your punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And our preaching and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and your Hearing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, are the appointed means it get this Moral power or Freedom, that is, to make you truly willing.</p>
            <p>Well, Sirs, I have but three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests to you, and I have done. First, that you will seriously read over this small Treatise: (and if you have such as need it in your Families, that you would read it over and over to them: and if those that fear God would go now and then to their ignorant neighbours, and read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:59290:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of winning of souls.) If we cannot intreate so small a Labour of men for their own salvation, as to read such short Instructions as these, they set little by themselves, and will most justly perish. Secondly, when you have read over this Book, I would intreate you to go alone, and ponder a little what you have read, and bethink you, as in the sight of God, whether it be not true, and do not neerly touch your souls, and whether it be not time for you to look about you. And also I intreate you, that you will upon your knees beseech the Lord that he will open your eyes to understand the truth, and turn your hearts to the Love of God, and beg of him all that saving grace that you have so long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and follow it on from day to day, till your hearts be changed. And withall that you will go to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors (that are set over you to take care of the health and safety of your
<pb facs="tcp:59290:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
souls, as Physitians do for the health of your bodies) and desire them to direct you what course to take, and acquaint them with your spiritual estate, that you may have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their Advice, and Ministerial help. Or if you have not a faithful Pastor at home, make use of some other, in so great a need. Thirdly, When by Reading, Consideration, Prayer and Ministerial Advice, you are once acquainted with your sin and misery, with your Duty and Remedy, delay not, but presently forsake your sinful company and courses, and turn to God, and obey his Call. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you love your souls, take heed that you go not on against so loud a Call of God, and against your own knowledge and consciences, lest it go worse with you in the day of Iudgement, then with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Enquire of God, as a man that is willing to know the truth, and not to be a wilful C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:59290:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his soul. Search the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures daily, and see whether these things be so or not: try imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally whether it be safer to trust to Heaven or Earth, and whether it be better follow God or man, the Spirit, or the flesh, and better live in Holiness, or sin; and whether an unsanctified estate be safe for you to abide in one day longer. And when you have found out which is <hi>best,</hi> Resolve accordingly, and make your choice without any more ado. If you will be true to your own souls, and do not love ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting torments, I beseech you as from the Lord, that you will but take this reasonable advices. O what happy Towns and Countreys, and what a happy nation might we have, if we could but perswade our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to agree to such a necessary motion! What joyful men would all faithful: Ministers be, if they could but see their people truly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb facs="tcp:59290:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and holy! This would be the Vnity, the Peace, the Safety, the glory of our Churches: the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our neighbours, and the comfort of our souls. Then how comfortably should we preach Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and Peace to you? and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Sacraments which are the Seals of Peace to you?

himself in those few that are his jewels, and in the little Flock that shall receive the Kingdom, when the most shall reap the misery which they sowed. In nature excellent things are few: The world hath not many Suns or Moons: Its but a little of the earth that's gold or silver. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Nobles are but a small part of the Sons of men. And it is no great number that are Learned, Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or wise here in the world; And therefore if the gate being strait, and the way narrow, there be but few that find salvation, yet God will have his glory and pleasure in those few.

                  <p>Say unto them, As I live saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die O' house of <hi>Israel</hi>?</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been the astonishing wonder of many a man as well as me, to read in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture how <hi>few</hi> will be saved, and that the greatest part
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59290:41"/>
even of those that are <hi>called,</hi> will be everlastingly shut out of the Kingdom of Heaven, and be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Devils in Eternal fire. Infidels believe not this when they read it, and therefore must feel it. Those that do believe it, are forced to cry out with <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God! How unsearchable are his Iudgements, and his waies past finding out</hi>! But nature it self doth teach us all to lay the blame. of evil works upon the doers; and therefore when we see any hainous thing done, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of justice doth provoke us to enquire after him that did it, that the evil of the work may return the evil of shame upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. If we saw a man killed and cut in pieces by the way, we would presently ask, <hi>Oh who did this cruel deed</hi>? If the town were wilfully
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59290:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
set on fire, you would ask, <hi>What wicked wretch did this?</hi> So when we read that the most will be fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of hell for ever, we must needs think with our selves, How comes this to pass? and who is it long of? Who is it that is so cruel as to be the cause of such a thing as this? And we can meet with few that will own the guilt. It is indeed confest by <hi>all</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> is the cause: but that doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the doubt, because he is not the principal cause. He doth not <hi>force</hi> men to sin, but <hi>tempt</hi> them to it, and leave it to their own wills whether they will do it or not. He doth not <hi>carry</hi> men to an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, and force open their mouths, and pour in the drink, nor doth he hold them that they cannot go to Gods service, nor doth he force their hearts from holy thoughts. It lieth therefore between God himself and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59290:42"/>
One of them must needs be the principall cause of all this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, which ever it is: For there is no other to cast it upon; And <hi>God</hi> disclaimeth it. <hi>He</hi> will not take it upon him. And the <hi>wicked</hi> disclaim it usually, and they will not take it upon them. And this is the Controversie that is here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging in my text.</p>
            <p>The Lord complaineth of the <hi>people</hi>; and the <hi>people</hi> think it is long of <hi>God.</hi> The same contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie is handled <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. where <hi>Verse</hi> 25. they plainly say, that <hi>the way of the Lord is not equal,</hi> and God saith, <hi>It is their wayes that are not equal.</hi> So here they say, <hi>Verse</hi> 19. <hi>If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how shall we then live</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As if they should say, If we must die and be miserable, how can we help it? As if it were not long of them, but God. But God in my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59290:42"/>
text doth clear himself of it, and telleth them how they may help it if they will, and perswadeth them to use the means, and if they will not be perswaded, he lets them know that it is long of themselves; and if this will not satisfie them, he will not therefore forbear to punish them: It is <hi>He</hi> that will be the Judge; and he will Judge them according to their wayes; They are no Judges of him or of themselves; as wanting authority, and wisdom, and impartiality: Nor is it their cavilling and quarrelling with God that shall serve their turn, or save them from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice which they murmur at.</p>
            <p>The words of this Verse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, 1. Gods purgation or clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himself from the blame of their Destruction. This he doth, not by disowning his Law, that <hi>the wicked shall die,</hi> nor by disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59290:43"/>
his Judgement and Execution according to that Law; or giving them any hope that the Law shall not be executed; But by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that it is not their death that he takes pleasure in, but their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi> rather, that they may live: And this he confirmeth to them by his Oath. 2. An express Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the wicked to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; wherein God doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Command, but perswade, and condescend also to reason the case with them, Why they will die? The direct end of this Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, That they may Turn and Live. The Secundary or reserved ends, upon supposition that this is not attained, are these two. First to convince them by the means which he used, that it is not long of God if they be miserable. Secondly to convince them from their manifest wilfulness in reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all his commands and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59290:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it is long of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and they die even because they <hi>Will</hi> die.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. IT is the unchangeable Law of God that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men must Turn or Die.</head>
               <p>If you will believe God, believe this: There is but one of these two wayes for every wicked man, either Conversion or Damnation. I know the wicked will hardly be perswaded either of the truth or Equity of this. No wonder if the Guilty quarrel with the Law. Few men are apt to believe that which they would not have to be true: And fewer would have that to be true which they apprehend to be against them. But it is not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with the Law, or with the Judge, that will save the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Believing and regarding the Law might have prevented his death: but denying and accusing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t will but hasten it. If it were not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59290:45"/>
so, an hundred would bring their reasons <hi>against</hi> the Law, for one that would brind his reason <hi>to</hi> the Law: and men would rather choose to give their reasons why <hi>they</hi> should not be punished, then to hear the commands and reasons of their Governours which require them to obey. The Law was not made for you to Judge, but that you might be ruled and Judged by it.</p>
               <p>But if there be any so blind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to venture to question, either the Truth or the Justice of this Law of God, I shall briefly give you that Evidence of both, which not thinks should satisfie a reasonable man.</p>
               <p>And first, if you doubt whether this be the word of God or not, besides an hundred other texts, you may be satisfied by these few. Mat. 18.3. <hi>Verely I say unto you, except ye be converted and become
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59290:45"/>
as little children, ye cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> John 3, 3. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see the Kingdom of God</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>If a man be in Christ, he is a new creature: Old things are past away, behold all thing are become new.</hi> Colos, 3.9.10. <hi>Ye have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Without holiness none shall see God.</hi> Rom. 8.8, 9. <hi>So then they that are in the flesh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not please God. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> Gal. 6.15. <hi>For in Christ Iesus neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but a new creature.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>According to his abundant grace he hath begotten us again to a lively hope.</hi> Verse 23. <hi>Being born
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59290:46"/>
again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.1, 2. <hi>Wherefore lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and evil speakings, as new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> Psalm 9.17. <hi>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi> Psalm 11.5. <hi>And the Lord loveth the righteous, but the wicked his soul hateth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I need not stay to open these Texts which are so plain, so I think I need not add any more of that multitude which speak the like: If thou be a man that dost believe the Word of God: here's already enough to satisfie thee, that the wicked must be converted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. You are already brought so far, that you must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that this is true, or say plainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59290:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you will not believe the Word of God. And if once you be come to that pass, there is but small hopes of you: look to your selves as well as you can; for its like you will not be long out of Hell. You would be ready to flie in the face of him that should give <hi>you</hi> the lie: and yet dare you give the lie to God? But if you tell God plainly you will not believe him, blame him not if he never warn you more, or if he forsake you and give you up as hopeless. For to what purpose should he warn you if you will not believe him? should he send an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you, its seems you would not believe. For an Angel can speak but the Word of God: and if an Angel should bring you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gospel, you are not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, but to hold him accursed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. And surely there is no Angel to be believed before the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59290:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Son of God, who came from the Father to bring us this Doctrine, If he be not to be believed, then all the Angels in heaven are not to be believed. And if you stand on these terms with God, I shall leave you till he deal with you in a more convincing way. God hath a voice that will make you hear. Though he <hi>intreat</hi> you to hear the voice of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> he will <hi>make</hi> you hear the voice of his condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence, without intreaty. We cannot make you <hi>believe</hi> against your wills: but God will make you <hi>feel</hi>

               <p>But let us hear what reason you have, why you will not believe this word of God, which tells us that the wicked must be <hi>Converted or condemned?</hi> I know your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; it is because that you judge it unlikely that God should be so unmerciful: you think it cruelty
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59290:47"/>
to damn men everlastingly for so small a thing as a sinful life. And this leads us up to the second thing, which is to justifie the <hi>Equity</hi> of God in his Laws and Judgements.</p>
               <p>And <hi>first</hi> I think you will not deny but that it is most sutable to an immortal soul, to be ruled by Laws that promise an immortal reward, and threaten an endless punishment. Otherwise the Law should not be suited to the nature of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if there had been no other penalties before the flood, when men lived eight
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59290:48"/>
or nine hundred years, it would not have been sufficient, because men would know that they might have so many hundred years im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity afterward. So is it in our present case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I suppose you will confess that the <hi>promise</hi> of an endless and unconceivable glory is not unsuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the wisdom of God, or the case of man. And why then should you not think so of the <hi>Threatning</hi> of an endless and unspeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery?</p>
               <p n="3">3. When you find it in the Word of God that <hi>so it is,</hi> and <hi>so it will be,</hi> do you think your selves fit to contradict this Word? Will you call your Maker to the Barr? and examine his Word upon the accusation of falshood? will you sit upon him and judge him by the Law of your Conceits? Are you wiser, and better, and righteouser then he? Must the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Must infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom learn of folly? and infinite Goodness be corrected by a swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish sinner, that cannot keep himself an hour clean? Must the Almighty stand at the Bar of a worm? Oh horrid arrogancy of sensless dust! Shall every mole, or cold, or dung-hill, accuse the Sun of darkness, and undertake to illuminate the world? Where were you when the Almighty made these Laws, that he did not call you to his counsel? Surely he made them before you were born, without desiring your advice: and you come into the world too late for to reverse them: if you could have done so great a work, you should have stept out of your Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and have contradicted Christ when he was on earth, or <hi>Moses</hi> before him, or have saved <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. And if the sin of the <hi>Devils</hi> deserved an endless torment, why not also the sin of man?</p>
               <p n="6">6. And me thinks you should perceive, that it is not possible for the best of men, much less for the wicked to be competent Judges of the desert of sin. Alas we are all both blind and partial. You can never know fully the desert of sin, till you fully know the evil of sin; and you can never fully know the <hi>evil</hi> of sin, till you fully know,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59290:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. The Excellency of the <hi>soul</hi> which it deformeth. 2. And the excellency of <hi>holiness</hi> which it doth obliterate. 3. And the reason and excellency of the <hi>Law</hi> which it violateth. And 4. the excellency of the <hi>Glory</hi> which it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise. And 5. the excellency and office of <hi>Reason</hi> which it treadeth down. 6. No nor till you know the infinite Excellency, Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Holiness of that <hi>God</hi> against whom it is committed. When you fully know all these, you shall fully know the desert of sin. Besides, you know that the offendor is too partial to judge the Law, or the proceedings of his Judge. We judge by feeling, which blinds our reason. We see in common worldly things that most men think the cause is right which is their own: and that all is wrong thats done against them: and let the most wise, or just, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59290:50"/>
friends perswade them to the contrary, and its all in vain. There's few children but think the Father is unmerciful, or dealeth hardly with them, if he whip them. There's scarce the vilest swinish wretch, but thinketh the Church doth wrong him if they excommunicate him: Nor scarce a Thief or Murderer that is hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but would accuse the Law and Judge of cruelty, if that would serve turn.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Can you think that an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy</hi> soul is <hi>fit for heaven?</hi> Alas, they cannot <hi>love</hi> God <hi>here,</hi> nor do him any service which he can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. They are <hi>contrary</hi> to God, they <hi>loath</hi> that which he most loveth; and love that which he abhorreth: They are uncapable of that imperfect Communion with him, which his Saints do here partake of. How then can they live in that perfect love of him,

and full delights, and Communion with him, which is the blessedness of heaven? You do not accuse your selves of unmercifulness, if you make not your enemy your bosom Counseller; or if you take not your swine to bed and board with you; no nor if you take away his life, though he never sinned. And yet will you blame the absolute Lord, the most wise and gracious Soveraign of the world if he condemn the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verterted to perpetual misery?</p>

we must preach, and you must hear. It is easier to hear of Hell then feel it. If your necessities did not require it, we would not gall your tender ears with truths that seem so harsh and grievous. Hell would not be so full, if people were but willing to know their case, and to hear and think of it. The reason why so few escape it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they strive not to enter in at the strait gate of Conversion, and to go the narrow way of holines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you will but throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this truth, me thinks the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59290:52"/>
weight of it should force you to remember it; and it should follow you, and give you no rest till you are converted. If you had but once heard this word by the voice of an Angel, <hi>Thou must be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or Condemned; Turn or Die</hi>: would it not stick in your mind, and haunt you night and day, so that in your sinning you would remember it, and at your labour you would remember it, as if the voice were still in your ears, <hi>Turn or Die.</hi> O happy were your souls if it might thus work with you, and never be forgotten, or let you alone, till it have driven home your hearts to God. But if you will cast it out by forgetfulness or unbelief, how can it work to your Conversion and Salvation? But take this with you to yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>O what's the matter then that the hearts of sinners be not pierced with such a weighty truth! A man would think now, that every Unconverted soul that hears these words, should be pricked to the heart, and think with themselves, <hi>This is my own case</hi>; and never be quiet till they found themselves converted. Believe it Sirs, this drowsie careless temper will not last long. Conversion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation are both of them awakening things; and one of them will make you feel ere long. I can foretel it as truly as if I saw it with my eyes, that either Grace or Hell will shortly bring these matters to the quick, and make you say, <hi>What have I done?

               <p>And here you must observe, that in the sense of the Text, a <hi>wicked man,</hi> and a <hi>converted man</hi> are contraries. No man is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that is converted; and no man is a converted man that is wicked: So that to be a wicked man, and to be an unconverted man, is all one. And therefore in opening one we shall open both.</p>

               <p>It pleased the great Creator of the world, to make three sorts of living creatures: <hi>Angels</hi> he made pure Spirits without flesh: and therefore he made them only for Heaven, and not for to dwell on earth. <hi>Bruits</hi> were made flesh without immortal souls: and therefore they were made only for earth and not for Heaven. <hi>Man</hi> is of a middle nature between both, as partaking of both flesh and Spirit; and therefore he was made both for Earth and Heaven. But as his flesh is made to be but a servant to his Spirit, so is he made for earth but as his passage or way to Heaven, and not that this should be his home or happiness. The blessed state that man was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59290:54"/>
made for, was to behold the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majesty of the Lord, and to praise him among his holy Angels; and to love him and be filled with his Love for ever. And as this was the End that man was made for, so God did give him means that were fitted to the attaining of it. These means were principally two. First the right Inclination and Disposition of the mind of man. Secondly the right ordering of his life and practice. For the first, God suited the Disposition of man unto his End; giving him such knowledge of God as was fit for his present state, and an Heart Disposed and Inclined to God, in holy Love. But yet he did not <hi>fix</hi> or <hi>confirm</hi> him in this condition; but having made him a free agent, he left him in the hands of his own free-will. For the second, God did that which belonged to him; that is, he gave man a perfect Law, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59290:55"/>
him to continue in the Love of God, and perfectly to obey him. By the wilful breach of this Law, man did not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his hopes of everlasting life, but also turned his heart from God, and fixed it on these lower fleshly things: and hereby did blot out the spiritual Image of God from his soul. So that man did both fall short of the Glory of God, which was his End, and put himself out of the Way by which he should have attained it; and this both as to the frame of his <hi>heart</hi> and of his <hi>life.</hi> The holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and Love of his soul to God, he lost; and instead of it, he contracted an Inclination and Love to the pleasing of his flesh, or carnal-self by earthly things; growing strange to God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the creature: And the course of his life was suited to the Bent and Inclination of his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59290:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heart: he lived to his carnal self, and not to God: he sought the creature for the pleasing of his flesh, instead of seeking to please the Lord. With this <hi>Nature or Corrupt inclination</hi> we are all now born into the world: For <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Iob</hi> 14.4. As a Lyon hath a fierce and cruel <hi>nature</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth devour; and as an Adder hath a venemous <hi>nature</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sting; so in our very infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we have those sinful <hi>Natures</hi> or <hi>Inclinations</hi> before we think, or speak, or do amiss. And hence springeth all the sin of our lives. And not only so; but when God hath of his mercy provided us a Remedy, even the Lord Jesus Christ to be the Saviour of our souls, and bring us back to God again, we naturally love our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state, and are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59290:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are set against the means of our Recovery; and though custom have taught us to thank Christ for his good will, yet carnal self perswadeth us to refuse his Remedies, and to desire to be excused when we are commanded to take the Medicines which he offereth, and are called to forsake all, and follow him to God and Glory.</p>
               <p>I pray you read over this leaf again and mark it; for in these few words, you have a true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of our natural state; and consequently of a wicked man. For every man that is in this state of corrupted nature, is a wicked man, and in a state of death.</p>
               <p>By this also you are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to understand what it is to be <hi>Converted,</hi> to which end you must further know, That

               <p>But because the Lord knoweth that the heart of man is grown so wicked, that for all this men will not accept of the Remedy, if they be left to themselves, therefore the Holy Ghost hath undertaken it as his office to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire the Apostles, and seal up the Scripture by Miracles and Wonders, and to illuminate and convert the souls of the Elect.</p>
               <p>So that by this much you see that as there are three persons in the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, so each of these persons have their several works, which are eminently ascribed to them.</p>

creatures, by the Law of Nature, and Judge us thereby: And in mercy to provide us a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer when we were lost, and to send his Son, and accept his Ransom.</p>
               <p>The works of the <hi>Son</hi> for us were these, To Ransom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us by his Sufferings and Righteousness; to give out the Promise or Law of Grace, and Rule and Judge the world as their Redeemer, on terms of Grace, and to make intercession for us, that the benefits of his death may be communicated; and to send the Holy Ghost (which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also doth by the Son.) The works of the Holy Ghost for us are these: to indite the Holy Scriptures, by inspiring and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophets and Apostles, and sealing the Word by his Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts and works; and the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating and exciting the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59290:58"/>
Ministers of the Gospel, and so enabling them and helping them to publish that Word: and by the same word Illuminating and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the souls of men. So that as you could not have been <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures,</hi> if the <hi>Father</hi> had not <hi>Created</hi> you, nor have had any <hi>access to God,</hi> if the <hi>Son</hi> had not <hi>Redeemed</hi> you; so neither can you have a <hi>part in Christ,</hi> or be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> do <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi> you.</p>
               <p>So that by this time you may see the several causes of this work. The <hi>Father</hi> sendeth the <hi>Son:</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> Redeemeth us, and maketh the Promise of Grace: the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> inditeth and sealeth this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: the <hi>Apostles</hi> are the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the Spirit, to write it: the <hi>Preachers</hi> of the Gospel do proclaim it, and perswade men to obey it. And the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth make their preaching effectual, by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59290:58"/>
opening the hearts of men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it. And all this to repair the image of God upon the soul: and to set the heart upon God again, and take it off the creature and carnal self, to which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted; and so to turn the current of the life into an heavenly course, which before was earthly: and all this by the entertainment of Christ by Faith, who is the Physitian of the soul.</p>
               <p>By this which I have said, you may see what it is to be <hi>Wicked,</hi> and what it is to be <hi>Converted.</hi> Which I think will be yet plainer to you if I describe them as consisting of their several parts: and for the first, a <hi>wicked man</hi> may be known by these three things.</p>
               <p>First, he is one who placeth his <hi>chief content on earth,</hi> and loveth the creature more then God, and his fleshly prosperity above the heavenly felicity: He savoureth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59290:59"/>
the things of the flesh, but neither discerneth nor savoureth the things of the Spirit: though he will <hi>say,</hi> that Heaven is better then earth, yet doth he not really so esteem it to himself. If he might be sure of earth, he would let go heaven, and had rather stay here, then be removed thither. A life of perfect holiness in the sight of God, and in his love and praises for ever in heaven, doth not find such liking with his heart, as a life of health, and wealth, and honour here upon earth. And though he falsly profess that he loveth God above all, yet indeed he never felt the power of Divine Love within him, but his mind is more set on the world, or fleshly pleasures, then on God. In a word, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Loveth earth above heaven, and fleshly prosperity more than God, is a wicked unconverted man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59290:59"/>On the other side, a <hi>Converted man,</hi> is illuminated to discern the <hi>Loveliness</hi> of God: and so far believeth the Glory that is to be had with God, that his heart is taken up to it, and set more upon it, then on any thing in this world. He had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see the face of God and live in his everlasting love and praises, then have all the wealth or pleasure of this world. He seeth that all things else are vanity; and nothing but God can fill the soul; and therefore let the world go which way it will, he layeth up his treasure and hopes in heaven, and for that he is resolved to let go all. As the fire doth mount up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the Needle that is touched with the load-stone still turneth to the North: so the Converted soul is <hi>enclined</hi> unto God. Nothing else can satisfie him, nor can he find any Content
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59290:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Rest but in his Love. In a word, All that are Converted, do Esteem and Love God beetter then all the world, and the Heavenly felicity is dearer to them then their fleshly prosperity. The proof of what I have said you may find in these places of Scripture, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19, 20, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 23. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.25, 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> a wicked man is one that maketh it the <hi>principal busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his life to prosper in the world,</hi> and attain his fleshly ends. And though he may read; and hear, and do much in the outward duties of Religion, and forbear disgraceful sins, yet this is all but upon the by, and he never makes it the trade and principal business of his life to Please God and attain everlasting glory, but puts off God with the leavings of the world, and gives him no more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59290:60"/>
service then the flesh can spare: for he will not part with all for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, a <hi>Converted</hi> man is one that makes it the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal care and business of his life to Please God,</hi> and to be saved, and takes all the blessings of this life but as accommodations in his journey towards another life; and useth the creature in subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto God: he <hi>loveth</hi> an holy life, and longeth to be <hi>more</hi> holy: he hath no sin but what he hateth, and longeth, and prayeth, and striveth to be rid of. The drift and bent of his life is for God; and if he sin, it is contrary to the very bent of his heart and life, and therefore he riseth again, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth it, and dare not wilfully live in any known sin. There is nothing in this world so dear to him, but he can give it up to God, and forsake it for him and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59290:61"/>
hopes of glory. All this you may see in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33, 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.22, 23, 29. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.18, 24, 26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the soul of a wicked man did never truly discern and relish the mystery of Redemption, nor thankfully entertain an offered Saviour, nor is he taken up with the love of the Redeemer, not willing to be ruled by him as the Physitian of his soul, that he may be saved from the guilt and power of his sins, and recovered unto God: but his heart is insensible of this unspeakable benefit, and is quite against the healing means by which he should be recovered. Though he may be willing to be <hi>carnally</hi> Religious, yet he never resigneth up his soul to Christ, and to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conduct of his Word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the <hi>Converted</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59290:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
soul having felt himself undone by sin, and perceiving that he hath lost his peace with God, and hopes of heaven, and is in danger of everlasting misery, doth thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully entertain the tidings of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and believing in the Lord Jesus as his only Saviour, resigneth up himself to him for wisdom, righteousness, sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redemption. He taketh Christ as the Life of his soul, and liveth by him, and useth him as his salve for every sore, admiring the wisdom and Love of God in this wonderful work of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. In a word, Christ doth even dwell in his heart by faith, and the life that he now liveth is by the Faith of the Son of God, that hath loved him and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for him. Yea it is not so much he that liveth, as Christ in him. For these, see <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.11, 12. &amp; 3.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59290:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
8, 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15 2, 3.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p>YOU see now in plain terms from the Word of God, who are the wicked, and who are the Converted. Ignorant people think that if a man be no swearer, not curser, nor rayler, nor drunkard, nor fornicator, nor extortioner, nor wrong any body in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and if they come to Church, and say their prayers, these cannot be wicked men. Or if a man that hath been guilty of drunkenness, or swearing, or gameing or the like vices, do but forbear them for the time to come, they think that this is a Converted man. Others think, if a man that hath been an enemy and scorner at godliness, do but approve it, and joyn himself with those that are godly, and be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59290:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hated for it by the wicked as the godly are, that this must needs be a Converted man. And some are so foolish as to think they are Converted, by taking up some new and false opinion, and falling into some dividing party, as Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Quakers, Papists, or such like. And some think, if they have but been affrighted by the fears of Hell, and had Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Gripes of Conscience, and thereupon have purposed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised amendment, and taken up a life of Civil behavour, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Religion, that this must needs be true Conversion. And these are the poor deluded souls that are like to lose the benefit of all our perswasions; and when they hear that the wicked must <hi>Turn</hi> or <hi>Die,</hi> they think that this is not spoken to them, for they are not <hi>wicked,</hi> but are <hi>Turned</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And therefore it is that Christ
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59290:63"/>
told some of the Rulers of the Jews, who were graver and civiler then the common people, that <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Harlots do go into the Kingdom of God before them, Mat.</hi> 21.31. Not that an harlot or gross sinner can be saved without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; but because it was easier to make these gross sinners per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their sin and misery, and the necessity of a change, when the civiler sort do delude themselves by thinking that they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted already, when they be not.</p>
               <p>O Sirs, Conversion is another kind of work then most are ware of: Its not a small matter to bring an Earthly mind to Heaven, and to shew man the amiable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, till he be taken up in such Love to him, that never can be quenched; to break the heart for sin, and make him flie forre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge unto Christ, and thankfully
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59290:63"/>
embrace him as the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe of his soul, to have the very drift and bent of the heart and life to be changed, so that a man renounceth that which he took for his felicity, and placeth his felicity where he never did before, and liveth not to the same end, and driveth not on the same design in the world, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he did: in a word, he that is in Christ, is a <hi>new creature; old things are past away, behold all things are become new,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. He hath a new understanding, a new will and resolution, new sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and desires, and love, and delight, new thoughts, new spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, new company (if possible) and a new conversation. Sin that before was a jesting matter with him, is now so odious and terrible to him, that he flies from it as from death. The world that was so lovely in his eyes, doth now appear but as vanity and vexation: God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59290:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that was before neglected, is now the only Happiness of his soul; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was forgotten, and every lust preferred before him; but now he is set next the heart, and all things must give place to him: and the heart is taken up in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and observance of him: and is grieved when he hides his face, and never thinks it self well without him. Christ himself that was wont to be slightly thought of, is now his only hope and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and he liveth upon him as on his daily bread; he cannot pray without him, nor rejoyce without him, nor think, nor speak, nor live without him. Heaven it self that before was lookt upon but as a tolerable reserve, which he hoped might serve turn as better then hell, when he could not stay any longer in the world, is now taken for his home, the place of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hope and Rest, where he shall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59290:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
See, and Love, and Praise that God that hath his heart already. Hell that before did seem but as a bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to frighten men from sin, doth now appear to be a real misery, that is not to be ventured on, nor jested with. The works of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness which before he was weary of, and seemed to be more ado then needs, are now both his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and his business, and the trade that he lives upon. The Bible which was before to him but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as a common book, is now as the Law of God, as a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to him from heaven, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed with the name of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Majesty</hi>; it is the Rule of his thoughts, and words, and deeds; the commands are binding, the threats are dreadful, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of it speak life to his soul. The godly that seemed to him but like other men, are now the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest and happyest on earth. And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59290:65"/>
the wicked that were his play-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are now his grief: and he that could laugh at their sin, is readyer now to weep for their sin and misery, <hi>Psalm</hi> 16.3. &amp; 15.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. In short, he hath a New End in his thoughts, and a New Way in his endeavours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Heart and life is New. Before his <hi>Carnal Self</hi> was his <hi>End</hi>; and his pleasure, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profits, and Credit were his Way: and now God and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory is his <hi>End</hi>: and Christ, and the Spirit, and Word, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Holiness to God, and Righteousness and Mercy to men, these are his <hi>Way.</hi> Before <hi>Self</hi> was the chief Ruler, to which the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God and Conscience must stoop and give place: and now God in Christ, by the Spirit, Word, and Ministry is the chief Ruler, to whom both <hi>Self,</hi> and all the matters of <hi>Self</hi> must give place.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59290:65"/>
So that this is not a change in one or two, or twenty points; but in the whole soul: and the very end and Bent of the Conversation. A man may step out of one path into another, and yet have his face the same way, and be still going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same place: but tis ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter to turn quite back again, and take his journey the clean contrary way to a contrary place. So it is here. A man may turn from drunkenness to thrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and forsake his good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and other gross disgraceful sins, and set upon some duties of Religion, and yet be going still to the same End as before, intending his carnal <hi>Self</hi> above all, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it still the Government of his soul. But when he is Converted, this <hi>Self</hi> is denyed and taken down, and God is set up, and his face is turned the contrary way: and he that before was addicted to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59290:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himself, and lived to himself, is now by Sanctification devoted to God, and liveth unto God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he asketh <hi>himself,</hi> what he should do with his time, his parts, and his estate; and for himself he used them: but now he asketh God what he shall do with them, and he useth them for him. Before he would Please God so far as might stand with the Pleasure of his flesh, and Carnal <hi>Self,</hi> but not to any great displeasure of them. But now he will please God, let <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> be never so much displeasd. This is the great change that God will make upon all that shall be saved.</p>
               <p>You can say, that the Holy-Ghost is your <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> but do you know what <hi>Sanctification is</hi>? Why this is it that I have now opened to you: and every man and woman in the world must have this, or be condemned to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59290:66"/>
misery. They must <hi>Turn or Dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you believe all this Sirs, or do you not? Surely you dare not say you do not: For tis past doubt or denyal: These are not Controversies, where one learned pious man is of one mind, and another of another: where one party saith this, and the other saith that: Papists, and Aanbaptists, and every Sect among us that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be called Christians, are all agreed in this that I have said: and if you will not believe the God of Truth, and that in a case where <hi>every</hi> sect and party do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, you are utterly unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.</p>
               <p>But if you do believe this, how comes it to pass that you live so quietly in an unconverted state? Do you know that you are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? and can you find this wonderful change upon your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59290:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
souls? Have you been thus born again and made anew? Be not these strange matters to many of you? and such as you never felt upon your selves? If you cannot tell the day or the week of your change, or the very Sermon that Converted you, yet do you find that the work is done? and such a change indeed there is? and that you have such hearts as are before described? Alas, the most do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their worldly business, and little trouble their minds with such thoughts. And if they be but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from scandalous sins, and can say, <hi>I am no whore-monger, nor thief, nor curser nor swearer, nor tipler, nor ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59290:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
too gross neglect of your immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal souls. Can you make so light of Heaven and Hell? Your corpses will shortly all lye in the dust, and Angels or Devils will presently seize upon your souls, and every man and woman of you all, will shortly be among other company, and in another case then now you are; you will dwell in those houses but a little longer: you will work in your shops and fields but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer: you will sit in those seats, and dwell on this earth but a little longer: you will see with those eyes, and hear with those ears, and speak with those tongues but a little longer, till the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection day: and can you make shift to forget this? O what a place will you be shortly in of Joy or Torment! O what a sight will you shortly see in Heaven or Hell! O what thoughts will shortly fill your hearts, with unspeakable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59290:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Delight or Horrour? What work will you be employed in? to Praise the Lord with Saints and Angels, or to cry out in fire unquenchable with Devils? And should all this be forgotten? And all this will be endless and sealed up by an unchangeable decree: Eternity, Eternity, will be the measure of your Joyes or sorrows, and can this be forgotten? And all this is true Sirs, most <hi>certain true</hi>: when you have gone up and down a little longer, and slept and awak't a few tunes more, you'l be dead and gone, and find all true that now I tell you: and yet can you now so much forget it? You shall then remember that you heard <hi>this Sermon,</hi> and that <hi>this day,</hi> from <hi>this place,</hi> you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered of these things: and perceive them matters a thousand times greater then either you or I could here conceive: and yet
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59290:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall they be now so much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten?</p>
               <p>Beloved friends; if the Lord had not awakened me to believe and lay to heart these things my self, I should have remained in the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>selfish</hi> state, and have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished for ever: but if he have truly made me sensible of them, it will constrain me to compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate you, as well as my self: If your eyes were so far opened as to <hi>see</hi> Hell, and you saw your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that were Unconverted dragg'd thither with hideous cries, though they were such as you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted honest people on earth, and feared no such matter by themselves; such a sight would make you go home and think of it, and think again; and make you warn all about you as the damned worldling in <hi>Luke.</hi> 16.28. would have had his Brethen warned, lest they come to that place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59290:69"/>
Why, faith is a kind of sight; it is the eye of the soul; the Evidence of things aot seen: If I believe God, it is next to see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And therefore I beseech you excuse me, if I be half as earnest with you about these matters, as if I had seen them. If I must die to morrow, and it were in my power to come again from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world and tell you what I had seen, would you not be willing to hear me, and would you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and regard what I should tell you? If I might preach one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to you after I am dead, and have seen what is done in the world to come, would you not have me plainly speak the truth, and would you not crowd to hear me? and would you not lay it to heart? but this must not be; God hath his appointed way of teaching you by Scripture and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: and he will not humour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59290:69"/>
Unbelievers so far as to send men from the dead to them, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his establisht way: if any man quarrel with the Sun, God will not humour him so far as to set him up a clearer light. Friends, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you regard me now, as you would do if I should come from the dead to you: for I can give you as full assurance of the truth of what I say to you, as if I had been there and seen it with my eyes: For its possible for one from the dead to deceive you: but Jesus Christ can never deceive you: the Word of God delivered in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and sealed up by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and holy workings of the Spirit, can never deceive you. Believe this, or believe nothing. Believe and obey this, or you are undone.

Oh blessed God, what a mercy is it that thou didst not cut off my life all this while, before I had any certain hope of eternal life? Well, God forbid that I should neglect this work any longer. What state is my soul in? Am I C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lord, to see the odiousness of sin, the need of a Saviour, the Love of Christ, and the Excellencies of God and Glory? Is my heart broken or humbled within me for my former life? Have I thankfully entertained my Saviour and Lord, that offered himself with pardon and life to my soul? Do I hate my former sinful life, and the remnant of every sin that is in me? Do I flie from them as my deadly enemies? Do I give up my self to a life of Holiness and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God? Do I love it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it? Can I truly say that I am dead to the world and carnal self, and that I live for God and the Glory which he hath promised? Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

world could spare, and which were the leavings of the flesh. Is my heart now turned another way? Have I a new design, and a new end, and a new train of holy affect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And is it now the scope, and design, and bent of my heart and life, to get well to heaven, and see the glorious face of God, and live in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Love and Praise? And when I sin, is it against the very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual bent and design of my heart? And do I conquer all gross sins, and am I weary, and willing to be rid of mine infirmities? This is the state of a Converted soul. And thus must t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be with me, or I must perish. Is it thus indeed with me, or is it not? Its time to get this doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, before the dreadful Iudge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it. I am not such a stranger to my own heart and life, but I may somewhat perceive whether I am thus Converted or not: if I be not,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59290:71"/>
it will do me no good to flatter my soul with false conceits and hopes. I am resolved no more to deceive my self; but to endeavour to know truly off or on, whether I be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, yea or no; that If I be, I may rejoyce in it, and glorifie my gracious Lord, and comfortably go on till I reach the Crown: and if I am not, I may set my self to beg and seek after the Grace that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert me, and may turn without any more delay: For if I find in time that I am out of the way, by the help of Christ, I may turn and be recovered; but if I stay till either my heart be forsaken of God in blindness and hardness, or till I be catcht away by death, its then too late. There is no place for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Conversion then; I know it must be now or never.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Sirs, this is my request to you, that you will but take your hearts to task, and thus examine them,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59290:72"/>
till you see if it may be, whether you are Converted or not? and if you cannot find it out by your own endeavours, go to your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, if they be faithful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced men, and desire their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. The matter is great; let not bashfulness nor carelesness hinder you. They are set over you to advise you, for the saving of your souls, as Physitians advise you for the curing of your bodies. It undoes many thousands that they think they are in the way to salvation, when they are not; and think that they are Converted when it is no such thing. And then when we call to them daily to <hi>Turn,</hi> they go away as they came, and think, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not them; for they are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already, and hope they shall do well enough in the way that they are in, at least if they do pick the fairest path, and avoid some of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59290:72"/>
the foulest steps, when alas, all this while they live but to the world, and flesh, and are strangers to God and Eternal life, and are quite out of the way to Heaven. And all this is much, because we cannot perswade them to a few se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of their Condition, and to spend a few hours in the examining of their states. Is there not many a self-deceiving wretch that heareth me this day, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bestowed one hour or quarter of an hour in all their lives, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their souls, and try whether they are truly Converted or not? O merciful God, that will care for such wretches that care no more for themselves! and that will do so much to save them from Hell, and help them to Heaven, who will do so little for it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If all that are in the way to Hell, and in a state of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did but know it, they durst not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59290:73"/>
continue in it. The greatest hope that the Devil hath of bringing you to damnation without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue, is by keeping you blindfold, and ignorant of your state, and making you believe that you may do well enough in the way that you are in. If you knew that you are out of the way to heaven, and were lost for ever if you should die as you are, durst you sleep another night in the state that you are in? durst you live another day in it? Could you heartily laugh or be merry in such a state? What! And not know but you may be snatcht away to hell in an hour! Sure it would constrain you to forsake your former company and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to betake your selves to the waies of Holiness, and the Communion of the Saints. Sure it would drive you to cry to God for a new heart, and to seek
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59290:73"/>
help of those that are fit to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel you. Theres none of you sure that <hi>cares not</hi> for being damned. Well then, I beseech you present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make enquiry into your hearts, and give them no rest, till you find out your condition, that if it be good, you may rejoyce in it, and go on: and if it be bad, you may presently look about you for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, as men that believe they must <hi>Turn</hi> or <hi>Die.</hi> What say you, Sirs? Will you resolve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to be at this much labour for your own souls? Will you fall upon this self examination when you come home? Is my request unreasonable? Your consciences know it is not. Resolve on it then before you stir: Knowing how much it concerneth your souls, I beseech you for the sake of that God that doth command you, at whose Bar you will short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all appear, that you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59290:74"/>
me this reasonable request. For the sake of those souls that must <hi>turn or dye,</hi> I beseech you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me not; even but to make it your business to understand your own Conditions, and build upon sure ground, and know off or on whether you are Converted or no, and venture not your souls on negligent security.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you'l say, What if we should find our selves yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted; what shall we do then? This question leadeth me to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Doctrine, which will do much to the answering of it, to which I shall now proceed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="doctrine">
               <head>

               <p>The Lord here professeth that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59290:74"/>
this is it that he takes pleasure in, that the wicked <hi>Turn and Live.</hi> Heaven is made as sure to the Converted as Hell is to the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. <hi>Turn and Live,</hi> is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a truth, as <hi>Turn or Dye.</hi> God was not <hi>bound</hi> to provide us a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, nor open to us a door of hope, nor call us to Repent and Turn, when once we had cast our selves away by sin. But he hath freely done it to magnifie his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Sinners, there's none of you shall have cause to go home, and say I preach desperation to you. Do <hi>we</hi> use to shut up the door of Mercy against you? O that you would not shut it up against your selves! Do we use to tell you, that God will have no mercy on you, though you Turn and be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified? When did you ever hear a Preacher say such a word? You that bark at the Preachers of the Gospel, for desiring to keep you
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59290:75"/>
out of Hell, and say that they Preach Desperation; tell me if you can, when did you ever hear any sober man say, that there is no hope for you, though you Repent and be Converted? No; it is the clean contrary that we daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim from the Lord; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is born again, and by Faith and Repentance doth become a new creature, shall certainly be saved: and so far are we from perswading you to despair of this, that we perswade you not to make any doubt of it. It is Life and not Death, that is the first part of our Message to you: our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is to offer salvation, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain salvation: a speedy, glorious, everlasting salvation, to every one of you: to the poorest beggar as well as the greatest Lords: to the worst of you: even to drunkards, swearers, worldlings, thieves, yea to the despisers and reproachers of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59290:75"/>
the holy way of salvation. We are commanded by the Lord our Master, to offer you a pardon for all thats past, if you will but now at last Return and Live: we are commanded to beseech and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to accept the offer and Return; to tell you what prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made by Christ; what Mercy stayes for you; what Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence waiteth on you; what Thoughts of kindness God hath towards you; and how happy, how certainly and unspeakably happy you may be if you will. We have indeed also a Message of wrath and death, yea of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wrath and death: but neither of them is our principal Message: we must tell you of the wrath that is on you already, and the death that you are born under, for the breach of the Law of works; but this is but to shew you the need of Mercy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59290:76"/>
you to esteem the grace of the Redeemer. And we tell you nothing but the truth which you must know: for who will seek out for Physick that knows not that he is sick? Our telling you of your misery is not it that makes you miserable, but driveth you out to seek for mercy. It is you that have brought this death upon your selves. We tell you also of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, even remediless, and much greater torment, that will fall on those that will not be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. But as this is true, and must be told you, so it is but the last and saddest part of our Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. We are first to offer you Mercy if you will Turn: and it is only those that will not Turn, nor hear the voice of Mercy, that we must fore-tell damnation to. Will you but cast away your transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, delay no longer, but come away at the Call of Christ and be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59290:76"/>
Converted, and become new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and we have not a word of damning wrath or death to speak against you. I do here in the name of the Lord of Life proclaim to you all that hear me this day, to the worst of you, to the greatest, to the oldest sinner, that you may have mercy and salvation, if you will but Turn. There is mercy in God, there is sufficiency in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Christ, the promise is free, and full, and universal; you may have Life, if you will but Turn. But then, as you love your souls, Remember what Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is that the Scripture speaks of. It is not to mend the old house, but to pull down all, and build anew, on Christ the Rock and sure foundation. It is not to mend somewhat in a Carnal course of life, but to mortifie the flesh, and live after the Spirit. It is not to serve the flesh and the world in a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59290:77"/>
more reformed way, without any scandalous disgraceful sins, and with a certain kind of Religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But it is to change your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and your Work, and End, and set your face the contrary way, and do all for the life that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw, and Dedicate your selves and all you have to God. This is the change that must be made if you will live.</p>
               <p>Your selves are witnesses now, that it is Salvation and not Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that is the great Doctrine I preach to you, and the first part of my message to you. Accept of this, and we shall go no further with you, for we would not so much as affright or trouble you with the name of damnation, without necessity.</p>
               <p>But if you <hi>will</hi> not be saved, there's no remedy, but Damnation must take place. For there is no middle place between the two:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59290:77"/>
You must have either Life or Death.</p>
               <p>And we are not only to <hi>offer</hi> you Life; but to shew you the Grounds on which we do it, and call you to believe that God doth mean indeed as he speaks: that the Promise is true, and extendeth Conditionally to <hi>you</hi> as well as others, and that Heaven is no fancy, but a true felicity.</p>
               <p>If you ask where is our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for this offer; among an hundred Texts of Scripture, I will shew it you in these few.</p>
               <p>First, you see it here in my Text, and the following verses, and in the 18. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> as plain as can be spoken.

               <p>Here you may safely trust your souls: for the Love of God is the Fountain of this offer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. and the blood of the Son of God hath purchased it: the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and truth of God is engaged to make the promise good: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles have sealed up the truth of it: Preachers are sent through the world to proclaim it; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are instituted and used for the solemn Delivery of the mercy offered, to them that will accept it: and the Spirit doth open the heart to entertain it, and is it self the earnest of the full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

frighten you; he is more merciful then to do as he saith: he will be better to you then his word.</hi>] And alas, the greatest part of the world believe this word of the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word of God; just as our first sin and misery came into the world.

So now the Lord saith [<hi>Turn or Die.</hi>] And the Devil saith, [<hi>You shall not die, if you do but cry God mercy at last, and give over the acts of sin when you can practise it no longer.</hi>] And this is the word that the world believes. O hainous wickedness to believe the Devil before God!</p>
               <p>And yet that is not the worst: but blasphemously they call this <hi>a Believing and Trusting God,</hi> when they put him in the shape of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59290:80"/>
who was a lyar from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and when they believe that the word of God is a lye, they call this a <hi>Trusting God,</hi> and say they Believe in him, and Trust on him for salvation: Where did ever <hi>God</hi> say, that the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, unconverted, unsanctified shall be saved? Shew such a word in Scripture. I challenge you, if you can. Why this is the <hi>Devils</hi> word; and to believe it is to believe the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the sin that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Presumption:</hi> and do you call this a <hi>believing and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God?</hi> There is enough in the Word of God to comfort and strengthen the hearts of the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but not a word to strengthen the hands of wickedness, nor to give men the least hope of being saved, though they be never sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>But if you will <hi>Turn</hi> and come into the way of Mercy, the Mercy
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59290:81"/>
of the Lord is ready to entertain you. Then Trust God for salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on boldly and confidently, for he is engaged by his word to save you. He will be a Father to none but his children, and he will save none but those that forsake the world, the Devil, and the flesh, and come in to his family to be members of his Son, and have Communion with his Saints. But if they <hi>will</hi> not come in, it is long of themselves: His doors are open: He keeps none back: He never sent such a message as this to any of you: [<hi>Its now too late: I will not receive thee though thou be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi>] He <hi>might</hi> have done so, and done you no wrong: but he <hi>did</hi> not: he <hi>doth</hi> not to this day; He is still ready to receive you, if you were but ready unfeignedly and with all your hearts to <hi>Turn.</hi> And the fulness of this truth will yet more <hi>appear</hi> in the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59290:81"/>
Doctrines, which I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next proceed to, before I make any further application of this.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. GOD taketh Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Salvation: but not in their Death or Damnation: he had rather they would Return and Live, then go on and die.</head>
               <p>I shall first teach you how to understand this; and then clear up the truth of it to you.</p>
               <p>And for the first, you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these following things. 1. A <hi>simple willingness or complacency</hi> is the first act of the <hi>will,</hi> following the <hi>simple apprehension</hi> of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> before it proceedeth to <hi>compare</hi> things together. But the <hi>choosing</hi> act of the <hi>will</hi> is a following act, and supposeth the <hi>comparing practical</hi> act of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59290:82"/>
the <hi>understanding</hi>: and these two acts may often be carried to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> objects, without any fault at all in the person.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An unfeigned willingness may have divers degrees. Some things I am so far willing of, as that I will do all that lieth in my power to accomplish it: and some things I am truly willing <hi>another</hi> should do, when yet I will not do all that ever I am able to procure it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many Reasons to disswade me there from; though yet I will do all that belongs to me to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The will of a <hi>Ruler, as such,</hi> is manifested in <hi>making and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Laws</hi>: but the will of a <hi>man</hi> in his <hi>simple natural capacity,</hi> or as <hi>absolute Lord</hi> of his <hi>own,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in desiring or resolving of <hi>events.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A Rulers will as <hi>Law-giver</hi> is first and principally that his <hi>Laws be obeyed</hi>: and not at all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59290:82"/>
that the penalty be executed on any, but only on supposition that they <hi>will not obey his precepts.</hi> But a Rulers will, as <hi>Iudge,</hi> supposeth the Law already either kept or broken: and therefore he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on rewards or punishments accordingly.</p>
               <p>Having given you these neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Distinctions, I shall next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to the case in hand, in these following Propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is in the <hi>glass</hi> of the <hi>word a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d creatures</hi> that in this life we must know God: and so according to the nature of man we ascribe to him <hi>Vnderstanding and will,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all the imperfections that we can, because we are capable of no higher Positive conceptions of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And on the same grounds we do (with the Scripture) <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi> between the <hi>acts of Gods will,</hi> as diversified from the respects of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59290:83"/>
the objects, though as to Gods <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> they are all one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the boldlyer; because that when we speak of Christ, we have the more ground for it from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And thus we say that the <hi>simple Complacency, Will</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> of God <hi>is</hi> to all that is <hi>Naturally,</hi> or <hi>Morally good,</hi> according to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of its <hi>goodness.</hi> And so he hath pleasure in the Conversion and Salvation of all, which yet will never come to pass.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And God as <hi>Ruler</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> of the world, hath so far a <hi>Practical Will</hi> for their salvation, as to make them a free <hi>Deed of Gift of Christ and Life,</hi> and an act of Oblivion for all their sins, so be it they will not unthankfully reject it; and to command his Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to offer this Gift to all the world, and perswade them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59290:83"/>
it. And so he doth <hi>all</hi> that <hi>as Law-giver or Promiser</hi> belongs to him to do for their salvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But yet he resolveth as <hi>Law-giver,</hi> that they that will not turn shall dye: And as <hi>Iudge,</hi> when their day of grace is past, he will execute that Decree.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So that he thus unfeignedly willeth the Conversion of those that never will be Converted, but not as <hi>Absolute Lord,</hi> with the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest efficacious Resolution,</hi> nor as a thing which he resolveth shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly come to pass, or would engage all his power to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish. It is in the power of a Prince to set a guard upon a Murderer to see that he shall not murder and be hanged. But if upon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he forbear this, and do but send to his subjects, and warn and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them not to be murderers, I hope he may well say that he would not have them murder and be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59290:84"/>
hanged; he takes no pleasure in it, but rather that they forbear and live. And if he do more for some, upon some special reason, he is not bound to do so by all. The King may well say to all the Murderers and Felons in the Land, [<hi>I have no pleasure in your death, but rather that you would obey my Laws and live: but If you will not, I am resolved for all this that you shall die.</hi>] The Judge may truly say to the Thief or Murderer, [<hi>Alas man, I have no delight in thy death: I had rather thou hadst kept the Law, and saved thy life; but seeing thou wilt not, I must condemn thee, or else I should be unjust.</hi>] So though God have no <hi>Pleasure</hi> in your <hi>damnation,</hi> and therefore calls upon you to <hi>Return and Live,</hi> yet he hath <hi>Pleasure in the demonstration of his own Iustice,</hi> and the executing his <hi>Laws,</hi> and therefore he is for all this fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59290:84"/>
that if you <hi>will not be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> you shall be <hi>Condemned.</hi> If God were so much against the death of the wicked, as that he were resolved to do all that he can to hinder it, then no man should be Condemned: whereas Christ telleth you that few will be saved. But <hi>so far</hi> God is against your damnation, as that he will teach you, and warn you, and set before you life and death, and offer you your choice, and command his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to intreate you not to damn your selves, but accept his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and so to leave you without excuse; but if this will not do, and if still you be Unconverted, he professeth to <hi>you,</hi> he is resolved of your damnation, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to say to you in his name, <hi>Verse</hi> 8. <hi>O wicked man, thou shalt surely die!</hi> And Christ hath little less then sworn it over and over, with a <hi>Verily, verily,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59290:85"/>
except ye be Converted, and born again, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven, Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. Mark, that he saith, [<hi>You cannot</hi>] It is in vain to hope for it, and in vain to dream that God is willing of it; for it is a thing that <hi>cannot</hi> be.</p>
               <p>In a word you see then the meaning of the Text, that God the great <hi>Law-giver</hi> of the world doth take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they Turn and Live; though yet he be resolved that none shall Live but those that Turn; and as <hi>Iudge,</hi> even delighteth in Justice and manifesting his hatred of sin; though not in their misery which they have brought upon themselves in it self considered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for the <hi>proofs</hi> of the point, I shall be very brief in them, because I suppose you easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it already.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59290:85"/>1. The very <hi>gracious nature</hi> of God proclaimed <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.6. and frequently elsewhere, may assure you of this, that he hath no Pleasure in your death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God had more pleasure in thy Death then in thy Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Life, he would not have so frequently commanded thee in his word, to Turn; he would not have made thee such promises of Life, if thou wilt but Turn; he would not have perswaded thee to it by so many Reasons. The tenour of his <hi>Gospel</hi> proveth the point.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And his Commission that he hath given to the Ministers of the Gospel, doth fully prove it. If God had taken more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in thy damnation, then in thy Conversion and Salvation, he would never have charged us to offer you Mercy, and to teach you the Way of Life both publikely and privately,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59290:86"/>
and to intreate and beseech you to turn and live; to acquaint you with your sins, and foretell you of your danger, and to do all that possibly we can for your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and to continue patiently so doing, though you should hate us, or abuse us for our pains. Would God have done this, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Ordinances for your good, if he had taken Pleasure in your death?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is proved also by the course of his providences. If God had rather you were damned then Converted and Saved, he would not second his word with his works, and entice you by his daily kindness to himself, and give you all the mercies of this life which are his means to <hi>lead you to Repentance, Rom.</hi> 2.4. and bring you so often under his rod, to force you into your wits; he would not set so many examples
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59290:86"/>
before your eyes; no nor wait on you so patiently as he doth from day to day, and year to year. These be not signs of one that taketh pleasure in your death. If <hi>this</hi> had been his delight, how easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could he have had thee long ago in Hell? How oft before this could he have catcht thee away in the midst of thy sins, with a curse, or oath, or lye in thy mouth, in thy ignorance and pride, and sensuality? when thou wast last in thy drunkenness, or last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding the waies of God, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily could he have stopt thy breath, and tamed thee with his Plagues, and made thee sober in another world! Alas, how small a matter is it for the Lord Almighty to rule the tongue of the prophanest railer, and tye the hands of the most malicious persecutor, or calm the fury of the bitterest of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and make them know that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59290:87"/>
they are but worms? If he should but frown upon thee, thou wouldst drop into thy grave. If he gave Commission to one of his Angels to go and destroy ten thousand sinners, how quickly would it be done! How easily can he lay thee on thy bed of languishing, and make thee lie roaring there in pain; and make thee eat the words of reproach which thou hast spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against his Servants, his Word, his Worship and his holy Waies? And make thee send to beg their prayers whom thou didst despise in thy presumption? How easily can he lay that flesh under gripes and groans, and make it too weak to hold thy soul, and make it more loathsom then the dung of the earth? That flesh which now must have what it loves, and must not be displeased though God be displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but must be humoured in meats, and drink, and cloaths, whatever
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59290:87"/>
God say to the contrary, how quickly would the frowns of God consume it? When thou wast passionately defending thy sin, and quarrelling with them that would have drawn thee from it, and shewing thy spleen against the reprover, and pleading for the works of darkness; how easily could God have snatcht thee away in a moment, and set thee before his dreadful Majesty, where thou shouldst see ten thousand times ten thousand of glorious Angels wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his throne? and have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee there to plead thy cause, and asked thee, <hi>What hast thou now to say against thy Creator, his Truth, his Servants, or his holy waies? Now plead thy cause, and make the best of it that thou canst. Now what canst thou say in excuse of thy sin? Now give account of thy worldliness and fleshly life, of thy time, of all the mercies thou hast
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59290:88"/>
had.</hi> O how thy stubborn heart would have melted, and thy proud looks be taken down, and thy countenance be appaled, and thy stout words turned into speechless silence, or dreadful cries, if God had but set thee thus at his Bar, and pleaded his own cause with thee, which thou hast here so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously pleaded against! How easily can he at any time say to thy guilty soul, [<hi>Come away and live in that flesh no more till the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>] and it cannot resist? A word of his mouth would take off the poise of thy present life, and then all thy parts and powers would stand still: and if he say unto thee, [<hi>Live no longer</hi>: or <hi>live in Hell</hi>] thou couldst not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</p>
               <p>But God hath yet done none of this; but hath patiently forborn thee, and mercifully upheld thee; and given thee that breath which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59290:88"/>
thou didst breath out against him, and given those Mercies which thou didst sacrifice to thy flesh, and afforded thee that provision, which thou spentest to satisfie thy greedy throat; he gave thee every minute of that time, which thou didst waste in idleness, or drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or worldliness: and doth not all this Patience and Mercy shew that he desired not thy damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Can the candle burn without the oyl? Can your houses stand without the earth to bear them? As well as you can live an hour without the support of God. And why did he so long support thy life, but to see when thou wouldst bethink thee of the folly of thy waies, and return and live? Will any man purposely put arms into his enemies hands to resist him? or hold the Candle to a Murderer that is killing his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or to an idle servant that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59290:89"/>
Plaies or sleeps the while. Surely it is to see whether thou wilt at last Return and Live, that God hath so long waited on thee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is further proved by the sufferings of his Son, that God taketh no pleasure in the death of the wicked: would he have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed them from death at so dear a rate? Would he have astonished Angels and men by his condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Would God have dwelt in flesh, and have come in the form of a servant, and have assumed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity into one person with the Godhead, and would Christ have lived a life of suffering, and dyed a cursed death for sinners, if he had rather taken pleasure in their death? Suppose you saw him but so busie in preaching and healing them, as you find him in <hi>Mark</hi> 3.21. or so long in fasting, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. or all night in prayer, as in <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.12. or praying with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59290:89"/>
drops of blood trickling from him instead of sweat, as <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. or suffering a cursed death upon the Cross, and pouring out his soul as a sacrifice for our sins: Would you have thought these the signs of one that delighted in the death of the wicked?</p>
               <p>And think not to extenuate it by saying that this was only for his Elect. For it was <hi>thy</hi> sin, and the sin of all the world that lay upon our Redeemer, and his sacrifice and satisfaction is <hi>sufficient</hi> for all, and the fruits of it are offered to one as well as another: but it is true, that it was never the intent of his mind to pardon and save any that would not by faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be Converted. If you had seen and heard him weeping and bemoaning the state of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient impenitent people, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41, 42. or complaining of their stubborness, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59290:90"/>
                  <hi>Oh Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how oft would I have gathered thy chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ren together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?</hi> Or if you had seen and heard him on the Cross praying for his persecutors, [<hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for they know not what they do</hi>] would you have suspected that he had delighted in the death of the wicked; even of those that perish by their wilfull unbelief? When <hi>God hath so loved</hi> (not only loved, but <hi>so loved) the world, as to give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him,</hi> (by an effectual faith) <hi>should not perish, but have everlasting life</hi>: I think he hath hereby proved against the malice of men and devils, that he takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but had rather that they would <hi>Turn</hi> and <hi>Live:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Lastly, if all this will not yet satisfie you, take his own

               <p>If you dare question his word, I hope you dare not question his oath. As Christ hath solemnly protested, that the unregenerate and Unconverted cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. So God hath sworn that his pleasure is not in their death, but in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Life.

he can swear by no greater then himself,</hi> he saith, <hi>As I live,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to them an end of strife; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by on oath, that by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, in which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for God to lye, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us, which we have as an Anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast.</hi> If there be any man that cannot reconcile this truth with the Doctrine of Predestination, or the actual damnation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that's his own ignorance: he hath no pretence left to deny or question therefore the truth of the point in hand: For this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Oath of God, and therefore must not be distorted

Certainly it is not God: he hath sworn for his part that he takes no pleasure in it. And I know it is not the pleasing of him that you intend in it.

Lord, this is the case of our miserable neighbours, and we cannot help it: we see them ready to drop into hell, and we cannot help it: we know if they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly turn they might be saved; but we cannot perswade them: if we would beg it of them on our knees, we cannot perswade them to it: if we would beg it of them with tears, we cannot perswade them; and what more can we do</hi>?</p>

               <p>This Doctrine is the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, as by a Use of Exhortation, and accordingly I shall handle it. Is there ever an Unconverted sinner that heareth these vehement words of God? Is there ever a man or woman in this Assembly that is yet a stranger to the renewing sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost? (It is an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Assembly if it be not so with the most.) Hearken then to the voice of your maker, and Turn to him by Christ without delay. Would you know the will of God? Why this is his will, that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

Shall the voice of the Eternal Majesty be neglected? If he do but terribly thunder, thou art afraid. O but this voice doth more nearly concern thee. If he did but tell thee thou shalt die to morrow, thou wouldst not make light of it. O but this word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth thy life or death everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is both a Command and an Exhortation. As if he had said to thee, [<hi>I charge thee upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance that thou owest to me thy Creator and Redeemer, that thou renounce the flesh, the world, and the

               <p>Hear all you cold and out-side professors, and all that are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the life of Christ, and never knew the power of his Cross and Resurrection, and never felt your hearts warmed with his Love, and live not on him as the strength of your souls, <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will you die</hi>?</p>
               <p>Hear all that are void of the Love of God, whose hearts are not toward him, nor taken up with

the Hopes of glory, but set more by your earthly prosperity and delights, then by the Joyes of Heaven; all you that are Religious but a little on the by, and give God no more then your flesh can spare; that have not denyed your carnal selves, and forsaken all that you have for Christ, in the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and grounded resolution of your souls, but have any one thing in the world so dear to you, that you cannot spare it for Christ, if he require it, but will rather ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on his displeasure then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye; Why will you die?</hi>

               <p>Consider first, <hi>What preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Mercy hath made for your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> and what pitty it is that any man should be damned after all this.

as that he hath made thee a free Act of Oblivion, and a free deed of Gift of Christ and Life, and offereth it to thee, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth thee to accept it, and it may be thine if thou wilt. For, <hi>he was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, and hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us the word of actual reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. Sinners, we are commanded to do this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to you all, as from the Lord, [<hi>Come, for all things are ready] Luke</hi> 14.17. Are <hi>all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and are <hi>you unready?

If the Lord Almighty say the word, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and all therein obey him: but if he call but a drunkard out of an Ale-house, he will not obey; or if he call a worldly fleshly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to deny himself, and mortifie the flesh, and set his heart on a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inheritance, he will not obey.</p>

least thou wouldst say, <hi>this Call is the dreadful voice of God, and who dare disobey</hi>? For saith the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. <hi>The Lyon hath roared, who will not fear</hi>? God is not as man that thou shouldst dally and play with him: Remember what he said to <hi>Paul</hi> at his Conversion [<hi>It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks] Act.</hi> 9.5. Wilt thou yet go on and despise his word, and resist his Spirit, and stop thine ear against his Call? Who is it that will have the worst of this? Dost thou know whom thou disobeyest and contendest with, and what thou art doing? It were a far wiser and easier task for thee to contend with the thorns, and spurn them with thy bare feet, and beat them with thy bare hands, or put thy head into the burning fire. <hi>Be not deceived, God will not be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Galat.</hi> 6.7.

O how unmeet a match art thou for God! <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into his hands, Hebrews</hi> 10.31. and therefore it is a fearful thing to contend with him or resist him. As you love your souls, take heed what you do. What will you say if he begin in wrath to plead with you? What will you do if he take you once in hand? Will you then strive against his Judgement, as now you do against his grace; faith the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.4, 5. <hi>Fury is not in me</hi>: (that is, I delight not to destroy you: I do it as it were unwillingly: but yet) <hi>who would set the bryars and thorns against me in battle?

               <p>A strange Disputation it is, both as to the Controversie, and as to the Disputants. 1.

               <p n="1">1. Is it not a strange Thing which God doth seem here to suppose, that any man should be <hi>willing to die,</hi> and be damned? Yea that this should be the case of all
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59290:116"/>
the wicked; that is, of the greatest part of the world; but you will say, <hi>This cannot be; for nature desireth the preservation and felicity of it self, and the wicked are more selfish then others, and not less; and therefore how can any man be willing to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>

               <p>To which I answer, 1. It is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth. that no man can be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any evil as evil, but only as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t hath some appearance of good; much less can any man be willing to be eternally tormented. Misery as such is desired by none. 2. But yet for all that it is most true which God here teacheth us, that the cause why the wicked die and are damned, is because <hi>they will die and be damned.</hi> And this is true in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because they will go the way that leads to Hell; though they are told by God and man, whether it goes, and where it ends; and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59290:116"/>
though God hath so often profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in his word, that if they hold on in that way, they shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and that they shall not be saved unless they Turn. <hi>Isa.</hi> 48.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 57.21. <hi>There is no Peace,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>unto the wicked.</hi>] Isa. 59 8. <hi>The way of Peace they know not; there is no Iudgement in their goings; They have made them crooked paths: Whosoever goeth therein shall not know Peace.</hi>] They have the word and the Oath of the living God for it; that if they will not Turn, they shall not enter into his Rest. And yet wicked they are, and wicked they will be, let God and man say what they will; Fleshly they are, and fleshly they will be: Worldlings they are, and Worldlings they will be: though God hath told them that <hi>the Love of the world is enmity to God,</hi> and that <hi>if any man love the world,</hi> (in that measure)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59290:117"/>
                  <hi>the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> James 4.4. 1 John 2.15. so that <hi>consequentially</hi> these men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be damned, though not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: They are willing of the way to Hell, and Love the certain cause of their torment, though they be not willing of Hell it self, and do not love the pain which they must endure.</p>
               <p>Is not this the Truth of your case Sirs? You would not burn in Hell: But you will kindle the fire by your sin, and cast your selves into it: you would not be tormented with Devils for ever; But you will do that which will certainly procure it, in despite of all that can be said against it. It is just as if you would say, <hi>I will drink this rats-bane, or other poison, but yet I will not die. I will cast my self headlong from the top of a steeple, but yet I will not kill my self; I will thrust this knife into
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59290:117"/>
my heart, but yet I will not take away my life. I will put this fire into the thatch of my house, but yet I will not burn it.</hi> Just so it is with wicked men; they will be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they will live after the flesh and the world, and yet they would not be damned. But do you not know that the means do lead unto the end? and that God hath by his righteous Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that you must repent or perish? He that will take poyson, may as well say plainly, <hi>I will kill my self</hi>: for it will prove no better in the end: Though perhaps he loved it for the sweetness of the Sugar that was mixt with it, and would not be perswaded that it was poyson, but that he might take it and do well enough: But it is not his conceits, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that will save his life. So if you will be Drunkards, or Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, or worldlings, or live after
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59290:118"/>
the flesh, you may as well say plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>we will be damned</hi>: For so you shall be unless you Turn; would you not rebuke the folly of a thief or murderer, that would say, [<hi>I will steall, and kill, but I will not be hanged,</hi>] when he knows that if he do the one, the Judge in justice will see that the other be done? If he say, <hi>I will steal and murder,</hi> he may as well say plainly, <hi>I will be hanged.</hi> So if you will go on in a carnal life, you may as well say plainly, <hi>we will go to Hell.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Moreover, <hi>The wicked will not use those means, without which there is no hope of their Salvation:</hi> He that will not eat, may as well say plainly he will not live, unless he can tell how to live without meat; He that will not go his journey, may as well say plainly, he will not come to the end.

to help him out, may as well say plainly he will be drowned; So if you be carnal and ungodly, and will not be converted, nor use the <hi>means</hi> by which you should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but think it more ado then needs, you may as well say plainly, you will be damned. For if you have found out a way to be saved without Conversion, you have done that which never was done before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, this is not all, but the <hi>wicked are unwilling, even of salvation it self.</hi> Though they may desire somewhat which they call by the name of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet Heaven it self, considered in the true nature of the felicity, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not: Yea their hearts are quite against it. Heaven is a state of perfect holiness, and of continual Love, and Praise to God, And the wicked have no heart to this. The imperfect Love, and Praise,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59290:119"/>
and holiness which is here to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they have no mind of: Much less of that which is so much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The joyes of Heaven are of so pure and spiritual a nature, that the heart of the wicked cannot truly desire them.</p>
               <p>So that by this time you may see on what ground it is that God sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth that the wicked are willing of their own destruction: They will not turn, though they must Turn or die, they will rather ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on certain misery, then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and then to quiet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their sin, they will make themselves believe that they shall nevertheless escape.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as the <hi>Controversie</hi> is matter of wonder (that ever men should be such enemies to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as wilfully to cast away their souls) so are the <hi>Disputants</hi> too. That God should stoop so low, as thus to plead the case with man;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59290:119"/>
and that man should be so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind and obstinate, as to need all this in so plain a case, yea and to resist all this, when their own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lieth upon the issue.</p>
               <p>No wonder if they will not hear <hi>us</hi> that are men, when they will not hear the Lord himself. As God saith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7. when he sent the Prophet to the Israelites, [<hi>The house of Israel will not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto thee: For they will not hearken unto me; For all the house of</hi> Israel <hi>are impudent and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted.</hi>] No wonder if they can plead against a Minister, or a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Neighbour, when they will plead against the Lord himself, even against the plainest passages of his word, and think that they have Reason on their side. When they <hi>weary the Lord with their words,</hi> they say, <hi>wherein have we wearied him? Mal.</hi> 2.17. The Priests that <hi>despised his name,</hi> durst ask,

But, [<hi>Wo unto him</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>that striveth with his Maker!

               <p>Quest. <hi>But why is it that God will reason the Cause with man</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reasonable creature, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to be dealt with, and by Reason to be perswaded and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. God hath therefore endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with Reason, that they might use it for him. One would think a reasonable creature should not go against the clearest and greatest Reason in the world, when it is set before him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59290:120"/>2. At least men shall see that God did require nothing of them that was unreasonable; but that whatever he commandeth them, and whatever he forbiddeth them, he hath all the right Reason in the world on his side; and they have good Reason to obey him; but none to disobey. And thus even the damned shall be forced to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie God. and confess that it was but Reason that they should have turned to him; and they shall be forced to condemn themselves, and confess that they had little reason to cast away themselves by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting of his Grace in the day of their visitation.</p>

Is it possible that a man can have any good reason to damn his own Immortal soul? Mark the Lords question [<hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, Why will you die?</hi>] Is eternal <hi>death</hi> a thing to be de desired? Are you in love with Hell? What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have you willfully to perish? If you think you have some reason to <hi>sin,</hi> should you not remember that <hi>death is the wages of sin? Rom.</hi> 6.23. and think whether you have any Reason to undo your selves body and soul for ever. You should not only ask whether you love the Adder, but whether you love the sting. It is such a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59290:123"/>
thing for a man to cast away his everlasting happiness, and to sin against God, that no good reason <hi>can</hi> be given for it: but the more any man pleads for it, the madder he sheweth himself to be. Had you a Lord-ship or a Kingdom offered you for every sin that you commit, it were not reason, but madness to accept it. Could you by every sin obtain the highest thing on earth that flesh desireth, it were of no considerable value to perswade you in reason to commit it. If it were to please your greatest or dearest friends, or to obey the greatest Prince on earth, or to save your lives, or to escape the greatest earthly Misery, all these are of no consideration, to draw a man in reason to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of one sin. If it were a right hand, or a right eye that would hinder your salvation, it is the gainfullest way to cast it away,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59290:124"/>
rather then to go to Hell to save it. For there's no saving a part, when you lose the whole. So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great are the matters of Eternity, that nothing in this world deserveth once to be named in comparison with them: Nor can any earthly thing, though it were Life, or Crowns, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, be a reasonable excuse for the neglect of matters of such higher and Everlasting Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. A man can have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to cross his ultimate End. Heaven is such a thing, that if you lose it, nothing can supply the want, or make up your loss; And Hell is such a thing that if you suffer it, nothing can remove your misery, or give you ease and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And therefore nothing can be a valuable consideration to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you for neglecting your own salvation: For saith our Saviour, <hi>What shall it profit a man to win
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59290:124"/>
all the world, and lose his own soul? Mark</hi> 8.36.</p>
               <p>Oh Sirs, that you did but know what matters they are that we are now speaking to you of! The Saints in Heaven have other kind of thoughts of these things. If the Devil could come to them that live in the sight and love of God, and should offer them a cup of Ale, or a Whore, or merry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or sports, to tice them away from God and Glory, I pray you tell me, how do you think they would entertain the motion? Nay, or if he should offer them to be Kings on the earth: Do you think this would tice them down from Heaven! O with what hatred and holy scorn would they disdain and reject the motion! And why should not you do so, that have Heaven opened to your faith, if you had but faith to see it? There's never a soul in hell but knows by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59290:125"/>
this time, that it was a mad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to let go heaven for fleshly pleasure; and that it is not a little mirth, or Pleasure, or worldly riches, or Honour, or the good Will or Word of men, that will quench Hell-fire, or make him a saver that loseth his soul. O if you had heard what I believe, if you had seen what I believe, and that on the credit of the word of God, you would say there can be no reason to warrant a man to damn his soul: You durst not sleep quietly another night before you had resolved to Turn and Live.</p>
               <p>If you see a man put his hand into the fire till it burn off, you'l marvail at it: but this is a thing that a man may have Reason for, as Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> had when he burnt off his hand for subscribing to Popery. If you see a man cut off a leg or an arm, its a sad sight;

but this is a thing that a man <hi>may</hi> have <hi>good reason</hi> for: as many a man doth it to save his life. If you see a man give his body to be burnt to ashes, and to be tormented with strappado's and racks, and refuse deliverance when it is offered: this is a hard case to flesh and blood. But this a man may have good <hi>reason</hi> for; as you may see in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33, 34, 35, 36. and as many an hundred Martyrs have done. But for a man to forsake the Lord that made him, and for a man to run into the fire of Hell, when he is <hi>told</hi> of it, and intreated to Turn that he may be saved; this is a thing that can have <hi>no Reason</hi> in the world, that is <hi>Reason indeed,</hi> to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or excuse it. For <hi>Heaven</hi> will pay for the loss of any thing that we can lose to get it, or for any labour which we bestow for it. But nothing can pay for the loss of Heaven.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nk that God cares so much what men think, or speak, or do, as to make so great a matter of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It seems then you take the word of God to be false, and then what will you believe? But your own reason might teach you better, if you believe not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: For you see God set not so light by us, but that he vouchsafed to make us, and still preserveth us, and daily upholdeth us, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth for us: And will any wise man make a curious frame for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? will you make or buy a Clock or Watch, and daily look to it, and not care whether it go true or false? Surely if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not a particular eye of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence observing your hearts and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59290:131"/>
lives, you cannot believe or expect any paricular providence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your wants and trouble, to relieve You. And if God had so little cared for you as you imagine, you would never have lived till now: An hundred diseases would have striven which should first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy you; Yea the Devils would have haunted you, and fetcht you away alive, as the great fishes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the less, and as Ravenous birds and beasts devour others. You cannot think that God made man for no end or use: And if he made him for any, it was sure for himself. And can you think he cares not whether his ends be accomplished, and whether we do the work that we are made for?</p>
               <p>Yea by this Atheistical obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction you make God to have made and upheld <hi>all the world</hi> in vain. For what are all other lower Creatures for, but
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59290:131"/>
for man? What doth the earth but bear us, and nourish us? and the beasts do serve us with their labours and lives, and so of the rest. And hath God made so glorious a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and set man to dwell in it, and made all his servants, and now doth he look for nothing at his hands? nor care how he thinks, or speaks, or lives? This is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.</p>
               <p>Object. 9. <hi>It was a better world when men did not make so much ado in Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It hath ever been the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom to praise the times past. That world that you speak of, was wont to say, it was a better world in their fore-fathers dayes, and so did they of their fore-fathers: This is but an old custom; because we all feel the evil of our own times, but we see not that which was before us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Perhaps you speak as you
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59290:132"/>
think: Worldlings think the world is at the best when it is agreeable to their minds: and when they have most mirth and worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And I doubt not but the Devil as well as you, would say, that then it <hi>was a better world:</hi> for then he had more service, and less disturbance. But the world is at the best, when God is most loved, regarded and obeyed. And how else will you know when the world is good or bad but by this?</p>
               <p>Object. 10. <hi>There are so many waies and Religions that we know not which to be of, and therefore we will be even as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Because there are <hi>many,</hi> will you be of that way that you may be <hi>sure</hi> is wrong? <hi>None</hi> are further out of the way, then worldly, fleshly, Unconverted sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For they do not only err in this or that opinion, as many sects
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59290:132"/>
do, but in the very <hi>scope and drift</hi> of their lives. If you were going a journey that your life lay on, would you stop or turn again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you met with some cross waies, or because you saw some travellers go the horse way, and some the foot way, and some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps break over the hedge, yea and some miss the way? or would you not rather be the more careful to enquire the way? If you have some servants that know not how to do your work right, and some that are unfaithful, would you take it well at any of the rest that would therefore be idle and do you no service because they see the rest so bad?</p>
               <p>Object. 11. <hi>I do not see that it goes any better with those that are so godly then with other men They are as poor, and in as much trouble as others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> And perhaps in much
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59290:133"/>
more, when God sees it meet. They take not earthly prosperity for their wages. They have laid up their treasure and hopes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, or else they are not Christians indeed. The less they <hi>have,</hi> the more is <hi>behind</hi>; and they are content to wait till then.</p>
               <p>Object. 12. <hi>When you have said all that you can, I am resolved tohope well, and trust in God, and do as well as I can, and not make so much ado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Is that <hi>doing as well as you can,</hi> when you will not Turn to God, but your heart is against his holy and diligent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? It is as well as you <hi>will</hi> indeed: but thats your mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My desire is, that you should Hope and Trust in God: But for what is it that you will Hope? Is it to be saved, if you
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59290:133"/>
turn and be sanctified? For this you have Gods promise: and therefore hope for it and spare not. But if you Hope to be saved without Conversion and an Holy Life, this is not to Hope in God, but in Satan or your selves. For God hath given you no such promise, but told you the contrary: but its Satan and self-love that made you such promises, and raised you to such Hopes.</p>
               <p>Well, If these and such as these be all you have to say against Conversion and an Holy Life, your <hi>All</hi> is <hi>Nothng,</hi> and worse then Nothing: And if these and such as these seem Reasons suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perswade you to forsake God, and cast your selves into Hell, the Lord deliver us from such Reasons, and from such blind understandings, and from such sensless hardened hearts. Dare you stand to ever an one
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59290:134"/>
of these Reasons at the Barr of God? Do you think it will then serve your turn to say, <hi>Lord I did not Turn because I had so much to do in the world, or because I did not like the lives of some professors, or because I saw men of so many minds.</hi> O how easily will the light of that day confound and shame such reasonings as these? Had you the world to look after? Let the world which you ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now pay your wages, and save you if it can? Had you not a <hi>better world</hi> to look after <hi>first?</hi> And were you not commanded to <hi>seek first Gods Kingdom and Righteousness,</hi> and promised, that <hi>other things should be added to you? Mat.</hi> 6.33. And were you not told, that <hi>godliness was profitable to all things, having the promise of this life, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Did the sins of professors hinder you?
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59290:134"/>
you should rather have been the more <hi>heedful,</hi> and learned by their falls to beware, and have been the more <hi>careful,</hi> and not the more <hi>careless</hi>: It was the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not <hi>their lives,</hi> that was your <hi>Rule.</hi> Did the many opinions of the world hinder you? Why, the Scripture that was your Rule did teach you but one way, and that was the right way: If you had followed that even in so much as was plain and easie, you should never have miscarried. Will not such Answers as these confound and silence you? If these will not, God hath those that will: when he asketh the man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment?</hi> that is, What dost thou in my Church among professed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, without an holy heart and life? What answer did he make? Why the text saith, <hi>He was speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59290:135"/>
he had nothing to say. The clearness of the case, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of God will then easily stop the mouths of the most confident of you, though you will not be put down by any thing that we can say to you now, but will make good your cause, be it never so bad. I know already that never a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that now you can give, will do you any good at last, when your case must be opened before the Lord and all the world.</p>
               <p>Nay, I scarce think that your own Consciences are well satisfied with your Reasons. For if they are, it seems then you have not so much as a <hi>Purpose to Repent.</hi> But if you do purpose to Repent, it seems you do not put much confidence in your Reasons which you bring against it.</p>
               <p>What say you yet Unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sinners? Have you any good Reason to give, why you should
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59290:135"/>
not Turn, and presently Turn with all your hearts? Or will you go to Hell in despight of Reason it self? Bethink you what you do in time; for it will shortly be too late to bethink you. Can you find any fault with God or his work, or wages? Is he a bad Master? Is the Devil whom you serve, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? or is the flesh a better? Is there any <hi>harm</hi> in an holy life? is a life of worldliness and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness better? Do you think in your Consciences that it would do you any harm to be Converted and live an holy life? What harm <hi>can</hi> it do you? Is it <hi>harm</hi> to you to have the Spirit of Christ within you? and to have a cleansed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified heart? If it be bad to be Holy, why doth God say, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Leviticus</hi> 20.7. Is it <hi>evil</hi> to be like <hi>God?</hi> Is it not said that <hi>God made man in his image</hi>? Why this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59290:136"/>
                  <hi>Holiness</hi> is his <hi>Image</hi>: This <hi>Adam</hi> lost, and this Christ by his Word and Spirit would restore to you, as he doth to all that he will save. Why were you <hi>Baptized into the Holy Ghost,</hi> and why do you Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize your children into the Holy Ghost as your <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> if you will not be sanctified by him, but think it an hurt to you to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified? Tell me truly, as before the Lord, Though you are loath to live an Holy life, had you not rather <hi>die</hi> in the case of those that <hi>do so</hi> then of others? If you were to die this day, had you not rather <hi>die</hi> in the case of a Conveted man, then of the Unconverted? of an holy and heavenly man, then of a carnal earthly man? and would you not say as <hi>Balaam,</hi> Numb. 23.10. <hi>Let me die the death of the Righteous, and let my last end be like his.</hi>] And why will you not now be of the mind that you will
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59290:136"/>
be of then? <hi>First</hi> or <hi>last</hi> you must come to this, either to be Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or wish you had been, when it is to late.</p>
               <p>But what is it that you are afraid of losing if you Turn? Is it your <hi>friends?</hi> you will but <hi>change</hi> them: <hi>God</hi> will be your friend, and <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> will be your friend, and every <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> will be your friend. You will get <hi>one friend</hi> that will stand you in more stead then all the friends in the world could have done. The friends you <hi>lose</hi> would but have ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you to hell, but could not have delivered you: But the friend you <hi>get,</hi> will save you from hell, and bring you to his own eternal Rest.</p>
               <p>Is it your <hi>pleasures</hi> that you are afraid of losing? You think you shall never have a merry day again, if once you be Converted. Alas, that you should think it a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59290:137"/>
greater pleasure to live in foolish sports and merriments, and please your flesh, then to live in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thoughts of glory, and in the love of God, and in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, in which the state of grace consisteth, <hi>Romans</hi> 14.17. If it be a greater pleasure to you to think of your Lands and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (if you were Lords of all the Country) then it is to a child to play for pins; why should it not be a greater Joy to you to think of the Kingdom of Heaven being yours, then of all the riches or pleasure of the world? As it is but foolish childishness that makes children so delight in gawds, that they would not leave them for all your Lands: so it is but foolish worldliness, and fleshliness, and wickedness, that makes you so much delight in your houses, and lands, and meat, and drink, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59290:137"/>
ease, and honour, as that you would not part with them for the heavenly delights. But what will you do for pleasure when these are gone? Do you not <hi>think of that</hi>? When <hi>your</hi> pleasures end in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and go out with a stinking snuff, the Pleasures of the Saints are then at the best. I have had my self but a little taste of the heavenly pleasures in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of the blessed approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, and in the present perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Love of God in Christ; but I have taken too deep a draught of earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures (so that you may see, if I be partial, it is on your side;) and yet I must profess from that little experience, that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; there is more joy to be had in a day (if the Sun of life shine clear upon us) in the state of Holiness, then in an whole life of sinful pleasures. I had <hi>rather
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59290:138"/>
be a door-keeper in the house of God, then to dwell in the Tents of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Psalm 84.10. <hi>A day in his Courts is better then a thousand any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else, Psal.</hi> 84.10. The mirth of the wicked is like the laughter of a mad man that knows not his own misery: and therefore <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> faith of such laughter, <hi>It is mad; and of mirth, What doth it? Eccles.</hi> 2.2. And <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>It is better to go to the house of mourning, then to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better then laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for by the sadness of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the heart is made better. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth: It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, then to hear the song of fools: For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool.</hi>] All
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59290:138"/>
the pleasures of fleshly things, is but like the scratching of a man that hath the itch: It is his disease that makes him desire it; and a wise man had rather be without his pleasure and be troubled with his itch. Your loudest laughter is but like that of a man that is tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; he laughs when he hath no cause of joy. And it is a wiser thing for a man to give all his estate and his life to be tickled to make him laugh, then for you to part with the Love of God, and the comforts of Holiness, and the Hopes of Heaven, and to cast your selves into damnation, that you may have your flesh tickled with the pleasures of sin for a little while. Judge as you are men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be a wise mans part. It is but your carnal unsanctified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that makes an holy life seem grievous to you, and a course of sensuality seem more delightful.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59290:139"/>
If you will but Turn, the Holy Ghost will give you another <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi>; and then it will be more plesant to you to be <hi>rid</hi> of your sin, then now it is to <hi>keep</hi> it; and you will then say, that you know not what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life was till now, and that it was never well with you, till God and Holiness were your delight.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>BVT how cometh it to pass that men should be so unreasonable in the matters of their salvation? they have wit enough in other matters. What makes them so loth to be Converted, that there should need so many words in so plain a case, and all will not do, but the most will live and de Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To name them only in a few words, the causes are these.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:59290:139"/>1. Men are naturally <hi>in Love</hi> with earth and flesh. They are born sinners, and their nature hath an enmity to God and godliness, as the Nature of the Serpent hath to a man: And when all that we can say goes against an habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of their natures, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail if it little prevail.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are in <hi>Darkness,</hi> and know not the very things which they hear. Like a man that was born blind, and hears an high commendation of the light: but what will <hi>bearing</hi> do, unless he see it? They know not what God is, nor what is the power of the Cross of Christ, nor what the Spirit of holiness is, nor what it is to live in love by faith: They know not the certainty, and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, and excellency of the heavenly inheritance. They know not what Conversion, and an holy mind and Conversation is, even
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59290:140"/>
when they hear of it. They are in a mist of ignorance. They are lost and bewildred in sin: like a man that hath lost himself in the night, and knows not where he is, nor how to come to himself again, till the day-light do recover him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are wilfully confident that they need no <hi>Conversion,</hi> but some <hi>partial amendment,</hi> but that they are in the way to heaven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and are Converted when they are not. And if you meet a man that is quite out of his way, you may long enough call on him to turn back again, if he will not believe you that he is out of his way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are become slaves to their flesh, and drowned in the world to make provision for it. Their lusts, and passions, and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites have distracted them, and got such an hand over them, that

by the stream of evil company, that they are possessed with hard thoughts of a godly life, by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them speak against it; or at least, they think they may venture to do as they see most do: and so they hold on in their sinful waies; and when <hi>one</hi> is cut off and cast into Hell, and <hi>another</hi> snatcht away from among them to the same condemnation, it doth not much daunt them, because they see not whither they are gone; poor wretches, they hold on in their ungodliness, for all this; for they little know that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions are now lamenting it in torments. In <hi>Luke</hi> 16. the rich man in hell would fain have had one to warn his five Brethren, left they should come to that place of torment.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59290:141"/>
would little have believed one that would have told them so. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a passage that a Gentleman yet living told me he saw upon a bridge over <hi>Severn</hi>:<note rend="inter">

dyeth by them and drops into hell, and <hi>another</hi> follows the same way; and yet they will go after them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think not whether they are gone.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59290:142"/>

And by such jugling deluding cheats as these, the Devil keeps the most in his captivity, and leadeth them to his misery.</p>
               <p>These, and such like impediments as these, do keep so many thousands Unconverted, when <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>done</hi> so much, and <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>suffered</hi> so much, and <hi>Ministers</hi> have <hi>said</hi> so much for their Conversion; when their <hi>Reasons</hi> are silenced, and they are not able to answer the Lord that calls after them, [<hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, Why will you die</hi>?] yet all comes to nothing with the greatest part of them; and they leave us no more to do after all, but to sit down and lament their wilful misery.</p>

He hath on this reasonable condition offered you the free pardon of all your sins; he hath written this in his Word, and sealed it by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and sent it you by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; they have made the offer to you an hundred and an hundred times, and called you to accept it, and to turn to God.

We see them almost undone: Their careless, worldly, fleshly lives do tell us that they are in the power of the Devil: we know if they die before they are Converted, all the world cannot save them; and knowing the uncertainty of their lives, we are afraid every day lest they drop into the fire. And therefore we intreat them to pitty their own souls, and not to undo themselves when mercy is at hand; and they <hi>will not</hi> hear us.

and come to Christ without delay, and to have some mercy on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but they will have none. And yet they think that God must be cruel if he condemn them. O wilful wretched sinners! It is not <hi>God</hi> that is <hi>cruel</hi> to you: it is <hi>you</hi> that are <hi>cruel</hi> to your selves.

What would you have him <hi>do</hi> with his Mercy? He offereth it you, and you will not have it. You are in the ditch of sin and misery, and he would give you his hand to help you out, and you refuse his help: he would cleanse you of your sins,

and you had rather keep them. You <hi>love</hi> your lust, and <hi>love your</hi> gluttony, and sports, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and <hi>will not</hi> let them go. Would you have him bring you to Heaven whether you will or no? Or would you have him bring you and your sins to heaven together? Why, that's an impossibility; you may as well expect he should turn the Sun into Darkness.

We tell the ungodly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less worldling, <hi>It is not such a life that will serve the turn, or ever bring you to Heaven. If a Bear were at your back you would mend your pace; and when the curse of God is at your back, and Satan and Hell are at your back will you not stir, but ask what needs all this ado?

Who can dwell with the everlasting fire? And yet

they will have no mercy upon themselves. And yet will these shameless wretches say, that God is more merciful then to condemn them, when it is themselves that cruelly and unmercifully <hi>run</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condemnation; and if we should go to them with our hats in our hands and intreate them, we cannot stop them.

Unless the holy God of Heaven will give these wretches leave to trample upon his Sons blood, and with the Jews, as it were again to spit in his face, and do despight to the Spirit of grace, and make a jest of sin, and a mock at holiness, and set more light by saving mercy, then by the filth of their fleshly pleasures, and unless after all this he will save them by the mercy which they cast away, and would none of, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self must be called unmerciful by them.

Had the disputing part of the world been as careful to avoid sin and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as they have been busie in searching after the cause of them, and forward indirectly to impute it to God, they might have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised their wits more profitably, and have less wronged God, and sped better themselves. When so ugly a monster as sin is within us, and so heavy a thing as punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is on us, and so dreadful a thing as Hell is before us, one would think it should be an easie question, who is in the fault, and whether God or man be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal or culpable cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some men are such favourable Judges of themselves, that they are proner to accuse the Infinite Perfection and Goodness it self, then their own hearts: and imitate their first parents that said, <hi>The Serpent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted

So say they, [<hi>The understanding that thou gavest me, was unable to discern; the will that thou gavest me, was unable to make a better choice; the objects which thou diast set before me, did entice me; the temptation which thou didst permit to assault me, prevailed against me.</hi> And some are so loth to think that God can make a self-determining creature, that they dare not deny him that which they take to be his prerogative, to be the determiner of the will in every sin, as the first efficient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate physical cause. And many could be content to acquit God from so much causing of evil, if they could but reconcile it with his being the chief cause of good; as if truths must be no longer truths, then we are able to see
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59290:156"/>
them in their perfect order and coherence: because our r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>velled wits cannot set them right toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor assign each truth its proper place, we presume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that some must be cast away. This is the fruit of proud self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedness, when men receive not Gods truths as a child his lesson, in an holy submission to the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of our Teacher, but as Censurers that are too wise to learn.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But we cannot Convert our selves till God Convert us: we can do nothing without his grace: It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God hath two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of mercy to shew: the mercy of Conversion first; and the mercy of Salvation list: the latter he will give to none but those that <hi>will</hi> and <hi>run,</hi> and hath
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59290:156"/>
promised it to them only. The former is to make them <hi>willing</hi> that were <hi>unwilling</hi>: and though your own <hi>willing</hi> and endeavours deserve not this grace, yet your <hi>wilfull</hi> refusal deserveth that it should be denyed to you. Your <hi>disabily</hi> is your very <hi>unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> it self, which excuseth not your sin, but maketh it the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. You <hi>could</hi> Turn if you were but truly <hi>willing</hi>: and if your <hi>wills</hi> themselves are so corrupted, that nothing but effectual grace will move them, you have the more cause to seek for that grace, and yield to it, and do what you can in the use of means, and not neglect it, or set against it. Do what you are able first, and then complain of God for denying you grace if you have cause.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you seem to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate all this while that man hath free will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:59290:157"/>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> The dispute about free-will is beyond your capacity; I shall therefore now trouble you with no more but this about it. Your will is naturally a <hi>free,</hi> that is, a <hi>self-determining faculty,</hi> but it is <hi>vitiously inclined,</hi> and <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to good,</hi> and therefore we see by sad experience that it hath not a <hi>vertuous moral freedom.</hi> But that is the <hi>wickedness</hi> of it, which deserveth the punishment. And I pray you let us not befool our selves with opinions. Let the case be your own. If you have an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my so malicious, that he falls upon you, and beats you every time he meets you, and takes away the lives of your children, will you excuse him because he saith, [<hi>I have not free will, it is my nature; I cannot choose unless God give me grace.</hi>] If you have a servant that robbeth you, will you take such an answer
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59290:157"/>
from him? Might not every Thief and Murderer that is hanged it the Assize give such an answer, [<hi>I have not free-will; I cannot change my own heart: what can I do without Gods grace</hi>?] and shall they therefore be acquit? If not, why then should you think to be acquit for a course of sin against the Lord?</p>
               <p n="2">2. FRom hence also you may observe these three things together. 1. What a subtile tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter Satan is. 2. What a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing sin is. 3. What a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish creature corrupted man is. <hi>A subtile tempter</hi> indeed, that can perswade the greatest part of the world to go wilfully into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59290:158"/>
indeed, that can bewitch so many thousands to put with everlasting life, for a thing so base and utterly unworthy! <hi>A foolish creature</hi> is man indeed, that will be so cheated of his salvation for nothing; yea for a <hi>known nothing</hi>: and that by an enemy, and a known enemy. You would think it impossible that any man in his wits should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded for a trifle to cast himself into the fire, or water, or into a coal-pit, to the destruction of his life. And yet men will be enticed to cast themselves into Hell. If your natural lives were in your own hands, that you should not die till you would kill your selves; how long would most of you live? And yet when your everlasting life is so far in your own hands under God, that you cannot be undone till you undo your selves, how few of you will forbear your own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing? Ah what a silly thing is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59290:158"/>
man! and what a bewitching and befooling thing is sin?</p>
               <p n="3">3. FRom hence also you may learn, that it is no great wonder if wicked men be hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others in the way to heaven, and would have as many Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted as they can, and would draw them into sin, and keep them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="4">4. LAstly, you may hence learn, that the greatest enemy to man is himself; and the greatest judgement in this life that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59290:159"/>
can befall him, is to be left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and that the great work that Grace hath to do, is to save us from our selves, and the greatest accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and complaints of men should be against themselves; and that the greatest work that we have to do our selves, is to resist our selves; and the greatest enemy that we should daily pray, and watch, and strive against, is our own carnal hearts and wills; and the greatest part of your work, if you would do good to others, and help them to heaven, is to save them from themselves, even from their own blind under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, and corrupted wills, and perverse affections, and violent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and unruly senses. I only name all these for brevity sake, and leave them to your further considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:59290:159"/>
               <p>WELL Sirs, now we have found out the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent and Murderer of souls, (even mens selves, their own wills) what remains but that you judge according to the evidence, and confess this great iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and be humbled for it, and do so no more? To these three ends distinctly, I shall add a few words more. 1. Further to convince you. 2. To humble you. And 3. To reform you, if there be yet any hope.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We know so much of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>gracious nature of God,</hi> who is willing to do good, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to shew mercy, that we have no reason to suspect <hi>him</hi> of being the culpable cause of our death, or to call him cruel: He made all good, and he preserveth and maintaineth all; the eyes of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59290:160"/>
all things do wait upon him; and he giveth them their meat in due season; he openeth his hand, and satisfieth the desires of all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>Psalm</hi> 145.15, 16. He is not only <hi>righteous in all his waies,</hi> (and therefore will deal justly) <hi>and holy in all his works,</hi> (and therefore not the author of sin) but [<hi>he is also good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.] Psal.</hi> 145.17, 9.</p>
               <p>But as for <hi>man,</hi> we know his mind is dark, his will perverse, his affections carry him so headlong, that he is fitted by his folly and corruption to such a work as the destroying of himself. If you saw a Lamb lie killed in the way, would you sooner suspect the <hi>sheep,</hi> or the <hi>dog,</hi> or <hi>woolf,</hi> to be the author of it, if they both stood by? or if you see an house broken and the people murdered, would you sooner suspect the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Iudge,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59290:160"/>
that is wise and just, and had no need; or a <hi>known Thief or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer?</hi> I say therefore as <hi>Iames</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. <hi>Let no man say when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth be any man,</hi> (to draw him to sin) <hi>But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</hi> Then <hi>when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death.</hi>] You see here, that sin is the brat of your own concupiscence, and not to be fathered on God; and that death is the off-spring of your own sin, and the fruit which it will yield you as soon as it is ripe. You have a treasure of evil in your selves as a spider hath of poyson: from whence you are bringing forth hurt to your selves and spinning such webs as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Nature</hi> shews, its <hi>you</hi> that are the cause.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its evident that you are your own destroyers, in that you are so <hi>Ready to entertain any Temptation</hi> almost that is offered you. Satan is scarce readier to move you to any evil, then you are ready to hear, and do as he would have you. If he would tempt your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to error and prejud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce, you yield. If he would hinder you from good resolutions, it is soon done. If he would cool any good desires or affections, it is soon done. If he would kindle any lust or vile affections and desires in you, it is soon done: if he will put you on to evil thoughts, or words, or deeds, you are so free that he needs not rod or spur: if he would keep you from holy thoughts, and words, and waies, a little doth it; you need no curb. You examine not his suggestions,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59290:161"/>
nor resist them with any resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor cast them out as he casts them in, nor quench the sparks which he endeavoureth to kindle: but you set in with him, and meet him half way, and embrace his motions, and tempt him to tempt you. And its easie to catch such greedy fish that are ranging for a bait, and will take the bare hook.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your destruction is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long of your selves, in that you Resist all that would help to save you, and would do you good, or hinder you from undoing your selves God would help and save you by his word, and you resist it, it is too strict for you. He would sanctifie you by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and you resist, and quench it. If any man reprove you for your sin, you fly in his face with evil words; and if he would draw you to an holy life, and tell you of your present
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59290:162"/>
danger, you give him little thanks, but either bid him look to himself, he shall not answer for you; or else at best, you put him off with an heartless thanks, and will not Turn when you are perswaded. If Ministers would privately instruct and help you, you will not come at them; your unhumbled souls do feel but little need of their help. If they would Catechize you, you are too old to be Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised, though you are not too old to be ignorant and unholy. Whatever they can say to you for your good, you are so self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and wise in your own eyes, (even in the depth of ignorance) that you will regard nothing that agreeth not with your present conceits, but contradict your Teachers, as if you were wiser then they; you resist all that they can say to you, by your ignorance and wilfulness, and foolish Cavils,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59290:162"/>
and shifting evasions, and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rejections, so that no good that is offered can find any welcome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and entertainment with you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover its apparent that you are self-destroyers, in that you <hi>draw the matter of your sin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction even from the blessed God himself.</hi> You like not the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of his Wisdom: You like not his Justice, but take it for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: You like not his Holiness, but are ready to think he is such a one as your selves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.21. and makes as light of sin as you: You like not his Truth, but would have his Threanings, even his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Threatnings prove false. And his goodness which you seem most highly to approve, you part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resist, as it would lead you to repentance; and partly abuse, to the strengthning of you sin, as if you might the freelyer sin, because
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59290:163"/>
God is Merciful, and because his Grace doth so much abound.</p>
               <p>Yea you <hi>fetch destruction from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he blessed Redeemer, and Death from the Lord of life</hi> himself. And nothing more emboldneth you in sin, then that Christ hath died for you; as if now the danger of death were over, and you might boldly venture: As if Christ were become a servant to Satan and your sins, and must wait upon you while you are abusing him: and because he is become the Physitian of souls, and he is able to save to the utmost all that come to God by him, you think he must suffer you to refuse his help, and throw away his Medicines, and must save you whether you will come to God by him or no: so that a great part of your sins are occasioned by your bold presumption, upon the death of Christ.</p>
               <p>Not considering that he came
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59290:163"/>
to redeem his people from their sins, and to sanctifie them a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people to himself, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them in Holiness to the image of their heavenly Father and to their head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You also <hi>fetch your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from all the providences and works of God.</hi> When you think of his eternal fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Decrees, it is to harden you in your sin, or possess your minds with quarrelling thoughts, as if his Decrees might spare you the labour of repentance and an holy life, or else were the cause of your sin and death. If he afflict you, you repine: If he prosper you, you the more forget him, and are the backwarder to the thoughts of the life to come. If the wicked prosper, you forget the end that will set all reckonings strait, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59290:164"/>
are ready to think, its as good be wicked as godly. And thus you draw your death from all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And the like you do <hi>from all the Creatures and mercies of God</hi> to you. He giveth them to you as the tokens of his love, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his service, and you turn them against him, to the pleasing of your flesh. You eat and drink to please your appetite, and not for the glory of God, and to enable you for his work. Your cloathes you abuse to pride. Your Riches draw your hearts from heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. Your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and applause do puff you up: If you have health and strength, it makes you more secure and forget your end. Yea other mens mercies are abused by you to your hurt. If you see their honours and dignity, you are provoked to envy them. If you see their riches, you are ready to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59290:164"/>
covet them. If you look upon beauty, you are stirred up to lust, and its well if godliness be not an eye-fore to you.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>very gifts that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth</hi> on you, and the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of grace which he hath insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for his Church, you turn to sin. If you have better parts then others, you grow proud and self-conceited: if you have but common gifts, you take them for special Grace. You take the bare hearing of your duty for so good a work, as if it would excuse you for not obeying it. Your Prayers are turned into sin, because you <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard iniquity in your hearts,</hi> Psalm 66.18. <hi>and depart not from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity when you call on the name of the Lord,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Your <hi>prayers are abominable, because you turn away your ear from hearing the Law, Prov.</hi> 28.9. And are more ready to offer the Sacrifice of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59290:165"/>
fools, (thinking you do God some special service) then to hear his word and obey it, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.1. You examine not your selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you receive the Supper of the Lord, but not discerning the Lords body, do eat and drink judgement to your selves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yea the <hi>persons that you converse with, and all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> you make the occasions of your sin and destruction. If they live in the fear of God, you hate them. If they live ungodlily, you imitate them: if the wicked are many, you think you may the more boldly follow them; if the godly be few, you are the more emboldened to despise them. If they walk exactly, you think they are too precise; if one of them fall in a particular temptation, you stumble upon them, and turn away from holiness, because that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59290:165"/>
others are imperfectly holy: as if you were warranted to break your necks, because some others have by their heedlesness sprained a sinnew or put out a bone. If an hypocrite discover himself, you say, <hi>They are all alike,</hi> and think your selves as honest as the best. A Professor can scarce slip into any miscarriage, but because he cuts his finger, you think you may boldly cut your throats. If mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters deal plainly with you, you say they rail. If they speak gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or coldly, you ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If any errours creep into the Church, some greedily entertain them, and others reproach the Christian Doctrine for them, which is most against them. And if we would draw you from any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rooted errour, which can but plead two, or three, or six, or seven
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59290:166"/>
hundred years custom, you are as much offended with a motion for Reformation, as if you were to lose you lives by it, and hold fast <hi>old</hi> errors, while you cry out against <hi>new</hi> ones. Scarce a difference can arise among the ministers of the Gospel, but you will fetch your own death from it. And you will not hear, or at least not obey the unquestionable Doctrine of any thing that jumps not with your conceits: <hi>One</hi> will not hear a Minister, because he readeth his Sermon: and another will not hear him, because he doth not read them. <hi>One</hi> will not hear him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saith the Lords prayer: and another will not hear him, because he doth not use it. <hi>One</hi> will not hear them that are <hi>for</hi> Episcopacy: and another will not hear them that are <hi>against it.</hi> And thus I might shew it you in many other cases, how you turn all that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59290:166"/>
comes near you to your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, so clear is it that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are self-destroyers, and that their perdition is of themselves.</p>
               <p>ME thinks, now upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of what is said, and the review of your own waies, you should bethink you what you have done, and be ashamed and deeply humbled to remember it. If you be not, I pray you consider these following truths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be your own destroyers, is to sin against the deepest prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in your Natures, even the principle of self preservation. Every thing naturally desireth or inclineth to its own felicity, well-fare or perfection. And will you set your selves to your own destruction? When you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to love your neighbours
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59290:167"/>
as your selves, it is supposed that you naturally love your selves. But if you love your neighbours no better then your selves, it seems you would have all the world be damned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How extreamly do you cross your own intentions! I know you intend not your own damnation, even when you are procuring it; you think you are but doing good to your selves, by gratifying the desires of your flesh. But alas, it is but as a draught of cold water in a burning feaver, or as the scratching of an itching wild-fire, which increaseth the disease and pain. If indeed you would have pleasure, or profit, or honour, seek them where they are to be found, and do not hunt after them in the way to hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What pitty is it, that you should do that against your selves, which none else in earth or hell
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59290:167"/>
can do! If all the world were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined against you, or all the Devils in Hell were combined against you, they could not destroy you without your selves, nor make you sin but by your own consent. And will you do that against your selves which no one else can do? you have hateful thoughts of the Devil, because he is your enemy, and endeavoureth your destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And will you be worse then Devils to your selves? Why thus it is with you, if you had hearts to understand it: when you run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sin, and run from godliness, and refuse to turn at the Call of God, you do more against your own souls, then men or devils could do besides. And if you should set your selves, and bend your wits to do your selves the greatest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, you could not devise to do a greater.</p>

               <p n="6">6. It will everlastingly make you your own Tormenters in Hell to think on it, that you brought your selves wilfully to that misery.

O what a griping thought it will be for ever to think with your selves, [That this was your own doing! That you were warned of this day, and warned again, but it would not do.

               <p>AND now I am come to the Conclusion of this work; my heart is troubled to think how I shall leave you; lest after this the flesh should still deceive you, and the world and the Devil should keep you asleep, and I should leave you as I find you, till you awake in Hell; Though in care of your poor souls, I am affraid of this, as knowing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy

That God and conscience might have been as willing to spare me this labour, as some of you could have been. Dear friends! I am so loth you should lie in everlasting fire, and be shut out of Heaven, if it be possible to prevent it, that I shall once more ask you, What do you now resolve? Will you Turn or Die? I look upon you as a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian on his Patient in a dangerous disease: that saith to him [<hi>Though you are far gone, take this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,

This is your case. As far as you are gone in sin, do but now Turn and Come to Christ, and take his Remedies, and your souls shall live. Cast up your deadly sins by Repentance, and return not to the poysonous vomit any more, and you shall do well. But yet if it were your bodies that we had to deal with, we might partly know what to do for you, though you would not consent. You might be held or bound, while the medicine were poured down your throats, and hurtful
