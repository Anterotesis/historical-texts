         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR's Letter
to the Stationer, upon
occasion of the following
Papers.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have received both your
Excuses and Desires
about those Papers I left
in your Fathers hands upon
my several journeys into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with a charge That none
ever should see them, unless I
happen'd to dye before my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
In that case only I gave
him leave to Print them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I found it would be a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to him, and he thought


<pb facs="tcp:56779:4"/>
an advantage. I will examine
no further how several of them
came to run abroad both in
Print and Manuscript, since
you justifie your felf; and I
will not accuse your Father,
whom I ever esteemed a good
man. All I can say of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is, That the Two Copies at
first dispersed, came from two
of your Fathers Friends, and
that you confess to have Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ten by order of one of Mine
while I was abroad, upon the
belief he would not have desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it without my Consent; But
that you ought not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
without knowing it from
me, as you might easily have


<pb facs="tcp:56779:4"/>
done in ten days time.</p>
            <p>You pretend to be sure the
Press was broken after tbat
number was taken off; which
is a thing you cannot answer
for, without your Printers
leave; nor if it were so, do I
make any difference between
Ten and a Hundred. This I
am sure of, that how few soever
were Printed, very many have
seen them, and more have heard
of them, and so many of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
prest me for Copies,
that I have been troubled to
refuse them, and to be so hardly
believed when I assured them
I had none.</p>
            <p>Now for what you tell me


<pb facs="tcp:56779:5"/>
of the great care and pains
you have taken, since I spoke
to you last, to discover how
they went out, and to call them
in, and that you find this last
is impossible, and apprehend
every day that some or other
will Print them without your
knowledge or mine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ground your desires for
my leave to do it; I know not
well what to say, having said
so much to you already upon this
occasion, and think 'tis best
troubling my self no longer
about a thing that is past reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Therefore I am content
you should publish them, rather
than any other should do it


<pb facs="tcp:56779:5"/>
without my leave, and rather
than any further mystery should
be made of those that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
which has given the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of two other Books being
laid to my charge, that I have
been so far from writing, as
never to have seen.</p>
            <p>For the Order and Titles
of the several Papers, they
must, I doubt, be the same with
the Copies already dispersed,
since these cannot be recalled.
For any general Title, I leave
it wholly to you, as well as the
time; nor are you to expect
from me either any Correction
of Press, or trouble of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
being resolved, since they


<pb facs="tcp:56779:6"/>
first run away without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to own them no longer, and
to concern my self in them no
more than if they had never
been mine. What advantages
soever you can propose to your
self by them, I can expect but
one (and that will agree very
ill with yours) which is, That
the publishing of them may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
suppress them; and that
they may be talkt of no more
when once they grow common;
since nothing but the scarcity
of them can give them any
vogue. If this happens, I
shall be at quiet, which is all I
ask of them or of you.</p>

proceeding usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from outward
Blows and Accidents,
as well as inward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
or Infirmities; it seems equally
necessary for any Government to know
and reflect upon the Constitutions,
Forces, and Conjunctures among their


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56779:7"/>
Neighbouring States, as well as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
Humours, and Interests of their
own Subjects; For all Power is but
comparative, nor can any Kingdom
take a just measure of its safety by its
own riches or strength at home, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
casting up at the same time what
Invasions may be feared, and what
Defences expected from Enemies or
Allyes abroad.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, That so advantageous
a Scituation as that of His Majesties
Dominions in these Islands of Great
<hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> makes any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
consideration less important to
us, than to any other Nation: Because
the Numbers and Native courage of
our men, with the strength of our
Shipping, have for many ages past (and
still for ought we yet know) made
us a match for the greatest of our
Neighbours at Land; and an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match
for the strongest of them at Sea:
Whereas whoever hurts us without
our own Arms, must be able to master
us in both those Elements. Yet in
regard there are the names of several
Conquests remaining still upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56779:7"/>
(though all of them the meer
effects of our own divisions or invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions);
when Trade is grown the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of all Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> that are
possest of any Maritime Provinces, as
being the only unexhausted Mine, and
out of whose Treasures all greatness at
Sea naturally arises: When instead of
a King of <hi>France</hi> surrounded and
bearded by Dukes of <hi>Brittany,</hi> and
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> as well as our own possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Guienne;</hi> Instead
of a Count of <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi>
who served for no more, than like the
smaller weights to make the balance
sometimes a little even in the greater
scales of the <hi>English, French,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Powers; We now behold in
<hi>France</hi> the greatest Land-Forces that
perhaps have ever been known under
the Command of any Christian Prince;
And in the United Provinces, the
greatest numbers both of Ships and
Mariners that were ever yet heard of
under any State in the World; And
which have hitherto been only awed
by the strength of our Oak, the Art
of our Shipwrights, and chiefly by the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56779:8"/>
invincible hearts of our Seamen: When
the prospect of these two Powers brings
us to consider, that any firm conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of them, either by Confederacy
or the Submission of <hi>Holland,</hi> will
prove the nearest approach that was
ever made to our ruine and servitude:
It may perhaps import us in this calm
we enjoy, to hearken a little more than
we have done of late, to the storms
that are now raising abroad; and by
the best Perspectives we can find, to
discover from what Coast they break,
what course they are like to hold, how
much we can lye in their danger, and
whether the shelter expected from us
by our Neighbours, will be only a
strain of Generosity and Humanity, or
the best provision we can make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
for our own safety.</p>
            <p>Those Countreys in whose Actions
or Interests we have at any time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
our selves, have been the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<hi>France, Spain, Sweden, Denmark,</hi>
and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in the two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
bodies usually distinguished by
the names of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
For with <hi>Poland</hi> we have never gone


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56779:8"/>
further, than our good wishes towards
their defence against the <hi>Turk.</hi> Nor
with <hi>Italy,</hi> than the Offices of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
or Interests of Traffique, unless
sometimes some short Negotiation that
served the present turn to stop the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
growth of either the <hi>French</hi>
or <hi>Spanish</hi> greatness in those as well as
nearer parts.</p>
            <p>THE Forreign Interests of the
Empire are the defence of the
Eastern parts against the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the
preservation of the Western Circles
against the growth of <hi>France.</hi> The
Domestique are the limited constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Imperial Power, and the
balance of the several free Princes and
States of the Empire among themselves.
The two last have raised no dust since
the Peace of <hi>Munster,</hi> which seems
chiefly occasioned by the <hi>Swedes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in to be a Member of the Empire,
upon the share then yielded to him
in <hi>Pomerania</hi> and <hi>Bremen.</hi> These give
him an immediate entrance into the
heart of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Native
poverty of his own Countrey makes
him considered, as still upon the wing,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56779:9"/>
and ready to stoop at the first Quarry
he can meet with upon any divisions
in the Empire, so as there seems a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
resolution not to furnish him
with such occasions. Their defence
against the <hi>Turk</hi> will be provided and
pursued by Common Inclinations and
Forces, unless those Princes of the
Western Circles should at the same
time be busied in some nearer danger
from <hi>France.</hi> But if the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier</hi>
be so great a man as he is reputed
in Politicks as well as Arms, he will
never consent by an Invasion of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
to make way for the advance of
the <hi>French</hi> Progress into the Empire,
which a Conquest of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi>
would make easie and obvious:
And so great accessions (with others
that would lye fair and open in the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Provinces upon the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian)
would make <hi>France</hi> a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Power to the <hi>Turk</hi> himself, and
greater than I suppose he desires to see
any in <hi>Christendom;</hi> So that it seems
not improbable, that the present Peace
between the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the <hi>Turk,</hi>
may last longer than is generally
calculated by the fears or desires


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56779:9"/>
of those who are most concerned in
it.</p>
            <p>In the preservation of the Western
Circles (especially that of <hi>Burgundy</hi>
and the <hi>Rhine</hi>) against the Progress
of the <hi>French</hi> Greatness; the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
if not Interests of the several
Members of the Empire, seem much
more divided. The <hi>Emperor</hi> himself
is firm in resolving it, because he has
nothing to fear so much as the Power
and Ambition of <hi>France,</hi> in regard of
their Common Pretensions to <hi>Spain</hi>
after the young Kings death, and a
jealousie of the Empire it self after
a further course of success: But he
will be faint in any execution of such
a Counsel, unless spirited by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Decrees of a general Dyet,
from his own dispositions, which are
thought rather generous and just than
ambitious and enterprizing, from the
influence of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in that Court,
who are observed to grow generally
<hi>French</hi> as they were <hi>Spanish</hi> in the last
age; from the fear of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who
are still like a Cloud that hangs over
his head; And from a jealousie of
<hi>Swedens</hi> joyning absolutely with <hi>France,</hi>


               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56779:10"/>
which might share a great part of the
Empire between them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> would fall
intirely into the Interests of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>
in this point, as a Prince that is
a true <hi>German,</hi> loves the liberty of the
Empire; Forefees, that if it should fall
into the <hi>French</hi> hands, all the Princes
would grow little Companions to what
they are, or return to be the several
Officers of his Court; as they were in
the unlimited greatness of some Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Emperors.</hi> Besides, his distance
from <hi>France,</hi> though it does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him to think wiser than other
Princes, Yet it helps him to speak bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
what he thinks upon these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and
<hi>Langrave</hi> of <hi>Hesse,</hi> and at least two of
the Dukes of <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> are in their
Dispositions and Judgments upon the
same Interests; But will be influenced
and awed by <hi>Sweden,</hi> whose ill Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
will be still suspected to <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi>
upon the differences in <hi>Prus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia;</hi>
and to <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> upon the late
disappointment at <hi>Bremen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56779:10"/>
The <hi>Electors</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Triers</hi>
have the same Inclinations, but lying
at the mercy of <hi>France,</hi> in so near and
so imperious a Neighbourhood, They
will take no measures wherein they
may not see their own safety provided
for, as well as that of the Empire;
Wherein no Prince has greater repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Prudence and Caution, than
the Bishop of <hi>Mentz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> either upon
remainders of the ancient Leagues
with <hi>France,</hi> or quarrels with the
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> has been thought
inclined to the <hi>French;</hi> But as a wife
Prince will be found generally in the
true Interests of the <hi>Empire</hi> as far as
the seat of his Countrey will give
him leave, which in a War will be
so much exposed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> has been
esteemed wholly in the <hi>French</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests
since the Treaty of <hi>Munster;</hi>
But by what tyes or motives, has not
fallen under my observation, in regard
of the distance of his Countrey, and
small Commerce out of the limits of
the <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56779:11"/>
The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Colen</hi> is a person of
much natural goodness and candor,
but of age and infirmities, and whom
Devotion and Chymistry have shared
between them, and in a manner remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the affairs of his State;
which have been long and intirely
devolved upon the Bishop of <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi>
A man busie, and always in
motion or intrigue: But for the rest,
whether upon future ambition, or
present advantages, Esteemed to be
perfectly in the <hi>French</hi> Interests; So
as whatever use can be made by <hi>France</hi>
of that Electors Name or Countrey,
may be reckoned upon as wholly at
the devotion of that Crown.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Nieuburgh</hi> is in his
person and meen, rather like an <hi>Italian</hi>
than a <hi>German;</hi> and should be so in
his disposition, by playing the Game
of an <hi>Italian</hi> Prince; In declaring no
partialities, provoking no enemies, and
living more retired than the other
Princes of his Countrey; Having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shewed any ambition, but for the
Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> which design helpt
to inspire him with great compliance


<pb facs="tcp:56779:11"/>
towards all his Neighbours, and other
Princes, who were able to do him good
or ill offices in that point. But the
failing of it, was thought to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
disobliged him from <hi>France</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whose assistance he reckoned) and
has sunk him in a debt which he will
hardly recover.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Munster</hi> is made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considerable by his scituation, which
lyes the fittest of all others to invade
<hi>Holland;</hi> And by the dispositions of
this man, which are unquiet, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
to raise a name in the World.
An old implacable hatred to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
upon their intelligence with his chief
Town of <hi>Munster;</hi> Their Usurpation
(as he pretends) of <hi>Borkloe,</hi> and some
other small places in his Countrey;
Their protection of the Countess of
<hi>Benthem,</hi> and the hopes of sharing
<hi>Overyssel</hi> or <hi>Friesland,</hi> if ever their
spoyls come to be divided; make him
a certain friend to what Prince soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is Enemy to them, and will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him with men, or money enough
to appear in the head of an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56779:12"/>
The general Interest that the several
Princes of the Empire have with us,
is grounded wholly upon the Esteem
of His Majesties Power, and the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Name, which is so great
amongst them, That most of them are
resolved in the present Conjuncture
of Affairs in <hi>Christendom,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
perfectly His language, before they
speake their own.</p>
            <p>THE Government of <hi>Sweden</hi> is
esteemed steady and wise, as
their people warlike and numerous.
The digestion of their Counsels is made
in a Senate consisting of forty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,
who are generally the greatest
men of the Kingdom in Office, Estates,
or Abilities; and who have most of
them been Commanders in the <hi>German</hi>
Wars, or are so in the present Militia,
which makes their Counsels generally
Warlike and Ambitious, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tempered by the Minority of
their King. This has turned them for
some years since their last Kings death,
rather to make advantages by the name
and reputation of their Alliances, than
by the appearance of their Arms. But


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56779:12"/>
if their King grow a Man, and of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
thoughts, as may be presaged from
so great a Father, We may see great
actions and revolutions grow again
out of this Northern Climate. For
the names of <hi>Goth,</hi> and <hi>Vandal,</hi> and
their famons successes both in <hi>Poland</hi>
and <hi>Germany</hi> this last age, inspire them
with great thoughts; And the bodies
and courages of their common men,
as well as the Prudence and Conduct
of their great Officers, seem to have
framed them for great undertakings.
Besides their Application of late years
to trade, has much increast their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and Seamen (which they found
to be their weak-side in their last at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts).
All these may in time make
way for their great design, which is
the Dominion of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea by
the Conquest of <hi>Denmark.</hi> This was
about the year 59, wrested out of
their hands by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Assistances,
and can hardly escape them, if ever
that Commonwealth should be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
And if they arrive once at this
point, there will grow a Power in that
rough Climate, which both at Land
and Sea may equal most others that


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56779:13"/>
are now in <hi>Christendom;</hi> by being
Masters of such numbers of strong
and valiant men, as well as of all
the Naval Stores that furnish the
World.</p>
            <p>They have a nearer prospect upon
the City of <hi>Bremen,</hi> by the Addition
whereof to the Bishoprick already in
their possession, They design to lay
a great foundation both of Trade and
Strength in the nearer parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their next Interest seems to be a
long knocking War in the Empire or
the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> which will make
them Courted by all, till they think
fit to declare; And then will bring
them to a share in the Game; And
those often go away with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
who bring in least when the Stake
begins. The neglects of <hi>France</hi> since
the peace of <hi>Munster,</hi> and the late
courtship of <hi>Spain,</hi> seem to have left
them open for the fairest offer from
either of those Crowns: But rather
inclined to <hi>Spain,</hi> which has still the
surest fonds of treasure (if they could
fall into good method or direction)


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56779:13"/>
and to whom they are more necessary
than to <hi>France,</hi> which has out-grown
almost all measures with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
They have a peek to <hi>Holland</hi>
something in shew, but more at heart;
As lying cross to their three designs,
the Dominion of the <hi>Baltick,</hi> their
Acquisition of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and a War in
the upper or lower <hi>Germany.</hi> And
they are so wise a State as to be found
commonly in their Interest; which
for these reasons, is either an absolute
breaking, or a great weakening of
that Commonwealth. Besides, they
esteemed themselves at least neglected
by them in the late Negotiation of
the Tripple Alliance, wherein they
expected constant Subsidies in the time
of peace, from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to
engage them in the defence of all those
Provinces against the threatning power
of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An old friendship to our Nation,
and Alliance, proceeding from a long
conjunction of Interests, besides the
necessity of keeping well with one of
the greatest Maritime Powers, will
(as may be conjectured) perswade


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56779:14"/>
them to follow His Majesties measures
the closest and furthest of any State in
<hi>Europe.</hi> This gave them the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of entring into the Tripple Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;
And into the commerce with
<hi>Spain</hi> in the year 68; And their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of keeping pace with His
Majesty in both those points, as well
as the consequences of them; Which
they will do, unless the present Scene
should wholly change, and open new
Councels and Interests not yet thought
of in the world.</p>
            <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> seems
less considerable than their
Neighbour-Crown, From a fainter
Spirit which appears of late in their
people, and in their Government it
self; as well as a great inequality of
number in their Forces both at Sea
and Land; For the last change of
their Government, from Elective to
Hereditary, has made it seem hitherto
of less Force, and unfitter for Action
abroad. As all great Changes brought
about by Force or Address in an old
Constitution of Government (rooted
in the Hearts and Customs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple),


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56779:14"/>
though they may in time prove
an encrease of Strength and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(when fallen into Method, and
grown easie by Use); Yet for many
years they must needs weaken it, by
the divisions and distractions of mens
minds, and discontents of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
And so turn the Counsels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Designs within, desisting from any
without; And advantages upon Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
must give way to those upon
Subjects: So as the breaking down an
old frame of Government, and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a new, seems like the cutting down
an old Oak (because the fruit decays,
and the branches grow thin), and
planting a young one in the room.
'Tis true, the Son or Grandson (if it
prospers) may enjoy the shade and the
maste; But the Planter, besides the
pleasure of Imagination, has no other
benefit to recompence the pains of
Setting and Digging, the care of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and Pruning, the fears of every
Storm and every Drougth. And 'tis
well, If he escapes a blow from the
fall of the old Tree, or its Boughs, as
they are lopt off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56779:15"/>
The Change in <hi>Denmark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was the
safer by having to deal with a soft
easie people, and with Nobles grown
to have small power or interest amongst
them, and of whom many were gained
by the Crown. Besides, that nothing
seemed to concern Property in the
change of Successive, for Elective.
And the example of all Christian
Crowns (besides that of <hi>Poland)</hi> made
way for it; And yet it is certain,
that <hi>Denmark</hi> has continued ever since
weak and unspirited, bent only upon
safety, and enjoying the Revenues of
the <hi>Sound</hi> (which are the chief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that Crown); So as their
great Interest is their defence against
<hi>Sweden,</hi> And for the rest a general
Peace, by which Traffique encreasing
they may come in for a share, and see
their Customs grow in the <hi>Sound</hi> and
<hi>Norway.</hi> They reckon'd chiefly upon
their support from <hi>Holland,</hi> till seeing
them fall into closer measures with Us
and <hi>Sweden,</hi> upon the Tripple Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
They have tacked some points
nearer <hi>France,</hi> and the rather, because
of the unkindness grown in the last
<hi>Dutch</hi> War, between us and them;


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56779:15"/>
Yet they have it at heart, that <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has ever used them insolently,
if not scornfully, in the whole course
of their Treaties and Alliances, as well
as the differences between them about
the payments of the <hi>Sound,</hi> And will
be ever ready and resolute in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> whenever the
<hi>Danes</hi> shall have strength and heart
enough to attaque it, which seems the
chief Ambition they have left them
abroad.</p>
            <p>THE Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> was in all
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second's time lookt
upon as both the terror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Christendom;</hi> No Monarchy
having ever grasped at so great an
Empire there, and at the same time
pursued an open War against so great
a power as the <hi>Turks.</hi> This great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was grown up by the Union of
the House of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> of
that of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
with that of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> By the
accession or conquest of <hi>Portugal,</hi> By
that of the <hi>Indies</hi> (when their Mines
bled fresh, as they did many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their first opening), By the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56779:16"/>
of brave Troops and Leaders;
which were raised and made by the
various and continual Wars of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth; But chiefly by the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
succession of three great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Ferdinand, Charles,</hi> and <hi>Philip;</hi>
Which can never fail of raising a small
Kingdom to a great, no more than the
contrary of bringing down a great one
to a small. But whoever measures the
Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> now, by the Scale of
that Age, may fancy a man of Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score,
by a Picture drawn of him at
Thirty; 'Tis like a great old Tree
which has lost its Branches and Leaves,
<hi>Et trunco non frondibus efficit umbram.</hi>
Though no man knows, whether out
of this old Root a Sucker may not
spring, that with a little shelter at
first, and good seasons, may in time
prove a mighty Tree; For there seems
still to remain strength and sap in the
Root to furnish a fair growth, though
not in proportion to the first. These
decays have been occasioned by so long
a War with <hi>Holland</hi> (supported by
all the Neighbours who envied or
feared the greatness of <hi>Spain),</hi> By the
exhausting in a great degree of their


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56779:16"/>
               <hi>Indian</hi> Mines; By that of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to furnish the <hi>Indian</hi> Conquests,
and secure all their Provinces both in
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> But most of all
by two Successions (which we may
at least call) of unactive Princes, And
the want of any great Ministry to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
either them, or the Minority of
this King, in which they ended. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this Crown out-grow its present
weakness, by some great Spirit rising
up at the head of the Monarchy, who
shall digest their Councels, reform the
vast and impertinent profusions of their
Treasures, by suppressing all unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pensions and Expences, And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the vigor of their Nation by
Martial designs and examples; We
may reckon the Interest of <hi>Spain</hi> to
lye wholly in the preservation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Flanders</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> of
<hi>Sicily</hi> from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and of their
<hi>Indies</hi> from Us. That of <hi>Sicily</hi> seems
more remote, because both <hi>Hungary</hi>
and <hi>Poland</hi> is a nearer Game for the
<hi>Turk,</hi> And will not so generally
alarm or unite the Christian Princes,
as the Invasion of <hi>Sicily,</hi> wherein
<hi>France</hi> as well as <hi>Italy</hi> is so near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56779:17"/>
The jealousie of their <hi>Indies</hi>
has been much nearer them since our
possession of <hi>Jamaica;</hi> And akes at
heart upon every fit which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Sallies of our Privateers there
bring upon them. But they hope to
make fair weather in those Seas, by
opening to us some advantages of
Trade there, And by a Conjunction
of Interests in <hi>Europe,</hi> which they
think the greatness of <hi>France</hi> makes as
necessary to us as to them.</p>
            <p>Their quarrel to <hi>France</hi> by a course
of almost continual Wars ever since
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's time, by the late
pretensions to <hi>Flanders,</hi> set on foot
by <hi>France</hi> since the death of their last
King, and pursued by the late Invasion
(which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend to have
been against all Faith, as well as Right)
seems to be grown wholly incurable,
Though dissembled by the sense of
their own weakness, which makes them
rather willing to deceive themselves
with a Peace, that they know must
fail them, than break out into a War
they fear must ruin them, without the
assistance of their Neighbours. And
this they hope some breach of the


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56779:17"/>
Peace at <hi>Aix</hi> on the <hi>French</hi> side, or
other accidents, may at one time or
other engage for them. And though
as they stand single, their present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is but bare defence, and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out their Kings Minority without
further losses; Yet a greater Interest,
and far more at heart, Is a War with
<hi>France</hi> in Conjunction with the Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Alliance,
or at least with Us and
<hi>Holland.</hi> For though the Peace holds,
Yet while <hi>France</hi> continues so great
Forces and Designs on foot, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Flanders</hi> will cost <hi>Spain
200 m.</hi> pounds a year, besides the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Countrey. And what
is left them in those Provinces remains
so lockt and interwoven with the last
<hi>French</hi> Conquests, that upon the first
breach of a War, It is all endangered;
and indeed cannot be any ways secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but by a strong diversion, which
may imploy the greatest part of the
<hi>French</hi> Forces in some other places.
These regards, and that of being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used (as they conceive) by Us
and <hi>Holland,</hi> in the Peace of <hi>Aix,</hi>
which forced them to quit so much
of their Countrey to <hi>France,</hi> and of


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56779:18"/>
their money to <hi>Sweden,</hi> Have raised
up a party in their Council, that would
make and secure the best Peace they
can with <hi>France,</hi> by a Cession of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
to that Crown, in exchange for
other Provinces towards <hi>Spain,</hi> and
of some other pretensions. But this
will not be carried in a Minority of
their King; at least without greater
fears of a sudden Invasion from <hi>France,</hi>
and greater despairs of help from us.
Because whenever they quit <hi>Flanders,</hi>
they must be content to shut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up within their Mountains, and
signifie nothing more in the Affairs of
<hi>Europe;</hi> Nor could they perhaps long
be safe either in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> if
they were there to sustain all the
Forces of <hi>France,</hi> without the great
diversion they have always made by
<hi>Flanders;</hi> out of which whenever
they are Masters of the field, they
march in four or five days up into the
very Isle of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To compass these two Interests ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of defence or a war in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
they would fain engage <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
but will endanger this Aim, by
the fear of venturing their money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56779:18"/>
the Game begins. They reckon
themselves sure of <hi>Holland</hi> as far as
their defence, but know, they will
never be brought to begin a War with
<hi>France.</hi> And the old rancours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> are not
yet enough worn out of the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the People or the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to make room for such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
turn. Their great hope is in
<hi>England,</hi> where their inclination carries
them as well as their interest. Besides,
they think our old as well as fresh
quarrels with <hi>France,</hi> and the jealousie
of their present growth, will temper
us for their turn at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so that their measures will ever
be fair with us; But no more towards
preserving their Peace, because they
think our Interest as well as our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
will be enough to engage us so
far without other motives. Though
to head a War against <hi>France,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
both <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> would
(as they think) follow our paces;
There is no advantage which the
Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> could make us in
Trade, nor money they could spare
from their own necessities (in the


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56779:19"/>
share of the quarrel) which they
would not willingly furnish us, and
trust to the events of a War how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
soever.</p>
            <p>THE State of <hi>Holland</hi> in point
both of riches, and strength, is
the most prodigious growth that has
been seen in the world; if we reckon
it from their Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which time, though their Forces
were great both at Land and Sea, yet
they were kept down by too violent
exercise; And that Government could
not be said to stand upon its own
legs, Leaning always on their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who were willing to support
them against <hi>Spain,</hi> and feared nothing
from a State so narrow in compass of
Land, and so weak in Native Subjects,
That the strength of their Armies has
ever been made up of forreign Troops.
But since that time, What with the
benefit of their Scituation and Orders
of their Government, The Conduct
of their Ministers (driving on steddy
and publick Interests), The Art, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and Parsimony of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
All conspiring to derive almost


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56779:19"/>
the Trade of the whole World into
their Circle, (while their Neighbours
were taken up either in Civil or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Wars) They have grown so
considerable in the World, that for
many years they have treated upon an
equal Foot with all the great Princes
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and concluded no Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
without advantage. And in
the last War with Us and <hi>Munster,</hi>
were able at the same time to bring
above a hundred men of War to Sea,
and maintain threescore and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men at Land. Besides, the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
or Conquests of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> have in a
manner erected another subordinate
Commonwealth in those parts; Where
upon occasion they have armed five
and forty men of War, and thirty
thousand Land-men by the modestest
computations. Yet the frame of this
State (as of most great Machines made
for rest and not for motion) is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
incapable of making any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
enlargements or conquests up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their neighbours; Which is evident
to all that know their Constitutions:
But needs no other argument besides


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56779:20"/>
their want of Native Subjects to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
any such attempts; What men
they can spare being drawn so wholly
into their trade, and their <hi>East-Indies;</hi>
That they cannot so much as furnish
a Colony for <hi>Surinam,</hi> proportioned
to the safety and plantation of that
place; And no Nation ever made and
held a Conquest by Mercenary Arms.
So that the wounds and fears they can
give their neighbours consists in point
of Trade; In injuries or insolencies at
Sea; In falling with great weight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a ballance with other Princes; In
protecting their Rebels or Fugitives,
And in an arrogant way of treating
with other Princes and States, a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
natural to men bred in popular
Governments, and derived of late
years from the great successes of theirs,
under the present Ministry.</p>
            <p>It may be laid (I believe) for a
Maxim, That no wise State will ever
begin a War unless it be upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Conquests, or necessity of
Defence; For all other Wars serve
only to exhaust Forces and Treasure,
and end in untoward Peaces, patcht
up out of weakness or weariness of


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56779:20"/>
the parties: Therefore the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
unless invaded either at home or
in <hi>Flanders</hi> (which they esteem now
the same case, if it comes from <hi>France),</hi>
can have no interest to offer at a War;
But find their greatest in continuing
their course of Traffique uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and enjoying the advantages which
in that point their industry and address
will gain them from all their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
And for these ends they will
endeavour to preserve the Peace now
in being, And bandy by Leagues
and Negotiations against any from
whom they shall fear a breach of
it.</p>
            <p>They will ever seek to preserve
themselves by an Alliance with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
against <hi>France,</hi> and by that of
<hi>France</hi> against <hi>England,</hi> as they did
formerly by both against <hi>Spain.</hi> And
they will fall into all Conjuctures
which may serve to ballance in some
measure the two lesser Crowns of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
and <hi>Denmark,</hi> as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> But because
they believe, that good Arms are as
necessary to keep Peace, as to make
War; They will always be Great in


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56779:21"/>
their preparations of that kind, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at Sea; By which they may in
all cases, advance or secure their Trade,
And upon a War with <hi>France,</hi> make
up that way the weakness of their
Land-Forces, Which a long rust of
Peace, and a swarm of Officers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by the Magistrates in favour
of their relations, has brought to be
very disproportioned in Force to what
they are in Number. They esteem
themselves secure from <hi>Spain</hi> and their
<hi>German</hi> Neighbours (upon what has
been said of the present condition of
those Princes). And from Us, not
so much upon our late Treaties with
them, as upon what they take to be
the common Interest, which they think
a Nation can never run over, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is the opposing any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of the <hi>French</hi> greatness. Their
only danger they apprehend, is from
<hi>France,</hi> and that not immediately to
themselves, but to <hi>Flanders;</hi> where
any Flame would soon scorch them,
and consume them, if not quenched
in time. But in regard of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Spain,</hi> The slow motions of
the <hi>Empire,</hi> The different paces among


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56779:21"/>
the Princes of it, And the distance of
<hi>Sweden;</hi> They esteem the Peace of
<hi>Christendom</hi> to depend wholly upon
His Majesty, as well as the safety of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> in case of a War. For they
think <hi>France</hi> will be dared, and never
take wing while they see such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Power as Ours and the <hi>Dutch</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
about all their Coasts; And so
many other Princes ready to fall in,
whenever His Majesty declares, united
by the same jealousies or dangers. And
if they should open a War, they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
the consumption which <hi>France</hi>
must fall into by the stop of their Wine,
Salts, and other Commodities (now
in a manner wholly taken off by our
two Nations). And the head that
may be made against their Forces in
the Field it self, by a Body of <hi>English</hi>
Infantry (so much renowned abroad).
So as though their first Interest be to
continue the Peace, while it may be
done with any safety; yet when that
fails, their next is, to open a War in
favour of <hi>Spain,</hi> and conjunction with
us. And the greatest they have in
the world, is to preserve and encrease
their Alliance with us; Which will


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56779:22"/>
make them follow our measures ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
in all the present Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p>THE Crown of <hi>France</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the extent of Countrey,
in the number of People, in the riches
of Commodities, in the Revenues of
the King, the greatness of the Land-Forces
now on foot, and the growth
of those at Sea (within these two
years past), the number and bravery
of their Officers, the conduct of their
Ministers, and chiefly in the Genius
of their present King; A Prince of
great aspiring thoughts, unwearied
application to whatever is in pursuit,
severe in the institution and preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Order and Discipline; In the
main, a Manager of his Treasure, and
yet bountiful from his own motions,
wherever he intends the marks of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and discerns particular Merit. To
this, in the flower of his Age, at the
head of all his Armies, and hitherto
unfoiled in any of his attempts, either
at home or abroad: I say, considered
in all these circumstances, <hi>France</hi> may
appear to be designed for greater At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56779:22"/>
and Empires, than have
been seen in Christendom since that of
<hi>Charlemaigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The present Greatness of this Crown,
may be chiefly derived from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
it has had of two great Ministers
<hi>(Richelieu</hi> and <hi>Mazarine)</hi> succeeding
one another, between two great Kings,
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth and this present
Prince; so as during the course of one
unactive life, and of a long Minority,
That Crown gained a great deal of
ground both at home and abroad, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of losing it; Which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fate of Kingdoms upon those oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
            <p>The latter greatness of this Crown
began in the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi>
by the Spoils of the House of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
and the Divisions of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which gave that King the heart of
attempting to bring the Government
(as he called it) <hi>Hors de Page;</hi> Being
before controul'd by their Princes, and
restrained by their States; And in
point of Revenue, kept within the
bounds of the Kings Demesnes, and
the Subjects voluntary Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56779:23"/>
'Tis not here necessary to observe,
by what difficulties and dangers to the
Crown, this design of <hi>Lewis</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by many succeeding Kings, like a
great Stone forced up a Hill, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every slacking of either strength or
care, rolling a great way back, often to
the very bottom of the Hill, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with the destruction of those
that forced it on, till the time of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richelieu.</hi> It was in this great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
most to be admired, that finding
the Regency shaken by the Factions of
so many great ones within, and awed
by the terror of the <hi>Spanish</hi> greatness
without; He durst resolve to look
them both in the face, and begin a
War, by the course of which for so
many years (being pursued by <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
till the year 60), The Crown of
<hi>France</hi> grew to be powerfully armed,
The Peasants were accustomed to Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(which could have seemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
only by a War, and which none
but a successful one could have helpt to
digest), and grew heartless as they grew
poor. The Princes were sometimes sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with Commands of the Army,
sometimes mortified and supprest by


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56779:23"/>
the absoluteness or addresses of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry;
The most boiling blood of the
Nobility and Gentry was let out in so
long a War, or wasted with Age and
Exercise; At last it ended at the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reenes</hi>
in a Peace, and a Match so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to <hi>France;</hi> As the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them contributed much to the
Authority of the young King, who
bred up in the Councils, and served by
the tried Instruments of the former
Ministry, But most of all advantaged
by his own personal Qualities, fit to
make him obeyed; Grew absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Factions of the great men,
as well as the purses of his people. In
the beginning of his Minority, the two
disputes, with the Pope about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of the <hi>Corsi,</hi> and with the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> about the encounter at <hi>London,</hi>
between the Count <hi>D'Estrades</hi> and the
Baron <hi>De Batteville</hi> (Ambassadors from
those Crowns), both carried so high,
and both ended so honourably, and to
the very will of <hi>France,</hi> Were enough
to give a young Prince the humour and
appetite of trying yet further what
there was could oppose him. The Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and easie success in <hi>Flanders,</hi> fed


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56779:24"/>
his Glory, and encreast the reputation of
his Power; Till this career was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Peace at first, then the
Alliances between Us and <hi>Holland,</hi> and
afterwards the Peace at <hi>Aix,</hi> and the
Tripple Alliance (contracted purposely
to secure it), since which time the
Counsels of that Court have turned
wholly from Action to Negotiation; Of
which no man can yet see the success,
nor judg whether it may not be more
prosperous to them than that of their
Arms.</p>
            <p>If there were any certain heighth
where the flights of Power and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
use to end, one might imagine,
that the Interest of <hi>France</hi> were but
to conserve its present Greatness, so
feared by its Neighbours, and so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the world: But besides, that the
motions and desires of human minds are
endless, It may perhaps be necessary for
<hi>France</hi> (from respects within) to have
some War or other in pursuit abroad,
which may amuse the Nation, and keep
them from reflecting upon their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at home, Hard and uneasie to all
but such as are in charge, or in pay
from the Court. I do not say misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56779:24"/>
(the term usually given it), because
no condition is so, but to him that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems
it so; And if a <hi>Paisan</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> thinks of no more, than his
coarse Bread and his Onions, his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vass
Clothes and Wooden Shooes, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
contentedly on Working-days,
and dances or plays merrily on Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days;
He may, for ought I know, live
as well as a <hi>Boor</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> who is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weary of his very ease, or whose
cares of growing still richer and richer,
waste his life in toils at Land, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
at Sea; and perhaps fool him so
far, as to make him enjoy less of all
kind in his riches, than t'other in his
poverty.</p>
            <p>But to leave strains of Philosophy,
which are ill mingled with discourses
of Interest: The common people of
<hi>France</hi> are as little considerable in the
Government, as the Children; so that
the Nobles and the Soldiers may in a
manner be esteemed the Nation;
Whose Interest and Hopes carry them
all to War; And whatever is the general
humour and bent of a Nation, ought
ever to be much considered by a State,
which can hardly miscarry in the pursuit


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56779:25"/>
of it. Besides, the Personal Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the King, Active and Aspiring,
And many circumstances in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(fitter for persons of that Court,
than Strangers to pretend the knowledg
of), The continual encrease of their
Forces in time of peace, and their fresh
Invasion of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> are enough to
perswade most men, that the design of
this Crown is a War, whenever they
can open it with a prospect of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to purpose; For their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
are too wise, To venture much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hopes of little gains. What the
aims of <hi>France</hi> are in this kind, I will
not pretend to judg by common fears,
or the Schemes of men too ingeniously
politique; Nor perhaps can any one
tell any more than a man that leaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the water in strength and vigor, and
with pleasure, can say how far he will
swim; Which will be, till he is stopt
by currents, or accidents, or grows
weary, or has a mind to do something
else. One may judg, that if <hi>France</hi> will
begin a War, it would be naturally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Flanders;</hi> unless discouraged by
the same Alliances which prevailed
with them to end the last; so as the


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56779:25"/>
plain present Interest of <hi>France,</hi> is one
way or other to break the confidence
or the force of that Tripple Alliance,
which alone seems to bound their
prospect, which way soever they look;
And if once laid open, they have the
World and their Fortunes before them;
which is enough for a Crown that
has so much Force, and so much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
to manage them. Having little
hopes of breaking this on the <hi>Dutch</hi>
side, and knowing the <hi>Swede</hi> will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our measures in it, We may be
sure of all address, and all the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that can any way be infused;
and in short, all sorts of endeavours
and applications that can be used, to
break it on ours, Which seems to be
the present Game of that Crown,
and that they will begin no other till
they see an end of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FLanders</hi> cannot be considered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from <hi>Spain</hi> in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but may in the inclinations of
the people, which must ever have a
great influence upon it. They are
the best Subjects in the World, but
may have some reason to be weary


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56779:26"/>
of being the Theater of almost perpetual
Wars; and where those two mighty
Crowns have fought so many Battels,
and seem to have still so many more to
fight, If the Neighbour-assistances fall
in to balance their powers, now so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
matched. Therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Inhabitants of those <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Provinces seems to be, either that
the present Peace should be kept invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
by the strength and reputation of
the present Alliances; Or else, that a
War when it opens should have a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
issue; Which might be expected,
either from the <hi>French</hi> Conquest, or a
Proposition of Exchange. They are
naturally averse from the <hi>French</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as they are inclined to the
<hi>Spanish;</hi> but have so little kindness
for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or esteem of their
Land-Forces, that they hardly either
hope or care to be saved by their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
So as the reputation of His
Majesties Protection and Alliance, is all
that can inspire them with the hopes of
a lasting Peace, or the courage to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves by a War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56779:26"/>
FRom the Survey of all these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Interests, and Forces, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
that compose the present state
of all our Neighbours; It may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
and unquestionably concluded,
That a continuance of the present mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
The opening of new ones, Or an
absolute revolution of all, depends
wholly upon those His Majesty shall
take or pursue in this great Conjuncture,
wherein He seems to be generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for the sole Arbiter of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Interest abroad must lye in
one of these points.</p>
            <p>Either to preserve our present Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
and thereby the Peace of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi>
as it now stands.</p>
            <p>Or to encourage <hi>France</hi> to an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Holland,</hi> with assurance of our
Neutrality.</p>
            <p>Or else to join with <hi>France</hi> upon the
advantages they can offer us, for the
ruin of the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the first is to be considered,
Whether with a longer Peace, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with so great


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56779:27"/>
Revenues, and such application as is
seen in their Governments, will not
encrease every year out of proportion
to what ours will do; The Revenues
of <hi>France</hi> arising originally from the
vent of their Native Commodities;
and those of <hi>Holland</hi> growing wholly
out of Trade, and that out of Peace.</p>
            <p>Upon the second, Whether <hi>France</hi>
will ever resolve upon the Invasion of
<hi>Holland;</hi> Or <hi>Holland</hi> upon its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
defence, without our share in
the War, which would otherwise leave
us to enjoy the Trade of the World,
and thereby to grow vastly both in
Strength and Treasures, whilest both
these Powers were breaking one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Or whether the jealousie of such
a design in us, would not induce <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> either before a War, or
soon after it begins, To close upon some
measures between them to our disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as We and <hi>Holland</hi> did after
the last War, to the disadvantage of
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the last, Whether by the ruin
of <hi>Holland,</hi> we can reap as great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
as <hi>France</hi> (though perhaps
greater were necessary to make some


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56779:27"/>
equality in our Powers). And to gain
a fair prospect of this, it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
Whether <hi>Holland</hi> upon its fall
would grow an accession to the <hi>French,</hi>
or to Us; Or live under the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> as a Soveraign Prince, with our
support or protection. Whether <hi>France</hi>
would be content with either of these
last; or to see us grow absolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Sea, by the fall or subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Holland,</hi> any more than by their
Conjunction and Alliance. Whether
we could be able to defend the Maritime
Provinces, either in our own subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or in that of the Prince, whilest
<hi>France</hi> remained possest of all the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
of that State (which are their
Inland Provinces, their Towns in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi>
and upon the <hi>Rhine);</hi> Whether
we could on the other side hinder the
accession of <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> either
as Subjects in a Maritime Province
(with great Priviledges and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for continuance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Trade), Or as an inferior and
dependant Ally under their protection.
Whether in either of these cases, our
Government would have credit enough
in <hi>Holland</hi> to invite their Shipping and


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56779:28"/>
Traders to come over and settle in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and so leave those Provinces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of both. Whether it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to preserve <hi>Flanders</hi> after the loss
of <hi>Holland,</hi> Or upon the Conquest of
those Countries by <hi>France,</hi> For us to
preserve our peace or good intelligence
with that King, Or upon a War to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
our selves, either by our own
Forces, or the Alliances of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>But though these Arguments may
deserve the most serious deliberations
of Ministers at home; Yet I know they
lye out of the compass of my duty, and
are improper for the representations of
a man, the course of whose Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and thoughts for so long a time
has lain wholly abroad.</p>

their statures, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,

by the force

            <p>Thus the more Northern, and more
Southern Nations (extreams as they
say still agreeing) have ever lived
under single and Arbitrary Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
as all the Regions of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and
<hi>Muscovy</hi> on the one side: and of <hi>Africk</hi>
and <hi>India</hi> on the other. While those
under the more temperate Climates,
especially in <hi>Europe,</hi> have ever been
used to more moderate Governments,
Running anciently much into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
and of latter ages into
Principalities bounded by Laws, which
differ less in Nature than in Name.</p>
            <p>For though the old distinctions run
otherwise, there seem to be but two
general kinds of Government in the
world. The one exercised according
to the Arbitrary commands and will
of some single Person. And the other
according to certain Orders or Laws
introduced by agreement or custom,
and not to be changed without the
consent of many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56779:30"/>
But under each of these may fall
many more particular kinds, than can
be reduced to the common heads of
Government received in the Schools.
For those of the first sort, differ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the dispositions and humours
of Him that Rules, and of them that
obey: As Feavers do according to the
temper of the persons, and accidents
of the seasons. And those of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort, differ according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or number of the persons upon
whom is devolved the authority of
making, or power of executing Laws.</p>
            <p>Nor will any man, that understands
the State of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the <hi>Vnited
Provinces,</hi> be well able to range them
under any particular names of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that have been yet invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The great Scenes of Action, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Ancient Story, <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi>
and <hi>Sicily,</hi> were all divided into small
Commonwealths, till swallowed up
and made Provinces by that mighty
one of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with <hi>Spain,
Gaule,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> These were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
composed of many small Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
among which the Cities were


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56779:30"/>
generally under Commonwealths, and
the Countreys under several Princes:
Who were Generals in their Wars, but
in peace lived without Armies or Guards,
or any Instruments of Arbitrary Power:
And were only chief of their Councils,
and of those Assemblies by whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations,
and authority, the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
and actions among them were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
and enterprized.</p>
            <p>Through all these Regions some of
the smaller States, but chiefly those of
the Cities, fell often under Tyrannies:
Which spring naturally out of Popular
Governments. While the meaner sort
of the people opprest, or ill protected
by the richer, and greater, give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to the conduct of some one
man in chief credit among them; and
submit all to his will and discretion:
either running easily from one extream
to another, or contented to see those
they hated and feared before, now in
equal condition with themselves. Or,
because a multitude is incapable of
framing Orders, though capable of
conserving them: Or that every man
comes to find by experience, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and popular tumults have worse


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56779:31"/>
effects upon common safety than the
rankest Tyranny. For it is easier to
please the humour, and either appease
or resist the fury of one single man, than
of a multitude. And taking each of
them in their extreams, the rage of a
Tyrant may be like that of fire, which
consumes what it reaches but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and devouring one house after
another; whereas the rage of people
is like that of the Sea, which once
breaking bounds, overflows a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
with that suddenness and violence,
as leaves no hopes either of flying or
resisting, till with the change of tides
or winds it returns of it self.</p>
            <p>The force and variety of accidents
is so great, that it will not perhaps
bear reasoning, or enquiry how it
comes about, that single Arbitrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
seems to have been natural to
<hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk:</hi> and the other sort
to <hi>Europe.</hi> For though <hi>Carthage</hi> was
indeed a Commonwealth in <hi>Africk,</hi> and
<hi>Macedon</hi> a Kingdom in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet
the first was not Native of that Soyl
(being a Colony of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> as
there were some other small ones of
he <hi>Grecians</hi> upon the same Coasts)


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56779:31"/>
and the Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> Governed
by Laws, and the consent as well as
Councils of the Nobles. Not like the
Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> by humour and will,
as appears by the event of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
while so few Subjects conquered
so many Slaves.</p>
            <p>Yet one reason may be that <hi>Sicily,
Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> (which were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Commonwealths) were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thick with rich and populous Cities
(occasioned by their being so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
with the Sea). And the vein
of all rich Cities ever inclines to that
kind of Government. Whether it be
that where many grow Rich, many
grow to power, and are harder to be
subjected. Or where men grow to great
possessions, they grow more intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
safety, and therefore desire to be
Governed by Laws and Magistrates of
their own choice, fearing all Armed
and Arbitrary Power: Or that the
small compass of Cities makes the ease
and convenience of Assemblies and
Councils. Or that conversation sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
mens wits, and makes too many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
in matters of Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56779:32"/>
The contrary of all this happens in
Countries thin inhabited, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in vast <hi>Campania's,</hi> such as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
through <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> where
there are few Cities, besides what grow
by the residence of the Kings or their
Governours. The people are poorer,
and having little to lose, have little to
care for, and are less exposed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of power or violence. The assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of persons deputed from people
at great distances one from another, is
trouble to them that are sent, and
charge to them that send. And where
ambition and avarice have made no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
the desire of leasure is much
more natural, than of business and
care; besides, Men conversing all their
lives with the Woods, and the Fields,
and the Herds, more than with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
come to know as little as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
Use their Senses a great deal more
than their Reasons, examine not the
nature or the tenure of Power and
Authority; find only they are fit to
obey, because they are not fit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.
And so come to submit to the
will of him they found in Power, as
they do the will of Heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56779:32"/>
all changes of conditions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to them under good or bad Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
like good or ill Seasons that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the Weather and the Air.</p>
            <p>It may be said further, that in the
more intemperate Climates, the spirits
either exhal'd by heat, or comprest by
cold, are rendred faint and sluggish,
and by that reason the men grow ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and fitter for servitude. That in
more temperate Regions the spirits are
stronger, and more active, whereby
men become bolder in the defence or
recovery of their liberties.</p>
            <p>But all Government is a restraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
liberty; And under all, The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
is equally absolute, where it is
in the last resort.</p>
            <p>So that when men seem to contend
for Liberty, it is indeed but for the
change of those that rule, or for the
forms of Government they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been used to; and (being grown
weary of the present) now begin to
regret; though when they enjoyed
them, it was not without some pressure
and complaint. Nor can it be in the
other case; that when vast numbers of
men submit their lives and fortunes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56779:33"/>
to the Will of one, it should
be want of heart, but must be force of
custom, or opinion, the true ground
and foundation of all Government,
and that which subjects Power to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<hi>For Power arising from
Strength, is always in those that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
who are many: But Authority
arising from opinion, is in those that
Govern, who are few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This distinction is plain in the forms
of the old <hi>Roman</hi> State, where Laws
were made, and resolutions taken, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate
Senatus,</hi> and <hi>Jussu populi.</hi> The
Senate were Authors of all Counsels
in the State; and what was by them
consulted and agreed, was proposed
to the People: By whom it was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or commanded, because in them
was the power to make it be obeyed.
But the great opinion which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had at first of the persons of the
Senators, and afterwards of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
(which were called <hi>Patricians)</hi>
gained easie assent to what was thus
proposed; the Authority of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
adding great weight to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the things. And this went so
far, that though the choice of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56779:33"/>
was wholly in the people, yet
for a long course of years, they chose
none but <hi>Patricians</hi> into the great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of State, either Civil or Military.
But when the People began to lose the
general opinion they had of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians,</hi>
or at least so far as to believe
some among themselves were as able,
and fit as these, to advise the State, and
lead their Armies: They then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to share with the Senate in the
Magistracy, and bring in <hi>Plebeians</hi> to
the Offices of chiefest Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And hereupon began those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
which so long distempered, and
at length ruined that State.</p>
            <p>AUthority arises from the opinion
of Wisdom, Goodness, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
in the persons who possess it.</p>
            <p>Wisdom, As that which makes men
judg what are the best ends, and what
the best means to attain them; and
gives a man advantage among the weak
and the ignorant; as sight among the
blind, which is that of Counsel and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
This gives Authority to Age
among the younger, till these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at certain years to change their


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56779:34"/>
opinion of the old, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
This gives it more absolute
to a Pilot at Sea, whom all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
suffer to steer them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>Goodness, As that which makes
men prefer their Duty and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
before their Passions, or their
Interest; and is properly the object of
Trust. In our Language, it goes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the name of Honesty; though
what we call an honest man, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
called a good man; and honesty
in their Language, as well as in <hi>French,</hi>
rather signifies a composition of those
qualities which generally acquire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and esteem to those who possess
them.</p>
            <p>Valour, As it gives awe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
protection to those who want
either heart or strength to defend
themselves. This makes the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Men among Women; and that
of a Master-Buck in a numerous herd,
though perhaps not strong enough for
any two of them; but the impression
of single fear holds when they are all
together, by the ignorance of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56779:34"/>
Eloquence, As it passes for a mark
of Wisdom; Beauty of Goodness, And
Nobility of Valour (which was its
original) have likewise ever some effect
upon the opinion of the People; but a
very great one when they are really
joined with the qualities they promise
or resemble.</p>
            <p>There is yet another source from
which usually springs greater Authority
than from all the rest, which is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Divine Favour, or designation
of the persons, or of the races that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.
This made the Kings among the
Heathens ever derive themselves, or
their Ancestors from some god; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thereby for Heroes, that is, persons
issued from the mixture of divine and
humane race, and of a middle nature
between gods and men: others joyned
the Miter to the Crown, and thereby
the reverence of Divine, to the respect
of Civil Power.</p>
            <p>This made the <hi>Caliphs</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> and
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and the great Emperors of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> derive themselves by several
branches from their great Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet:</hi>
The <hi>Yncas</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> from the
Sun: And the <hi>Ottoman</hi> race to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56779:35"/>
among the <hi>Turks,</hi> as designed by
Heaven for perpetual Empire. And
the sacring of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> (as
<hi>Loysel</hi> says) is the sign of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Priesthood, as well as Kingdom;
and in the right thereof they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of holding all vacant Benefices of
the Church.</p>
            <p>Piety, As it is thought a way to the
favour of God, and Fortune as it looks
like the effect either of that or at least
of Prudence and Courage, beget Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
As likewise splendor of living
in great Palaces, with numerous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
much observance, and rich ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
differing from common men: Both
as it seems to be the reward of those
Virtues already named, or the effect
of Fortune; or as it is a mark of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obeyed by many.</p>
            <p>From all these Authority arises, but
is by nothing so much strengthned and
confirmed as by custom. For no man
easily distrusts the persons, or disputes
the things which he and all men that
he knows of, have been always bred
up to observe, and believe; or if he
does, he will hardly hope, or venture
to introduce opinions wherein he knows


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56779:35"/>
none, or few of his mind, and thinks
all others will defend those already
received; so as no man, nor party can
offer at the change of a Government
establisht, without first gaining new
Authority by the steps already traced
out; and in some degree debasing the
old, by appearance or impressions of
contrary qualities in those who before
enjoyed it. This induces a general
change of opinion, concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or party like to be obeyed, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the greatect or strongest part
of the people: according to which the
power or weakness of each is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.
So as in effect all Government
may be esteemed to grow strong or
weak, as the general opinion of these
qualities in those that Govern, is seen
to lessen or increase.</p>
            <p>And Power must be allowed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Authority in all Civil Bodies; as
in Natural the motions of the body
follow those of the mind, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
ever acting and pursuing what
the few (whom they trust) begin or
advise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:56779:36"/>
FRom this Principle, and from the
discovery of some natural Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
may perhaps be deduced a truer
original of all Governments among
men, than from any Contracts: though
these be given us by the great Writers
concerning Politicks and Laws. Some
of them lay for their foundation, That
men are sociable creatures, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
disposed to live in numbers and
troops together. Others, That they
are naturally creatures of prey, and in
a state of war one upon another; so
as to avoid confusion in the first case,
and violence in the other, they found
out the necessity of agreeing upon some
Orders and Rules, by which every man
gives up his common Right for some
particular possession, and his power to
hurt and spoil others, for the priviledg
of not being hurt or spoiled himself.
And the agreement upon such Orders,
by mutual Contract, with the consent
to execute them, by common strength
and endeavours, They make to be the
rise of all Civil Governments.</p>
            <p>I know not whether they consider
what it is that makes some creatures so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable,


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56779:36"/>
and others live and range more
alone, or in smaller companies; but I
suppose those creatures whose natural
and necessary food is easie and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as Grass, or Plants, or Fruits (the
common product of the earth) are
the sociable creatures, because where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they go, they usually find what
they want, and enough for them all
without industry or contention. And
those live more alone whose food (and
therefore prey) is upon other sensitive
creatures, and so not attained without
pursuit and violence, and seldom in
such quantities at once, as to satisfy
the hunger of great numbers together.
Yet this does not hold so far, but that
Ravens are seen in flocks where a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion
lies, and Wolves in herds to run
down a Deer. Nay they feed quietly
together while there is enough for them
all: Quarrel only when it begins to
fail, and when 'tis ended they scatter
to seek out new encounters. Besides,
those called sociable, quarrel in hunger
and in lust, as well as the others; and
the Bull and the Ram appear then as
much in fury and war, as the Lyon
and the Bear. So that if Mankind must


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56779:37"/>
be ranged to one of these sorts, I know
not well to which it will be: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the great differences of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
and dispositions in several men,
and even in the same men at several
times, I very much doubt they must
be divided into several forms. Nor do I
know, if men are like sheep, why they
need any Government: or if they are
like Wolves, how they can suffer it.
Nor have I read where the Orders of
any State have been agreed on by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Contract among great numbers of
men, meeting together in that natural
state of War; where every man takes
himself to have equal right to every
thing. But often where such Orders
have been invented by the Wisdom,
and received by the Authority of some
one man, under the name of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver;
And where this has not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
the original of Government
lyes as undiscovered in story, as that of
Time. All Nations appearing upon
the first Records that are left us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Authority of Kings, or Princes,
or some other Magistrates.</p>
            <p>Besides, this principle of contract as
the original of Government, seems cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56779:37"/>
for the account, given by
some of the old Poets of the original
of man; whom they raise out of the
ground by great numbers at a time in
perfect Stature and Strength. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if we deduce the several races of
mankind in the several parts of the
World from generation; we must ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the first numbers of them who in
any place agree upon any civil consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
to assemble not as so many
single heads, but as so many heads of
families, whom they represent, in the
framing any Compact or common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
and consequently as persons,
who have already an Authority over
such numbers as their families are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of.</p>
            <p>For if we consider a Man multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Kind by the birth of many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and his Cares by providing even
necessary food for them, till they are
able to do it for themselves (which
happens much later to the generations
of men, and makes a much longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
of children upon Parents,
than we can observe among any other
creatures) If we consider not only the
cares but the industry he is forced to,


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56779:38"/>
for the necessary sustenance of his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
brood, either in gathering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fruits, or raising those which are
purchased with labour and toil; if he
be forced for supply of this stock to
catch the tamer creatures, and hunt
the wilder, sometimes to exercise his
courage in defending his little Family,
and fighting with the strong and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Beasts (that would prey upon
him, as he does upon the weak and the
mild) if we suppose him disposing
with discretion and order, what-ever
he gets among his Children, according
to each of their hunger or need, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
laying up for to morrow, what
was more than enough for to day: at
other times pinching himself rather
than suffering any of them should want.
And as each of them grows up, and
able to share in the common support,
teaching him both by lesson and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
what he is now to do as the
Son of this family, and what hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the Father of another; instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them all, what qualities are good,
and what are ill for their health and
life, or common Society (which will
certainly comprehend whatever is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56779:38"/>
esteemed virtue or vice among
men) cherishing and encouraging dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
to the good; disfavouring
and punishing those to the ill: And
lastly, Among the various accidents of
Life, lifting up his eyes to Heaven,
when the earth affords him no relief;
and having recourse to a higher and a
greater nature, whenever he finds the
frailty of his own: We must needs
conclude, that the Children of this
Man cannot fail of being bred up with
a great opinion of his Wisdom, his
Goodness, his Valour, and his Piety.
And if they see constant plenty in the
Family, they believe well of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
too.</p>
            <p>And from all this must naturally
arise a great paternal Authority, which
disposes his Children (at least till the
age when they grow Fathers themselves)
to believe what he teaches, to follow
what he advises, and obey what he
commands.</p>
            <p>Thus the Father, by a natural Right
as well as Authority, becomes a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in this little State: and if his life
be long, and his generations many (as
well as those of his Children) He grows


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56779:39"/>
the Governour or King of a Nation,
and is indeed a <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> as the best
Kings are, and as all should be; and
as those which are not, are yet content
to be called. Thus the peculiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
of the Kings in <hi>France,</hi> is by
the name of <hi>Sire,</hi> which in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
language is nothing else but Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and denotes the Prince to be the
Father of the Nation. For a Nation
properly signifies a great number of
Families, derived from the same Blood,
born in the same Countrey, and living
under the same Government and Civil
Constitutions: As <hi>Patria</hi> does the land
of our Father; and so the <hi>Dutch</hi> by
expressions of deerness, instead of our
Countrey, say our <hi>Father-land.</hi> With
such Nations we find in Scripture all
the Lands of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the adjacent
Territories, were planted of old. With
such the many several Provinces of
<hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> when they began first
to appear upon the Records of Ancient
Story or Tradition. And with such
was the main Land of <hi>Gaul</hi> inhabited
in the time of <hi>Caesar;</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> in
that of <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Such were the many
Branches of the old <hi>British</hi> Nation;


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56779:39"/>
the <hi>Scepts</hi> among the <hi>Irish.</hi> And such
the infinite variety and numbers of
Nations in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America</hi> upon
the first discoveries, distinguisht by
their several names, and living under
their several Kings or Princes, till they
came to be swallowed up by greater
Empires.</p>
            <p>These seem to have been the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and original Governments of the
World, springing from a tacite defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of many to the Authority of
one single Person. Under Him (if the
Father of the Family or Nation) the
elder of his Children comes to acquire
a degree of Authority among the
younger by the same means the Father
did among them; and to share with
him in the consultation and conduct
of their common affairs. And this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with an opinion of Wisdom
from experience, may have brought in
the Authority of the Elders, so often
mentioned among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and in
general of aged men, not only in <hi>Sparta</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> but all other places in some
degree, both civil and barbarous. For
the names of Lord, <hi>Signior, Seigneur,
Senor,</hi> in the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>


               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:56779:40"/>
Languages, seem to have at first
imported only elder men, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
were grown into Authority among
the several Governments and Nations,
which seated themselves in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
upon the fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>This perhaps brought in Vogue that
which is called the Authority of the
Ancients in matters of opinion, though
by a mistaken sense: for I suppose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
may be reasonably allowed to
the opinions of ancient men in the
present age; but I know not why it
should be so to those of men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
that lived in ages long since past;
nor why one age of the World should
be wiser than another; or if it be,
why it should not be rather the latter
than the former; as having the same
advantage of the general experience
of the World, that an old man has
of the more particular experiments of
life.</p>
            <p>THus a Family seems to become a
little Kingdom, and a Kingdom
to be but a great Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56779:40"/>
Nor is it unlikely that this Paternal
Jurisdiction in its successions, and with
the help of accidents, may have branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out into the several heads of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
commonly received in the
Schools. For a Family Governed
with order, will fall naturally to the
several Trades of Husbandry, which
are Tillage, Gardening, and Pasturage
(the product whereof was the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
riches) For the managing of these,
and their encrease, and the assistance
of one man, who perhaps is to feed
twenty, it may be a hundred children
(since it is not easily told how far Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
may extend, with the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
choice and numbers of women,
practised anciently in most Countries)
the use of servants comes to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
These are gained by victory and
captives, or by fugitives out of some
worse governed Family, where either
they cannot or like not to live, and so
sell their liberty to be assured of what
is necessary to life. Or else by the
debased nature of some of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
who seem born to drudgery, or
who are content to encrease their pains
that they may lessen their cares; and


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56779:41"/>
upon such terms become servants to
some of their brothers, whom they
most esteem or chuse soonest to live
with.</p>
            <p>The Family thus encreased, is still
under the Fathers common, though not
equal care; that what is due to the
servants by Contract, or what is fit for
them to enjoy, may be provided, as
well as the portions of the Children:
And that whatever they acquire by
their industry or ingenuity (beyond
what the Masters expect, or exact from
them by the conditions of their servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude)
should be as much their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as any divisions of Land or of Stock
that are made to the Sons; and the
possession as secure, unless forfeited by
any demerit or offence against the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of the Family, which grow with
time to be the orders of this little
State.</p>
            <p>Now the Father of a Family or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that uses his Servants like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in point of Justice and Care; and
advises with his Children in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Commonweal, and thereby
is willingly followed and obeyed by
them all: Is what I suppose the Schools


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56779:41"/>
mean by a Monarch. And he that by
harshness of nature, wilfulness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
intemperance of passions, and
arbitrariness of commands, uses his
Children like Servants, is what they
mean by a Tyrant. And whereas the
first thought himself safe in the love
and obedience of his Children, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowing that he is feared, and
hated by them; thinks he cannot be
safe among his children, but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
arms into the hands of such of his
Servants as he thinks most at his will;
which is the original of Guards. For
against a Forreign Enemy, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of evident Interest, all that can
bear Arms in a Nation are Soldiers.
Their Cause is common safety; their
Pay is Honour: And when they have
purchased these, they return to their
homes, and former conditions of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
lives. Such were all the Armies
of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the first
Ages of their States. Such were their
<hi>Gens d' ordonnance</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the
Trainbands in <hi>England:</hi> but standing
Troops, and in constant pay, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Servants armed, who use the
Lance and the Sword, as other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56779:42"/>
do the Sickle, or the Bill at the
command and will of those who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them. And therefore Martial
Law is of all other the most absolute,
and not like the Government of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but a Master.</p>
            <p>And this brings in another sort of
Power, distinct from that already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
which follows Authority, and
consists in the willing obedience of the
people: But this in the command of
Soldiers who as Servants are bound to
execute the Will and Orders of those
that Lead them. And as Authority
follows the qualities before-mentioned;
so this Power follows Riches, or the
opinion of it; a multitude of Servants
being his that is able to maintain them.
And these kind of forces come to be
used by good Princes only upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of providing for their defence
against great and armed neighbours or
enemies; But by ill ones as a support
of decayed Authority, or as they lose
the force of that which is Natural and
Paternal, and so grow to set up an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of those that Govern, different
from that of those that are Governed,
which ought ever to be the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56779:42"/>
Yet this seems a much weaker princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Government than the other; for
the number of Soldiers can never be
great in proportion to that of People,
no more than the number of those
that are idle in a Country, to that of
those who live by labour or industry:
so as if the people come to unite by
any strong passion, or general interest,
or under the wise conduct of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
well rooted in their minds,
They are Masters of Armies. Besides,
the humour of the People runs insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
among the very Soldiers, so as it
seems much alike to keep off by
Guards, a general infection, or an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
sedition: for the distemper in
both kinds is contagious, and seizes
upon the defenders themselves. Besides,
common pay is a faint principle of
Courage and Action, in comparison of
Religion, Liberty, Honour, Revenge,
or Necessity; which make every Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
have the quarrel as much at heart
as their Leaders, and seem to have spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
all the great Actions, and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of the World. And lastly,
without the force of Authority, this
Power of Soldiers grows pernicious to


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56779:43"/>
their Master, who becomes their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and is in danger of their muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
as much as any Government can be
of the seditions of a people.</p>
            <p>If the Father of our Family govern
it with Prudence, Goodness, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
and his eldest Son appear Heir to
the virtues and worth of his Father;
He succeeds in the Government by a
Natural Right, and by the Strength of
an Authority both derived from his
Father, and acquired by His own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
qualities: but if either the eldest
Son by qualities degenerate and ill,
happen to lose all trust and opinion,
and thereby (Authority) in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Or else to dye before his time, and
leave a Child in his room; when the
Father comes to fail, then the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
fall into Councils of Election,
and either prefer the eldest of the Sons
then living, or perhaps one later, and
so remoter in birth, according as He
may have acquired Authority by those
qualities which naturally produce it,
and promise the best conduct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to the common affairs of the
Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56779:43"/>
Where the Father comes to lose his
Authority, many of the elder, or wiser,
or braver of the Sons increase in theirs
by the same degree: and when both
these arrive at a certain heighth, the
Nature of the Government is ready
for a change; and upon the Fathers
death, or general defection of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
they succeed in his Authority,
whil'st the humour of the whole body
runs against the succession, or election
of any single person, which they are
grown weary of by so late an example.
And thus comes in what they call an
<hi>Aristocracy:</hi> But Authority contracting
it self (as it seems naturally to do till
it ends in a point or single Person)
this Government falls sometimes into
the hands of a few who establish it in
their Families: and that is called an
<hi>Oligarchy.</hi> If the Authority come to
be lost in either of these forms; while
the Children of the Family grow into
the manners, and qualities, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
into the condition and poverty
of Servants: and while many of the
Servants by industry and virtue, arrive
at riches and esteem, then the nature
of the Government inclines to a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy</hi>


               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56779:44"/>
or Popular State, which is
nearest confusion, or <hi>Anarchy;</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
runs into it, unless upheld or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Authority of one, or of
some few in the State; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
without Titles or marks of any
extraordinary Office or Dignity.</p>
            <p>GOvernments founded upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
may have succeeded those
founded upon Authority: But the first
of them should rather seem to have
been agreed between Princes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
than between men of equal Rank
and Power. For the original of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was, I suppose, when one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
warring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against another (for things
necessary to Life, or for Women, or
for extent of Land) overcame their
enemies: if they only won a Battel,
and put their enemies to flight, those
they took Prisoners became their Slaves,
and continued so in their Generations,
unless infranchized by their Masters:
But if by great slaughter or frequent
victories, they subdued the very cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
of their enemies, while great
numbers of them remained alive; then


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56779:44"/>
the vanquisht Nation became subject to
the Conquerors by Agreement, and upon
certain conditions of safety and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and perhaps equal enjoyment
of liberties and customs, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Natives under the other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
If by such frequent successes and
additions, a Nation extended it self
over vast Tracts of Land and numbers
of People; it thereby arrived in time
at the ancient name of Kingdom, or
Modern of Empire.</p>
            <p>After such a victory, the chiefest of
the conquering Nations, become Rich
and Great upon the divisions of Lands,
of Spoils, and of Slaves: By all which
they grow into Power, are Lords
in their own Lands, and over those
that inhabit them, with certain Rights
or Jurisdictions, and upon certain ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
reserved to the Prince. The
custom of imploying these great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in all great Offices, and Councils,
grows to pass for a Right; as all
Custom does with length and force of
time.</p>
            <p>The Prince that Governs according
to the conditions of subjection at first
agreed upon (of which Use is the


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56779:45"/>
Authentique record) and according
to the ancient Customs, which are the
original Laws (and by which the Right
of succession in the Crown, as well as
private Inheritance and Common Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
is directed and establisht) is called
a Lawful Sovereign: He that breaks
and violates these ancient Constitutions
(especially that of Succession) is termed
an Usurper.</p>
            <p>A Free Nation is that, which has
never been conquered or thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into any conditions of Subjection,
as the <hi>Romans</hi> were, before they were
subdued by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals:</hi>
and as the <hi>Turks</hi> seem to be at this
time; who having been called from
<hi>Scythia</hi> to assist the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire
against that of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of both.</p>
            <p>In Countreys safer from Forreign
Invasions either by Seas or Rivers, by
Mountains and Passes, or great Tracts
of rough barren and uninhabited Lands,
People lived generally in scattered
dwellings, or small Villages: But where
Invasion is easie and passage open, and
bordering Nations are great and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant;
men croud together and seek


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56779:45"/>
their safety from number better united,
and from Walls and other Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the use whereof is to make the
few a match for the many, so as they
may Fight or Treat on equal terms.
And this is the original of Cities; but
the greatness and riches of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
according to the commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their scituation, in fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
or upon Rivers and Havens;
which surpass the greatest fertility
of any Soil, in furnishing plenty of
all things necessary to Life or Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury.</p>
            <p>When Families meet together, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
themselves by Walls; fall into
Order and Laws (either invented by
the wisdom of some one, or some few
men; and from the evidence of their
publick utility received by all; or else
introduced by experience and time)
and these Cities preserve themselves in
the enjoyment of their Possessions, and
observance of their Institutions, against
all Invasions; and never are forced to
submit to the will of any Conqueror,
or conditions of any absolute Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
They are called free Cities, and
of such there were many of old, in


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56779:46"/>
               <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> deducing their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
from some one Founder or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver:
And are many now in <hi>Germany</hi>
subject to no Laws but their own, and
those of the Empire, which is an Union
of many Soveraign Powers, by whose
general consent in their Dyets, all its
Constitutions are framed and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht.</p>
            <p>Commonwealths were nothing more
in their original, but free Cities, though
sometimes by force of orders, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
or of a numerous and valiant
people, they have extended themselves
into mighty Dominions: and often by
Scituation and Trade, grow to vast
Riches, and thereby to great Power
by force of mercenary Arms. And
these seem to be the more artificial, as
those of a single Person the more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Governments; being forced to
supply the want of Authority by wise
inventions, orders and institutions.</p>
            <p>For Authority can never be so
great in many as in one, because the
opinion of those qualities which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, cannot be equal in several
persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56779:46"/>
These Governments seem to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
either by the wisdom and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of some one Lawgiver, who
has Authority enough with the people
to be followed and observed in all his
orders and advices; and yet prefers
that which he esteems publick utility,
before any interest or greatness of
his own (such were <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
and <hi>Solon</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Timoleon</hi>
in <hi>Syracuse);</hi> Or else by the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of many Families out of some
Countries exposed to some fierce or
barbarous invasions, into places fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Nature, and secure from the
fury and misery of such Conquests.
Such were <hi>Rhodes</hi> of old, and several
small Islands upon the Coasts of <hi>Ionia;</hi>
and such was <hi>Venice</hi> founded upon the
Inundation of the barbarous Nations
over <hi>Italy:</hi> Or lastly, by the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and extinction of some Tyranny,
which being thrown off by the violent
indignation of an oppressed people,
makes way for a Popular Government,
or at least some form very contrary to
that which they lately execrated, and
detested: Such were <hi>Rome</hi> upon the
expulsion of the <hi>Tarquins;</hi> and the


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56779:47"/>
               <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> upon their revolt
from <hi>Spain:</hi> Yet are none of these
forms to be raised or upheld without
the influence of Authority, acquired
by the force or opinion of those vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
above-mentioned, which concur'd
in <hi>Brutus</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in
Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> among those
of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not enter into the Arguments
or comparisons of the several forms of
Government that have been, or are in
the World; wherein that cause seems
commonly the better, that has the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advocate, or is advantaged by fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
experience and impressions of good
or evil from any of the Forms among
those that judg: They have all their
heighths and their falls, their strong
and weak sides; are capable of great
perfections, and subject to great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
and though the preference seem
already decided in what has been said
of a single Persons being the original
and natural Government; and that it
is capable of the greatest Authority
(which is the foundation of all ease,
safety, and order, in the Governments
of the World) yet it may perhaps be


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56779:47"/>
the most reasonably concluded, That
those forms are best, which have been
longest received and authorized in a
Nation by custom and use; and into
which the humours and manners of the
people run with the most general and
strongest current.</p>
            <p>Or else, that those are the best Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
where the best men Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern;
and that the difference is not so
great in the forms of Magistracy, as in
the persons of Magistrates; which may
be the sense of what was said of old
(taking wise and good men, to be
meant by Philosophers) that the best
Governments were those, where Kings
were Philosophers, or Philosophers
Kings.</p>
            <p>THE safety and firmness of any
frame of Government, may be
best judged by the rules of <hi>Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
which teach us that the <hi>Pyramid</hi>
is of all figures the firmest, and least
subject to be shaken or overthrown by
any concussions, or accidents from the
Earth or Air: and it grows still so
much the firmer, by how much broader


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56779:48"/>
the bottom and sharper the top.</p>
            <p>The ground upon which all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
stands, is the consent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or the greatest or strongest part of
them; whether this proceed from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon what is past by the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of an Authority under which they
and their Ancestors have for many Ages
been born and bred; or from sense of
what is present, by the ease, plenty, and
safety they enjoy: or from opinions of
what is to come, by the fears they have
from the present Government, or hopes
from another. Now that Government
which by any of these, or all these
ways takes in the consent of the
greatest number of the People, and
consequently their desires and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to support it, may justly be said to
have the broadest bottom, and to stand
upon the largest compass of ground:
and if it terminate in the Authority of
one single person, it may likewise be
said to have the narrowest top, and so
to make the figure of the firmest sort
of <hi>Pyramid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, a Government
which by alienating the affections, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the opinions, and crossing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56779:48"/>
of the people, leaves out of its
compass the greatest part of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
may justly be said, in the same
degrees it thus loses ground, to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
its bottom: and if this be done
to serve the Ambition, humour the
Passion, satisfy the Appetites, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Power and Interests not
only of one man, but of two, or more,
or many that come to share in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
By this means the top may
be justly said to grow broader; as the
bottom narrower by the other: Now
by the same degrees that either of these
happen, the stability of the figure is by
the same lessened and impaired; so as
at certain degrees it begins to grow
subject to accidents of wind, and of
weather, and at certain others, it is
sure to fall of it self, or by the least
shake that happens, to the ground.</p>
            <p>By these measures it will appear, that
a Monarchy where the Prince governs
by the affections, and according to the
opinions and interests of his people;
or the bulk of them (that is, by many
degrees the greatest or strongest part
of them) makes of all others the safest
and firmest Government: and on the


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56779:49"/>
contrary a Popular State which is not
founded in the general humours and
interests of the people, but only of the
persons who share in the Government,
or depend upon it, is of all others the
most uncertain, unstable, and subject
to the most frequent and easie changes.</p>
            <p>That a Monarchy the less it takes
in of the Peoples opinions and interests,
and the more it takes in of the passions
and interests of particular men (Besides
those of the Prince, and contrary to
those of the people) the more unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it grows, and the more endangered
by every storm in the Air, or every
shake of the earth: and a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
the more it takes in of the
general humour and bent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the more it spires up to a head
by the Authority of some one Person
founded upon the love and esteem of
the People; the firmer it stands, and
less subject to danger or change by any
concussions of earth or of air.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that a <hi>Pyramid</hi> reversed
may stand for a while upon its point,
if ballanced by admirable skill, and
held up by perpetual care, and there
be a calm in the Air about it: Nay if


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56779:49"/>
the point be very hard and strong, and
the soil very yielding and soft; it may
pierce into the ground with time, so
as to grow the firmer the longer it
stands: But this last can never happen
if either the top of the figure be weak
or soft, or if the soil be hard and rough;
and at the best it is subject to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
if not by its own weight, yet
when ever any forreign weight shall
chance to fall upon any part of it: and
the first must overturn when ever there
happens any inequality in the ballance,
or any negligence in the hands that set
it up; and even without either of
those when ever there arrives any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to shake it, either from the winds
abroad, or those in the bowels of the
earth where it stands.</p>
            <p>I will not pretend from this Scheme
to presage, or judg of the future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
that may attend any Governments,
which is the business of those that are
more concerned in them than I am, and
write with other design than that alone
of discovering or clearing truth: But
I think any man may deduce from it
the causes of the several revolutions
that we find upon record to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56779:50"/>
in the Governments of the World:
Except such as have been brought
about by the unresistable force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
of some Nations over others
whom they very much surmounted in
Strength, Courage, and Numbers: Yet
the brave, long, and almost incredible
defences that have still been made by
those Governments which were rooted
in the general affections, esteem and
interests of the Nation; make it seem
probable that almost all the Conquests
we read of have been made way for,
or in some measure facilitated, if not
assisted by the weakness of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Government, grown from the
disesteem, dissatisfaction, or indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the People: or from those vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and effeminate constitutions of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and mind among them, which ever
grow up in the corrupt Air of a weak
or loose, a vicious or a factious State:
And such can never be strong in the
hearts of the People; nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
firm upon that which is the true
bottom of all Governments in the
World.</p>
            <p>Thus the small <hi>Athenian</hi> State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
with success the vast Power and


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56779:50"/>
Forces of the <hi>Persians</hi> in the time of
<hi>Miltiades</hi> and <hi>Themistocles; Rome</hi> those
of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in the time of <hi>Camillus:</hi>
And the vast Armies collected from
<hi>Africk, Spain,</hi> and the greatest part of
<hi>Italy</hi> in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Wars (under
the conduct of several great Captains;
but chiefly <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Scipio);</hi> The lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Principality of <hi>Epire</hi> was Invincible
by the whole Power of the <hi>Turks</hi> in
Three several Invasions under their
Prince <hi>Castriot</hi> (commonly called <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg);</hi>
the Kingdom of <hi>Leon</hi> and
<hi>Oviedo</hi> by all the Wars of the <hi>Moors,</hi>
or <hi>Saracens</hi> for many ages: The State
of <hi>Venice</hi> by those of the <hi>Turks;</hi> The
<hi>Switzers</hi> by the Power of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> by that of
<hi>Spain:</hi> Because in all these Wars the
People were both united, and spirited
by the common Love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
their Liberty, or Religion: Or
by the more particular esteem and love
of their Princes and Leaders.</p>
            <p>In the Conquests of the <hi>Lydians</hi> by
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> by <hi>Alexander;</hi>
of the great <hi>Asian</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings
by the <hi>Roman</hi> State, and of all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Provinces by the several Northern


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56779:51"/>
(or as they were usually called barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous)
Nations; of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the
<hi>Moors;</hi> and of our Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> by
the <hi>Saxons:</hi> It is easie and obvious to
observe that the resistances were render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
faint and weak; either by the soft
and effeminate dispositions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
grown up under the easiness, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Vicious or Luxurious Princes,
whom they neither honoured nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
obeyed: Or else by the common
hatred and disdain of their present ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,
which they were content to
change for any other that came in their
way: Or lastly, by the distracted facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a discontented Nation, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in no one common design or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence;
nor under any Authority
grounded upon the general love, or
esteem of the People.</p>
            <p>Of Instability and changes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
arrived by narrowing their
bottoms, which are the consent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the peoples affections and
interests; all stories and ages afford con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
examples. From hence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the frequent tumults, seditions, and
alterations in the Commonwealths of
<hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> as often as either by


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56779:51"/>
the charms of Orators, or the sway of
men grown to unusual Power and
Riches; the Governments were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in Counsels or Actions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the general interests of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Hence the several violent changes
that have arrived in the Races, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Princes of <hi>England, France,</hi>
or <hi>Spain:</hi> Nor has the force hereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
any where more visible than in
<hi>France,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Third, and a constant Succession of
Minions (as they were then called)
where all was conducted by the private
passions, humours, and interests of a
few persons in sole confidence with
the King, contrary to those more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and current of the people; till
He came to lose at first all esteem, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
obedience, and at last his Life in
the troubles given him by the League.</p>
            <p>That Government was in the same
manner exposed to the Dominion of
succeeding Favorites, during the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of the Queen-Mother in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>13th,</hi> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
perpetual commotions in that
State, and changes of the Ministry, and
would certainly have produced those


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56779:52"/>
in the Government too; if <hi>Richelieu</hi>
having gained the absolute ascendant in
that <hi>Court,</hi> had not ingaged in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
at first of a War upon the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notts,</hi>
and after that was ended, upon
<hi>Spain;</hi> In both which he fell in with
the current humour and dispositions of
the People: which with the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
successes of both those enterprises,
helped to bear up him and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against all the hatred and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
practices of the great Ones in the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But the two freshest examples may
be drawn from the Revolutions of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the year Sixty; and of <hi>Holland</hi>
in Seventy two: In the First, The
usurped Powers that had either design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no Root, or at least drawn none but
only in the affections and interests of
those that were engaged with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
thought themselves Secure
in the Strength of an unfoiled Army of
above Sixty thousand men, and in a
Revenue proportionable, raised by the
awe of their Forces, though with the
mock-forms of Legal Supplies by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Parliaments: Yet we saw them
forced to give way to the bent, and


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56779:52"/>
current humour of the People, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their Ancient and Lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and this mighty Army of a
sudden lose their Heart and their
Strength, abandon what they had so
long called their Cause, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and content themselves to be
moulded again into the Mass of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and by conspiring with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
humour of the Nation, make way
for the Kings glorious restauration
without a drop of blood drawn, in the
end of a quarrel the beginning and
course whereof had been so fatal to the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For the other in <hi>Holland,</hi> the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of their Government had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Twenty years in the hands of
their Popular Magistrates, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
or intermission of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the House of <hi>Orange</hi> upon the
death of the last Prince, and infancy
of this. The chief direction of their
affairs had for Eighteen years lain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
in the hands of their Pensioner
<hi>de Witt,</hi> a Minister of the greatest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Sufficiency, the greatest
Application and Industry that was ever
known in their State. In the course of


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56779:53"/>
his Ministry, He and his Party had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
not only all the Civil charges of
the Government in his Province, but
in a manner all the Military Commands
in the Army out of the hands of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
affectionate to the House of <hi>Orange,</hi>
into those esteemed sure and fast to the
Interests of their more Popular State.
And all this had been attended for so
long a course of years with the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
success of their affairs, by the
growth of their Trade, Riches, and
Power at home, and the consideration
of their Neighbours abroad: Yet the
general humour of kindness in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to their old form of Government
under the Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> grew up
with the Age and Virtues of the young
Prince, so as to raise the prospect of
some unavoidable revolutions among
them for several years before it arrived.
And we have seen it grow to that
heighth in this present year, upon the
Princes coming to the Two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of his Age (the time assigned him
by their Constitutions for his entring
upon the publick charges of their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice)</hi>
that though it had found them in
Peace, it must have occasioned some


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56779:53"/>
violent sedition in their State: But
meeting with the conjuncture of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Invasion, It broke out into so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a rage of the People, and such
general tumults through the whole
Countrey, as ended in the Blood of
their chief Ministers: In the displacing
all that were suspected to be of their
party throughout the Government;
In the full restitution of the Princes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to the highest point any of his
Ancestors ever enjoyed: But withall,
in such a distraction of their Councils,
and their Actions, as made way for the
easie successes of the <hi>French</hi> Invasion;
for the loss of almost Five of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
in Two months time, and for the
general presages of utter ruin to their
State.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not what it
was that fell into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
t'other day,
and gave your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
the occasion
of desiring me to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
into some Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and upon Paper, the means and
ways I esteemed most proper for the
advancing of Trade in <hi>Ireland:</hi> This


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56779:55"/>
I know very well, that you did it in
a manner, and with Expressions too
obliging to be refused, and out of a
design so publick and generous, as
ought not to be discouraged. I had
therefore much rather obey your
Lordship in this point, how ill soever
I do it, than excuse my self, though
never so well, which were much easier
than the other. For I might alledg
that neither my Birth nor my Breeding
has been at all in this Countrey: That
I have passed only one short period of
my life here, and the greatest part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wholly out of business and publick
thoughts; That I have since been Ten
years absent from it; and am now here
upon no other occasion than of a short
Visit to some of my Friends: Which
are all Circumstances that make me a
very improper subject for such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
But I suppose the vein I have
had of running into speculations of
this kind upon a greater scene of
Trade, and in a Countrey where I
was more a stranger; and the too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
favour your Lordship has exprest
to another Discourse of this nature,
have cost me this present service; and


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56779:55"/>
you have thought fit to punish me for
one folly, by engaging me to commit
another; like the Confessor, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
a Drunkard the penance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drunk again. However it is, your
Lordship shall be obeyed, and therein
I hope to be enough excused; which
is all I pretend to upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Trade which are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and may be more lasting in this
Kingdom; I will observe to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
some particular Circumstances in
the Constitution and Government,
which have been hitherto, and may be
long the great discouragers of Trade
and Riches here; And some others in
the present Conjuncture, which are
absolutely mortal to it; that so you
may not expect to find remedies where
indeed there is none; nor suffer men,
like busie ignorant Physicians, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
such as are contrary to the disease,
because they cannot find such as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for it.</p>
            <p>The true and natural ground of
Trade and Riches, is number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in proportion to the compass of


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56779:56"/>
Ground they inhabit. This makes all
things necessary to life dear, and that
forces men to industry and parsimony.
These Customs which grow first from
necessity, come with time to be habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
in a Countrey. And where-ever
they are so, that place must grow great
in Traffick and Riches, if not distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by some accidents or revolutions,
as of Wars, of Plagues, or Famines, by
which the People come to be either
scattered or destroyed.</p>
            <p>People are multiplied in a Countrey
by the temper of the Climate favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Generation, to Health, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life.
Or else by the Circumstances of
safety and ease under the Government,
the credit whereof invites men over to
it, when they cannot be either safe or
easie at home. When things are once
in motion, Trade begets Trade, as fire
does fire, and People go much where
much People are already gone. So men
run still to a crowd where they see it
in the streets, or the fields, though it
be only to do as others do, to see or to
be entertained.</p>
            <p>The want of Trade in <hi>Ireland</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the want of People, and this


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56779:56"/>
is not grown from any ill qualities of
the Climate or Air, but chiefly from
the frequent Revolutions of so many
Wars and Rebellions, so great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Calamities of Mankind as have
at several Intervals of time succeeded
the first Conquest of this Kingdom in
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seconds time, until the year
1653; Two very great Plagues fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the two great Wars, those of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and the last;
which helped to drain the current
stream of Generation in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>The discredit which is grown upon
the Constitutions or Settlements of
this Kingdom, by so frequent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Revolutions that for many ages
have infested it, has been the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to other Nations to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
themselves hither, and prevailed
further than all the invitations which
the cheapness and plenty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
has made them. So that had it
not been for the numbers of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,</hi>
which the necessity of the late
Wars at first drew over, and of such
who either as Adventurers or Soldiers
seated themselves here upon account of


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56779:57"/>
the satisfaction made to them in Land,
the Countrey had by the last War and
Plague been left in a manner deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>Besides, the subordinancy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
changing hands so often,
makes an unsteddiness in the pursuit of
the publick Interests of the Kingdom,
gives way to the emulations of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Factions, and draws the favour
or countenance of the Government
sometimes to one party or interest,
sometimes to another; this makes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
motions in mens minds, raising
hopes and fears, and opinions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
in their possessions; and
thereby in the peace of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>This subordinacy in the Government,
and emulation of parties, with the
want sometimes of Authority in the
Governour (by the weakness of his
credit and support at Court) occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the perpetual agencies or journeys
into <hi>England</hi> of all persons that have
any considerable pretences in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and money to pursue them; which end
many times in long abodes, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
habituating of Families there,


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56779:57"/>
though they have no money to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them but what is drawn out of
<hi>Ireland.</hi> Besides, the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
go of course for their breeding
there, some seek their health, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
their entertainment in a better
Climate or Scene; By these means the
Countrey loses the expence of many of
the richest persons or families at home,
and mighty sums of money must needs
go over from hence into <hi>England,</hi>
which the great stock of rich Native
Commodities here can make the only
amends for.</p>
            <p>These Circumstances so prejudicial
to the encrease of Trade and Riches in
a Countrey, seem natural or at least
have ever been incident to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here, and without them the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
fertility of the Soil and Seas in so
many rich Commodities improved by
multitude of people and industry, with
the advantage of so many excellent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and a Scituation so commodious
for all sorts of forreign Trade, must
needs have rendred this Kingdom one
of the richest in <hi>Europe,</hi> and made a
mighty encrease both of strength and
revenue to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi>


               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56779:58"/>
whereas it has hitherto been rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
and found to be our weak side,
and to have cost us more blood and
treasure than 'tis worth.</p>
            <p>Since my late arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
have found a very unusual, but I doubt
very just complaint concerning the
scarcity of Money, which occasioned
many airy Propositions for the remedy
of it, and among the rest that of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
some, or all of the Coyns here.
This was chiefly grounded upon the
experience made as they say about the
Duke of <hi>Ormonds</hi> coming first over
hither in 1663, when the Plate-pieces
of Eight were raised three pence in
the piece, and a mighty plenty of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was observed to grow in <hi>Ireland</hi>
for a year or two after. But this seems
to me a very mistaken account, and to
have depended wholly upon other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
little taken notice of, and
not at all upon the raising of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to which it is by some great men
attributed. For first, there was about
that time a general peace and serenity
which had newly succeeded a general
trouble and cloud throughout all His
Majesties Kingdoms; then after two


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56779:58"/>
years attendance in <hi>England</hi> upon the
settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> (there on the
forge) by all persons and parties here
that were considerably interested in it,
the Parliament being called here, and
the main settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> wound
up in <hi>England,</hi> and put into the Duke
of <hi>Ormonds</hi> hands to pass here into an
Act; all persons came over in a shoal
either to attend their own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the main, or more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to make their Courte to the Lord
Lieutenant upon whom His Majesty
had at that time in a manner wholly
devolved the care and disposition of
all affairs in this Kingdom: This made
a sudden and mighty stop of that issue
of Money which had for two years run
perpetually out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and kept it all at home. Nor is
the very expence of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi>
own great Patrimonial estate
with that of several other Families that
came over at that time, of small consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in the stock of this Kingdom.
Besides, there was a great sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in ready Coyn brought over out
of <hi>England</hi> at the same time towards
the arrears of the Army: Which are


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56779:59"/>
all circumstances that must needs have
made a mighty change in the course of
ready money here. All the effect that
I conceive was made by crying up the
pieces of Eight, was to bring in much
more of that Species instead of others
current here (as indeed all the Money
brought from <hi>England</hi> was of that sort,
and complained of in Parliament to be
of a worse allay), and to carry away
much <hi>English</hi> Money in exchange for
Plate-pieces, by which a Trade was
driven very beneficial to the Traders,
but of mighty loss to the Kingdom
in the intrinsick value of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>The Circumstances at this time seem
to be just the reverse of what they were
then; The Nations engaged in a War
the most fatal to trade of any that could
arise; The settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at the Court, and falling into new
disquisitions (whether in truth or in
common opinion, is all a case): This
draws continual Agencies and Journeys
of People concerned into <hi>England,</hi> to
watch the motions of the main wheel
there. Besides, the Lieutenants of
<hi>Ireland</hi> since the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56779:59"/>
time, have had little in their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here, and only executed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
daily taken at Court in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
as well as general affairs, which
has drawn thither the attendance of all
private pretenders. The great Estates
of this Kingdom have been four or five
years constantly spent in <hi>England.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
instead of coming over hither for
pay of the Army, has since the War
began, been transmitted thither for pay
of those Forces that were called from
hence. And lastly, This War has had
a more particular and mortal influence
upon the Trade of this Countrey, than
upon any other of His Majesties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>For by the Act against Transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Cattel into <hi>England,</hi> the Trade
of this Countrey which run wholly
thither before, was turned very much
into forreign parts; but by this War
the last is stopped, and the other not
being open'd, there is in a manner no
vent for any Commodity but of Wool.
This necessity has forced the Kingdom
to go on still with their forreign Trade,
but that has been with such mighty los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
by the great number of <hi>Dutch</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56779:60"/>
plying about the Coasts, and
the want of <hi>English</hi> Fregats to secure
them, that the stock of the Kingdom
must be extreamly diminished. Yet by
the continuance of the same expence
and luxury in point of living, Money
goes over into <hi>England</hi> to fetch what
must supply it, though little Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
goes either there or abroad to
make any considerable ballance; By all
which it must happen, that with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
years continuance of the War,
there will hardly be Money left in this
Kingdom to turn the common Markets,
or pay any Rents, or leave any circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
further than the receipts of the
Customs and Quit-rents, and the Pays
of the Army, which in both kinds must
be the last that fail.</p>
            <p>In such a conjuncture, the crying up
of any species of money will but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the want of it in general; for
while there goes not out commodity
to ballance that which is brought in,
and no degree of gains by exportation
will make amends for the venture;
what should money come in for, unless
it be to carry out other money as it
did before, and leave the stock that


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56779:60"/>
remains equal indeed in denomination,
but lower in the intrinsique value than
it was before? In short, while this
War lasts, and our Seas are ill guarded,
all that can be done towards preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the small remainder of Money in
this Kingdom, is, First, to introduce
as far as can be, a vein of Parsimony
throughout the Countrey in all things
that are not perfectly the native growths
and manufactures: Then by severity
and steddiness of the Government (as
far as will be permitted) to keep up
in some credit the present peace and
settlement. And lastly, To force men
to a degree of industry, by suffering
none to hope that they shall be able
to live by rapine or fraud. For in
some diseases of a Civil as well as a
Natural body, all that can be done
is to fast and to rest, to watch and to
prevent accidents, to trust to methods
rather than medicines or remedies:
and with patience to expect till the
humours being spent, and the <hi>Crisis</hi>
past, way may be made for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
returns of health and of
strength.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:56779:61"/>
This being premised as peculiar ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Government in general, or
to the present conjuncture; I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to such Observations as occur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ways of advancing the
common and standing Trade of this
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Trade of a Countrey arises from
the native growths of the Soil, or Seas,
the Manufactures, the commodiousness
of Ports, and the store of Shipping
which belong to it. The improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therefore of Trade in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
must be considered in the survey of
all these Particulars, the defects to which
at present they are subject, and the
encreases they are capable of receiving
either from the course of time, the
change of customs, or the conduct and
application of the Government.</p>
            <p>The native Commodities or common
easie Manufactures which make up the
Exportation of this Kingdom, and
consequently furnish both the stock of
forreign Commodities consumed in the
Countrey, and that likewise of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Money, by which all Trade is
turned; are Wool, Butter, Beef, Cattel,
Fish, Iron; and by the improvement


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56779:61"/>
of these, either in the quantity, the
credit, or the further Manufacture, the
Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> seems chiefly to be
advanced.</p>
            <p>In this Survey one thing must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of as peculiar to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
which is, That as in the nature
of its Government, so in the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of its Trade and Riches, it
ought to be considered not only in its
own proper interest, but likewise in
its relation to <hi>England,</hi> to which it is
subordinate, and upon whose weal in
the main, that of this Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends;
and therefore a regard must
be had of those points wherein the
Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> comes to interfere
with any main branches of the Trade
of <hi>England,</hi> in which cases the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of such Trade ought to be
either declined or moderated, and so
give way to the interest of Trade in
<hi>England,</hi> upon the health and vigor
whereof, the strength, riches and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of His Majesties Crowns seem chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to depend. But on the other side,
some such branches of Trade ought
not wholly to be supprest, but rather
so far admitted as may serve the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56779:62"/>
consumption of this Kingdom, lest
by too great an importation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
though out of <hi>England</hi> it
self, the Money of this Kingdom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be drawn away in such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
as not to leave a stock sufficient
for turning the Trade at home; the
effect hereof would be general discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
among the People, complaints,
or at least ill impressions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which in a Countrey com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of three several Nations differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to a great degree in Language, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
and Religion, as well as Interests
(both of property and dependances)
may prove not only dangerous to this
Kingdom, but to <hi>England</hi> it self. Since
a sore in the leg may affect the whole
body, and in time grow as difficult a
cure as if it were in the head; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where humours abound.</p>
            <p>The Wool of <hi>Ireland</hi> seems not to
be capable of any encrease, nor to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
under any defect, the Countrey
being generally full stockt with sheep,
cleared of Wolves, the Soil little sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to other rotts than of hunger;
and all the considerable flocks being of
<hi>English</hi> breed, and the staple of Wool


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56779:62"/>
generally equal with that of <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
or <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> the improvement
of this Commodity by Manufactures
in this Kingdom would give so great a
damp to the Trade of <hi>England</hi> (of
which Cloths, Stuffs and Stockins,
make so mighty a part) that it seems
not fit to be encouraged here, at least
no further than to such a quantity of
one or two Summer-stuffs, <hi>Irish</hi>-freeze,
and Cloth from Six shillings to Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
as may supply in some measure
the ordinary consumption of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
That which seems most necessary
in this branch is the careful and severe
execution of the Statutes provided to
forbid the Exportation of Wool to
any other parts but to <hi>England,</hi> which
is the more to be watched and feared,
since thereby the present Riches of this
Kingdom would be mightily encreased,
and great advantages might be made by
the connivance of Governours; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the other side this would prove a
most sensible decay, if not destruction
of Manufactures both here and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:56779:63"/>
Yarn is a Commodity very proper
to this Countrey, but made in no great
quantities in any parts besides the North,
nor any where into Linnen to any great
degree, or of sorts fit for the better
uses at home, or exportion abroad;
though of all others this ought most to
be encouraged, and was therefore
chiefly designed by the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
The Soil produces Flax kindly and well,
and fine too, answerable to the care
used in choice of seed and exercise of
Husbandry; and much Land is fit for
it here, which is not so for Corn. The
Manufacture of it in gathering or beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is of little toyl or application,
and so the fitter for the Natives of the
Countrey. Besides, no Women are
apter to spin it well than the <hi>Irish,</hi> who
labouring little in any kind with their
hands, have their fingers more supple
and soft than other Women of the
poorer condition among us. And this
may certainly be advanced and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
into a great Manufacture of
Linnen, so as to beat down the Trade
both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and draw
much of the Money which goes from


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56779:63"/>
               <hi>England</hi> to those parts upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
into the hands of His Majesties
Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> without crossing
any interest of Trade in <hi>England.</hi> For
besides what has been said of Flax and
Spinning, the Soil and Climate are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for whitening both by the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Brooks, and also of Winds in the
Countrey.</p>
            <p>Much care was spent upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in an Act of Parliament past the
last Session, and something may have
been advanced by it; but the too great
rigor imposed upon the sowing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
quantities of Flax, has caused (and
perhaps justly) a general neglect in the
execution; and common guilt has made
the penalties impracticable; so as the
main effect has been spoiled by too
much diligence, and the Child killed
with kindness. For the Money apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that Act to the encouragement
of making fine Linnen, and broad
(which I think is twenty pounds every
year in each County), though the
institution was good, yet it has not
reached the end, by encouraging any
considerable application that way; so


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56779:64"/>
that sometimes one share of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is paid to a single pretender at the
Sizes, or Sessions; and sometimes a share
is saved for want of any pretender at
all.</p>
            <p>This Trade may be advanced by
some amendments to the last Act in
another Session, whereby the necessity
of sowing Flax may be so limited, as
to be made easily practicable, and so
may be forced by the severity of levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the penalties Enacted. And for
the Money allotted in the Counties,
no person ought to carry the first, second
or third price, without producing two
pieces of Linnen of each sort (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
one only now is necessary.) And
severe defences may be made against
weaving any Linnen under a certain
breadth, such as may be of better use
to the poorest People, and in the
coarsest Linnen, than the narrow <hi>Irish</hi>
Cloth; and may bear some price a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
when ever more comes to be
made than is consumed at home. But
after all these or such like provisions,
there are but two things which can
make any extraordinary advance in


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56779:64"/>
this branch of Trade, and those are:
First, An encrease of People in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to such a degree as may make things
necessary to life dear, and thereby force
general industry from each member of
a Family (Women as well as Men),
and in as many sorts as they can well
turn to, which among others may in
time come to run the vein this way.
The second is a particular application
in the Government. And this must
be made either by some Governour
upon his own private account, who
has a great stock that he is content to
turn that way, and is invited by the
gains, or else by the honour of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pass a Work of so much pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
utility both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(which circumstances I suppose
concur'd both in the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s
design); and when ever they meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
can have no better copy to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in all particulars, than that begun
at the <hi>Naas</hi> in his time. Or else by a
considerable sum of Money being laid
aside either out of His Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Revenue, or some future Subsidy
to be granted for this occasion: And


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56779:65"/>
this either to be imployed in setting
up of some great Linnen Manufacture
in some certain place, and to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by some certain hands both for
making all sorts of fine Clothes, and of
those for Sails too. The benefit or
loss of such a Trade accruing to the
Government, until it comes to take
root in the Nation. Or else if this
seem too great an undertaking for the
humour of our age, then such a sum
of money to lie ready in hands ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Government, for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off at common moderate prices all
such pieces of Cloth as shall be brought
in by any persons at certain times to
the chief Town of each County; and
all such pieces of Cloth as are fit for
Sails, to be carried into the stores of
the Navy. All that are fit for the use
of the Army, to be given the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(as Clothes are) in part of their
Pay: And all siner pieces to be sold,
and the money still applied to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
or constant supply of the main
stock. The effect hereof would be,
That people finding a certain Market
for this Commodity, and that of others


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56779:65"/>
so uncertain as it is in this Kingdom,
would turn so much of their industry
this way, as would serve to furnish a
great part of that Money, which is
most absolutely necessary for payment
of Taxes, Rents, or subsistence of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
            <p>Hide, Tallow, Butter, Beef, arise all
from one sort of Cattel, and are subject
to the same general defects, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the same common improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The three first are certain Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and yield the readiest Money
of any that are turned in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
because they never fail of a price
abroad. Beef is a drug, finding no
constant vent abroad, and therefore
yielding no rate at home: for the
consumption of the Kingdom holds no
proportion with the product that is
usually made of Cattel in it; so that
in many parts at this time an Ox may
be bought in the Countrey-Markets,
and the Hide and Tallow sold at the
next Trading-Town for near as much
as it cost. The defects of these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
lie either in the age and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56779:66"/>
of the Cattel that are killed, or
in the Manufacture and making them
up for exportation abroad.</p>
            <p>Until the Transportation of Cattel
into <hi>England</hi> was forbidden by the late
Act of Parliament, the quickest Trade
of ready Money here was driven by
the sale of young Bullocks, which for
four or five Summer-months of the
year were carried over in very great
numbers, and this made all the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the Kingdom turn their lands
and stocks chiefly to that sort of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.
Few Cows were bred up for the Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
more than served the consumption
within; and few Oxen for draught,
which was all performed by rascally
small Horses; so as the Cattel gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
sold either for slaughter within,
or Exportation abroad, were of two,
three, or at best four years old, and
those such as had never been either
handled or wintered at hand-meat, but
bred wholly upon the Mountains in
Summer, and upon the withered long
grass of the lower lands in the Winter.
The effect hereof was very pernicious
to this Kingdom in what concerned all


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56779:66"/>
these Commodities: The Hides were
small, thin and lank: The Tallow much
less in quantity, and of quicker con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
Little Butter was exported
abroad, and that discredited by the
huswifery of the <hi>Irish,</hi> in making it
up; most of what was sent coming
from their hands, who alone kept up
the Trade of Dairies, because the breed
of their Cattel was not fit for the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>-Markets.
But above all, the Trade
of Beef for forreign Exportation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was
prejudiced and almost sunk, for the
flesh being young, and only grass-fed
(and that on a sudden by the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Summers pasture, after the
Cattel being almost starved in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
was thin, light and moist, and not
of a substance to endure the salt, or
be preserved by it, for long Voyages,
or a slow consumption. Besides, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the unskilfulness or carelesness, or
Knavery of the Traders, added much
to the undervalue and discredit of these
Commodities abroad; for the Hides
were often made up very dirty, which
increased the weight by which that
Commodity is sold when it comes in


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56779:67"/>
quantities abroad. The Butter would
be better on the top and bottom of
the Barrels, than in the middle, which
would be sometimes filled up, or
mingled with Tallow; nay, sometimes
with stones. The Beef would be so
ill chosen, or so ill cured, as to stink
many times before it came so far as
<hi>Holland,</hi> or at least not prove a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
that would defray the first
charge of the Merchant before it was
shipt. Nay, I have known Merchants
there, fain to throw away great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
after having lain long in their
hands without any Market at all.</p>
            <p>After the Act in <hi>England</hi> had wholly
stopt the Transportation of Cattel, the
Trade of this Kingdom was forced to
find out a new Channel, a great deal of
Land was turned to sheep, because
Wool gave ready Money for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>-Markets,
and by stealth for those
abroad. The breeders of <hi>English</hi> Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
turn'd much to Dairy, or else by
keeping their Cattel to six and seven
year old, and wintering them dry, made
them fit for the Beef-trade abroad; and
some of the Merchants fell into care


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56779:67"/>
and exactness in Barrelling them up;
and hereby the improvements of this
Trade were grown so sensible in the
course of a few years, that in the year
1669, some Merchants in <hi>Holland</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, that they had received parcels
of Beef out of <hi>Ireland</hi> which sold cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and very near the <hi>English;</hi> and
of Butter which sold beyond it; and
that they had observed it spent as if it
came from the richer soil of the two.
'Tis most evident that if the <hi>Dutch</hi>
War had not broken out so soon after
the improvements of all these Trades
(forced at first by necessity, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards habitual by use) would
a few years have very much advanced
the Trade and Riches of this Kingdom,
and made it a great gainer instead of
losing by the Act against Transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Cattel: But the War
gave a sudden damp to this and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Trade, which is sunk to nothing
by the continuance of it.</p>
            <p>However having marked the defects
that were even in time of peace, it may
not be useless to set down the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
though little practicable while the


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56779:68"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>


               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:56779:69"/>
War lasts. For that great one of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Cattel young, and only grass-fed,
I know none so effectual as introducing
a general custom of using Oxen for all
sorts of draught, which would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the greatest improvement that
could be made in many kinds through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom. By this means the
great slaughter would be made of full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown,
large, and well wintered Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
which would double the income
made by Hide, Tallow and Beef, and
raise their credit in all forreign Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets;
every man would be forced to
provide Winter-fodder for his Teem
(whereas common Garrans shift upon
grass the year round); and this would
force men to the enclosing of Grounds,
and improving Bog into Meadows; the
race of Garrans would decrease, and
so make room for the Countreys main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the greater number of Cattel,
which makes a forreign Commodity,
though they die by accident or age,
whereas the other makes none at
all.</p>
            <p>No great or useful thing is to be
atchieved without difficulties, and


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56779:69"/>
therefore what may be raised against
this Proposal ought not to discourage
the attempting it. First, the Statutes
against that barbarous custom of Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the tail, ought to be renewed,
and upon absolute forfeitures instead
of penalties; the constant and easie
compositions whereof have proved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an allowing than forbidding it.
Now if this were wholly disused, the
Harness for Horses being dearer than
for Oxen, the <hi>Irish</hi> would turn their
draught to the last, where-ever they
have hitherto used the Plowing by the
Tail. Next a Standard might be made,
under which no Horse should be used
for draught; this would not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
the breed of Horses, but make
way for the use of Oxen, because they
would be cheaper kept than large good
Horses, which could not be wintered
like Garrans without housing or fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And lastly, a Tax might be laid
upon every Horse of draught through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom, which besides the
main use here intended, would increase
the Kings Revenue by one of the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ways that is any where in use.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:56779:70"/>
For the miscarriages mentioned in
the making up of those several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
for forreign Markets, they
must likewise be remedied by severe
Laws, or else the improvements of the
Commodities themselves will not serve
to bring them in credit, upon which
all Trade turns. First, the Ports out
of which such Commodities shall be
shipt, may be restrained to a certain
number, such as lie most convenient
for the vent of the Inland Provinces,
and such as either are already or are
capable of being made regular Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
Whatever of them shall be
carried out of any other Port, shall be
penal both to the Merchant that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and to the Master that receives
them. In the Ports allowed shall be
published rules agreed on by the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
Merchants in those Wares, to be
observed in the making up of all such
as are intended for forreign Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and declaring that what is not
found agreeable to those rules shall not
be suffered to go out. Two Officers
may be appointed to be chosen every
three years by the body of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56779:70"/>
whose business shall be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
all Barrels of Beef, Tallow, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and all Packs of Hides, and put
to them the seal or mark of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
without which none shall be
suffer'd to go abroad; Nor shall this
mark be affixed to any parcels by those
Officers, but such as they have viewed
and found agreeable to the rules set
forth for that purpose. Whereof one
ought to be certain, That every Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
be of the same constant weight,
or something over. If this were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for a small course of time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any certain marks, the credit of
them both as to quality and weight
would rise to that degree, that the
Barrels or Packs would go off in the
Markets they used abroad, upon sight
of the mark, like silver-plate upon
sight of the Cities mark where 'tis
made.</p>
            <p>The great difficulty will lie in the
good execution of the Offices; But the
interest of such Corporations lying so
deep in the credit of their mark, will
make emulation among them, every
one vying to raise their own as high


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56779:71"/>
as they can; and this will make them
careful in the choice of men fit for
that turn. Besides, the Offices ought
to be made beneficial to a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
by a certain fee upon every seal;
and yet the Office to be forfeited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every miscarriage of the Officer,
which shall be judged so by the chief
Magistrates of the Town, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a new Election be made by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Corporation.</p>
            <p>Cattel for Exportation, are Sheep,
Bullocks, Horses, and of one or other
of these kinds the Countrey seems to
be full-stockt, no ground that I hear
of being untenanted; the two first
seem sufficiently improved in the kinds
as well as the number, most of both
being of the <hi>English</hi> breed. And though
it were better for the Countrey if the
number of Horses being lessened made
room for that of encreasing Sheep, and
great Cattel; yet it seems indifferent
which of these two were most turn'd
to, and that will be regulated by the
liberty or restraint of carrying live Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
into <hi>England.</hi> When the passage
is open, Land will be turned most to


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56779:71"/>
great Cattel; when shut, to Sheep, as
it is at present, though I am not of
opinion it can last, because that Act
seems to have been carried on rather
by the interest of particular Counties
in <hi>England,</hi> than by that of the whole,
which in my opinion must be evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a loser by it. For first, the fraight,
of all Cattel that were brought over,
being in <hi>English</hi> Vessels, was so much
clear gain to <hi>England,</hi> and this was
one with another near a third, or
at least a fourth part of the price.
Then there coming over young and
very cheap to the first Market, made
them double the price by one years
feeding, which was the greatest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
to be made of our dry Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture-land
in <hi>England.</hi> The Trade of
Hides, and Tallow, or else of Leather,
was mightily advanced in <hi>England,</hi>
which will be beaten down in forreign
Markets by <hi>Ireland,</hi> if they come to
kill all their Cattel at home. The young
<hi>Irish</hi> Cattel served for the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in <hi>England,</hi> while their own
large old fat Cattel went into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
for the forreign Trade, in which


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56779:72"/>
               <hi>Irish</hi> Beef had in a manner no part,
though by the continuance of this
restraint it will be forced upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
and come to share with
<hi>England</hi> in the Beef-Trade abroad.
Grounds were turned much in <hi>England</hi>
from breeding, either to feeding or
Dairy, and this advanced the Trade of
<hi>English</hi> Butter, which will be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beaten down when <hi>Ireland</hi> turns to
it too (and in the way of <hi>English</hi>
Huswifery, as it has done a great deal
since the restraint upon Cattel.) And
lastly, whereas <hi>Ireland</hi> had before very
little Trade but with <hi>England,</hi> and
with the Money for their Cattel bought
all the Commodities there which they
wanted: By this restraint they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to seek a forreign Market, and
where they sell, they will be sure to
buy too; and all the forreign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
which they had before from
<hi>Bristow, Chester,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> they will
have in time from <hi>Roan, Amsterdam,
Lisbon</hi> and the <hi>Streights.</hi> As for the
true causes of the decay of Rents in
<hi>England,</hi> which made the occasion of
that Act, they were to be found in


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56779:72"/>
the want of People, in the mighty
consumption of forreign Commodities
among the better sort, and in a higher
way of living among all, and not in
this Transportation of <hi>Irish</hi> Cattel,
which would have been complained of
in former times if it had been found
a prejudice to <hi>England.</hi> Besides, the
Rents have been far from encreasing
since; and though that may be by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accidents, yet as to what concerns
<hi>Ireland,</hi> it comes all to one, unless
Wool be forbidden as well as Cattel;
for the less Cattel comes over from
thence, there comes the more Wool,
which goes as far as t'other towards
beating down the price of Pasture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
in <hi>England;</hi> and yet the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaion
of Wool cannot be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
since that would force the <hi>Irish</hi>
Wool either by stealth into forreign
Markets, or else in Cloth by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of that Manufacture; either of
which would bring a sudden decay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the principal branch of the <hi>English</hi>
Trade.</p>
            <p>Horses in <hi>Ireland</hi> are a drug, but
might be improved to a Commodity,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56779:73"/>
not only of greater use at home, but
also fit for Exportation into other
Countrys. The Soil is of a sweet and
plentiful grass, which will raise a large
breed; and the Hills, especially near
the Sea-coast, are hard and rough, and
so fit to give them shape and breath,
and sound feet. The present defects
in them, are breeding without choice
of Stallions either in shape or size,
and trusting so far to the gentleness of
the Climate, as to winter them abroad,
without ever handling Colts till they
are four year old: This both checks
the growth of the common breeds, and
gives them an incurable shyness, which
is the general vice of <hi>Irish</hi> Horses, and
is hardly ever seen in <hi>Flanders,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the hardness of the Winters in
those parts forces the breeders there
to house and handle their Colts for at
least six months every year. In the
Studds of persons of quality in <hi>Ireland</hi>
where care is taken, and cost is not
spared, we see Horses bred of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
shape and vigour, and size, so as to
reach great prices at home, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
strangers to find the Market here;


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56779:73"/>
among whom I met with one this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that came over on that errand,
and bought about twenty Horses to
carry over into the <hi>French</hi> Army, from
twenty to threescore pounds price at
the first hand.</p>
            <p>The improvement of Horses here
may be made by a standard prescribed
to all Stallions, and all Horses that shall
be used for draught, the main point
being to make the common breed large,
for then whether they have shape or
no, they have ever some reasonable
price both at home and abroad. And
besides, being not to be raised without
wintering, they will help to force men
into improvement of Land by a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of fodder. But for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of finer breed, and in the better
hands, some other institutions may be
invented by which emulation may be
raised among the Breeders by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
both of particular honour and
profit to those who succeed best, and
of good ordinary gains and ready vent
to such as by aiming at the best though
they fail, yet go beyond the common
sorts. To this purpose there may be


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56779:74"/>
set up both a Horse-Fair, and Races to
be held at a certain time every year
for the space of a Week; the first in
the fairest Green near the City of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> the later in that place designed
by your Lordship in the Park for some
such purpose. During this Week, the
<hi>Monday, Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> may
be the Races; the <hi>Tuesday, Thursday</hi>
and <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Fairs may be held.
At each Race may be two Plates given
by the King, one of Thirty pounds,
and the other of Twenty (besides the
fashion) as the Prizes for the first and
second Horse; the first Engraven with
a Horse Crowned with a Crown; the
second with a Coronet, and under it
the day of the Month, and the year.
Besides these Plates, the Wagers may
be as the persons please among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but the Horses must be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by good Testimonies to have been
bred in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For honour, the
Lord Lieutenant may ever be present
himself, or at least name a Deputy in
his room, and two Judges of the field,
who shall decide all Controversies, and
with sound of Trumpet declare the


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56779:74"/>
two Victors. The Masters of these
two Horses may be admitted to ride
from the Field to the Castle with the
Lord Lieutenant, or his Deputy, and
to Dine with him that day, and there
receive all the honour of the Table.
This to be done, what quality soever
the persons are of; for the lower that
is, the more will be the honour; and
perhaps the more the sport: and the
encouragement of breeding will by
that means extend to all sorts of
men.</p>
            <p>For the Fairs, the Lord Lieutenant
may likewise be present every day in
the heighth of them, by himself or
Deputy, and may with the advice of
the two chief Officers of the Army then
present, choose out one of the best
Horses, and two of the best Geldings
that appear in the Fair, not under four,
nor above seven years old. For which
shall be paid to the owners of them,
after sufficient Testimony of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bred in <hi>Ireland,</hi> One hundred
pounds for the Horse, and fifty pounds
a piece for the Geldings. These Sums,
as that for the Plates, to issue out of


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56779:75"/>
the Revenue of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and without
trouble or fee; and the three Horses
to be sent over every year to the Kings
Stables. Both those that won the Plate,
and those which are thus sold, ought
immediately to be marked so as they
may never return a second time, either
to the Race or to the Sale.</p>
            <p>The benefit by such an institution as
this, will be very great and various:
For besides the encouragement to
breed the best Horses, from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and gain already mentioned;
there will be a sort of publick enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for one whole week, during
which the Lord Lieutenant, the Lord
Mayor of the City, and the great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
both Civil and Military, ought to
keep open Tables for all strangers.
This will draw a confluence of people
from all parts of the Country. Many
perhaps from the nearer parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
may come, not only as to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
kind of solemnity, but as to a
great Mart of the best Horses. This
will enrich the City by the expence of
such a concourse, and the Country by
the sale of many Horses into <hi>England,</hi>


               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56779:75"/>
and in time (or from thence) into
foreign parts. This will make general
acquaintances among the Gentry of
the Kingdom, and bring the Lord
Lieutenant to be more personally
known, and more honoured by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in more greatness, and with
more solemnity than usual upon these
occasions. And all this with expence
only of Three hundred and fifty
pounds a year to the Crown, for
which the King shall have three the
best Horses bred that year in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fishing of <hi>Ireland</hi> might prove
a Mine under water, as rich as any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground, if it were improved to
those vast advantages it is capable of,
and that we see it raised to in other
Countrys. But this is impossible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
so great a want of people, and
cheapness of all things necessary to life
throughout the Country, which are in
all places invincible enemies of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and improvements. While these
continue, I know no way of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
this Trade to any considerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
unless it be the erecting four


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56779:76"/>
Companies of Fishery, one in each
Province of <hi>Ireland,</hi> into which every
man that enters, shall bring a certain
Capital, and receive a proportionable
share of the gain or loss, and have a
proportional voice in the Election of
a President and Council, by whom the
whole business in each Province shall
be managed. If into each of these
Companies the King or Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
would enter for a considerable
share at the first, towards building such
a number of Boats and Busses as each
Company could easily manage, it would
be an encouragement both of honour
and advantage. Certain Priviledges
likewise, or Immunities, might be
granted from charges of trouble or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
nay from Taxes, and all unusual
payments to the publick, in favour of
such as brought in a proportion to a
certain heighth into the Stock of the
Fishery. Nay, it seems a matter of so
great importance to His Majesties
Crowns, both as to the improving the
Riches of this Kingdom, and impairing
the mighty gains of His Neighbours
by this Trade, that perhaps there were


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56779:76"/>
no hurt if an Act were made, by which
none should be capable of being either
chosen into a Parliament, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the Peace, who had not
manifested his desires of advancing
the publick good by entring in some
certain proportion into the stock and
Companies of the Fishery, since the
greatness of one, and application of
the other, seem the only present means
of improving so rich and so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
a Trade. It will afterwards be
the business of the Companies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or their directors, to fall into
the best methods and rules for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and barrelling up all their Fish,
and to see them so exactly observed,
as may bring all those quantities of
them that shall be sent abroad, or spent
at home, into the highest and most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
credit; which with advancing
the Seasons all that can be, so as to
find the first forreign Markets, will be
a way to the greatest and surest gains.
In <hi>Holland</hi> there have been above
thirty Placaerts or Acts of State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ouring, salting, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
of Herrings alone, with such


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56779:77"/>
severity in the Imposition and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Penalties, that the business is
now grown to an habitual skill, and
care, and honesty, so as hardly any
example is seen of failing in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or thereby impairing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
credit of that Commodity among
them, or in the forreign Markets they
use.</p>
            <p>Iron seems to me the Manufacture
that of all others ought the least to be
encouraged in <hi>Ireland;</hi> or if it be,
which requires the most restriction to
certain places and Rules. For I do not
remember to have heard that there is
any Oare in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at least I am sure
the greatest part is fetched from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
so that all this Country affords
of its own growth towards this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,
is but the Wood, which has
met but with too great consumptions
already in most parts of this Kingdom,
and needs not this to destroy what is
left. So that Iron-works ought to be
confined to certain places, where either
the Woods continue vast, and make the
Country savage, or where they are
not at all fit for Timber, or likely to


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56779:77"/>
grow to it, or where there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
for Timber to places of vent,
so as to quit the cost of the carriage.</p>
            <p>Having run through the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with their defects and
improvements, I will only touch the
other two Points mentioned at first, as
the grounds likewise of Trade in a
Country; those are the Commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Ports, and the store of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
in one of which this Kingdom
as much abounds, as it fails in the other.
The Haven of <hi>Dublin</hi> is barr'd to that
degree, as very much to obstruct the
Trade of the City; the clearing or
opening of it were a great work, and
proper either for the City, or the
whole Province of <hi>Lemster</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
But whether it be feasible, or at
such charges as will quit cost, I will not
judg, especially considering the many
good Havens that are scattered upon
that whole Eastern Coast of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
Besides this, I know not what to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon this head, unless it be the
making of two free Ports, one in
<hi>Kerry,</hi> and t'other upon the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
Coast, which may thereby grow


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56779:78"/>
to be Magazines for the <hi>West-Indy</hi>
Trade, and from thence those Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
may be dispersed unto all other
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> after having paid the
Customs which they ought to pay in
<hi>England,</hi> where this must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed.</p>
            <p>For the last Point, I doubt there is
hardly any other Country lying upon
the Sea-coast, and not wholly out of
the way of Trade, which has so little
Shipping of its own as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
which might be capable of imploying
more. The reason of this must be in
part the scarcity of Timber proper for
this built; but more, the want of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and uncertainty of Trade in
the Country. For preventing the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
destruction of Timber, a Law
may be made, forbidding any man to
cut down any Oak that is of a certain
heighth, unless it be of a certain scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as twelve inches diameter, or some
such measure as usually makes a Tree
useful Timber. And further, the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Penalties ought to be put upon
Barking any Tree that is not felled; a
custom barbarous and peculiar to this


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56779:78"/>
Country, and by which infinite quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Timber have been destroyed.</p>
            <p>Most Traders in these parts, at least
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are but Factors; nor do I
hear of any number of Merchants in
the Kingdom. The cause of this must
be rather an ill opinion of security,
than of gain; for those are the two baits
which draw Merchants to a place: the
last intices the poorer Traders, or the
young beginners, or those of passage;
but without the first, the substantial
and the rich will never settle in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
This opinion can be attained only
by a course of time, of good conduct,
and good government, and thereby of
justice, and of peace, which lye out of
the compass of this Discourse. But to
make some amends for this want at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
encouragement may be given to
any Merchants that shall come over and
turn a certain stock of their own here,
as Naturalization upon any terms; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from Customs the two first years,
and from any Offices of trouble or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the first seven years. I see no
hurt if the King should give leave to
the Merchants in eight or ten of the


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56779:79"/>
chief Trading-Ports of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
name for each Town one of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
out of which the Lord Lieutenant
should chuse two to be of the Privy-Council
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a certain Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
from the King to defray their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance:
This would be an honour
and encouragement to so worthy a
Calling, and would introduce an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of Trade into the Council, which
being now composed wholly of the
Nobility or Gentry, the Civil or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Officers; the Traders seem to be
left without Patrons in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and thereby without favour to
the particular concernments of a chief
member in the Politick body; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whose prospering the wealth of the
whole Kingdom seems chiefly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
            <p>But this is enough for your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
trouble, and for the discharge of
my promise, and too much I doubt for
the humour of our age to bring into
practice, or so much as to admit into
consideration. Your Lordship I know
has generous thoughts, and turned to
such Speculations as these. But that is


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56779:79"/>
not enough towards the raising such
buildings as I have drawn you here the
lines of, unless the direction of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
here were wholly in your hands,
or at least the opinion lost of other
mens being able to contest with you
those points of publick utility, which
you ought best to know and most to
be believed in, while you deserve or
discharge so great a trust as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this Kingdom. For I
think a Prince cannot too much consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom to chuse for such employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but when he has chosen, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
trust them too far, or thereby
give them too much Authority; no
more than end it too soon, whenever
he finds it abused. In short, 'tis left on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Princes to mend the world, whose
Commands find general obedience; and
Examples, imitation. For all other men,
they must take it as they find it; and
good men enter into commerce with
it, rather upon cautions of not being
spoiled themselves, than upon hopes of
mending the World. At least, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
becomes men of my level, amongst
whom I have observed all set-quarrels


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56779:80"/>
with the Age, and pretences of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it by their own models, to end com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
like the pains of a man in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Boat, who tugs at a Rope that's fast
to a Ship, it looks as if he resolved to
draw the ship to him, but the truth
and his meaning is, to draw himself to
the Ship, where he gets in when he can,
and does like the rest of the Crew
when he is there. When I have such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
I will begin such contentions; in
the mean time the bent of my thoughts
shall be rather to mend my self, than
the World, which I reckon upon leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much what I found it. Nor should
I have reason in complaining too far of
an Age, which does your Lordship so
much justice by the honour of so great
an Imployment, In which as I know no
man deserves greater successes than you
do, so I am sure no man wishes you
greater than I do.</p>

            <p>The King finds himself ingaged in
the second year of a War with the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and for prosecution thereof in
a strict Alliance with <hi>France;</hi> and
now in danger of being intangled in
the quarrel broken out upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
between <hi>France</hi> and the House
of <hi>Austria:</hi> In this state of affairs, it
is to be considered whether we can
pursue our War with <hi>Holland</hi> and yet
preserve our peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are able to maintain the War
with both in conjunction with <hi>France;</hi>
and if not, what there is left for His
Majesty to do with the best regard to
His Honour and Safety.</p>
            <p>For the first we shall soon be out of
doubt; but in the mean time 'tis very
unlikely that upon the late conjunction
between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi>
should have obliged themselves to


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56779:81"/>
make no Peace without the inclusion
of their Allyes; and that <hi>Spain</hi> should
not have yielded to break with Us,
in case they could not effect a Peace
between Us and <hi>Holland;</hi> since the
<hi>Dutch</hi> know nothing could farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to it, than the fear of a breach
with <hi>Spain,</hi> and so great a loss of Trade
in those Dominions. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have but one temptation of their own
to quarrel with Us, which is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of recovering <hi>Jamaica,</hi> for that
has ever lien at their hearts, and 'tis
to be feared their Conjunction with
<hi>Holland</hi> has not been perfected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
early measures between them for
the surprize of that Island, unless our
care has been as early in providing for
its defence. And if we should lose it,
I foresee little hurt we could do <hi>Spain</hi>
in their <hi>Indies,</hi> guarded as they would
be, and attended by the Shipping of
the <hi>Dutch;</hi> but His Majesty will, I
suppose, soon know from <hi>Spain</hi> what
He is to trust to in this point.</p>
            <p>To judge whether upon a breach
with <hi>Spain</hi> we are able to maintain the
War, must be considered; the present


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56779:82"/>
state of the Kings Treasure, the rise
or fall that may happen in his constant
Revenue by the <hi>Spanish</hi> War; the
hopes that may be grounded upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
from <hi>France,</hi> the assurance or
measure of those expected from the
Parliament, the credit of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
to raise present money where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any of these fall short, and the
humour of the Nation towards carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on or ending the War.</p>
            <p>For the present state of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
the King best knows it Himself,
or His Officers can best give the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
for the changes that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in His Revenue, 'tis evident they
must be much for the worse the very
first year of a <hi>Spanish</hi> War. The main
branch of it, which is the Customs,
must wither away in a very great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
since all the Trade in a manner
left us upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> War (that
has turned to any account) has been
that with <hi>Spain</hi> and into the <hi>Straits:</hi>
The first upon a <hi>Spanish</hi> War will be
wholly lost, the last can neither be
secured by our own Convoys, nor by
the <hi>French</hi> Fleets in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>


               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56779:82"/>
from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Capers that will fill
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Havens, and from those of
<hi>Biscay, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca,</hi>
which in all Wars have been the
Nests of Picaroons; so that no way
seems left of beginning this War, but
as the <hi>Dutch</hi> began theirs, by leaving
off all Trade in the Nation while it
lasts: But the case is very different be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and us, for they have still
a Trade left from the <hi>North,</hi> which
running upon a sandy Coast from
<hi>Hamborough,</hi> is secured from our Fleets:
and they have driven a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
by Collusion with the <hi>Swedes,
Danes, Hamburgers, Bremeners</hi> and
<hi>Flemish,</hi> ever since the War began.
Besides, the hearts of their People
(which would otherwise have sunk
by the loss of Trade) have been kept
up by the necessity of their defence,
by the last extremities which were
threatned them from the War, and by
the general opinion of justice in their
Cause both from these circumstances,
and the manner of Ours and of the
<hi>French</hi> beginning the War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:56779:83"/>
This makes the States content to
impose and the people to fuffer the
utmost payments; and besides, in a
manner all men of Fortunes among
them have a great part of their estates
lying in the Cantores of the States or
the Provinces, which would all be lost
upon the conquest of their Countrey,
so as they will lend to the last for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
so much as is already in danger.
And these are circumstances which will
not be found in our Dispositions or
Constitutions.</p>
            <p>For supplies from <hi>France,</hi> it must be
considered how their money has been
drained out of that Kingdom since this
War began, by their payments to Us,
and to <hi>Sweden,</hi> to the Bishops of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
and <hi>Munster</hi> and some other Princes
of <hi>Germany;</hi> by their Armies in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
and the new Conquests in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
all which returns no more into
<hi>France,</hi> as money did in their former
Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi> that were made chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon their Confines; for then the
Pays of their Armies being made only
in the Winter-quarters which were in
<hi>France</hi> or its Frontiers, the money fell


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56779:83"/>
back again into the circulation of their
own Countrey; yet now their expence
must upon a <hi>Spanish</hi> War be increased
by new Armies in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
and new Fleets in the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi>
so that all these circumstances with the
general decay of Trade by the War,
must in few years time leave that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
poorer than it has been this age.
And where money is not, the King of
<hi>France</hi> himself cannot have it.</p>
            <p>For what supplies may come from
the Parliament towards carrying on the
War, some few days I suppose will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, and no measures can be taken
unless by what past in the former Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which was not very favourable to
that design.</p>
            <p>For the Credit of the Exchequer
(at least to any measure that may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Course or Necessities of a War)
I fear it is irrecoverably lost by the
last breach with the Bankers; for cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
is gained by custom and course of
time, and seldom recovers a strain;
but if broken, is never well set again.
I have heard a great Example given of
this (by some of our Merchants) that


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56779:84"/>
happened upon the last Kings seizing
200000 l. that was in the Mint about
the year 38, which had then the credit
of a Bank, and for several years had
been the Treasury of all the vast pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
transmitted from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
But after this invasion of it,
though the King paid back the money
within very few months, yet the Mint
has never since recovered its Credit
among foreign Merchants.</p>
            <p>If the business of money should
happen to go lame upon any or all of
these feet, then all that will be left to
carry on the War is the humour of the
Nation: And that sometimes may go
farther than any Treasures, if spirited
by Hatred or Revenge, by the love of
Religion or Liberty, or the necessity
of Defence: But the good will of the
Nation to the present War (as it was
foreseen by those who gave the Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Counsels of beginning it with the
Proroguing of the Parliament, and
stopping of the Exchequer; so it) has
been since but too much experienced
by the successes have attended it, which
will ever depend upon the humours


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56779:84"/>
and opinions of those that serve, as
well as the Abilities and Conduct of
those that Command; and not to speak
of those incurable jealousies which
have been so generally raised or infused
into the People about the first designs
of this War, and so much encreased by
the Professions or Actions, or at least
the general Reputation of those who
pass for the chief Authors of it: 'Tis
at least observable, that after so long
hostility and Four Battels, yet the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
does not seem at all to be angry,
though that is the first thing should be
brought about, if we would have men
fight.</p>
            <p>It is, I doubt, little to be hoped,
that a breach with <hi>Spain</hi> should make
us any kinder to the War than we were
before; since that must grow wholly
upon occasion of the <hi>French,</hi> We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no quarrel there of our own.
And our kindness to <hi>France</hi> will spirit
us as little as our hatred to <hi>Spain,</hi> at
least till their fortunes change, and the
Ballance rise again on the <hi>Spanish</hi> side,
which has risen so long and to such a
height on the <hi>French;</hi> for by the


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56779:85"/>
course of Humane Nature there will
ever be a degree of hatred mingled
with fear, and of kindness with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</p>
            <p>Upon the survey of these provisions
and dispositions, it must be concluded
necessary for His Majesty either to make
a peace, or else to turn the War di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
upon such points of Honour,
Justice and Safety, as may ingage both
the Parliament and Nation in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and prosecution of the War. And
to do this, He must at least offer at a
Peace, and upon terms into which the
humour and spirit of the Nation will
run.</p>
            <p>The Conjunction now perfected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> seems the
happiest thing that could have arrived
to His Majesties affairs upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
for whilst <hi>Holland</hi> stood alone,
in case we had been forced to offer at
any measures with them, <hi>France</hi> might
upon the first jealousie have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Us, and slipping one knot might
have tyed another in three days time;
But now the Interests of the <hi>Empire,
Spain</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> are woven together


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56779:85"/>
with those of <hi>Holland,</hi> it will not be
a short or easie work to adjust those
of <hi>France</hi> with the Emperor in the
matters of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> with <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
or the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in that
<hi>Dutchy;</hi> nor is the Conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Holland</hi> and their Allies likely
to be broken unless by the revolutions
of War the <hi>Dutch</hi> come to apprehend
a nearer and greater danger from <hi>Spain,</hi>
in which case they will not fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to their old measures with
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first pace which seems necessary
for his Majesty to make, is to fall into
Confidence with <hi>Spain</hi> as far as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he can, by assuring them he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
upon a neutrality in the War
between them and <hi>France;</hi> that if he
comes to a peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it shall pass by their Mediation;
and if that be effected, he will imploy
his own towards the general Peace
of Christendom, and particularly that
between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next point is to resolve upon
the Conditions necessary to a Peace.
The best way to this is to seek without


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56779:86"/>
passion where the justice lies, and the
true interests of his Majesties Crowns,
as it is generally understood by his
People, of which the sense of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is the best Testimony; for their
concurrence will give weight to his
demands of Peace, or to the support
of a War.</p>
            <p>Between Us and <hi>Holland</hi> the points
of Justice must be grounded upon the
infraction of Treaties, and so will
reach only to the business of the Flag
and of <hi>Surinam.</hi> For the Flag, it has
been agreed by three several Treaties
in the same form; but the Articles
still referring to former use, it remains
to discuss and agree particularly what
that has been, and to explain the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and circumstances of observing it.
Without this, no peace we can have
will seem to be made with intentions
to keep it long, while the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Article about the Flag is
a ground at pleasure for opening a
War. And this point can only be
gained by a separate Peace between
Us and <hi>Holland;</hi> for if the War should
come to end in a general Treaty, like


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56779:86"/>
that of <hi>Munster;</hi> As His Majesties
interest would be less considered in a
croud of so many others, and would
hardly be suffered to obstruct a general
Peace; so this Right of the Flag in
particular, would be at least disfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if not opposed by our Friends as
well as our Enemies, that is, by <hi>France,
Sweden, Denmark,</hi> as well as <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The business of <hi>Surinam</hi> is a trifle,
and the disputes upon it arose rather
from an unkind and jealous humour
growing between the Nations, than
from any difference or difficulty in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justing
it; so as that is not a thing will
lye much in the way, being soon deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by plain Articles upon the surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of the Place.</p>
            <p>There are two points more wherein
the honour and interest of the Nation
is concerned and ought to be insisted
upon, so far at least as to find a temper
in them, though they can hardly be
said to be points of Justice, because
they are not regulated by Treaties.
The first is the point of the <hi>East-India</hi>
trade, wherein we desire new agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56779:87"/>
between us, upon suspition of
what may happen, rather than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of any Breach in the old; and
though our <hi>East-India</hi> Company never
urged their desires as a just ground
for a Quarrel, yet a great deal might
have been gained in this point from
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> while they depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Alliance; and I suppose may
be still, if we fall into it again.</p>
            <p>The second is an acknowledgment to
His Majesty for the leave of fishing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
His Coasts; and though this may
not be grounded upon any Treaty, yet
if it appear to have been an ancient
Right on our side, and custom on theirs,
and not determined or extinguished by
any Treaty between us; it may with
Justice be insisted on, though it will
pass harder with the <hi>Dutch</hi> than any of
the rest, who will much easier be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to buy off the pretence with a
great sum of money at one or more
payments, than acknowledg it by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
tribute.</p>
            <p>The last thing His Majesty can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from <hi>Holland</hi> is money for the
charges of the War. But unless the


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56779:87"/>
Justice or Necessity of it were agreed
on between us, that will have but a
weak ground. And if we expect
money, it must be to purchase what
is to come, and not to pay for what
is past; and it is very probable that
if His Majesty should resolve with a
peace of <hi>Holland</hi> to enter into a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> upon
the evident points of justice between
them, and to joyn against that Crown
which refuses the Peace, both <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>Holland</hi> would be content to part
with their money upon such an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But the measure and manner
must be left to private Treaty, and
would depend upon the confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us.</p>
            <p>Whatever in any of these points or
any other His Majesty should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to release, ought to be done upon
the satisfaction He should declare to
have received in the advancement of
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the charges
of his Ancestors. But for His Majesty
to insist upon any further advantages
to the Prince than are already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
upon him, would not only


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56779:88"/>
raise invincible difficulties in our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the States, but prejudice the
Princes affairs among them in a very
great measure. And the Prince I believe
knows their Constitution so well, as to
understand it so.</p>
            <p>If upon good terms in these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
a Peace can be effected with
<hi>Holland,</hi> the honour of this Crown
will certainly be provided for, and the
interest of it to a higher degree than
could have been gained even without
the events of the War; since we should
be left in Peace to enjoy the Trade of
the world, while the House of <hi>Austria</hi>
and <hi>Holland</hi> would be engaged in a long
War with <hi>France;</hi> and whenever they
grow weary, His Majesty would have
the glory and advantage of mediating
the Peace.</p>
            <p>For the measures to be observed in
all this with <hi>France,</hi> and the preserving
His Majesties Honour on that side;
First, the humour of the Parliament
as to this War, and the interest of the
Nation in the Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> ought
to be represented to them as difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
invincible, unless <hi>France</hi> can furnish


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56779:88"/>
the charge which the War will cost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what can be spared out of His
Majesties constant Revenue. Then His
Majesty may propose to them His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Neutrality between them and
<hi>Spain,</hi> which I suppose was not a point
that entred into any Agreements against
<hi>Holland;</hi> and lastly, He may desire
their consent, since he cannot prosecute
the War, to make his peace with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
upon the assurance of imploying
afterwards his Mediation between them
and <hi>Spain,</hi> in which the concurrence of
His Parliament will make Him able to
effect a Peace, as the want of it has
made Him unable to pursue the War.
If <hi>France</hi> will not consent either to
furnish us with money sufficient to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the War, nor to our Neutrality
with <hi>Spain,</hi> nor peace with <hi>Holland:</hi>
it would then be considered whether
<hi>France</hi> in the like case would suffer
such a Conjuncture as this to escape
them upon any Ties or Treaties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us: or whether indeed any
Prince or State would do so. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
whereby the honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of His Majesties Crowns may be


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56779:89"/>
provided for, the Trade of the Nation
raised to a heighth it has not reached
before; the passionate bent and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the people pleased, and their
jealousies in a great measure allayed,
the true ballance of Christendom main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
all the Princes and States of it
(besides <hi>France</hi> alone) satisfied; and
in short, by which His Majesty may
grow again insensibly into the hearts
of his people at home, and into the
influence upon all affairs of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
abroad.</p>
            <p>It is a rude thing which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, that we may come off from
<hi>France</hi> with as much honour as we
came on. But it is a true thing, that
he has always the honour of the War
that has the advantage of it, and 'tis
I doubt, so of a Peace too; and that
cannot fail us here, provided we make
sure of <hi>Spain</hi> (in case we apprehend
our losing of <hi>France),</hi> to which their
dispositions and interests must certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concur with ours in all points,
unless that of <hi>Jamaica</hi> make an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56779:89"/>
All the difficulty His Majesty can
meet with in this pursuit, will be some
want of reputation and trust with the
Government of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
which have been foyled of late by the
breach of our former Alliances, so
much (as they think) against our own
interests as well as theirs; for all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are grounded upon the common
belief, That every State will be ever
found in their own Interests, among
which their Honour and observance
of Faith grows to be one very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
(Because while the minds of
men are generally possest with a belief
of God Almighty's concerning Himself
in affairs here below, the opinion of
Justice or Injustice in a Quarrel will
never fail of having mighty effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the successes of a War): therefore
our reputation cannot any way be so
far recovered with our Neighbours, as
by their finding that His Majesties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
return into the true interests of
His Kingdoms, which will make the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> believe our Measures may be
firm with them upon the same reason
which has shaken them with <hi>France.</hi>


               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56779:90"/>
Thus much is certain, that whatever
means will restore or raise the credit
of His Majesties Government at home,
will do it abroad too; for a King of
<hi>England</hi> at the head of his Parliament
and People, and in their hearts and
interests, can never fail of making what
figure he pleases in the world, nor of
being safe and easie at home; and may
despise all the designs of factious men,
who can only make themselves consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by seeming to be in the interest
of the Nation, when the Court seems
to be out of it. But in running on
Councels contrary to the general hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and spirit of the People, the King
indeed may make His Ministers great
Subjects, but they can never make Him
a Great Prince.</p>

by a Letter
from your Ladiship,
was too great and
too sensible not to
be acknowledged;
but yet I doubted
whether that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
could bear me out in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of giving your Ladiship any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
troubles of this kind, without as


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56779:91"/>
good an errand as my last. This I have
reckon'd upon a good while by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
visit my Sister and I had designed
to my Lord <hi>Capell.</hi> How we came to
have defer'd it so long, I think we are
neither of us like to tell you at this
distance, though we make our selves
believe it could not be helpt. Your
Ladiship at least has had the advantage
of being thereby excused sometime
from this trouble, which I could no
longer forbear upon the sensible wounds
that have so often of late been given
your friends here by such desperate
expressions in several of your Letters
concerning your Humour, your Health,
and your Life; in all which if they
are your Friends, you must allow them
to be extremely concerned. Perhaps
none can be at heart more partial than
I am to whatever touches your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
nor more inclined to defend you
upon this very occasion, how unjust
and unkind soever you are to your
self. But when you go about to throw
away your Health, or your Life, so
great a remainder of your own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and so great hopes of that into


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56779:91"/>
which you are enter'd, and all by a
desperate melancholly, upon an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
past remedy, and to which all
mortal race is perpetually subject; For
God's sake, Madam, give me leave to
tell you, that what you do is not at
all agreeable either with so good a
Christian, or so reasonable, and so great
a person as your Ladiship appears to
the World in all other lights.</p>
            <p>I know no duty in Religion more
generally agreed on, nor more justly
required by God Almighty than a
perfect submission to His Will in all
things; nor do I think any disposition
of mind can either please Him more,
or become us better, than that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
satisfied with all He gives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with all He takes away. None
I am sure can be of more Honour to
God, nor of more ease to our selves;
for if we consider him as our Maker,
we cannot contend with him; if as
our Father, we ought not to distrust
him; So that we may be confident,
whatever He does is intended for our
good, and whatever happens that we
interpret otherwise, yet we can get


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56779:92"/>
nothing by repining, nor save any thing
by resisting.</p>
            <p>But if it were fit for us to reason
with God Almighty, and your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
loss be acknowledged as great as
it could have been to any one alive;
Yet, I doubt, you would have but ill
grace to complain at the rate you have
done, or rather as you do; for the first
motions of passions how violent soever,
may be pardoned; and it is only the
course of them which makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable.
In this world, Madam, there
is nothing perfectly good, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is called so, is but either compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
with other things of its kind,
or else with the evil that is mingled in
its composition; so he is a good man
that is better than men commonly are,
or in whom the good qualities are
more than the bad; so in the course of
life, his condition is esteemed good,
which is better than that of most other
men, or wherein the good circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are more than the ill; By this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
I doubt Madam, your complaints
ought to be turned into acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and your Friends would have


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56779:92"/>
cause to rejoyce rather than condole
with you; For the goods or blessings
of life are usually esteemed to be, Birth,
Health, Beauty, Friends, Children, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Riches. Now when your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has fairly considered how God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
has dealt with you in what He
has given you of all these, you may
be left to judge your self how you
have dealt with Him in your complaints
for what he has taken away. But if
you look about you, and consider o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lives as well as your own, and
what your lot is in comparison with
those that have been drawn in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of your knowledg; If you think
how few are born with Honour, how
many dye without Name or Children,
how little Beauty we see, how few
Friends we hear of, how many Diseases,
and how much Poverty there is in the
world, you will fall down upon your
knees, and instead of repining at one
affliction, will admire so many blessings
as you have received at the hand of
God.</p>
            <p>To put your Ladiship in mind of
what you are, and the advantages you


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56779:93"/>
have in all these points, would look like
a design to flatter you: But this I may
say, that we will pity you as much as
you please, if you will tell us who
they are that you think upon all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
you have reason to envy.
Now if I had a Master that gave me all
I could ask, but thought fit to take
one thing from me again, either because
I used it ill, or gave my self so much
over to it, as to neglect what I owed
either to him or the rest of the world;
Or perhaps because he would show his
power, and put me in mind from whom
I held all the rest; would you think
I had much reason to complain of hard
usage, and never to remember any more
what was left me, never to forget what
was taken away.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, you have lost a Child, and
therein all that could be lost in a Child
of that age; but you have kept one
Child, and are likely to do so long;
you have the assurance of another,
and the hopes of many more. You
have kept a Husband great in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in fortune, and (which is
more) in the esteem of good men. You


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56779:93"/>
have kept your Beauty, and your
Health, unless you have destroyed them
your self, or discouraged them to stay
with you by using them ill. You have
Friends that are as kind to you as you
can wish, or as you will give them
leave to be by your fears of losing
you, and being thereby so much the
unhappier, the kinder they are to you;
But you have Honour and Esteem from
all that know you; or if ever it fails
in any degree, 'tis only upon that point
of your seeming to be fallen out with
God and the whole World, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to care for your self, or any thing
else after what you have lost.</p>
            <p>You will say perhaps <hi>that</hi> one thing
was all to you, and your fondness of
it made you indifferent to every thing
else; But this, I doubt, will be so far
from justifying you, that it will prove
to be your fault as well as your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
God Almighty gave you all
the blessings of life, and you set your
heart wholly upon one, and despise or
undervalue all the rest: Is this His
fault or yours? Nay, is it not to be
very unthankful to Heaven, as well as


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56779:94"/>
very scornful to the rest of the world?
Is it not to say, because you have lost
one thing God had given you, you thank
Him for nothing he has left, and care
not what he takes away? Is it not to
say, since that one thing is gone out of
the world, there is nothing left in it
which you think can deserve your
kindness or esteem? A friend makes
me a feast, and sets all before me that
his care or kindness could provide;
but I set my heart upon one dish alone,
and if that happen to be thrown down,
I scorn all the rest; and though he sends
for another of the same, yet I rise from
the Table in a rage, and say my friend
is my enemy, and has done me the
greatest wrong in the world; Have I
reason, Madam, or good grace in what
I do? Or would it become me better
to eat of the rest that is before me,
and think no more of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and could not be remedied?</p>
            <p>All the Precepts of Christianity agree
to teach and command us to moderate
our passions, to temper our affections
towards all things below; to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the possession, and patient under


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56779:94"/>
the loss whenever He that gave it shall
see fit to take away. Your extreme
fondness was perhaps as displeasing to
God before, as now your extreme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and your loss may have been
a punishment for your faults in the
manner of enjoying what you had;
'Tis at least pious to ascribe all the ill
that befalls us to our own demerits ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to injustice in God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
us better to adore all the issues
of His Providence in the effects, than
inquire into the causes; For submission
is the only way of reasoning between
a creature and its Maker; and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in His Will is the greatest duty
we can pretend to, and the best reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
we can apply to all our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>But, Madam, though Religion were
no party in your case, and that for so
violent and injurious a grief you had
nothing to answer to God, but only
to the world and your self; yet I very
much doubt how you would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.
We bring into the world
with us a poor needy uncertain life,
short at the longest, and unquiet at


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56779:95"/>
the best; All the imaginations of the
witty and the wise have been perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
busied to find out the ways how
to revive it with pleasures, or relieve
it with diversions; how to compose it
with ease, and settle it with safety;
To some of these ends have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
the institutions of Lawgivers,
the reasonings of Philosophers, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of Poets, the pains of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the extravagances of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
men. All the world is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
at work about nothing else, but
only that our poor mortal lives should
pass the easier and happier for that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time we possess them, or else end
the better when we lose them; Upon
this occasion Riches came to be coveted,
Honours to be esteemed, Friendship and
Love to be pursued, and Virtues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be admired in the world.
Now, Madam, is it not to bid defiance
to all mankind, to condemn their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
opinions and designs, if instead
of passing your life as well and easily,
you resolve to pass it as ill and as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
as you can? You grow insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to the conveniences of Riches,


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56779:95"/>
the delights of Honour and Praise, the
charms of kindness, or Friendship, nay
to the observance or applause of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
themselves; For who can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
in these excesses of passion, will
allow you to show either temperance
or fortitude, to be either prudent or
just? And for your Friends, I suppose,
you reckon upon losing their kindness,
when you have sufficiently convinced
them, they can never hope for any
of yours, since you have none left for
your self, or any thing else. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
upon all occasions, you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of receiving any comfort or
pleasure in any thing that is left in this
world; and, I assure you Madam, none
can ever love you, that can have no
hopes ever to please you.</p>
            <p>Among the several inquiries and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
after the happiness of life,
the sensual men agree in pursuit of
every pleasure they can start, without
regarding the pains of the chase, the
weariness when it ends, or how little
the quarry is worth: The busie and
ambitious fall into the more lasting
pursuits of Power and Riches; The


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56779:96"/>
speculative men prefer tranquillity of
mind, before the different motions of
passion and appetite, or the common
successions of desire and satiety, of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and pain; but this may seem too
dull a principle for the happiness of
life, which is ever in motion; and
though passions are perhaps the stings,
without which they say no honey is
made; yet I think all sorts of men
have ever agreed, they ought to be our
Servants, and not our Masters; to give
us some agitation for entertainment, or
exercise, but never to throw our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
out of its seat. Perhaps I would
not always sit still, or would be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on horse-back; but I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ride a Horse that galls my flesh,
or shakes my bones, or that runs away
with me as he pleases, so as I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
stop at a River or Precipice. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
no passions at all, than have them
too violent; or such alone, as instead
of heightening our pleasures, afford us
nothing but vexation and pain.</p>
            <p>In all such losses as your Ladiships
has been, there is something that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nature cannot be denied, there


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56779:96"/>
is a great deal that good nature may
be allowed; but all excessive and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous
grief or lamentation for the
dead, was accounted among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Christians, to have something of
heathenish; and among the Civil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of old, to have something of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous;
and therefore it has been the
care of the first to moderate it by their
Precepts, and the latter to restrain it
by their Laws: The longest time that
has been allowed to the forms of
Mourning by the custom of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and in any Relation, has been but
that of a year; in which space the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is commonly supposed to be moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
away to earth, and to retain no
more figure of what it was; but this
has been given only to the loss of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
of Husband, or Wife. On the
other side, to Children under age, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
has been allowed; and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
with particular reason (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ground of all general customs),
perhaps because they dye in innocence,
and without having tasted the miseries
of life, so as we are sure they are well
when they leave us, and escape much


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56779:97"/>
ill would in all appearance have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
them if they had stay'd longer
with us. Besides, a Parent may have
twenty Children, and so his mourning
may run through all the best of his
life, if his losses are frequent of that
kind; and our kindness to Children so
young, is taken to proceed from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinions, or fond imaginations,
not Friendship or Esteem; and to be
grounded upon entertainment rather
than use in the many offices of life;
nor would it pass from any person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
your Ladiship, to say you lost a
companion and a friend at Nine year
old, though you lost one indeed who
gave the fairest hopes that could be of
being both in time, and every thing
else that was esteembable and good;
But yet, that it self God only knows,
considering the changes of humour and
disposition, which are as great as those
of feature and shape the first sixteen
years of our lives; considering the
chances of time, the infection of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the snares of the world, and
the passions of youth; so that the
most excellent and agreeable creature


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56779:97"/>
of that tender age, and that seemed
born under the happiest Stars, might
by the course of years and accidents,
come to be the most miserable her self,
and more trouble to her Friends by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
long, than she could have been by
dying young.</p>
            <p>Yet after all, Madam, I think your
loss so great, and some measure of your
grief so deserved, that would all your
passionate complaints, all the anguish
of your heart do any thing to retrieve
it; Could tears water the lovely plant,
so as to make it grow again after once
'tis cut down. Would sighs furnish new
breath, or could it draw life and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
from the wasting of yours; I am
sure your Friends would be so far from
accusing your passion, that they would
encourage it as much, and share it as
deep as they could. But alas, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws of the Creation extinguish
all such hopes, forbid all such designs;
Nature gives us many Children and
Friends to take them away, but takes
none away to give them us again. And
this makes the excesses of grief to have
been so universally condemned as a


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56779:98"/>
thing unnatural, because so much in
vain; whereas nature they say does
nothing in vain: As a thing so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
because so contrary to our
own designs; for we all design to be
well, and at ease, and by grief we make
our selves ill of imaginary wounds,
and raise our selves troubles most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
out of the dust, while our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
and complaints are but like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
shot up into the air, at no mark,
and so to no purpose; but only to fall
back upon our heads, and destroy our
selves instead of recovering, or reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Friends.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, Madam, you will say this
is your design, or if not your desire;
but I hope you are not yet so far gone,
or so desperately bent; Your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
knows very well your life is not
your own, but His that lent it you to
manage, and preserve the best you
could, and not throw it away, as if it
came from some common hand. It
belongs in a great measure to your
Countrey, and your Family, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by all humane Laws, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
self-murder has ever been agreed


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56779:98"/>
on as the greatest crime, and is punisht
here with the utmost shame, which is
all that can be inflicted upon the dead.
But is the crime much less to kill our
selves by a slow poyson, than by a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
wound? Now if we do it, and
know we do it by a long and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
grief, can we think our selves
innocent? What great difference is
there if we break our hearts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
them; if we pierce them, or bruise
them, since all determines in the same
death, as all arises from the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair?
But what if it goes not so far?
'tis not indeed so bad as might be, but
that does not excuse it from being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill: Though I do not kill my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
is it no hurt to wound him, or
to spoyl him of the conveniencies of
life? The greatest crime is for a man
to kill himself; is it a small one to
wound himself by anguish of heart, by
grief, or dispair, to ruin his health, to
shorten his age, to deprive himself of
all the pleasures, or eases, or enjoyments
of life?</p>
            <p>Next to the mischiefs we do our
selves, are those we do our Children,


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56779:99"/>
and our Friends, as those who deserve
best of us, or at least deserve no ill;
The Child you carry about you, what
has that done that you should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deprive it of life, almost as
soon as you bestow it? or if at the best
you suffer it to live to be born, yet
by your ill usage of your self, should
so much impair the strength of its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and health, and perhaps the very
temper of its mind, by giving it such
an infusion of melancholly, as may
serve to discolour the objects, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relish
the accidents it may meet with
in the common train of life? But this
is one you are not yet acquainted
with; what will you say to another
you are? Were it a small injury to my
Lord <hi>Capell</hi> to deprive him of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whose prudence and kindness he
may justly expect, the cares of his health
and education, the forming of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the cultivating of his mind;
the seeds of Honour and Virtue, and
thereby the true Principles of a happy
life? How has my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that you should go about to
lose him a Wife He loves with so


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56779:99"/>
much passion, and which is more, with
so much reason; so great an honour
and support to His Family, so great a
hope to His Fortune, and comfort to
His Life? Are there so many left of
your own great Family, that you should
desire in a manner wholly to reduce it,
by suffering the greatest and almost
last branch of it to wither away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its time? Or is your Countrey in
this age so stored with great persons,
that you should envy it those we may
justly expect from so noble a race.</p>
            <p>Whilest I had any hopes your tears
would ease you, or that your grief
would consume it self by liberty and
time, your Ladiship knows very well
I never once accused it, nor ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
it like many others by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
formal ways of asswaging it; and
this I am sure is the first office of this
kind I ever went about to perform o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than in the most ordinary
forms. I was in hope what was so
violent, could not be so long; but
when I observed it to grow stronger
with age, and encrease like a stream
the further it run; when I saw it draw


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56779:100"/>
out to such unhappy consequences,
and threaten no less than your Child,
your Health, and your Life; I could
no longer forbear this endeavour, nor
end it without begging of your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for God's sake and for your own,
for your Childrens and your Friends,
for your Countreys and your Families,
that you would no longer abandon
your self to so disconsolate a passion,
but that you would at length awaken
your Piety, give way to your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or at least rowse up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Spirit of the <hi>Piercys,</hi> that never
yet shrunk at any disaster; that you
would sometimes remember the great
Honours and Fortunes of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
not always the losses, cherish
those veins of good humour that are
sometimes so natural to you, and sear
up those of ill that would make you
so unnatural to your Children, and to
your self; But above all, that you
would enter upon the cares of your
health, and your life, for your Friends
sake at least, if not for your own.
For my part, I know nothing could
be to me so great an honour and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56779:100"/>
as if your Ladiship would
own me to have contributed towards
this Cure; but however, none can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more justly pretend to your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for the attempt, since there is none,
I am sure, that has always had at heart
a greater Honour for your Ladiships

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Never thought it
would have befallen
me to be the first
that should try a
new experiment, any
more than to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of any new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
being little inclined to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
upon others, and as little that


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56779:102"/>
others should practise upon me. The
same warmth of head disposes men
to both, though one be commonly
esteemed an honour, and the other a
reproach. I am sorry the first, and
the worse of the two is fallen to my
share, by which all a man can hope is
to avoid censure, and that is much
harder than to gain applause; For
this may be done by one great or wise
action in an age; but to avoid cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
a man must pass his life without
saying or doing one ill or foolish
thing.</p>
            <p>This might serve the turn, if all men
were just; but as they are, I doubt
nothing will, and that 'tis the idlest
pretension in the world to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; The meanest Subjects censuring
the actions of the greatest Prince; The
silliest Servants of the wisest Master;
and young Children of the oldest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
Therefore I have not troubled
my self to give any account of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
I made by your perswasion,
to satisfie those who imputed it to
folly, rashness, or impatience; but to
satisfie you who proposed the thing in


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56779:102"/>
kindness to me, and desired the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it in kindness to other men.</p>
            <p>I confess, your engaging me first in
this adventure of the <hi>Moxa,</hi> and desiring
the story of it from me, is like giving
one the torture, and then asking his
confession, which is hard usage to an
innocent man, and a friend; Besides,
having suffered the first, I took my self
to have a right of refusing the other;
But I find your Authority with me is
too great to be disputed in either; and
the pretence of publick good is a cheat
that will ever pass in the world, though
so often abused by ill men, that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the good do not grow ashamed
to use it any longer. Let it be as it
will, you have what you asked, and
cannot but say that I have done, as well
as suffered what you had a mind to
engage me in. I have told you the
story with the more circumstance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many questioned the Disease,
that they might not allow of the Cure;
though the certainty of one, and force
of the other, has been enough evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
by two returns since I left you
at the <hi>Hague,</hi> which past with the same


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56779:103"/>
success. The reasonings upon this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which seem to confirm the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
and other Remedies for the
<hi>Gout</hi> here reflected on, are aimed at
the same end for which you seemed so
much to desire this Relation. The
digressions I cannot excuse otherwise,
than by the confidence that no man
will read them, who has not at least
as much leisure as I had when I writ
them; and whosoever dislikes, or grows
weary of them, may throw them away.
For those about temperance, age, or
their effects and periods in reference to
publick business, they could be better
addrest to none, than to you, who
have past the longest life with the most
temperance, and the best health and
humor of any man I know; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
run through so much great and
publick business, have found out the
secret so little known, that there is a
time to give it over.</p>
            <p>I will pretend but to one piece of
merit in this Relation, which is to
have writ it for you in <hi>English,</hi> being
the Language I always observed to
have most of your kindness among so


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56779:103"/>
many others of your acquaintance.
If your partiality to that, and to me,
and to your own request, will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
all the faults of this Paper; I
have nothing more to say for it, and
so will leave you to judge of it as you
please.</p>
            <p>AMong all the Diseases, to which
the intemperance of this age
disposes it (at least in these Northern
Climates), I have observed none to
encrease so much within the compass
of my memory and conversation, as
the <hi>Gout,</hi> nor any I think of worse
consequence to mankind; because it
falls generally upon persons engaged in
publick affairs, and great imployments,
upon whose thoughts and cares (if
not their motions and their pains) the
common good and service of their
Countrey so much depends. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Officers of Armies, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Provinces, the publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in Councels at home, and Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
abroad (that have fallen in my
way) being generally subject to it in
one degree or other. I suppose the


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56779:104"/>
reason of this may be, that men sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
come into those Posts till after
forty year old, about which time the
natural heat beginning to decay, makes
way for those distempers they are most
inclined to by their Native Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or by their customs and habits
of life. Besides, persons in those Posts
are usually born of Families Noble and
Rich, and so derive a weakness of
constitution from the ease and luxury
of their Ancestors, and the delicacy of
their own Education; Or if not, yet
the plenty of their fortunes from those
very imployments, and the general cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of living in them at much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
engages men in the constant
use of great Tables, and in frequent
excesses of several kinds, which must
end in diseases when the vigor of youth
is past, and the force of exercise (that
served before to spend the humour)
is given over for a sedentary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
life.</p>
            <p>These I take to be the reasons of such
persons being so generally subject to
such accidents more than other men;
and they are so plain, that they must


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56779:104"/>
needs occur to any one that thinks;
But the ill consequence of it is not so
obvious, though perhaps as evident to
men that observe, and may be equally
confirmed by Reasons, and Examples.
It is that the vigor of the mind decays
with that of the body, and not only
humour and invention, but even judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and resolution, change and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
with ill constitution of body,
and of health; And by this means pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
business comes to suffer by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
infirmities, and Kingdoms or States
fall into weaknesses and distempers, by
the diseases or decays of those persons
that manage them.</p>
            <p>Within these fifteen years past, I have
known a great Fleet disabled for two
Months, and thereby lose great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
by an indisposition of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
while he was neither well enough
to exercise, nor ill enough to leave
the command. I have known two
Towns of the greatest consequence
lost, contrary to all forms, by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
falling ill in the time of the
Sieges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:56779:105"/>
I have observed the fate of a <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
determine contrary to all appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by the caution and conduct of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
which were attributed by those
that knew him to his age and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
rather than his own true qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
acknowledged otherwise to have
been as great as most men of the age.
I have seen the Councels of a noble
Countrey grow bold, or timorous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Fits of his good or ill
health that managed them, and the
pulse of the Government beat high or
low with that of the Governour; and
this unequal Conduct make way for
great accidents in the world; Nay, I
have often reflected upon the Councels
and Fortunes of the greatest Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
rising and decaying sensibly with
the ages and healths of the Princes and
chief Officers that governed them.
And I remember one great Minister
that confest to me, when he fell into
one of his usual Fits of the Gout, He
was no longer able to bend his mind
or thoughts to any publick business,
nor give Audiences beyond two or
three of his own Domesticks, though


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56779:105"/>
it were to save a Kingdom; and that
this proceeded not from any violence
of pain, but from a general languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and faintness of Spirits, which made
him in those Fits think nothing worth
the trouble of one careful or solicitous
thought. For the approaches, or lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Gout, the Spleen, or the
Scurvy, nay the very fumes of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,
may indispose men to thought
and to care, as well as diseases of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and pain.</p>
            <p>Thus accidents of Health grow to
be accidents of State, and publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
come to depend in a great
measure upon those of particular men,
which makes it perhaps seem necessary
in the choice of persons for great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
(at least such as require con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
application and pains) to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their bodies as well as their minds,
and ages and health as well as their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>When I was younger than I am, and
thereby a worse judge of age; I have
often said, that what great thing soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a man proposed to do in his life,
He should think of atchieving it by


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56779:106"/>
fifty year old. Now I am approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that age, I think it much more
than I did before; and that no man
rides to an end of that Stage without
feeling his journey in all parts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
distinctions are made between the
mind and the body, or between judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and memory. And though I
have known some few, who might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be of use in Councel upon great
occasions, till after threescore and ten;
and have heard that the two late Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in <hi>Spain.</hi> Counts of <hi>Castriglio</hi>
and <hi>Pignoranda,</hi> were so till fourscore;
Yet I will not answer, that the very
conduct of publick affairs under their
Ministry has not always tasted of the
lees of their age.</p>
            <p>I observe in this Assembly at <hi>Nimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
from so many several parts of
<hi>Christendom,</hi> that so one and twenty
Ambassadors, there are but three above
fifty years old; which seems an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of my opinion being in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
general; Nor can I think the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
ill calculated, at least for a great
General of Armies, or Minister of
State, in times, or scenes of great Action,


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56779:106"/>
when the care of a State or an Army
ought to be as constant as the <hi>Chymicks</hi>
fire, to make any great production;
and if it goes out for an hour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the whole operation fails. Now
I doubt whether any man after fifty
be capable of such constant applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thought, any more than of long
and violent labour or exercise, which
that certainly is, and of the finest parts.
Besides, none that feels sensibly the
decays of age, and his life wearing off,
can figure to himself those imaginary
charms in Riches and Praise, that men
are apt to do in the warmth of their
blood; and those are the usual Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
towards the attempt of great
dangers, and support of great trouble
and pains.</p>
            <p>To confirm this by Examples, I have
heard that Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> about
five and fifty, found it was time to
give over. That the present Grand
<hi>Vizier,</hi> who passes for one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
men of that Empire, or this age,
began His Ministry about twenty eight;
and the greatest I have observed, which
was that of <hi>Monsieur de Witt,</hi> began


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56779:107"/>
at three and thirty, and lasted to forty
eight, and could not, I believe, have
gone on many years longer at that
heighth, even without that fatal end.
Among other qualities which enter'd
into the composition of this Minister,
the great care he had of his health, and
the little of his life, were not, I think,
the least considerable; since from the
first He derived his great temperance,
as well as his great boldness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
from the other. And if intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
be allowed to be the common
Mother of Gout, of Dropsie, and of
Scurvy, and most other lingring Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
which are those that infest the
State; I think Temperance deserves
the first rank among publick Virtues,
as well as those of private men, and
doubt whether any can pretend to the
constant steddy exercise of Prudence,
Justice, or Fortitude, without it.</p>
            <p>Upon these Grounds, whoever can
propose a way of Curing, or prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gout (which enter'd chiefly
into those examples I have mentioned
of publick affairs suffering by private
indispositions) would perhaps do a


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56779:107"/>
service to Princes and States, as well as
to particular men, which makes me
the more willing to tell my Story, and
talk out of my Trade, being strongly
possest with a belief, that what I have
tryed, or thought, or heard upon this
subject, may go a great way in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the growth of this disease where
it is but new, though perhaps longer
methods are necessary to deal with it
when 'tis old.</p>
            <p>From my Grandfathers death I had
reason to apprehend the Stone, and
from my Fathers life the Gout, who
has been for this many years, and still
continues much afflicted with it. The
first apprehension has been, I confess
with me, ever the strongest, and the
other hardly in my thoughts, having
never deserved it by the usual forms;
Nor had I ever, I thank God, the least
threat from either of them, till the last
year at the <hi>Hague,</hi> being then in the
seven and fortieth of my age; when
about the end of <hi>February,</hi> one night
at Supper, I felt a sudden pain in my
right foot, which from the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it began, encreased sensibly, and


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56779:108"/>
in an hours time to that degree, that
though I said nothing, yet others took
notice of it in my face, and said, They
were sure I was not well, and would
have had me go to bed. I confest I
was in pain, and thought it was with
some sprain at Tennis; I pulled off
my shooe, and with some ease that
gave me, stir'd not till the Company
broke up, which was about three hours
after my pain began. I went away to
bed, but it raged so much all night,
that I could not sleep a wink. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
it till about eight next morning,
in hopes still of stealing some rest; but
then making my complaints, and show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my foot, they found it very red
and angry; and to relieve my extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of pain, began to apply common
Poultives to it; and by the frequent
change of them I found some ease, and
continued this exercise all that day,
and a great part of the following
night, which I past with very little
rest. The morning after, my foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to swell, and the violence of my
pain to asswage, though it left such a
soreness, that I could hardly suffer the


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56779:108"/>
Clothes of my bed, nor stir my foot
but as it was lifted.</p>
            <p>By this time my illness being enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after about the Town, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to be the Gout; and being no
longer feverish, or in any extremity
of pain, I was content to see company:
Every body that came to visit me,
found something to say upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
some made a jest of it, or a
little reproach; others were serious in
their mirth, and made me Compliments
as upon a happy accident and sign of
long life. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> askt me <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricias</hi>
for telling me the news, that I
might be sure 'twas the Gout; and in
short, none of the company was in ill
humour but I, who had rather by half
have had a Fever, or a worse disease at
that time, where the danger might
have been greater, but the trouble
and the melancholly would I am sure
have been less.</p>
            <p>Though I had never feared the Gout,
yet I had always scorned it as an effect
commonly of intemperance; and hated
it, as that I thought made men unfit
for any thing after they were once


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56779:109"/>
deep engaged in it; Besides, I was
prest in my journey at that time to
<hi>Nimmeguen</hi> by His Majesties Commands
to assist at the Treaty there. Most of
the Ambassadors from the several parts
of <hi>Christendom</hi> were upon their way;
One of my <hi>Colleagues</hi> was already up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, and I had promised im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to follow; for by our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
we were to be two to act in
that Mediation; and to help at this
pinch, I had always heard that a Fit
of the Gout used to have six weeks at
the least for its ordinary period. With
these comforts about me, and sullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
enough to use no Remedy of a
hundred that were told me, Monsieur
<hi>Zulichem</hi> came to see me (among the
rest of my Friends) who I think never
came into company without saying
something that was new, and so he did
upon my occasion. For talking of my
illness, and approving of my obstinacy
against all the common prescriptions;
he asked me whether I had never heard
the <hi>Indian</hi> way of Curing the Gout by
<hi>Moxa?</hi> I told him no, and asked him
what it was? He said it was a certain


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56779:109"/>
kind of Moss that grew in the <hi>East-Indies;</hi>
that their way was, when ever
any body fell into a Fit of the Gout,
to take a small quantity of it, and
form it into a figure, broad at bottom
as a two-pence, and pointed at top;
To set the bottom exactly upon the
place where the violence of the pain
was fixed, then with a small round
perfumed Match (made likewise in
the <hi>Indies</hi>) to give fire to the top of
the Moss; which burning down by
degrees, came at length to the skin, and
burnt it till the Moss was consumed to
ashes; That many times the first burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would remove the pain; if not,
it was to be renewed a second, third
and fourth time, till it went away, and
till the person found he could set his
foot boldly to the ground and walk.</p>
            <p>I desired him to tell me how he had
come acquainted with this new Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
He said by the Relation of
several who had seen and tryed it in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> but particularly by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
little Book, written of it by a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Minister at <hi>Batavia,</hi> who being
extremely tormented with a Fit of the


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56779:110"/>
Gout, an old <hi>Indian</hi>-woman coming
to see him, undertook to Cure him,
and did it immediately by this <hi>Moxa;</hi>
and after many experiments of it there,
had written this Treatise of it in <hi>Dutch</hi>
for the use of his Countreymen, and
sent over a quantity of the Moss and
Matches to his Son at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> to be sold,
if any would be perswaded to use them;
That though he could not say whether
experiment had been made of it here,
yet the Book was worth reading; and
for his part, He thought He should try
it if ever he should fall into that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</p>
            <p>I desired the Book, which He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to send me next morning; and
this discourse of Monsieur <hi>Zulichem</hi>
busied my head all night: I hated the
very name of the <hi>Gout,</hi> and thought
it a reproach: and for the good sign,
people called it, I could not find that
mended an ill thing, nor could I like
any sign of living long in weakness, or in
pain; I deplored the loss of my legs, and
confinement to my Chamber at an age
that left me little pleasure but of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and of air; but the worst circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56779:110"/>
of all, was the sentence past up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it of being without Cure.</p>
            <p>I had past Twenty years of my life,
and several accidents of danger in my
health, without any use of Physicians;
and from some experiments of my own,
as well as much reading and thought
upon that subject, had reasoned my
self into an opinion, that the use of
them and their methods (unless in
some sudden and acute disease) was it
self a very great venture, and that their
greatest practisers practised least upon
themselves, or their friends. I had
ever quarrelled with their studying
art more than nature, and applying
themselves to methods, rather than to
remedies; whereas the knowledg of the
last is all that nine parts in ten of the
world have trusted to in all ages.</p>
            <p>But for the common Remedies of the
Gout, I found exceptions to them all;
the time of Purging was past with me,
which otherwise I should certainly
have tryed upon the authority of the
great <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> who says it should be
done upon the first motion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in the Gout. For Poultives, I


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56779:111"/>
knew they allayed pain; but withall,
that they drew down the humours,
and suppled the parts, thereby making
the passages wider, and apter to receive
them in greater quantity; and I had
often heard it concluded, that the use
of them ended in losing that of ones
limbs, by weakening the joint upon
every fit. For Plaisters that had any
effect, I thought it must be by dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or repelling the humours, which
could not be done without endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perhaps some other disease of the
bowels, the stomack, or the head. Rest
and warmth either of clothes or bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
I doubted would in a degree have
the effects of Poultives; and Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was proper for prevention rather
than remedy. So that all I could end
in with any satisfaction, was patience
and abstinence; and though I easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
of the last, yet the first was hard
to be found in the circumstances of my
business, as well as of my health.</p>
            <p>All this made me rave upon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Zulichem</hi>'s new operation; and
for the way of curing by fire, I found
twenty things to give me an opinion of


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56779:111"/>
it. I remembred what I had read of the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> of old, who used it in most
diseases; and what I had often heard of
that practice still continuing among the
Moors of <hi>Africk;</hi> so that a slave is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
taken (as both <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses</hi>
affirm) who has not many scars
of the hot iron upon his body, which
they use upon most distempers, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
those of the head, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in Physick as well as in Surgery.
In the time of the <hi>Yncas</hi> reign in <hi>Peru,</hi>
(which I take to have been one of the
greatest Constitutions of Absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
that has been in the world) no
composition was allowed by the Laws
to be used in point of Medicine, but
only Simples proper to each Disease.
Burning was much in use, either by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or artificial fires; particularly for
all ilnesses of teeth, and soreness or
swelling of the gums (which they were
subject to from their nearness to the
Sea) they had an herb which never
failed of curing it, and being laid to
the gums, burnt away all the flesh that
was swelled or corrupted, and made way
for new that came again as sound as


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56779:112"/>
that of a Child. I remembred to have
had my self in my youth, one cruel
wound cured by scalding Medicaments,
after it was grown so putrified as to
have (in the Surgeons opinion) endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
the bone; and the violent swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and bruise of another, taken away
as soon as I received it, by scalding it
with Milk. I remembred the cure of
Chilblanes when I was a boy (which
may be called the Childrens Gout) by
burning at the fire, or else by scalding
brine, that has (I suppose) the same
effect. I had heard of curing the
stings of Adders, and bites of mad
Dogs, by immediately burning the part
with a hot iron; and of some strange
cures of Frenzies, by casual applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of fire to the lower parts; which
seems reasonable enough, by the violent
revulsion it may make of humours from
the head; and agrees with the opinions
and practice I mentioned before, of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
and <hi>Africa.</hi> Perhaps blistering in
the neck, and hot Pidgeons, may be in
use among us upon the same grounds;
and in our Methods of Surgery, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is found of such effect in the case


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56779:112"/>
of old Ulcers, as fire, which is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the greatest drawer and dryer, and
thereby the greatest cleanser that can
be found. I knew very well, that in
Diseases of Cattel, there is nothing
more commonly used, nor with greater
success; and concluded it was but a
tenderness to Mankind that made it less
in use amongst us, and which had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Corrosives and Causticks to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the place of it, which are indeed
but artificial fires.</p>
            <p>I mention all these reflections, to
show that the experiment I resolved to
make, was upon thought, and not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or impatience (as those called it
that would have dissuaded me from it);
but the chief reason was, that I liked
no other, because I knew they failed
every day, and left men in despair of
being ever well cured of the Gout.</p>
            <p>Next morning I lookt over the Book
which Monsieur <hi>Zulichem</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
me, written by the Minister at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi>
I pretended not to judg of the
<hi>Indian</hi> Philosophy, or reasonings upon
the cause of the Gout; but yet thought
them as probable as those of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56779:113"/>
here; and liked them so much the
better, because it seems their opinion
in the point is general among them, as
well as their method of curing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the differences among ours are almost
as many in both, as there are Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that reason upon the causes, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
upon the cure of that disease.
They hold that the cause of the Gout
is a malignant vapour that falls upon
the joynt between the bone and the
skin that covers it, which being the
most sensible of all parts of the body,
causes the violence of the pain. That
the swelling is no part of the disease,
but only an effect of it, and of a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in nature, that to relieve the part
affected, calls down humours to damp
the malignity of the vapour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
assuage the sharpness of the pain,
which seldom fails whenever the part
grows very much swelled. That conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the swellings and returns of
the Gout, are chiefly occasioned by the
ill methods of curing it at first. That
this vapour falling upon joints which
have not motion, and thereby heat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to dispel it, cannot be cured o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56779:113"/>
than by burning, by which it
immediately evaporates; and that this
is evident by the present ceasing of the
pain upon the second, third, or fourth
application of the <hi>Moxa,</hi> which are
performed in a few minutes time. And
the Author affirms it happens often
there, that upon the last burning, an
extreme stench comes out of the skin
where the fire had opened it.</p>
            <p>Whatever the reasonings were, which
yet seemed ingenious enough; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
alledged with so much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to be so generally in those
parts, and told by an Author that writ
like a plain man, and one whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
was to tell truth, helped me to
resolve upon making the trial. I was
confirmed in this resolution by a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Physician, Doctor <hi>Theodore Coleby,</hi>
who was then in my Family, a sober
and intelligent man, whom I dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
immediately to <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> to bring
me some of the <hi>Moxa,</hi> and learn the
exact method of using it, from the man
that sold it, who was Son to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Batavia.</hi> He returned with all
that belonged to this Cure, having


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56779:114"/>
performed the whole operation upon
his hand by the mans direction. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
made the experiment in the
manner before related, setting the
<hi>Moxa</hi> just upon the place where the
first violence of my pain began, which
was the joint of the great toe, and
where the greatest anger and soreness
still continued, notwithstanding the
swelling of my foot, so that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet in five days been able to stir it,
but as it was lifted.</p>
            <p>Upon the first burning I found the
skin shrink all round the place; and
whether the greater pain of the fire
had taken away the sense of a smaller
or no, I could not tell; but I thought
it less than it was: I burnt it the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, and upon it observed the
skin about it to shrink, and the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to flat yet more than at first. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to move my toe, which I had not
done before; but I found some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of pain. I burnt it the third
time, and observed still the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
without, but a much greater
within; for I stirred the joynt seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times at ease; and growing bolder,


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56779:114"/>
I set my foot to the ground without
any pain at all. After this I pursued
the method prescribed by the Book,
and the Authors Son at <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> and
had a bruised Clove of Garlick laid to
the place that was burnt, and covered
with a large Plaister of <hi>Diapalma,</hi> to
keep it fixed there; and when this was
done, feeling no more pain, and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still bolder and firmer upon it, I cut
a slipper to let in my foot swelled as
it was, and walkt half a dozen turns
about the room without any pain or
trouble, and much to the surprize of
those that were about me, as well as to
my own. For though I had reasoned
my self before-hand into an opinion of
the thing, yet I could not expect such
an effect as I found, which seldom rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to the degree that is promised by
the prescribers of any remedies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this went beyond it, having been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
so late, and the prescription
reaching only to the first attaque of
the pain, and before the part begins to
swell.</p>
            <p>For the pain of the burning it self,
the first time it is sharp, so that a man


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56779:115"/>
may be allowed to complain; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
I would not, but that I would
count to a certain number as the best
measure how long it lasted. I told six-score
and four, as fast as I could; and
when the fire of the <hi>Moxa</hi> was out,
all pain of burning was over. The
second time was not near so sharp as
the first, and the third a great deal less
than the second. The wound was not
raw, as I expected, but looked only
scorched and black; and I had rather
endure the whole trouble of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
than half a quarter of an hours
pain in the degree I felt it the first
whole night.</p>
            <p>After four and twenty hours, I had
it opened, and found a great blister
drawn by the Garlick, which I used no
more, but had the blister cut, which
run a good deal of water, but filled
again by next night; and this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for three days, with only a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Diapalma</hi> upon it; after which
time the blister dryed up, and left a sore
about as big as a two-pence, which
healed and went away in about a weeks
time longer; but I continued to walk


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56779:115"/>
every day, and without the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of pain, the swelling still grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
less, though it were near six weeks
before it was wholly gone. I favoured
it all this while more than I needed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the common opinion that walking
too much might draw down the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
which I have since had reason to
conclude a great mistake, and that if I
had walked as much as I could from the
first day the pain left me, the swelling
might have left me too in a much less
time.</p>
            <p>The talk of this Cure run about the
<hi>Hague,</hi> and made the conversation in
other places, as well as in the visits I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
while I kept my Chamber, which
was about a fortnight after the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Monsieur <hi>Zulichem</hi> came to me
among the rest of the good company
of the Town, and much pleased with
my success, as well from his own great
humanity, and particular kindness to
me, as from the part he had in being
the first prescriber of my Cure, and
from the opinion it gave him of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good fortune befallen all that felt,
or were in danger of the Gout.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:56779:116"/>
Among others he told it to Monsieur
<hi>Serinchamps</hi> was one, an Envoy of the
Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi> then in Town; a
person very much, and very deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
esteemed among all the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in Town, and to whom every
body was kind upon the score of his
own good humour, or his Masters ill
fortunes: He had been long subject to
the Gout, and with constant returns
of long and violent fits two or three
times in a year. He was a man frank
and generous, and loved to enjoy health
whilest he had it, without making too
much reflexion upon what was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and so when he was well, denied
himself nothing of what he had a mind
to eat or drink, which gave him a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
full of humours, and made his fits
of the Gout as frequent and violent as
most I have known; When they came,
he bore them as he could, and forgot
them as soon as they were past, till a
new remembrance. At this time he
lay ill of a cruel fit, which was fallen
upon his knee, and with extreme pain;
When he heard of my Cure, he sent to
me first for the Relation of it, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56779:116"/>
it, for my <hi>Moxa,</hi> and for <hi>Coleby</hi> to
apply it; He did so, and after his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
way roared out, and swore at me
all the while it was burning; and asked
if I took him for a Sorcerer that I sent
to burn him alive. But with all this,
the pain went away upon it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
no more to the same place;
but he was something discouraged by
a new pain falling some days after up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his elbow on the other side, which
gave him a new fit, though gentler and
shorter than they used to be.</p>
            <p>About the same time one of the
Maids of my house was grown almost
desperate with the Tooth-ach, and want
of sleep upon it, and was without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
The Book gives the same Cure
for certain in that illness, by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the great Vein under the
Ear; and the man who sold it at
<hi>Vtrecht,</hi> had assured <hi>Coleby</hi> he had seen
many Cures by it in that kind. We
resolved to try, which was done, and
the pain immediately taken away,
and the Wench perfectly well, without
hearing of it any more, at least while
she was in my house.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:56779:117"/>
Thus passed the first experiment, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Monsieur <hi>Zulichem</hi> giving an
account of it to some of his Friends at
<hi>Gresham</hi>-Colledg, came to me before I
left the <hi>Hague,</hi> formally to desire me
from them, and from himself, that I
would give a Relation of it that might
be made publick, as a thing which
might prove in appearance of common
utility to so great numbers as were
subject to that disease; And told me
that some of <hi>Gresham</hi>-Colledg had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given order for Translating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>English</hi> the little <hi>Batavian</hi> Treatise.
I commended the care of publishing it
among us, and thereby inviting others
to an experiment I had reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove;
but excused my self from any
Relation of my own, as having too
much business at that time, and at all
times caring little to appear in publick.
I had another reason to decline it, that
ever uses to go far with me upon all
new inventions or experiments, which
is, that the best tryal of them is by time,
and observing whether they live or
no; and that one or two tryals can
pretend to make no rule, no more than


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56779:117"/>
one Swallow a Summer; and so before
I told my story to more than my friends,
I had a mind to make more tryals my
self, or see them made by other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as wise as I had been.</p>
            <p>During the confinement of this fit,
I fell into some methods, and into much
discourse upon the subject of the Gout,
that may be perhaps as well worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
by such as feel or apprehend
it, as what I have told of this <hi>Indian</hi>
Cure. In the first place from the day
I kept my Chamber, till I left it, and
began to walk abroad, I restrained my
self to so regular a dyet, as to eat flesh
but once a day, and little at a time,
without Salt or Vinegar; and to one
moderate draught, either of Water or
small Ale. I concluded to trust to
abstinence and exercise, as I had ever
resolved, if I fell into this disease; and
if it continued, to confine my self
wholly to the Milk-dyet, of which I had
met with very many and great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and had a great opinion even in
long and inveterate Gouts. Besides,
this refuge I met with, in my visits and
conversation arising upon my illness,


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56779:118"/>
many notions or medicines very new
to me, and reflexions that may be so
perhaps to other men. Old Prince
<hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> told me, he laught
at the Gout, and he had been several
times attaqued, yet it never gave him
care nor trouble. That he used but
one remedy, which was when ever he
felt it, to boyl a good quantity of
Horse-dung from a Stone-horse of the
<hi>Hermelinne</hi> colour, as he called it in
<hi>French,</hi> which is a native white, with
a sort of raw nose, and the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
about the eyes. That when
this was well boiled in water, he set
his leg in a pale-full of it, as hot as he
could well endure it, renewing it as
it grew cool for above an hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
That after it, he drew his leg im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
into a warm bed, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the perspiration as long as he could,
and never failed of being cured. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the remedy be good, or the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of colour signifie any thing
more, than to make more mystery, I
know not; but I observed that he ever
had a sett of such <hi>Hermelinne</hi> Horses in
his Coach, which he told me was on


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56779:118"/>
purpose, that he might never want this
remedy.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>Kinski,</hi> Ambassador
from the Emperor, to the Treaty at
<hi>Nimmeguen,</hi> gave me a Receipt of the
Salt of Harts-horn, by which a famous
<hi>Italian</hi>-Physician of the Emperors, had
performed mighty Cures upon many
others as well as Himself, and the last
year upon the Count <hi>Montecuculi;</hi>
The use of this, I am apt to esteem
both from the quality given it of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Sweat extremely, and of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away all sharpness from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you put it in, which must both
be of good effect in the Cure of the
Gout.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rhyngrave,</hi> who was killed last
Summer before <hi>Mastricht,</hi> told me his
Father the old <hi>Rhyngrave,</hi> whom I
knew very well, had been long subject
to the Gout, and never used other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
or remedy, than upon the very first
fit he felt, to go out immediately and
walk, whatever the weather was, and
as long as he was able to stand, and
pressing still most upon the foot that
threatned him; when he came home,


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56779:119"/>
he went to a warm bed, and was rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
very well, and chiefly upon the
place where the pain begun. If it
continued or returned next day, he
repeated the same course, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
laid up with it; and before his
death recommended this course to his
Son, if he should ever fall into that
accident.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Dutch</hi>-man, who had been long
in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> told me, in one part
of them where he had lived some time,
the general remedy of all that were
subject to the Gout, was rubbing with
hands; and that whoever had Slaves
enough to do that constantly every
day, and relieve one another by turns
till the motion raised a violent heat
about the joynts where it was chiefly
used, was never troubled much, or
laid up by that disease.</p>
            <p>My youngest Brother told me he had
a Keeper very subject to it, but that it
never laid him up, but he was still
walking after his Deer or his Stud while
he had the fits upon him, as at other
times, and often from morning to night,
though in pain all the while; This he


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56779:119"/>
gave me as one instance, that poor and
toiling men have sometimes the Gout,
and that many more may have it, who
take no more notice of it than his
Keeper did, who yet he confest used
to bring the fits of Gout upon him,
by fits of drinking, which no doubt is
a receipt that will hardly fail if men
grow old in the custom.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>Serinchamps</hi> told me, a
<hi>Lorrain</hi> Surgeon had undertaken to
cure it by a more extraordinary way
than any of these, which was by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the naked part with a great Rod
of Nettles till it grew all over blister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that he had once perswaded
him to perform this penance in a sharp
fit he had, and the pain in his knee so
violent, as helped him to endure this
remedy. He said it was cruel, that all
where he was whipt, grew so angry,
and swell'd as well as blister'd, that he
thought it had given him a Fever that
night; The next morning the part was
all stiff as a boot, and the skin like
parchmin; but that keeping it anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a certain Oyl likewise of Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
it past in two days, and the Gout


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56779:120"/>
too, without feeling any more pain that
Fit.</p>
            <p>All these things put together, with
what a great Physician writes of Cures
by whipping with Rods, and another
with Holly, and by other cruelties of
cutting, or burning, made me certainly
conclude, that the Gout was a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that ought to be treated like an
enemy, and by no means like a friend,
and that grew troublesome chiefly by
good usage; and this was confirmed to
me, by considering that it haunted usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the easie and the rich, the nice
and the lazy, who grow to endure
much, because they can endure little;
That make much of it as soon as it
comes, and yet leave not making much
of themselves too; That take care to
carry it presently to bed, and keep it
safe and warm, and indeed lay up the
Gout for two or three months, while
they give out, that the Gout lays up
them. On t'other side, it hardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
the rough and the poor, such
as labour for meat, and eat only for
hunger; that drink water, either pure,
or but discoloured with Malt; that


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56779:120"/>
know no use of wine, but for a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial,
as it is, and perhaps was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
Or if such men happen by
their native constitutions to fall into
the Gout, either they mind it not at
all, having no leisure to be sick; or
they use it like a Dog, they walk on,
or they toil and work as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they keep it wet and cold; or
if they are laid up, they are perhaps
forced by that to fast more than before;
and if it lasts, they grow impatient,
and fall to beat it, or whip it, or cut it,
or burn it, and all this while perhaps
never know the very name of the
Gout.</p>
            <p>But to follow my experiment: I
past that Summer here at <hi>Nimmeguen,</hi>
without the least remembrance of what
had happen'd to me in the Spring, till
about the end of <hi>September,</hi> and then
began to feel a pain that I knew not
what to make of, in the same joynt,
but of my other foot: I had flattered
my self with hopes, that the vapor had
been exhaled, as my learned Authors
had taught me, and that thereby the
business had been ended; This made


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56779:121"/>
me neglect my <hi>Moxa</hi> for two days, the
pain not being violent, till at last my
foot begun to swell, and I could set it
no longer to the ground. Then I fell
to my <hi>Moxa</hi> again, and burnt it four
times before the pain went clear away,
as it did upon the last, and I walked at
ease, as I had done the first time, and
within six days after above a League
without the least return of any pain.</p>
            <p>I continued well till this Spring,
when about the end of <hi>March</hi> feeling
again the same pain, and in the same
joynt, but of the first foot; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it grow violent, I immediately
burnt it, and felt no more after the
third time; was never off my legs, nor
kept my Chamber a day. Upon both
these last experiments, I omitted the
application of Garlick, and contented
my self with a Plaister only of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma</hi>
upon the place that was burnt,
which crusted and healed in very few
days, and without any trouble. I have
since continu'd perfectly well to this
present <hi>June;</hi> and with so much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Cure, that I have been
content to trouble my self some hours


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56779:121"/>
with telling the story, which, 'tis possible,
may at one time or other be thought
worth making publick, if I am further
confirmed by more time and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my own, or of others. And
thereby I may not only satisfie Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Zulichem,</hi> but my self too, who
should be sorry to omit any good I
thought I could do to other men, though
never so unknown.</p>
            <p>But this Cure, I suppose, cannot
pretend to deal with inveterate Gouts,
grown habitual by long and frequent
returns, by dispositions of the stomack,
to convert even the best nourishment
into those humours, and the vessels to
receive them. For such constitutions,
by all I have discovered, or considered
upon this subject, the Remedies (if
any) are to be proposed either from a
constant course of the Milken-dyet,
continued at least for a year together;
Or else from some of those methods,
commonly used in the Cure of a worse
disease (if at least I may be so bold
with one that is much in vogue), the
usual exceptions to the first, are not
only so long a constraint, but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56779:122"/>
of Spirits whilest it continues, and
the danger of Fevers whenever 'tis left
off. There may, I believe, be some Care
necessary in this last point, upon so great
a change; but for the other, I have
met with no complaints among those
that have used it; and Count <hi>Egmont,</hi>
who has done so, more, I believe, than
any other man, has told me He never
found himself in so much vigour, as in
the midst of that course. I have known
so many great examples of this Cure,
and heard of its being so familiar in
<hi>Austria,</hi> that I wonder it has gained no
more ground in other places, and am
apt to conclude from it, that the loss
of pain is generally thought to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
too dear by the loss of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>For the other, I met with a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
whom I esteemed a man of truth,
that told me of several great Cures of
the Gout, by a course of <hi>Guiacum,</hi> and
of two Patients of his own that had
gone so far as to be fluxed for it, and
with success. And indeed there seems
nothing so proper, as what pretends to
change the whole mass of the blood,


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56779:122"/>
or else a long course of violent perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
But the mischief is, that the
Gout is commonly the disease of aged
men, who cannot go through with
these strong Remedies, which young
men play with upon other occasions;
and the reason, I suppose, why these
ways are so little practised, is because
it happens so seldom that young men
have the Gout.</p>
            <p>Let the disease be new or old, and
the remedies either of common or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
growth, there is one Ingredient
of absolute necessity in all cases: For
whoever thinks of curing the Gout
without great Temperance, had better
resolve to endure it with patience: And
I know not whether some desperate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Abstinence would not have
the same effect upon other men, as they
had upon <hi>Atticus,</hi> who weary of his
Life as well as his Physicians, by long
and cruel pains of a Dropsical Gout,
and despairing of any Cure, resolved
by degrees to starve himself to death,
and went so far, that the Physicians
found he had ended his disease instead
of his Life; and told him, that to be


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56779:123"/>
well, there would need nothing but
only resolving to live. His Answer
was noble, That since dying was a
thing to be done, and he was now so
far on his way, he did not think it
worth the while to return. This was
said and done, and could indeed have
been so by none but such a man as <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi>
who was singular in his Life, as
well as his Death; and has been ever,
I confess, by me as much esteemed in
both, as any of those that have made
greater figures upon the busie Scenes of
their own times, and since in Records
of Story and of Fame.</p>
            <p>But perhaps some such Methods
might succeed with others upon the
designs to live, as they did with him
upon those to dye; and though such
degrees may be too desperate, yet none
of Temperance can, I think, be too
great for those that pretend the Cure
of inveterate Gouts, or indeed of most
other Diseases to which Mankind is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
rather by the viciousness than by
the frailty of their natures. Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
That Virtue without Pride, and
Fortune without Envy, that gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56779:123"/>
of body, and tranquillity of
mind; the best Guardian of youth and
support of old age: The Precept of
Reason, as well as Religion; and Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
of the Soul as well as the Body;
The Tutelar Goddess of Health, and
universal medicine of Life, that clears
the head, and cleanses the blood, that
eases the stomack, and purges the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
that strengthens the nerves, enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
the eyes, and comforts the heart.
In a word, that secures and perfects
digestion, and thereby avoids the fumes
and winds to which we owe the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and the Spleen; those crudities
and sharp humours that feed the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
and the Gout, and those slimy
dregs, out of which the Gravel and
Stone are formed within us. Diseases
by which we often condemn our selves
to greater torments and miseries of life,
than have perhaps been yet invented by
Anger or Revenge, or inflicted by the
greatest Tyrants upon the worst of
men.</p>
            <p>I do not allow the pretence of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
to all such as are seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
drunk, or fall into Surfeits; for


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56779:124"/>
men may lose their health without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their senses; and be intemperate
every day, without being drunk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
once in their lives: Nay, for
ought I know, if a man should pass
the month in a Colledg-diet, without
excess or variety of Meats or of
Drinks, but only the last day give a
loose in them both, and so far till it
comes to serve him for Physick rather
than food, and he utter his stomack as
well as his heart; He may as to the
considerations of Health, do much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than another that eats every day
but as men do generally in <hi>England,</hi>
who pretend to live well in Court or
in Town; that is in Plenty and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with great variety of meats, and a
dozen glasses of Wine at a meal, still
spurring up appetite when it would lye
down of it self; flusht every day, but
never drunk; and with the help of
dozing three hours after dinner, as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and wise as they were before.</p>
            <p>But that which I call Temperance,
and reckon so necessary in all attemps
and methods of curing the Gout, is a
regular and simple dyet, limited by


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56779:124"/>
every mans experience of his own ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
digestion, and thereby proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as near, as well as can be, the daily
repairs to the daily decays of our wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodies. Nor can this be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by measures and weights, or any
general Lessian rules; but must vary
with the vigor or decays of Age or of
Health, and the use or disuse of Air,
or of Exercise, with the changes of
Appetite; and then by what every
man may find or suspect of the present
strength or weakness of digestion:
And in case of Excesses, I take the
<hi>German</hi> Proverbial Cure by a <hi>hair of
the same beast,</hi> to be the worst in the
world; and the best to be that which
is called the Monks Diet, to eat till you
are sick, and fast till you are well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
In all courses of the Gout, the
most effectual point I take to be absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from Wine, further than as a
Cordial where faintness or want of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
require it; And the use of water,
where the stomack will bear it, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
most mens will, and with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of digestion, unless they are
spoiled with long and constant use of


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56779:125"/>
Wines or other strong drinks. In that
case they must be weaned, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
changed by degrees, and with time,
for fear of falling into Consumptions,
instead of recovering Dropsies or Gouts.
But the Wines used by those that feel
or fear this Disease, or pursue the
Cure, should rather be <hi>Spanish</hi> or <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
than either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Rhenish;</hi>
and of the <hi>French,</hi> rather the <hi>Provence</hi>
or <hi>Languedoc,</hi> than the <hi>Bordeaux</hi> or
<hi>Champagne;</hi> and of the <hi>Rhenish,</hi> the
<hi>Ringaw</hi> and <hi>Bleker,</hi> of which at least it
may be said that they do not so much
harm as the others.</p>
            <p>But I have known so great Cures,
and so many, done by obstinate resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of drinking no Wine at all, that
I put more weight upon that part of
Temperance, than any other. And I
doubt very much whether the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of that Disease in <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these twenty years, may not have
been occasioned by the custom of much
Wine introduced into our constant and
common Tables. For this use may be
more pernicious to health, than that
of Taverns and Debauches according


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56779:125"/>
to the old style, which were but by
fits, and upon set or casual encounters.
I have sometimes thought that this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of using Wine for our common
drink, may alter in time the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of our Nation, I mean the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
tempers of our bodies and minds,
and cause a heat and sharpness in our
humours, which is not natural to our
Climate. Our having been denied it
by nature, is argument enough that it
was never intended us for common use;
nor do I believe it was so in any other
Countreys, there being so small a part
of the world where it grows; and
where it does, the use of it pure being
so little practised, and in some places
defended by Customs or Laws. So the
<hi>Turks</hi> have not known it, unless of late
years; and I have met with many <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
that never tasted it pure in their
lives; Nor in the time when I was in
<hi>France,</hi> did I observe any I converst
with to drink it unmixt at meals. The
true use of Wine, is either as I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
for a Cordial; and I believe there
is not a better to such as drink it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
Or else what the Mother of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>


               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:56779:126"/>
tells her son, <hi>Give strong drink to
him that is ready to perish, and wine to
those that are heavy of heart; let him
drink and forget his poverty, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his misery no more.</hi> At least it
ought to be reserv'd for the times and
occasions of feasts and of joy, and be
treated like a Mistress rather than a
Wife, without abandoning either our
wits to our humours, or our health to
our pleasure, or that of one sense to
those of all the rest, which I doubt it
impairs. This Philosophy I suppose
may pass with the youngest and most
sensual men, while they pretend
to be reasonable; but whenever they
have a mind to be otherwise, the best
way they can take, is to drink or to
sleep, and either of them will serve the
turn.</p>
