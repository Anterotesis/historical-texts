            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Neither can I offend much against the State, in begging your
Patronage and perusall of this Book, knowing that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
first mastered all the Learning of <hi>Padoa,</hi> before you did
adventure upon that wise Senate: who amongst all her other
greatnesses, has ever had a principall care, that Learning might
not be diminished. When these Sermons were preached, they
<pb facs="tcp:93359:3"/>
were terminated within the compasse of an houre, but your
acceptance may make them outlive the very Churches that
they were preached in, and give them such a perpetuity that
<hi>Nec Jovis Ira, nec Amor, edacior multò, poterit abolere;</hi>
For, though a fiery zeale in succeeding ages hath often both
ruined the Temples, and casheired the gods, that were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in them: Yet such sacrifices as these, have beemy laies
kept unburnt; and we are suffered to know those religions, that
we are not allowed to practice. Nor can I expect any greater
advantage, for the paines I have taken in publishing this Book,
then that posterity may know, I did it, when I had the favor
and protection of your Lordship, and was allowed to stile
my selfe</p>

Thee in thine <hi>Unity,</hi> as thou art <hi>One God;</hi> Thee in thy <hi>Plurality,</hi> as thou art
<hi>More Persons,</hi> we receive this thy Institution of <hi>Mariage</hi> to be one. In thy first
work, the <hi>Creation,</hi> the last <hi>seale</hi> of thy whole work was a <hi>Mariage.</hi> In thy
Sonnes great work, the <hi>Redemption,</hi> the first seale of that whole work,
was a miracle at a <hi>Mariage.</hi> In the work of thy blessed Spirit, our <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
he refreshes to us, that promise in one Prophet, <hi>That thou wilt mary thy
selfe to us for ever:</hi> and more in another, <hi>That thou hast maryed thy selfe unto us
from the beginning.</hi> Thou hast maryed <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> in thy selfe, maryed
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in thy Sonne, maryed <hi>Increpation</hi> and <hi>Consolation</hi> in the Holy
Ghost, mary in us also, O Lord, a <hi>Love</hi> and a <hi>Fear</hi> of thee. And as thou
hast maryed in us <hi>two natures,</hi> mortall and immortall, mary in us also, the
knowledge, and the practise of all duties belonging to both conditions,
that so this world may be our <hi>Gallery</hi> to the next; And mary in us, the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Thankfulnesse,</hi> for all thy benefits already bestowed upon us, and the
<hi>Spirit of prayer</hi> for the continuance, and enlargement of them. Continue,
and enlarge them, O'God, upon thine universall Church, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>OF all Commentaries upon the Scriptures, <hi>Good Examples</hi> are the best and
the livelyest; and of all Examples those that are nearest, and most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93359:6"/>
our owne families; and in families, the Masters of families, the fathers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
are most conspicuous, most appliable, most considerable. Now, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
upon such occasions as this, ordinarily, the instruction is to bee directed
especially upon those persons, who especially give the occasion of the exercise;
that is, upon the persons to bee united in holy wedlock: for, as that's a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Lectures,</hi> that a Sermon intends <hi>Exhortation</hi>
principally and <hi>Edification,</hi> and a holy stirring of religious affections, and then
<hi>matters of Doctrine,</hi> and points of <hi>Divinity,</hi> occasionally, secondarily, as the words of
the text may invite them; But <hi>Lectures</hi> intend principally <hi>Doctrinall points,</hi> and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and matter of <hi>Exhortation</hi> but <hi>occasionally,</hi> and as in a <hi>second</hi> place: so
that's a difference between <hi>Christening sermons,</hi> and <hi>Mariage sermons,</hi> that the first, at
Christnings, are especially directed upon the <hi>Congregation,</hi> and not upon the persons
who are to be christened; and these, at mariages, especially upon the <hi>parties</hi> that are
to be united; and upon the congregation, but by reflexion. When therefore to these

                     <p>These words our blessed Saviour spake to the <hi>Sadduces;</hi>

<hi>whose wife,</hi> of <hi>those seven should she be in the Resurrection?</hi> they would needs suppose,
and prefume, that there could be no <hi>Resurrection of the body,</hi> but that there must be to all
purposes, a <hi>Bodily use of the Body</hi> too, and then the question had been pertinent, <hi>whose wife
of the seven shall she be?</hi> But Christ shews them their errour, in the weaknesse of the
foundation, she shall be none of their wives, for, <hi>In the Resurrection, they neither mary,</hi>
&amp;c. The words give us this latitude, when Christ sayes, <hi>In the Resurrection they mary
not,</hi> &amp;c. The words give us this latitude, when Christ sayes, <hi>In the Resurrection they mary
not,</hi> &amp;c. from thence flowes out this concession, this proposition too; Till <hi>the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they shall mary, and be given in mariage;</hi> no inhibition to be laid upon <hi>persons,</hi> no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
no aspersion upon the <hi>state</hi> of mariage. And when Christ saies, <hi>Then they are
as the Angels of God in heaven,</hi> from this flowes this concession, this proposition also,
<hi>Till then we must not look for this Angelicall state,</hi> but, as in all other states and conditions
of life, so in all mariages there will be some encumbrances, betwixt all maried persons,
there will arise some unkindnesses, some mis-interpretations; or some too quick inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
may sometimes sprinkle a little sournesse, and spread a little, a thin, a dilute
and washy cloud upon them; Then they mary not, till then they may; then their state
shall be perfect as the Angels, till then it shall not; These are our branches, and the fruits

that grow upon them, we shall pull in passing, and present them as we gather them.</p>
                     <p>First then, Christ establishes a Resurrection, <hi>A Resurrection there shall be,</hi> for, that makes

in our soule, for there would be a life everlasting in heaven, and we were bound to
beleeve it, as we were bound to beleeve a God in heaven, though our <hi>soules</hi> were not

for God himself shall be intirely in every soul; And what can that soul lack, that hath all

Therefore does S. <hi>Luke</hi> assigne that reason why they shall not mary,<note place="margin">Luke 20. 35.</note> 
                        <hi>Because

                     <p>But yet, though Christ exclude that, of which there is clearely no use in Heaven,

Mariage, (because they need no physick, no mutuall help, no supply of children, yet
he excludes, not our <hi>knowing,</hi> or our <hi>loving</hi> of <hi>one another</hi> upon former knowledge in
this world, in the next; Christ does not say expressely we shall, yet neither does he say,
that we shall not, <hi>know one another</hi> there. Neither can we say, we shall not, because we
know not how we should. <hi>Adam,</hi> who was asleep when <hi>Eve</hi> was made, and neither saw,
nor felt any thing that God had done,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 23.</note> knew <hi>Eve</hi> upon the very first sight, to be <hi>bone of

                        <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 3.</note> and <hi>flesh of his flesh.</hi> By what light knew he this? And in the transfiguration of
Christ, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> knew <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and by what light knew
they them, whom they had never seen? Nor can we, or they, or any, be imagined to have
any degree of knowledge of persons, or actions, though but occasionally, and transeunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in this life, which we shall not have inherently, and permanently in the next. In the
<hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>generall</hi> Resurrection, which were <hi>particular</hi> Resuscitations of the dead in

                        <note place="margin">Luke 16. 23.</note> though in Hell; and it is not easily told, by what light these saw
these. Whatsoever conduces to Gods glory, or our happinesse, we shall certainly know
in heaven: And he that in a rectifyed conscience beleeves that it does so, may piously
beleeve that he shall know them there. In things of this nature, where no direct place
of Scripture binds up thy faith, beleeve so, as most exalts thine own Devotion; yet
with this Caution too, not to condemn uncharitably, and peremptorily, those that
beleeve otherwise. A Resurrection there shall be: In the Resurrection there shall be no
<hi>Mariage,</hi> because it conduces to no end; but, if it conduce to Gods glory, and my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
(as it may piously be beleeved it does) to know them there, whom I knew here,
I shall <hi>know</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>Now from this, In the Resurrection they mary not, flows this also, Till <hi>the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they doe, they may, they shall mary.</hi> Nay, in Gods first purpose and institution, <hi>They
must:</hi> For God said, <hi>It is not good that the man should be alone.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> Every man is a <hi>naturall</hi>
body, every congregation is a <hi>politik</hi> body; The whole world is a <hi>Catholik,</hi> an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
body. For the sustentation and aliment of the naturall body, <hi>Man,</hi> God hath given
<hi>Meat;</hi> for the Politik, for societies, God hath given <hi>Industry,</hi> and severall callings; and
for the Catholik body, for the sustentation, and reparation of the world, God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Mariage.</hi> They that scatter themselves in various lusts, commit wast, and shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
at last, a heavy condemnation upon that <hi>Action of wast</hi> in their souls, as they shal
feel it before in their bodies which they have wasted. They that mary not, do not keep
the world in reparation; And the common law, the law of nature, and the generall law
of God bindes man in generall to that reparation of the world, to Mariage: for <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi>
is <hi>Privilegtum,</hi> a Privilege; that is, <hi>Privata lex;</hi> when it is given, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a law too; for he to whom God gives the gift of Continency, is bound by
it: it is <hi>Privata lex,</hi> a Law, an Obligation upon that particular man; And then <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legium,</hi>
is <hi>Privatio Legis,</hi> it is a dispensation upon that Law, which without
that privilege, and dispensation would binde him; so that all those, who have
not this privilege, this dispensation, this continency, by immediate gift from God, or
other medicinall <hi>Disciplines,</hi> and <hi>Mortifications,</hi> (which Disciplines and Mortifications, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
state and condition of life is not bound to exercise, because such Mortifications as
would overcome their Concupiscences, would also overcome all their naturall strength,
and make them unable to doe the works of their callings) all such are bound by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
law to mary. For, from <hi>Nature,</hi> and her Law, we have that voice, <hi>ut gignamus
geniti;</hi> Man is borne into the world, that others might be born from him: And from
<hi>Gods</hi> generall Law, we have that voice, <hi>Crescite</hi> &amp; <hi>Multiplicamini:</hi> Therefore God
plac'd man here, that he might repair and furnish the world. He is gone at <hi>Common</hi>
Law, that maries not: Not but that he may have <hi>reliefe;</hi> but it is onely in <hi>Conscience,</hi>
and by way of Equity, and as in <hi>Chancery;</hi> that is, If in a rectified Conscience he know,
that he should be the lesse disposed to religious Offices, for mariage, he does well to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93359:7"/>
otherwise he must remember that the world is one <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Mariage</hi> the <hi>aliment,</hi>
that the world is one <hi>Building,</hi> and Mariage the <hi>Reparation.</hi> Therefore the Emperor
<hi>Augustus</hi> did not onely encrease the rewards, and privileges which former Laws had
given to <hi>maried persons,</hi> but he laid particular <hi>penalties</hi> upon them, that liv'd unmaryed.
And though that State seem to have countenanced single life, because they afforded dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to certaine <hi>Vestall Virgins,</hi> yet the number of those Vestals was small, not above
<hi>six,</hi> and then the dignities and privileges, which those Vestals had, were no other, but
that they were made equall in the state to maryed Wives; They were preferred before all
that liv'd unmaryed, but not before maryed persons.</p>
                     <p>This fortification and rampart of the World, Mariage, hath the Devill battered
with most artillery, opposed with most instruments: for, as an Army composed of many
Nations, more sects of Heretiks have concurr'd in the condemning of Mariage, then
in any one Heresie. The <hi>Adamites,</hi> the <hi>Tatians,</hi> and those whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> cals the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratites;</hi>
all within two thousand years after Christ; and more after. And yet God
kept such a hook in the nostril of this <hi>Leviathan,</hi> such a bridle in the jaws of these sects
of Heretiks, as that never any of them so opposed Mariage, as that they justifyed <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,</hi>
or <hi>various lust,</hi> or <hi>Indifferency,</hi> or <hi>Community</hi> in that kinde. Now as in the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
Heresie, those that came to modify and mollify that Heresie, and to be
<hi>Semi-Pelagians,</hi> were in some points worse then those that were full Pelagians,
(as truly, in many Cases, the <hi>half-papist</hi> may doe more harme, and be more dangerous,
then the whole Papist that declares himself) so the <hi>Semi-Adamites,</hi> the <hi>Semi-Tatians,</hi> and
<hi>Semi-Encratites</hi> of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> who, though they doe not as those whole Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks
did, condemn mariage intirely, yet they condemn it in <hi>Certaine persons,</hi> and in so
many as constitute a great part of the Body of mankinde, that is, in all their Clergy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
those very heretiks, in favour of incontinency, and fornication, and various lusts,
which those Heretiks who absolutely condemned Mariage, condemned too, as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely;
whereas in the Roman Church a Jesuit tels us; that there are divers Catholiks
of that opinion,<note place="margin">Lorinus. Act. 15. 20.</note> That <hi>it is not Heresie to say,</hi> that <hi>Fornication is no deadly sinne:</hi> And
yet it is Heresie to say, that <hi>Mariage</hi> in <hi>some persons,</hi> (onely disabled by their Canons) is
not deadly sinne. And when they erect and justify their Academies of Incontinency,
and various lust, (various even in the sex) if some Authors among themselves have not
injur'd them) when they maintaine publik stews, and maintaine their dignity by them,
and make that a part of the Revenue of the Church, what Advocate of theirs can deny,
but that these <hi>Semi-Adamites, Semi-Tatians, Semi-Encratites,</hi> are worse then those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks
themselves, that did absolutely oppose Mariage? We depart absolutely from those
old Heretiks,<note place="margin">Patres.</note> who did absolutely condemn Mariage; and from those latter men, who
though they be but <hi>Semi-Heretiks</hi> in respect of them, because they limit their forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Mariage, to certaine persons, yet they are <hi>sequi-Heretiks</hi> in this, that they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<hi>Incontinency,</hi> and <hi>Fornication,</hi> which those very heretiks abhorred; And wee
must have leave too, (which we are alwaies loath to doe) to depart from the rigidness of
some of those blessed <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> who found some necessities in
their times, to speak so very highly in praise of Continency and Chastity, as reflected
somewhat upon mariage it selfe, and may seem to emply some under-valuation of that.
Many such things were so said by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> many by S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> as being crudely, and
nudely taken, not decocted and boyl'd up with the circumstances of those times, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with the knowledge of those persons, to whom they were written, might dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
and dishonor mariage. But <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his most vehement perswasion of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
writes to his <hi>own wife,</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> for the most part, to those Ladies, whom
he had taken into his own discipline, and with one of which, he had so near a conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that (as himself saies) the world was scandaliz'd with it. and that the world
thought him fit to have been made <hi>Pope,</hi> but for that misconstruction which had been
made of that his conversation with that Lady. <hi>Tertullian</hi> writing to his Wife, S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
to those Ladies, may either have had particular reasons of this vehement procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of theirs in advancing Continency, or they may have conceived that way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion
of continency to those persons, to have been a fit way to convey down to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
the love thereof. As <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Areopagite sayes, That the Church in
those times at funerals, did convey their thankes to God, for the party deceased, by way
of Prayer: they seemed to pray that those dead persons might be sav'd; and, indeed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93359:8"/>
they did but praise God, that they were sav'd. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> when they
seem to perswade Continency to those persons, they do but tell us, how continent those
persons were. But howsoever it be for that, no such magnifying of Virginity before,
as should diminish the honour and dignity of Mariage, no such magnifying of <hi>Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
after, as should frustrate the purpose of Mariage after, or the returning to
a second Mariage after a true dissolution of the first, can subvert, or contract
the Apostles <hi>Nubant in Domino, Let them mary in the Lord;</hi> where the <hi>In
Domino, in the Lord,</hi> is not to mary for matter of <hi>Title</hi> and place; nor, <hi>In Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
In the Lord, is not to mary for matter of <hi>Lordships,</hi> and possessions, and worldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment;
nor, <hi>In Domino,</hi> In the Lord, is not in hope to exercise a Dominion and a
Lordship over the other party: but <hi>In the Lord,</hi> is in the <hi>feare</hi> of the Lord, In the <hi>love</hi>
of the Lord, In the <hi>Law,</hi> that is, in the true <hi>Religion</hi> of the Lord; for this is that that
makes the mariages of Christians, Contracts of another kinde, then the mariages of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people are; with all people of the world, mariage is as fully the same <hi>Reall,</hi> and
<hi>Civill,</hi> and <hi>Morall</hi> Contract, as with us Christians. The same Obligations of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>help,</hi> of <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>loyalty</hi> to one another, and of communication of all their possessions,
lies upon mariage in Turky,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 32.</note> or China, as with us. But for Mariage amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<hi>Sacramentum hoc magnum est,</hi> saies the Apostle, <hi>This is a great secret, a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</hi>
Not that it is therefore a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
For, if they will make mariage such a sacrament, because it is expressed there
in that word, <hi>Magnum sacramentum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Revel. 17. 5.</note> they may come to give us an <hi>eight</hi> sacrament
after their <hi>seven;</hi> They may translate that name which is upon the mother of Harlots,
and abominations of the earth, <hi>sacrament,</hi> if they will, for it is the same word, in that
place of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which they translate Sacrament in the other place to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians;
And in the next verse but one, they doe translate it so there; <hi>I will tell thee,</hi>
saies the Angel, <hi>Sacramentum mulieris,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Babylon. Now if all the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
and secrets of Antichrist, all the confused practises of that Babylon, all the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and occasionall articles of that Church, and that <hi>State-religion,</hi> shall become Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
we shall have a Sacrament of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> a Sacrament of <hi>Invasion,</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of <hi>Powder,</hi> a Sacrament of <hi>dissolving allegeance,</hi> sacraments in the Element
of <hi>Baptism,</hi> in the water, in navies, and Sacraments in the Elements of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in
<hi>Blood,</hi> in the sacred <hi>blood of Kings.</hi> But Mariage amongst Christians, is herein <hi>Magnum
mysterium,</hi>
A Sacrament in such a sense; a mysterious signification of the <hi>union of the
soule</hi> with Christ, when both persons professe the Christian Religion, in <hi>generall,</hi> there
arises some signification of that spirituall union: But when they both professe Christ
in <hi>one</hi> forme, in one Church, in one Religion, and that, the right; then, as by the <hi>Civill</hi>
Contract, there is an union of their <hi>estates,</hi> and <hi>persons,</hi> so, as that they two are made one,
so by this <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> this mysterious union, these two, thus made one, between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
are also made one with Christ himself; by the <hi>Civill</hi> union, common to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they are made <hi>Eadem caro;</hi> The same flesh with one another, By this mysterious,
this Sacramentall, this significative union, they are made <hi>Idem Spiritus cum Domino;</hi>
The same Spirit with the Lord. And therefore, though in the Resurrection, they
shall not mary, because then all the severall uses of mariage cease, yet till the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
that is, as long as this world lasts, for the sustentation of the world, which is
one Body, and Mariage the food, and aliment thereof; for the reparation of the world,
which is one <hi>Building,</hi> and Mariage the <hi>supply</hi> thereof, to maintaine a <hi>second eternity,</hi>
in the succession of children, and to illustrate this <hi>union of our soules to Christ;</hi> we may,
and in some Cases, must marry.</p>
                     <p>We are come, in our order proposed at first, to our second Part, <hi>Erimus sicut Angeli,
we shall be as the Angels of God in heaven;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Part. Divisio.</note> where we consider, first, what we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to, those <hi>Angels;</hi> And then <hi>in what</hi> that Comparison lies, wherein we shall be
like those Angels; And lastly, the Proposition that flowes out of this proposition, In
the Resurrection we shall be like them, <hi>Till the Resurrection we shall not,</hi> and therefore,
in the meane time, we must not looke for <hi>Angelicall perfections,</hi> but beare with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
infirmities.<note place="margin">Angeli.</note> Now when we would tell you, what those <hi>Angels</hi> of God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to which we are compared, are, we can come no nearer telling you that, then by
telling you, we cannot tell. The Angels may be content with that <hi>Negative</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
since we can express God himselfe in no clearer termes, nor in termes expressing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93359:8"/>
more Dignity, then in saying we cannot expresse him. Onely the Angels themselves
know one another; and, one good point, in which we shall be like them then, shall be,
that then we shall know what they are; we know they are <hi>Spirits</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> but what
the nature of a spirit is, we know not: we know they are <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>office,</hi> appointed to
execute Gods will upon us; but, <hi>How</hi> a spirit should execute those bodily actions, that
<hi>Angels</hi> doe, in their owne motion, and in the transportation of other things, we know
not: we know they are <hi>Creatures;</hi> but whether created with this world, (as all our later
men incline to think) or long before, (as all the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and some of the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers
thought) we know not: we know that for their number <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and for their faculties also,
there may be one <hi>Angel</hi> for every man; but whether there be so, or no, because not
onely amongst the Fathers, but even in the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, in both sub-divisions,
<hi>Lutheran,</hi> and <hi>Calvinist,</hi> great men deny it, and as great affirme it, we know not: we
know the Angels know, they understand, but whether by that way, which we call in
the Schoole, <hi>Cognitionem Matutinam,</hi> by seeing all in God, or that which we call <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rspertinam,</hi>
by a clearer manifestation of the <hi>species</hi> of things to them,<note place="margin">Colos. 1.</note> then to us, we
know not: we know they are distinguished into Orders; the Apostle tells us so: but
what, or how many their Orders are, (since S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard</hi> differ from that
Designe of their <hi>nine orders,</hi> which S. <hi>Denis the Areopagite</hi> had given before, in placing
of those nine, and <hi>Athanasius</hi> addes more to those nine,) we know not; But we are
content to say with S. <hi>Augustine, Esse firmissimè credo, quaenam sint nescio;</hi> that there
are distinct orders of <hi>Angels,</hi> assuredly I beleeve; but what they are, I cannot tell; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
qui possunt; si tamen probare possunt quod dicunt,</hi> saies that Father, Let them tell you
that can, so they be able to prove, that they tell you true. They are Creatures, that
have not so much of a Body as <hi>flesh</hi> is, as <hi>froth</hi> is, as a <hi>vapor</hi> is, as a <hi>sigh</hi> is, and yet with
a touch they shall molder a rocke into lesse Atomes, then the sand that it stands upon;
and a milstone into smaller flower, then it grinds. They are Creatures <hi>made,</hi> and yet
not a minute elder now, then when they were first made, if they were made before all
measure of time began; nor, if they were made in the beginning of Time, and be now six
thousand yeares old, have they one wrinckle of Age in their face, or one sobbe of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse
in their lungs. They are <hi>primogeniti Dei,</hi> Gods eldest sonnes; They are super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elementary
meteors, they hang between the nature of God, and the nature of man, and are
of middle Condition; And, (if we may offencelessely expresse it so) they are <hi>anigmata
Divina,</hi> The Riddles of Heaven, and the perplexities of speculation. But this is but
till the Resurrection; Then we shall be like them, and know them by that assimilation.
We end this branch with this consideration, If by being <hi>like</hi> the Angels, we shall <hi>know</hi>
the Angels, we are more then <hi>like</hi> ourselves, we are our selves, why doe we not know
our selves? Why did not <hi>Adam</hi> know, that he had a Body, that might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in an immortality, and yet submitted his body, and mine, and thine, and theirs,
who by this union are to be made one, and all, that by Gods goodnesse shall be derived
from them, to certaine, to inevitable Death? Why doe not we know our owne <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi>
that dwells in us still, for all <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and ours in him; that immortality
which we cannot devest, but must live for ever, whether we will or no? To know this
immortality, is to make this immortality, which otherwise is the heaviest part of our
Curse, a Blessing unto us, by providing to live in <hi>Immortall happinesse:</hi> whereas now, we
doe so little know our selves, as that if my soule could aske one of those <hi>Wormes</hi> which
my dead body shall produce, Will you change with me? that worme would say, No; for
you are like to live eternally in torment; for my part, I can live no longer, then the
putrid moisture of your body will give me leave, and therefore I will not change; nay,
would the <hi>Devill</hi> himselfe change with a damned soule? I cannot tell; As we argue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently,
that the Devil is tormented more then man, because the Devill fel from God,
without any other Tempter, then himselfe, but man had a Tempter, so may it be not
inconveniently argued too, that man may be more tormented then he, because man
continued and <hi>relapsed,</hi> in his rebellions to God, after so many pardons offered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
which the Devill never had. Howsoever, otherwise their torments may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
as the Devill is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and a condemned soule a spirit, yet that soule shall have
a <hi>Body</hi> too, to be tormented with it, which the Devill shall not. How little we know
our selves, which is the end of all knowledge! But we hast to the next branch, <hi>In the
Resurrection we shall be like to the Angels of God in Heaven;</hi> But in what lies this likenesse?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93359:9"/>In how many other things soever this likenesse may ly,<note place="margin">Simile's.</note> yet in this Text, and in our
present purpose, it lies onely in this, <hi>Non nubent,</hi> In the Resurrection <hi>they shall not mary.</hi>
But did Angels never mary, or, as <hi>good,</hi> or, at least, as <hi>ill,</hi> as mary? How many of the
ancients take those words,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 2. Drusius in Sulpit. Sever.</note> 
                        <hi>That the sonnes of God saw the daughters of Men</hi> that <hi>they</hi> were
faire, and <hi>they tooke them wives of all which they chose,</hi> to be intended of Angels? They
offer to tell us how many these maried Angels were; <hi>Origen</hi> saies, <hi>sixty,</hi> or <hi>seventy.</hi> They
offer to tell us some of their <hi>names; Aza,</hi> was one of these maried Angels, and <hi>Azael</hi>
was another. But then all those, who doe understand these words, <hi>The sonnes of God,</hi>
to be intended of Angels, who being sent downe, to protect <hi>Men,</hi> fell in love with <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and maried them, all, I say, agree, that those Angels that did so, never returned
to God againe, but fell, with the first fallen, under everlasting Condemnation. So that
still, <hi>the Angels of God in Heaven,</hi> those Angels to whom we shall be like in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<hi>doe not mary,</hi> not so much as in any such mistaking; they doe not, because they
need not; they need not, because they need no second Eternity, by the continuation of
children; for, says S. <hi>Luke,</hi> they <hi>cannot die. Adams</hi> first immortality was but this, <hi>Posse
non mori,</hi> that he needed not to have died, he should not have died; The Angels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
and ours, when we shall be like them, in the Resurrection, is, <hi>Non posse mori,</hi>
that we cannot die, for, whosoever dies, is <hi>Homicida sui,</hi> sayes <hi>Tertullian;</hi> he kills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and <hi>sinne</hi> is his sword: In heaven there shall no such sword be drawn; we need
not say, that the Angels in heaven have, that we when we shall be like them, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
shall so invest an immortality in our nature, as that God <hi>could</hi> not inflict
Death upon them, or us there, if we <hi>sinned:</hi> But because no sinne shall enter there, no
Death shall enter there neither, for, <hi>Death is the wages of sinne.</hi> Not that no sinne could
enter there, if we were left to our selves; for, in that place, Angels did sinne; (And,
<hi>fatendum est Angelos natura mutabiles,</hi> saies S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> Howsoever Angels be changed
in their Condition, they retaine still the same nature, and by nature they are mutable)
But that God hath added another prerogative, by way of Confirmation, to that state;
so, as that that Grace which he gives us here, which is, that nothing shall put a <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of sinning</hi> upon us, or that we must needs sinne, God multiplies upon us so there, as
that we can conceive no inclination to sinne. Therein we shall be like the Angels, that
we cannot die; And the nearer we come to that state in this life, the liker we are to those
Angels here. Now, beloved, onely he that is <hi>Dead</hi> already, cannot die. He that in a
holy mortification is <hi>Dead the Death of the righteous,</hi> dead <hi>to sinne,</hi> he lives, (shall we
dare to say so? yes, we may) <hi>he lives a blessed Death,</hi> for such a Death is true life: And
by such a heavenly Death, Death of the righteous, Death to sinne, he is in possession of
a heavenly life here, in an inchoation, though the consummation, and perfection be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for the next world; which is our last circumstance, and the Conclusion of all, At
the Resurrection we shall be like the Angels; <hi>Till then we shall not;</hi> and therefore must
not looke for <hi>Angelicall perfections</hi> here, but beare one anothers infirmities.</p>
                     <p>It is as yet but in Petition,<note place="margin">Interim.</note> 
                        <hi>fiat voluntas, Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven:</hi>
And as long as there is an Earth it will be but in Petition; His will will not be done in
Earth as it is in Heaven; when all is Heaven, to his Saints, all will be well; but not all
till then. In the meane time, remember all, (especially you, whose <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> that is,
<hi>Mysterious,</hi> and <hi>significative union</hi> now is a <hi>Type</hi> of your union with God in as neare, and
as fast a band, as that of Angels, for, <hi>you shall be as the Angels of God in Heaven</hi>) That the
office of the Angels in this world, is to <hi>Assist,</hi> and to supply <hi>Defects.</hi> You are both of
noble extraction; there's no defect in that; you need not supply one another with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi>
you are both of religious <hi>Education;</hi> there's no defect in that; you need not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
one another with fundamentall instructions. Both have your parts in that testimony
which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> gave of your Nation, at <hi>Rome, Angli Angeli,</hi> you have a lovelinesse
fit for one another. But, though I cannot <hi>Name,</hi> no nor <hi>Thinke</hi> any thing, wherein I
should wish that Angelicall disposition of supporting, or supplying defects, yet, when
I consider, that even he that said <hi>Ego &amp; pater unum sumus, I and the Father are one,</hi> yet
had a time to say, <hi>utquid dereliquisti? My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thereby, that no two can be so made one in this world, but that that unity may be,
though not <hi>Dissolved,</hi> no nor <hi>Rent,</hi> no nor <hi>Endangered,</hi> yet <hi>shaked</hi> sometimes by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestique
occasions, by Matrimoniall encumbrances, by perversnesse of <hi>servants,</hi> by
impertinencies of <hi>Children,</hi> by private whisperings, and calumnies of <hi>Strangers.</hi> And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93359:9"/>
therefore, to speake not <hi>Prophetically,</hi> that any such thing shall fall, but <hi>Provisionally,</hi> if
any such thing should fall, my love, and my duty, and my Text, bids me tell you, that
perfect happinesse is to be staid for, till you be <hi>as the Angels of God in heaven;</hi> here, it is
a faire portion of that Angelicall happinesse, if you be alwaies ready to support, and
supply one another in any such occasionall weaknesses. The God of Heaven multiply
the present joy of your parents, by that way, of making you <hi>joyfull parents</hi> also; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense
your obedience to parents, by that way, of giving you <hi>obedient Children</hi> too.
The God of heaven so joine you now, as that you may be glad of one another all your
life; and when he who hath joined you, shall separate you againe, establish you with an
assurance, that he hath but borrowed one of you, for a time, to make both your joies
the more perfect in the Resurrection. The God of Heaven make you alwaies of one
will, and that will alwaies conformable to his; conserve you in the sincere truth of his
Religion; feast you with the best feast, Peace of conscience; and carry you through the
good opinion, and love of his Saints in this world, to the association of his Saints, and
Angels, and one another, in the Resurrection, and everlasting possession of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which his Sonne, our Saviour, Christ Jesus hath purchased for us, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable

                     <p>If we should employ this exercise onely upon these two generall considerations,
first, that God puts even his care and his study to finde out <hi>what is good for man,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that God doth provide and furnish whatsoever he findes to be necessary, <hi>faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
I will make him a Helper,</hi> though they be <hi>common places</hi> we are bound to thanke
God that they are so; that it is a <hi>common place</hi> to <hi>good,</hi> that he ever does it towards us,
that it is a <hi>common place to us,</hi> that we ever acknowledge it in him. But you may be
pleased to admit a more particular distribution. For, upon the first, will be grounded
this consideration, that in regard of the <hi>publique</hi> good, God pretermits <hi>private,</hi> and
particular respects; for, God doth not say, <hi>Non bonum homini,</hi> it is not good for man
to be alone, man might have done well enough so; nor God does not say, <hi>non bonum
hunc hominem,</hi> it is not good for <hi>this,</hi> or that <hi>particular</hi> man to be alone; but <hi>non bonum,
Hominem,</hi> it is not good in the <hi>generall,</hi> for the <hi>whole frame of the world,</hi> that <hi>man should
be alone,</hi> because then both Gods purposes had been frustrated, of being glorified by
man here, in this world, and of glorifying man, in the world to come; for neither of
these could have been done, without a succession, and propagation of man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>non bonum hominem,</hi> it was <hi>not good, that man should be alone.</hi> And then upon the
second consideration, will arise these branches; first, that whatsoever the defect be, there
is no remedy, but from God; for it is, <hi>faciam,</hi> I will doe it. Secondly, that even the
workes of God, are not equally excellent; this is but <hi>faciam,</hi> it is not <hi>faciamus;</hi> in the

                        </note> that in regard of the <hi>publique good,</hi> God pretermits private respects, if we
take examples upon that stage, upon that scene, the face of Nature, we see that for the
conservation of the whole, God hath imprinted in the particulars, a disposition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from their owne nature: water will clamber up hills, and ayre will sinke down into

we see, that for the publique, for the <hi>redemption</hi> of the whole world, God hath (shall
we say, pretermitted?) derelicted, forsaken, abandoned, his own, and onely Sonne. Do
you so too? <hi>Regnum Dei intra nos;</hi> the kingdome of God is within you; <hi>planted</hi> in your

<hi>wantonnesse,</hi> in which the kingdome of God doth not consist, for the conservation of this

in consulting with religious friends? will ye not give <hi>subsidies</hi> for this kingdome,
in relieving their necessities, for whom God hath made you his stewards? weigh and
measure your selves, and spend that, be negligent of that, which is least, and worst in
you. Is your soule lesse then your body, because it is in it? How easily lies a letter in
a Boxe, which if it were unfolded, would cover that Boxe? unfold your soule, and you

whereas the body is but <hi>from</hi> that earth, and <hi>for</hi> that earth, upon which it is now; which
is but a short, and an inglorious progresse. To contract this, the soule is larger then the
body, and the glory, and the joyes of heaven, larger then the honours, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

                     <p>To proceed, when we made that observation,<note place="margin">Non homini.</note> 
                        <hi>that</hi> God <hi>pretermitted the private for

have been supplied with a farther creation of more men. In making the inventaries of
those goods which man possesseth in the world,<note place="margin">Xenoph.</note> we see a great Author says, <hi>In possessio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
sunt amici, &amp; inimici,</hi> not onely our friends, but even our enemies, are part of
our goods, and we may raise as much profit from these, as from those, It may be as
good a lesson to a mans sonne, <hi>Study that enemy,</hi> as <hi>Observe that friend.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> says,
<hi>propitius fuisti,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 99. 8.</note>

that he did correct them. So we may say to our enemy, I owe you my watchfulnesse

calumniated all my indifferent actions, and that kept me; from committing enormous ill
ones. And if then our enemies be <hi>in possessionibus,</hi> to be inventaried amongst our goods,
might not man have been abundantly rich in friends, without this addition of a woman?
<hi>Quanto congruentius,</hi> says S. <hi>Augustine;</hi> how much more conveniently might two friends
live together, then a man and a woman?</p>
                     <p>God doth not then say, <hi>non bonum homini,</hi> man got not so much by the bargaine,
(especially if we consider how that wife carried her selfe towards him) but that for his
particular, he had been better alone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nor he does not say now, <hi>non bonum hunc hominem
esse solum,</hi> It is not good for <hi>any man</hi> to be alone; for, <hi>Qui potest capere capiat,</hi> says
Christ: <hi>he that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</hi> What?<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>That some make themselves
Eunuchs for the kingdome of heaven:</hi> that is, the better to un-entangle themselves from
those impediments, which hinder them in the way to heaven, they abstaine from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
and <hi>let them that can receive it, receive it.</hi> Now certainly few try <hi>whether they
can</hi> receive this, or no. Few strive, few <hi>fast,</hi> few <hi>pray</hi> for the gift of continency; few are
content with that incontinency which they have, but are sorry they can expresse no
more incontinency. There is a use of mariage now, which God never thought of in the
first institution of mariage; that it is a <hi>remedy</hi> against burning. The two maine uses of
mariage, which are propagation of <hi>Children,</hi> and mutuall <hi>assistance,</hi> were intended by
God, at the present, at first; but the third, is a remedy against that, which was not then;
for then there was no inordinatenesse, no irregularity in the affections of man. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath taught us now, that those climates which are in reputation, hottest, are
not uninhabitable; they may be dwelt in for all their heat. Even now, in the corruption
of our nature, the clime is not so hot, as that <hi>every one</hi> must of necessity, mary. There
may be fire in the house, and yet the house not on fire: there may be a distemper of
heate, and yet no necessity to let blood. The Roman Church injures us, when they
say, that we prefer mariage before virginity: and they injure the whole state of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
when they oppose <hi>mariage</hi> and <hi>chastity,</hi> as though they were incompatible, and
might not consist together.<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> They may; for <hi>mariage is honourable, and the bed undefiled;</hi>
and therefore it may be so. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> observes in mariage, <hi>Bonuam fidei,</hi> a triall of
one anothers truth; and that's good; And <hi>bonum prolis,</hi> a lawfull meanes of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that's good; and <hi>bonum Sacramenti,</hi> a mysticall representation of that union
of two natures in Christ, and of him to us, and to his Church; and that's good too.
So that there are divers degrees of good in mariage. But yet for all these goodnesses,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93359:11"/>
God does not say, <hi>non bonum,</hi> it is not good <hi>for any man</hi> to be alone, but <hi>Qui capere
potest capiat;</hi> according to Christs comment, upon his Fathers text, <hi>He that can containe</hi>
and continue alone, <hi>let him</hi> doe so.</p>
                     <p>But though God do not say, <hi>non homini,</hi> It is not good for <hi>the man,</hi> that he be alone,
nor <hi>quemvis hominem,</hi> it is not good <hi>for every man</hi> to be alone, yet, considering his generall
purpose upon all the world, by man, he sayes <hi>non bonum;</hi> for that end, it is not good, that
man should be alone, because those purposes of God could not consist with that soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of man. In that production, and in that survay, which God made of all that he
had made, still he gives the testimony, that he saw all was good, excepting onely in his
<hi>Second dayes worke,</hi> and in his making of Man. He forbore it in the making of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
because the firmament was <hi>to divide</hi> between waters and waters; it was an
embleme of division, of disunion. He forbore it also in the making of man, because
though man was to be an embleme of Gods union to his Church, yet because this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,
and this representation, could not be in man alone, till the woman were made
too, God does not pronounce upon the making of man, that the work was good: but
upon Gods contemplation, that it was not good, that man should be alone, there arose
a goodnesse, in having a companion. And from that time, if we seeke <hi>bonum, quia lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
if we will call that good, which is lawfull, mariage is that, <hi>If thou takest a wife thou
sinnest not,</hi> sayes God by the Apostle.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 28.</note> If we seeke <hi>bonum, quia bonus autor,</hi> if we call that
good whose author is good,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 22.</note> mariage is that; <hi>Adduxit ad Adam,</hi> God brought her to
man. If we seek such a goodnesse, as hath <hi>good witness,</hi> good testimony, mariage is that;
Christ was present at a mariage,<note place="margin">Iohn. 2.</note> and honoured it with his first miracle. If we seek such
a goodnesse, as is a <hi>constant,</hi> and not a temporary, an occasionall goodnesse, Christ hath
put such a cement upon mariage,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>What God hath joined, let no man put as under.</hi> If we seek
such a goodnesse, as no man, (that is, no sort nor degree of men) is the worse for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
accepted, we see the holiecst of all, the <hi>High Priest,</hi> in the old Testament is onely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
<hi>what woman he shall not mary,</hi> but not that he shall not mary; and the <hi>Bishop</hi> in
the new Testament what kinde of husband he must have been, but not that he must have
been no husband. To contract this, as mariage in good, in having the best author, <hi>God,</hi>
the best witnesse, <hi>Christ,</hi> the logest terme, <hi>Life,</hi> the largest extent, even to the <hi>highest
persons, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Bishops;</hi> as it is, all these wayes, <hi>Positively</hi> good, so it is good in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison</hi>
of that, which justly seemes the best state, that is, <hi>Virginity,</hi> in S. <hi>Augustines</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>Non impar meritum Iohannis &amp; Abrahae:</hi> If we could consider merit in man, the
merit of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of nations, and the merit of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was no father at
all, is equall. But that wherein we consider the goodnesse of it here, is, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
this way, to receive glory from the sonnes of men here upon earth, and to give
glory to the sonnes of men in heaven.</p>
                     <p>But what glory can God receive from man, that he should be so carefull of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation?
what glory more from man, then from the Sunne, and Moon, and Stars,
which have no propagation? why this, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> observes; <hi>Musca Soli praefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renda,
quia vivit,</hi> A Fly is a nobler creature then the Sunne, because a fly hath life, and
the Sunne hath not; for the degrees of dignity in the creature are <hi>esse, vivere,</hi> and <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere:</hi>
to have a <hi>beeing,</hi> to have <hi>life,</hi> and to have <hi>understanding:</hi> and therefore man,
who hath all three, is much more able to glorify God, then any other creature is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he onely can chuse whether he will glorify God or no; the glory that the others
give, they must give,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> but man is able to offer to God a <hi>reasonable sacrifice. When ye
were Gentiles,</hi> saies the Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>ye were caryed away unto dumb Idols, even as ye were led.</hi>
This is reasonable service, out of <hi>Reason</hi> to understand, and out of our willingnesse to doe
God service. Now, when God had spent infinite millions of millions of generations,
from all un-imaginable eternity, in contemplating one another in the Trinity, and then
(to speake <hi>humanly</hi> of God, which God in his Scriptures abhors not) out of a satiety
in that contemplation would create a world for his glory, and when he had wrought
the first day, and created all the matter, and substance of the future creatures, and
wrought foure dayes after, and a great part of the sixth, and yet nothing produced, which
could give him any glory (for glory is <hi>rationabile obsequium,</hi> reasonable service; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could give that but a creature that understood it, and would give it,) at last, as
the knot of all, created man; then, to perpetuate his glory, he must perpetuate man:
and to that purpose, <hi>non bonum,</hi> it was not good for man to be alone; as without man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93359:11"/>
God could not have been glorified, so without woman man could not have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated.</p>
                     <p>But, as there is a place cited by S. <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 68. 18.</note> which hath some perplexity

or to have given gifts <hi>to men,</hi> (for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it) so it is not easse for us to discern,
whether God had a care to propagate man, that he might receive glory <hi>from</hi> man, or
that he might give glory <hi>to</hi> man. When God had taken it into his purpose to people
heaven again, depopulated in the fall of Angels, by the substitution of man in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
when God had a purpose to spend as much time with man in heaven after, as he had
done with himself before, (for our perpetuity after the Resurrection, shall no more have
an end, then his Eternity before the Creation had a beginning:) And when God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
that time of the Resurrection, as it were to make sure of man before, would send
down his <hi>own Son</hi> to assume our nature here; and, as not sure enough so, would take us
up to him, and set us, in his Son, at his own right hand, whereas he never did, nor shall
say to any of the Angels, <hi>Sit thou there:</hi> That God might not be frustrated of this
great, and gracious, and glorious purpose of his, <hi>non bonum,</hi> it was not good that man
should be alone; for without man God could not give this glory, and without woman
there could be no propagation of man. And so, though it might have been <hi>Bonum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
man might have done well enough alone; and <hi>Bonum hunc hominem, some</hi> men
may doe better alone, yet God, who ever, for our example, prefers the publique before
the private, because it conduced not to his <hi>generall</hi> end, of Having, and of Giving glory,
saw, and said, <hi>Non bonum hominem,</hi> it was not good that man should be alone. And so we
have done with the branches of our first part.</p>
                     <p>We are come now to our second generall part:<note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Part.</note> In which, as we saw in the former,
that God studies man, and all things necessary for man, we shall also see, that wherein
soever man is defective, his onely supply, and reparation is from God, <hi>Faciam,</hi> I will
doe it. <hi>Saul</hi> wanted <hi>counsell,</hi> he was in a perplexity, and he sought to the Witch of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
and not to God; and what is the issue? he Hears of his own, and of his son <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
death the next day. <hi>Asa</hi> wants <hi>health,</hi> and he seeks to the Physician, and not to
God, and what is the issue? He dies. Doe not say, says S. <hi>Chrysost. Quaero necessaria,</hi>
I desire nothing but that which is necessary for my birth, necessary for my place: <hi>Quod
non dat Deus, non est necessarium:</hi> God hath made himself thy Steward, thy Bayliffe;
and whatsoever God provides not for thee, is not necessary to thee. It was the poor way
that <hi>Mahomet</hi> found out in his Alchoran, that in the next life all women should have
eies of one bignesse, and a stature of one size; he could finde no means to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
but to make them all alike: But that is thy complexion, that is thy proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which God hath given thee. It may be true that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> notes, who had so much
conversation amongst women, that it did him harm, <hi>Mult as insognis pudicitiae, quamvis
nulli virorum, sibi scimus ornari;</hi> I know, says he, as honest women as are in the world,
that take a delight in making themselves handsomely ready, though for no other bodies
sake but for their own.<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> That may be; but, <hi>manus Deo inferunt,</hi> they take the pencil
out of Gods hand, who goe about to mend any thing of his making. <hi>Quod nascitur Dei
est, quod mutatur Diaboli,</hi> says the same Father; God made us according to his image,
and shall he be put to say to any of us, <hi>Non imago mea,</hi> this picture was not taken by the
life, not by me, but is a Copy of the present distemper of the time? All good reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are of God; none but he would ever have conceived such an invention as the Ark,
without that modell, for the reparation of the world; and he hath provided that means
for the conservation of the world, <hi>mariage,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> the association of one to one: <hi>Plures costae
Adae, nec fatig at a manus Dei: Adam</hi> had more ribs then one, neither were Gods hands
wearied with making one; and yet he made no more. For him who first exceeded
that, <hi>Lamech,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 18.</note> who had two wives, the first was <hi>Adah,</hi> and <hi>Adah</hi> signifies <hi>Coetum, congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationem;</hi>

<hi>Zillah,</hi> and <hi>Zillah</hi> is but <hi>umbra,</hi> but a shadow, but a <hi>ghost,</hi> that will <hi>terrifie</hi> at last.</p>
                     <p>To proceed; Though God always provide remedies,<note place="margin">Faciam.</note> and supplies of defects, it is
not always in the greatest measure, nor in the presentest manner, that we conceive to our
selves. So much may be intimated even in this, that in this remedy of Gods provision,
the woman, God proceeded not, as he did in the making of man; it is not <hi>Faciamus,</hi>
with such a counsell, such a deliberation as was used in that case. When the Creation

they affected the praise of the people, but that thereby they saw, that they had done
more good upon the people. And in another place he makes that comparison, That a
righteous man desires <hi>to be dissolved and to be with Christ,</hi> &amp; yet this righteous man dines,
and sups, takes ordinary refections and ordinary recreations: So, for mariage, says he, in
temperate men, <hi>officiosum, non libidinesum,</hi> it is to pay a debt, not to satisfie appetite; lest
otherwise she prove <hi>in Ruinam,</hi> who was given <hi>in Adjutorium,</hi> and he be put to the first

                     <p>So much then she should be, A Helper; for, for that she was made. She is not so, if
she remember not those duties which are intimated in the stipulation and contract which
she hath made. Call it <hi>Conjugium,</hi> and that is derived <hi>a Iuge,</hi> it is an equall patience in
bearing the incommodities of this life. Call it <hi>Nuptias,</hi> and that is derived <hi>à Nube,</hi> a
vaile, a covering; and that is an estranging, a withdrawing her self from all such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
as may violate his peace, or her honour. Call it <hi>Matrimonium,</hi> and that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from a Mother, and that implies a religious education of her children. <hi>De latere

                     <p>But she must be no more; If she think her self more then a Helper, she is not so
much. He is a miserable creature, whose Creator is his Wife. God did not stay to joyn
her in Commission with <hi>Adam,</hi> so far as to give names to the creatures; much lesse to
give essence; essence to the man, essence to her husband. When the wife thinks her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
owes her all his fortune, all his discretion, all his reputation, <hi>God help that man</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

of the weaker sexe, stronger in fortune, and in counsell too, then they to whom God

of a Helper. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> shall be her Remembrancer, She was not taken out of the <hi>fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be troden upon, nor out of the <hi>head,</hi> to be an overseer of him; but out of <hi>his side,</hi>
where she weakens him enough, and therefore should do all she can, to be a Helper.</p>
                     <p>To be so, so much, and no more, she must be as God made <hi>Eve, fimilis ei, meet</hi> and
<hi>fit</hi> for her husband. She is fit for any if she have those vertues, which always make the
person that hath them <hi>good;</hi> as <hi>chastity, sobriety, taciturnity, verity,</hi> and such; for, for
such vertues as may be had, and yet the possessor not the better for them, as <hi>wit; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
eloquence, musick, memory, cunning,</hi> and such, these make her never the fitter.
There is a Harmony of dispositions, and that requires particular consideration upon
emergent occasions; but the fitnesse that goes through all, is a <hi>sober continency;</hi> for
without that, <hi>Matrimonium jurata fornicatio,</hi> Mariage is but a continuall fornication,
sealed with an oath: And mariage was not instituted to prostitute the chastity of the
woman to one man, but to preserve her chastity from the tentations of more men.
<hi>Bathsheba</hi> was a little too fit for <hi>David,</hi> when he had tried her so far before; for there
is no fitnesse where there is not <hi>continency.</hi> To end all, there is a <hi>Morall fitnesse,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

fitnesse,</hi> in the unanimity of Religion, that they be not of repugnant professions
that way. Of which, since we are well assured in both these, who are to be joyned
now, I am not sorry, if either the houre, or the present occasion call me from speaking
any thing at all, because it is a subject too mis-interpretable, and unseasonable to admit
an enlarging in at this time. At this time therefore, this be enough, for the explication
and application of these words.</p>

                     <p>The first mariage that was made, God made, and he made it in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise:
And of that mariage I have had the like occasion as this to speak before, in the
presence of many honourable persons in this company. The last mariage which shall be
made, God shall make too, and in Paradise too; in the Kingdome of heaven: and at
that mariage, I hope in him that shall make it, to meet, not some, but all this company.
The mariage in this Text hath relation to both those mariages: It is it self the spirituall
and mysticall mariage of Christ Jesus to the Church, and to every mariageable soule in
the Church: And it hath a retrospect, it looks back to the first mariage; for to that the
first word carries us, because from thence God takes his metaphor, and comparison,

considerations three objects, three subjects: first, a secular mariage in Paradise;
secondly, a spirituall mariage in the Church; and thirdly, an eternall mariage in heaven.
And in each of these three we shall present three circumstances; first the Persons, <hi>Me</hi>
and <hi>Tibi, I will mary thee;</hi> And then the Action, <hi>Sponsabo, I will mary thee;</hi> And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <p>In the first acceptation then,<note place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Part. <hi>Persons.</hi>
                        </note> in the first, the secular mariage in Paradise, the persons
were <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve:</hi> Ever since they are he and she, man and woman: At first, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of necessity, without any such limitation, as now: And now without any other limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
then such as are expressed in the Law of God: As the Apostles say in the first
generall Councell,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>We lay nothing upon you but things necessary,</hi> so we call nothing <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
but that which is commanded by God. If in heaven I may have the place of a man
that hath performed the Commandements of God, I will not change with him that
thinks he hath done more then the Commandements of God enjoyned him. The rule
of marriage for degrees and distance in blood, is the Law of God; but for conditions
of men, there is no Rule given at all. When God had made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradise,
God did not place <hi>Adam</hi> in a Monastery on one side, and <hi>Eve</hi> in a Nunnery on the
other, and so a River between them. They that built wals and cloysters to frustrate Gods
institution of mariage,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 3.</note> advance the Doctrine of Devils in forbidding mariage. The
Devil hath advantages enow against us, in bringing men and women together: It was a
strange and super-devilish invention, to give him a new advantage against us, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men and women asunder, by forbidding mariage. Between the heresie of the Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans,
that induced a community of women, any might take any; and the heresie of
the Tatians that forbad all, none might take any, was a fair latitude. Between the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Manichean hereticks, that thought women to be made by the Devil, and
your Colliridian hereticks that sacrificed to a women, as to God, there is a fair distance.
Between the denying of them souls, which S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is charged to have done, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them such souls, as that they may be Priests, as your Pepution hereticks did, is a
faire way for a moderate man to walk in. To make them Gods is ungodly, and to make
them Devils is devillish; To make them Mistresses is unmanly, and to make them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
is unnoble; To make them as God made them, wives, is godly and manly too.
When in your Roman Church they dissolved mariage in naturall kindred, in degrees
where God forbids it not, when they dissolve mariage upon spitituall kindred, because
my Grandfather Christned that womans Father; when they dissolve mariage upon le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
kindred, because my Grandfather adopted that womans Father: they separate
those whom God hath joyned so, as to give leave to joyn in lawfull mariage. When
men have made vows to abstain from mariage, I would they would they would be content to try a
little longer then they doe, whether they could keep that vow or no: And when men
have consecrated themselves to the service of God in his Church, I would they would
be content to try a little farther then they doe, whether they could abstain or no: But
to dissolve mariage made after such a Vow, or after Orders, is still to separate those
whom God hath not separated. The Persons are he and she, man and woman; they
must be so much; he must be a man, she must be a woman; And they must be no more;
not a brother and a sister, not an unckle and aneece; <hi>Adduxit od eum,</hi> was the cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> God brought them together; God will not bring me a precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
person, he will not have me defraud another; nor God will not bring me a
mis-beleeving, a superstitious person, he will not have me drawn from himself: But let
them be persons that God hath made, man and woman, and persons that God hath
brought together, that is, not put asounder by any Law of his, and all such persons are
capable of this first, this secular mariage.</p>
                     <p>In which our second Consideration is the Action, <hi>Sponsabe;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sponsabo.</note> where the Active is a
kinde of Passive, <hi>I will mary thee, is, I will be maried unto thee, for we mary not our selves.</hi>
They are somewhat hard driven in the Roman Church,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimo. l. 1. c. 6.</note> when making mariage a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and being prest by us with this question, If it be a Sacrament, who administers it,
who is the Priest? They are fain to answer, the Bridegroom and the Bride, he and she
are the Priest in that Sacrament. As mariage is a civill Contract, it must be done so in
publick, as that it may have the testimony of men; As mariage is a religious Contract, it
must be so done, as that it may have the benediction of the Priest: In a mariage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
testimony of men they cannot claim any benefit of the Law; In a mariage without
the benediction of the Priest they cannot claim any benefit of the Church: for how
Matrimonially foever such persons as have maried themselves may pretend to love, and
live together, yet all that love, and all that life is but a regulated Adultery, it is not
mariage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93359:13"/>Now this institution of mariage had three objects: first, <hi>In ustionem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In ustionem.</note> it was given for
a remedy against burning; And then, <hi>In prolem,</hi> for propagation, for children; And
lastly, <hi>In adjutorium,</hi> for mutuall help. As we consider it the first way, <hi>In ustionem,</hi> every
heating is not a burning; every naturall concupiscence does not require a mariage; may
every flaming is not a burning; though a man continue under the flame of carnall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as long as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did; yet it needs not come presently to a <hi>Sponsabo,</hi> I will mary.
God gave S. <hi>Paul</hi> other Physick, <hi>Gratia mea sufficit,</hi> grace to stand under that tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave himself other Physick, <hi>Contundo corpus,</hi> convenient disciplines
to tame his body.<note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> These will keepa man from burning; for <hi>Vriest desideriis vinci, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideria
pati, illustris est, &amp; perfecti;</hi> To be overcome by our concupiscences, that is to
burn, but to quench the fire by religious ways, that is a noble, that is a perfect work.
When God at the first institution of mariage had this first use of mariage in his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
that it should be a remedy against burning, God gave man the remedy, before
he had the disease; for mariage was instituted in the state of innocency, when there was
no inordinatenesse in the affections of man, and so no burning. But as God created Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb
in the world, whose quality is to purge choler, before there was any choler to
purge, so God according to his abundant forwardnesse to doe us good, created a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
before the disease, which he foresaw comming, was come upon us. Let him then
that takes a wife in this first and lowest sense, <hi>In medicinam,</hi> but as his Physick, yet
make her his cordiall Physick, take her to his heart, and fill his heart with her, let her
dwell there, and dwell there alone, and so they will be mutuall Antidotes and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives
one to another, against all forein tentations. And with this blessing, blesse
thou, ô Lord, these whom thou hast brought hither for this blessing: make all the days
of their life like this day unto them; and as thy mercies are new every morning, make
them so to one another; And if they may not die together, sustain thou the survivor of
them in that sad hour with this comfort, That he that died for them both, will bring
them together again in his everlastingnesse.</p>
                     <p>The second use of mariage was <hi>In prolificationem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In prolem.</note> for children: And therefore as
S. <hi>August.</hi> puts the case, To contract before, that they will have no children, makes it
no mariage but an adultery: To deny themselves to another, is as much against mariage
as to give themselves to another. To hinder it by Physick, or any other practise; nay
to hinder it so far, as by a deliberate wish, or prayer against children, consists not well
with this second use of mariage. And yet in this second use, we dòe not so much consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
generation as regeneration; not so much procreation as education, nor propagation
as transportation of children. For this world might be filled full enough of children,
though there were no mariage; but heaven could not be filled, nor the places of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Angels supplied, without that care of childrens religious education, which from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in lawfull mariage they are likeliest to receive. How infinite, and how miserable a
circle of sin doe we make, if as we sinned in our Parents loins before we were born, so
we sin in our childrens actions when we are dead, by having given them, either exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or liberty of sinning. We have a fearfull commination from God upon a good
man, upon <hi>Eli,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 11. 4. 18.</note> for his not restraining the licentiousnesse of his sons; <hi>I will doe a thing
in Israel,</hi> says God there, <hi>at which every mans eares that heares it shall single:</hi> And it
was executed, <hi>Eli</hi> fell down and broke his neck. We have also a consolation to women
for children,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>She shall be saved in Child-bearing,</hi> says the Apostle; but as <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
and others of the Ancients observe and interpret that place (which interpretation arises
out of the very letter) it is, <hi>Si permanserint,</hi> not if she, but if they, if the children conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in faith, in charity, in holinesse, and sobriety: The salvation of the Parents hath
so much relation to the childrens goodnesse, as that if they be ill by the Parents exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or indulgence, the Parents are as guilty as the children. Art thou afraid thy childe
should be stung with a Snake, and wilt thou let him play with the old Serpent, in opening
himself to all tentations? Art thou afraid to let him walk in an ill aire, and art thou
content to let him stand in that pestilent aire that is made of nothing but oaths, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations
of blasphemous mouths round about him? It is S. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> complaint,
<hi>Perditionem magno pretio emunt; Salutem nec done accipere volunt;</hi> we pay dear for our
childrens damnation, by paying at first for all their childish vanities, and then for their
sinfull insolencies at any rate; and we might have them saved, and our selves to the
bargain, (which were a frugall way, and a debt well hedg'd in) for much lesse then
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93359:14"/>
ours, and their damnation stands us in. If you have a desire, says that blessed Father,
to leave them certainly rich, <hi>Deumiis relinque Debitorem,</hi> Doe some such thing for Gods
service, as you may leave God in their debt. He cannot break; his estate is inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
he will not break promise, nor break day; <hi>He will shew mercy unto thousands in them
that love him and keep his Commandements.</hi> And here also may another showre of his
benedictions fall upon them whom he hath prepared and presented here; <hi>Let the wife
be as a fruitfull Vine, and their children like Olive plants:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 128. 3.</note> To thy glory, let the Parents
expresse the love of Parents, and the children, to thy glory, the obedience of children,
till they both loose that secular name of Parents and Children, and meet all alike, in
one new name, all Saints in thy Kingdome, and fellow servants there.</p>
                     <p>The third and last use in this institution of secular mariage,<note place="margin">In adjutori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> was, <hi>In adjutorium,</hi> for
mutuall help. There is no state, no man in any state, that needs not the help of others.
Subjects need Kings, and if Kings doe not need their Subjects, they need alliances
abroad, and they need Counsell at home. Even in Paradise, where the earth produced
all things for life without labour, and the beasts submitted themselves to man, so that
he had no outward enemy; And in the state of innocency in Paradise, where in man all
the affections submitted themselves to reason, so that he had no inward enemy, yet
God in this abundant Paradise, and in this secure innocency of Paradise, even in the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of his own work, saw, that though all that he had made was good, yet he had not
made all good; he found thus much defect in his own work, that man lacked a helper.
Every body needs the help of others; and every good body does give some kinde of
help to others. Even into the Ark it self, where God blessed them all with a powerfull
and an immediate protection, God admitted onely such as were fitted to help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
couples. In the Ark, which was the Type of our best condition in this life, there
was not a single person. Christ saved once one theef at the last gasp, to shew that there
may be late repentances; but in the Ark he saved none but maried persons, to shew,
that he eases himself in making them helpers to one another. And therefore when we
come to the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sui Deum adjutorium meum,</hi> to rely upon God primarily for our Help,
God comes to the <hi>faciam tibi adjutorium,</hi> I will make thee a help like thy self: not always
like in complexion, nor like in years, nor like in fortune, nor like in birth, but like in
minde, like in disposition, like in the love of God, and of one another or else there is no
helper. It was no kinde of help that <hi>Davids</hi> wife gave him, when she spoke by way of
counsell, but in truth, in scorn and derision, to draw him from a religious act, as the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
before the Ark, at that time was: It is no help for any respect, to slacken the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in his Religion. It was but a poor help that <hi>Nabals</hi> wife was fain to give him by
telling <hi>David, Al as my husband is but a foole, like his name, and what will you look for at a
fools hand?</hi> It is the worst help of all to raise a husband by dejecting her self, to help
her husband forward in this world, by forfeiting sinfully, and dishonourably her own
interest in the next. The husband in the Helper in the nature of a foundation, to sustain
and uphold all; The wife in the nature of the roof, to cover imperfections and weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
The husband in the nature of the head from whom all the sinews flow; The wife in
the nature of the hands into which those sinews flow, and enable them to doe their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The husband helps as legges to her, she moves by his motion; The wife helps as a
staffe to him, he moves the better by her assistance. And let this mutuall help be a part
of our present benediction too; In all the ways of fortune let his industry help her, and
in all the crosses of fortune let her patience help him; and in all emergent occasions
and dangers spirituall, or temporall, <hi>O God make speed to save them, O Lord, make haste
to help them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have spoken of the persons,<note place="margin">In aeternum.</note> man and woman, him and her; And of the action,
first as it is Physick, but cordiall Physick; and then for children, but children to be
made the children of God; and lastly for help, but true help and mutuall help; There
remains yet in this secular mariage, the Term, how long, for ever, <hi>I will mary thee for
ever.</hi> Now though there be properly no eternity in this secular mariage, nor in any
thing in this world, (for eternity is that onely which never had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eginning, nor ever shall
have end) yet we may consider a kind of eternity, a kind of circle without beginning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end, even in this secular mariage: for first, mariage should have no beginning before
mariage; no half-mariage, no lending away of the minde, in conditionall precontracts
before, no lending away of the body in unchaste wantonnesse before. The body is the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93359:14"/>
temple of the Holy Ghost; and when two bodies, by mariage are to be made one temple,
the wife is not as the Chancell, reserv'd and shut up, and the man as the walks below, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
and at liberty for every passenger. God in his Temple looks for first fruits from
both, that so on both sides, mariage should have such a degree of eternity, as to have had
no beginning of mariage before mariage. It should have this degree of eternity too, this
quality of a circle to have no interruption, no breaking in the way by unjust suspitions
and jealousies. Where there is <hi>Spiritus immunditei,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, a spirit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse,
there will necessarily be <hi>Spiritus zelotypiae,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> cals it, a spirit of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
But to raise the Devill in the power of the Devill, to call up one spirit by another
spirit, by the spirit of jealousie and suspition, to induce the spirit of uncleannesse where it
was not, if a man conjure up a Devill so, God knows who shall conjure it down again,
As jealousie is a care and not a suspition, God is not ashamed to protest of himself that
he is a jealous God.<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> God commands that no idolatry be committed, <hi>Thou shalt not bow
down to a graven Image;</hi> and before he accuses any man to have bowed down to a graven
Image, before any Idolatry was committed, he tells them that he <hi>is a jealous God;</hi> God
is jealous before there is any harm done. And God presents it as a curse, when he says,
<hi>My jealousie shall depart from thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezech. 16. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>and I will be quiet, and no more angry;</hi> that is, I will
heave thee to thy self, and take no more care of thee. Jealousie that implies care, and
honour, and counsell, and tendernesse, is rooted in God, for God is a jealous God, and
his servants are jealous servants, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> professes of himself,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>I am jealous over you
with a gedly jealousie.</hi> But jealousie that implies diffidence and suspition, and accusation,
is rooted in the Devil, for he is the <hi>Accuser of the brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then, this secular mariage should be in <hi>aeternum,</hi> eternall, for ever, as to have no
beginning before, and so too, as to have no jealous interruption by the way; for it is so
eternall, as that it can have no end in this life: Those whom God hath joyned, no man,
no Devill, can separate so, as that it shall not remain a mariage so far, as that if those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
persons will live together again, yet they shall not be new maried; so farre, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
the band of mariage continues still. The Devil makes no mariages; He may
have a hand in drawing conveyances; in the temporall conditios there may be practice,
but the mariage is made by God in heaven. The Devil can break no mariages neither,
though he can by sin break off all the good uses, and take away all the comforts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
I pronounce not now whether Adultery dissolves mariage or no; It is S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi>
wisdome to say, Where the Scripture is silent, let me be silent too: And I may
goe lower then he, and say, Where the Church is silent, let me be silent too; and our
Church is so far silent in this, as that it hath not said, That Adultery dissolves mariage.
Perchance then it is not the death of mariage, but surely it is a deadly wound. We have
Authors in the Romanc Church that think <hi>fornicationem non vagam,</hi> that such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent
life as is limited to one certain person, is no deadly sin, But there is none even
amongst them that diminish the crime of Adultery. <hi>Habere quasi non haberes,</hi> is Christs
counsell, To have a wife as though thou hadst none, that is continency, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and forbearance and abstinency upon some occasions; But <hi>non habere quasi habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
is not so; not to have a wife, and yet have her, to have her, that is anothers, that is
the Devils counsell. That falutation of the Angle to the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary, Blessed
art thou amongst memen,</hi> we may make even this interpretation, not onely that she was
blessed amongst women, that is, above women, but that she was <hi>Benedicta,</hi> blessed
amongst women, that all women blest her, that no woman had occasion to curse her:
And this is the eternity of this secular mariage as far as this world admits any eternity;
that it should have no beginning before, no interruption of jealousie in the way, no such
approach towards dissolution, as that incontinency, in all opinions, and in all Churches
is agreed to be. And here also without any scruple of fear, or of suspition of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
there is place for this benediction, upon this couple; Build, ô Lord, upon thine
own foundations, in these two, and establish thy former graces with future; that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ever complain of either of them, nor either of them of one another, and so he and she
are maried in <hi>aeternum</hi> for ever.</p>
                     <p>We are now come in our order proposed at first, to our second Part;<note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Part.</note> for all is said
that I intended of the secular mariage. And of this second, the spirituall mariage, much
needs not to be said: There is another Priest that contracts that, another Preacher that
celebrates that, the Spirit of God to our spirit. And for the third mariage, the eternall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93359:15"/>
mariage, it is a boldnesse to speak any thing of a thing so inexpressible as the joyes of
heaven; it is a diminution of them to goe about to heighten them; it is a shadowing of
them to goe about to lay any colours or light upon them. But yet your patience may
perchance last to a word of each of these three Circumstances, The Persons, the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Term, both in this spirituall, and in the eternall mariage.</p>
                     <p>First then, as in the former Part, the secular mariage,<note place="margin">Persons.</note> for the persons there, we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
first <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and after every man and woman, and this couple in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
so in this spirituall mariage we consider first Christ and his Church, for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and more particularly Christ and my soul. And can these persons meet? in such a
distance, and in such a disparagement can these persons meet? the Son of God and the
son of man? When I consider Christ to be <hi>Germen Iehovae,</hi> the bud and blossome, the
fruit and off-spring of Jehovah, Jehovah himself, and my self before he took me in
hand, to be, not a Potters vessell of earth, but that earth of which the Potter might
make a vessel if he would, and break it if he would when he had made it: When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
Christ to have been from before all beginnings, and to be still the Image of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the same stamp upon the same metall, and my self a peece of rusty copper, in which
those lines of the Image of God which were imprinted in me in my Creation are defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and worn, and washed and burnt, and ground away, by my many, and many, and
many fins: When I consider Christ in his Circle, in glory with his Father, before he
came into this world, establishing a glorious Church when he was in this world, and
glorifying that Church with that glory which himself had before, when he went out of
this world; and then consider my self in my circle, I came into this world washed in my
own tears, and either out of compunction for my self or compassion for others, I passe
through this world as through a valley of tears, where tears settle and swell, and when
I passe out of this world I leave their eyes whose hands close mine, full of tears too,
can these persons, this Image of God, this God himself, this glorious God, and this
vessell of earth, this earth it self, this inglorious worm of the earth, meet without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement?</p>
                     <p>They doe meet and make a mariage;<note place="margin">Action.</note> because I am not a body onely, but a body and
s,oul there is a mariage,<note place="margin">Deut 21. 12.</note> and Christ maries me. As by the Law a man might mary a
captive woman in the Warres, if he shaved her head, and pared her nails, and changed
her clothes: so my Saviour having fought for my soul, fought to blood, to death, to the
death of the Crosse for her, having studied my soul so much, as to write all those Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
which are in the New Testament to my soul, having presented my soule with his
own picture, that I can see his face in all his temporall blessings, having shaved her head
in abating her pride, and pared her nails in contracting her greedy desires, and changed
her clothes not to fashion her self after this world, my soul being thus fitted by himself,
Christ Jesus hath maried my soul, maried her to all the three intendments mentioned
in the secular mariage; first, in <hi>ustionem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In ustionem.</note> against burning; That whether I burn my self in
the fires of tentation, by exposing my self to occasions of tentation, or be reserved to
be burnt by others in the fires of persecution and martyrdome, whether the fires of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
or envy, or lust, or the everlasting fires of hell offer at me in an apprehension of
the judgements of God, yet as the Spirit of God shall wipe all tears from mine eyes, so
the tears of Christ Jesus shall extinguish all fires in my heart, and so it is a mariage, <hi>In
ustionem,</hi> a remedy against burning.</p>
                     <p>It is so too,<note place="margin">In prolem.</note> 
                        <hi>In prolificationem,</hi> for children; first, <hi>vae soli,</hi> woe unto that single soul that
is not maried to Christ; that is not come into the way of having issue by him, that is
not incorporated in the Christian Church, and in the true Church, but is yet in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
of Idolatry amongst the Gentiles, or in the Labyrinth of superstition amongst
the Papists, <hi>vae soli,</hi> woe unto that single man that is not maried unto Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of the Church; and <hi>vae sterili,</hi> woe unto them that are barren after this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
mariage,<note place="margin">Ier. 22. 30.</note> for that is a great curse in the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Scribe virum istum sterilem,
write this man childlesse,</hi> that implied all calamities upon him; And assoon as Christ
had laid that curse upon the Fig-tree,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Let no fruit grow upon thee for ever,</hi> presently the
whole tree withered; no fruit, no leafes neither, nor body left. To be incorporated in
the body of Christ Jesus, and bring forth no fruits worthy of that profession, is a wofull
state too. <hi>Vae soli,</hi> woe unto the Gentiles not maried unto Christ; and <hi>vae sterili,</hi> woe
unto inconsiderate Christians, that think not upon their calling, that conceive not by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93359:15"/>
Christ; but there is a <hi>vae praegnanti</hi> too,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 19.</note> wo unto them that are with child, and are never
delivered; that have good conceptions, religious dispositions, holy desires to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods truth, but for some collaterall respects dare not utter them, nor bring them
to their birth, to any effect. The purpose of his mariage to us, is to have children by us:
and this is his abundant and his present fecundity, that working now, by me in you,
in one instant he hath children in me, and grand children by me. He hath maried me,
<hi>in ustionem,</hi> and <hi>in prolem,</hi> against burning, and for children; but can he have any use of
me, <hi>in adjutorium,</hi> for a helper? Surely, if I be able to feed him, and clothe him, and
harbour him, (and Christ would not condemne men at the last day for not doing these,
if man could not doe them) I am able to help him too. Great persons can help him over
sea, convey the name of Christ where it hath not been preached yet; and they can help
him home again; restore his name, and his truth where superstition with violence hath
disseised him: And they can help him at home, defend his truth there against all machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to displant and dispossesse him. Great men can help him thus; and every man
can help him to a better place in his own heart, and his own actions, then he hath had
there; and to be so helped in me and helped by me, to have his glory thereby advanced,
Christ hath maried my soul: And he hath maried it <hi>in aeternum,</hi> for ever; which
is the third and last Circumstance in this spirituall, as it was in the secular mariage.</p>
                     <p>And here the <hi>aeternum</hi> is enlarged;<note place="margin">In aeternum.</note> in the secular mariage it was an eternity conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
onely in this life; but this eternity is not begun in this world, but from all eternity
in the Book of life, in Gods eternall Decree for my election, there Christ was maried
to my soul. Christ was never in minority, never under years; there was never any time
when he was not as ancient as the Ancient of Days, as old as his Father. But when my
soul was in a strange minority, infinite millions of millions of generations, before my
soul was a soul, did Christ mary my soul in his eternall Decree. So it was eternall, it had
no beginning. Neither doth he interrupt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>his by giving me any occasion of jealousie by
the way, but loves my soul as though there were no other soul, and would have done
and suffered all that he did for me alone, if there had been no name but mine in the
Book of life. And as he hath maried me to him, <hi>in aeternum,</hi> for ever, before all begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and <hi>in aeternum,</hi> for ever, without any interruptions, so I know, that <hi>whom he loves
he loves to the end,</hi> and that he hath given me, not a presumptuous impossibility, but a
modest infallibility, that no sin of mine shall divorce or separate me from him, for, that
which ends the secular mariage, ends not the spirituall: not death, for my death does
not take me from that husband, but that husband being by his Father preferr'd to
higher titles, and greater glory in another state, I doe but goe by death where he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a King, to have my part in that glory, and in those additions which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there. And this hath led us to our third and last mariage, our eternall mariage in
the triumphant Church.</p>
                     <p>And in this third mariage, the persons are,<note place="margin">3<hi>
                              <hi rend="sup">d</hi> Part.</hi> Persons. Apoc. 19. 7, 9. Esay 53. 4.</note> the Lamb and my soul; <hi>The mariage of
the Lamb is come, and blessed are they that are called to the mariage Supper of the Lamb,</hi> says
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaking of our state in the generall Resurrection. That Lamb that was brought
to <hi>the slaughter and opened not his mouth,</hi> and I who have opened my mouth and poured
out imprecations and curses upon men, and execrations and blasphemies against God
upon every occasion; That Lamb who <hi>was slain from the beginning,</hi> and was slain by
him who <hi>was a murderer from the beginning;</hi> That <hi>Lamb which took away the sins of the
world,</hi> and I who brought more sins into the world, then any sacrifice but the blood of
this Lamb could take away: This Lamb and I (these are the Persons) shall meet and
mary; there is the Action.</p>
                     <p>This is not a clandestine mariage,<note place="margin">Action.</note> not the private seal of Christ in the obsignation of
his Spirit; and yet such a clandestine mariage is a good mariage: Nor it is not such a
Parish mariage, as when Christ maried me to himself at my Baptisme, in a Church
here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and yet that mariage of a Christian soul to Christ in that Sacrament is a blessed
mariage: But this is a mariage in that great and glorious Congregation, where all my
fins shall be laid open to the eys of all the world, where all the blessed Virgins shall see all
my uncleannesse, and all the Martyrs see all my tergiversations, and all the Consessors see
all my double dealings in Gods cause; where <hi>Abraham</hi> shall see my faithlesnesse in
Gods promises; and <hi>Iob</hi> my impatience in Gods corrections; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> my hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart in distributing Gods blessings to the poore; and those Virgins, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93359:16"/>
Martyrs, and Confessors, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and all that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
shall look upon the Lamb and upon me, and upon one another, as though
they would all forbid those banes, and say to one another, Will this Lamb have any
thing to doe with this soule? and yet there and then this Lamb shall mary me, <hi>In aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
for ever, which is our last circumstance.</p>
                     <p>It is not well done to call it a circumstance,<note place="margin">In aeternum.</note> for the eternity is a great part of
the essence of that mariage. Consider then how poore and needy a thing, all the
riches of this world, how flat and tastlesse a thing, all the pleasures of this world,
how pallid, and faint, and dilute a thing, all the honours of this world are, when
the very Treasure, and Joy, and glory of heaven it self were unperfect, if it were not
eternall, and my mariage shall be too, <hi>In aeternum,</hi> for ever.</p>
                     <p>The Angels were not maried so; they incurr'd an irreparable Divorce from God,
and are separated for ever, and I shall be maried to him, <hi>in aeternum,</hi> for ever. The
Angels fell in love, when there was no object presented, before any thing was created;
when there was nothing but God and themselves, they fell in love with themselves,
and neglected God, and so fell <hi>in aeternum,</hi> for ever. I shall see all the beauty, and all
the glory of all the Saints of God, and love them all, and know that the Lamb loves
them too, without jealousie, on his part, or theirs, or mine, and so be maried <hi>in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
for ever, without interruption, or diminution, or change of affections. I shall
see the Sunne black as sackcloth of hair,<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 12.</note> and the Moon become as blood, and the
Starres fall as a Figge-tree casts her untimely Figges, and the heavens roll'd up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Scroll. I shall see a divorce between Princes and their Prerogatives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
nature and all her elements, between the spheres, and all their intelligences;
between matter it self, and all her forms, and my mariage shall be, <hi>in aeternum,</hi> for
ever. I shall see an end of faith, nothing to be beleeved that I doe not know; and an
end of hope, nothing to be wisht that I doe not enjoy, but no end of that love in
which I am maried to the Lamb for ever. Yea, I shall see an end of some of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Lamb himself; Christ himself shall be no longer a Mediator, an Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
an Advocate, and yet shall continue a Husband to my soul for ever. Where I shall
be rich enough without Joynture, for my Husband cannot die; and wise enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
experience, for no new thing can happen there; and healthy enough without Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
for no sicknesse can enter; and (which is by much the highest of all) safe enough
without grace, for no tentation that need particular grace, can attempt me. There,
where the Angels, which cannot die, could not live, this very body which cannot
choose but die, shall live, and live as long as that God of life that made it. Lighten
our darkness, we beseech thee, ô Lord, that in thy light we may see light: Illustrate
our understandings, kindle our affections, pour oyle to our zeale, that we may come
to the mariage of this Lamb, and that this Lamb may come quickly to this mariage:
And in the mean time bless these thy servants, with making this secular mariage a
type of the spirituall, and the spirituall an earnest of that eternall, which they and we,
by thy mercy, shall have in the Kingdome which thy Son our Saviour hath purchased
with the inestimable price of his incorruptible blood. To whom, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Here you shall see the <hi>Angell that comes from the East,</hi>

him large, and bountifull in imprinting that Seal,<note place="margin">vers. 4.</note> you shall see <hi>an hundred and forty four
thousand of the Tribes of the Children of Israel, and you shall see a great multitude, which
no man can number, of al Nations,<note place="margin">verse 9. &amp; 10.</note> and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stand before the
Throne, and before the Lamb, and cry out, and say, Salvation commeth of our God, that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
upon the Throne, and of the Lamb:</hi> and you shall see all the Angels stand round about
the Throne, and about the Elders,<note place="margin">verse 11.</note> and the four Beasts, all falling upon their faces, and
worshipping God, saying,<note place="margin">verse 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Amen, praise, and glory, and wisdome, and thanks, and honour,

and good Musique.</p>
                     <p>And lest you should lose any of the Joy of this conversation, of this society, by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
what they were, one of the Elders prevents you;<note place="margin">verse 13.</note> and (as the Text says) <hi>answers
you,</hi> saying, <hi>what are these that are araid in white?</hi> he answers <hi>by</hi> a question, which is
some what strange; but he answers <hi>before</hi> any question, which is more strange: but God
fees questions in our hearts before he hears them from our lips; and as soon as our hearts
conceive a desire to be informed, he gives a full and a present satisfaction; he answers
<hi>before we ask;</hi> but yet he answers <hi>by</hi> a question, that thereby he may give us occasion
of farther discourse, of farther questioning with him. There, this Elder shall tell thee,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93359:17"/>
that those are they which are come out of the Tribulations of this world,<note place="margin">verse 14.</note> and <hi>have made
their Robes white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> that therefore they are in the presence
of the Throne of God, that they serve him day and night in the Temple, that they
shall hunger no more, thrist no more, nor be offended with heat, or Sun; That is, as
many as are appointed to receive this Seal of the living God upon their foreheads,
though they be not actually delivered from all the incommodities of this life, yet nothing
in this life shall deprive them of the next. For as you see the Seal given in this Chapter,
and the promise of all these blessings annexed to it, so you see in this Text the reason
of all this, for the <hi>Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall govern them, and
shall leade them unto the lively fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all teares
from their eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which words, we shall consider for order and distincton,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> first the <hi>matter,</hi> and
then the <hi>form:</hi> by the <hi>matter</hi> we mean the purpose and <hi>intention</hi> of the Holy Ghost in
these words; and by the <hi>form,</hi> the declaring, the proving, the <hi>illustrating,</hi> and the height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that purpose of his. For the matter; we take this <hi>imprinting or the Seal</hi> of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God in the forehead of the Elect,<note place="margin">vers. 3.</note> and this <hi>washing in the blood</hi> of the Lamb,<note place="margin">verse 14.</note> to be
intended of the <hi>Sacrament of Baptisme:</hi> In that which we call the <hi>form,</hi> which is the <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating</hi>
of this, we shall first look upon the great benefits and blessings which these ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God so <hi>sealed,</hi> and so <hi>washed,</hi> are made partakers of; for those blessings
which are mentioned in the verses before, are rooted and enwrapped in this particular
of this Text, <hi>Quoniam, for;</hi> they are blessed; <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Lamb</hi> shall dòe this and this for
them; And then we shall consider <hi>what</hi> that is which this Lamb will doe for them; first,
<hi>Reget illos, He shall govern them,</hi> take them into his care, make them heirs of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
breed them in a <hi>visible Church:</hi> secondly, <hi>Deducet eos, He shall lead them to the
lively fountains of waters;</hi> give them outward and visible means of Sanctification; thirdly,
<hi>Absterget omnem lachtymam, He shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;</hi> even in <hi>this life</hi>
he shall settle and establish a heavenly joy in the faithfull appreliension of the joyes of
heaven here.</p>
                     <p>First then to speak of the <hi>matter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Materia.</note> that is of the purpose and intention of these words,
it is true, they are diversly understood: They have been understood of the state of the
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> which are now come to the possesion of their Crown in heaven, because they
are said to have <hi>made their long Robes white in the blood of the Lamb;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">verse 14.</note> And so S. <hi>August.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug.</note>
and S. <hi>Gregory</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gregor.</note> (when, by occasion of the subject which they were then in hand with, they
were full of the contemplation of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> and encouragements to that) doe seem
to understand these words, of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> But since it is not said, that they washed their
robes <hi>in their own blood,</hi> which is proper to <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but <hi>in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> which
is communicated <hi>to all</hi> that participate of the <hi>merit</hi> of Christ, the words seem larger
then so, and not to be restrained onely to <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Others have enlarged them farther
then so, beyond Martyrs: but yet limit them to the <hi>Triumphant Church;</hi> that because it
is said, that <hi>they are come out of great tribulation,</hi> and that <hi>they are in the presence of the
Throne of God,</hi> and that <hi>they shall hunger no more,</hi> they see no way of admitting these
perfections, in <hi>this life.</hi> But S. <hi>Paul</hi> saw a way, when he said of the <hi>Elect,</hi> even in <hi>this life,
God which is rich in mercy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 4.</note> Convivificavit, conresuscitavit, considere fecit, <hi>he hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us, he hath raised us, he hath made us fit together in the heavenly places, in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi>
That is, as he is our <hi>Head,</hi> and is there <hi>himself,</hi> and we with Christ Jesus, as we are
his <hi>Members;</hi> we are with him there too. In the same place where the Apostle says,
<hi>That we look for our Saviour from heaven,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> (there is our <hi>future,</hi> our expectation) he says
also, <hi>our conversation is in heaven,</hi> there is our <hi>present,</hi> our actuall possession. That is it
which S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug.</note> intends, <hi>Dilexisti me Domine plusquam te; Lord thou hast loved me
more then thou hast loved thy self:</hi> Not onely that thou gavest thy self for me, that thou
didst neglect thy self to consider me, but whereas thou hadst a glory with the <hi>Father,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world was made, thou didst admit a <hi>cloud,</hi> and a slumber upon that glory, and
staiedst for thy glory till thy <hi>death,</hi> yet thou givest <hi>us,</hi> (naturally inglorious, and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creatures) a reall possession of glory, and of inseparablenesse from thee, in <hi>this life.</hi>
This is that <hi>Copiosa redemptio,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 130. 7.</note> there is with the Lord <hi>plentifull redemption;</hi> though that
were <hi>Matura redemptio,</hi> a seasonable redemption, if it should meet me upon my <hi>death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,</hi>
and that the Angels then should receive my soul, to lay it in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, yet
this is my Saviours <hi>plentifull redemption,</hi> that my soul is in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome now
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93359:17"/>
whilest it is in this body, and that I am already in the presence of his Throne, now when
I am in your sight, and that <hi>I serve him already day and night in his Temple,</hi> now when I
meditate, or execute his Commission, in this service, in this particular Congregation.</p>
                     <p>Those words are not then necessarily restrained to <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they are not restrained to
the state of the <hi>Triumphant Church,</hi> they are spoken to all the <hi>Children of righteousnesse,</hi>
and of godlines; and <hi>godlinesse hath the promises</hi> of the <hi>life present, and that, that is to come.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note>
That which involves all these promises, that which is the kernell, and seed, and marrow of
all, the last clause of the text, <hi>God shall wipe all teares from their eyes,</hi> those words, that
clause, is <hi>thrice</hi> repeated intirely in the Scriptures: When it is spoken <hi>here,</hi> when it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the one and twentieth Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and at the fourth verse, in both
places, it is derived from the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">25. 8.</note> which is an <hi>Eacharisticall chapter,</hi> a
Chapter of thanksgiving for Gods deliverance of his children, even in <hi>this world,</hi>
from the afflictions, and tribulations thereof, and therefore this text belongs also to
<hi>this world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>imprinting</hi> then of <hi>the seale</hi> in <hi>the forehead,</hi> this <hi>washing</hi> of <hi>the robes</hi> in <hi>the bloud
of the Lambe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ambr.</note> S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> places conveniently to be accomplished in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>Baptisme:</hi> for this is <hi>Copiosissima Redemptio,</hi> this is the most plentiful redemption, that that
be applied to us, not onely at last in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor at my last step towards heaven, at my
<hi>death,</hi> nor in all the steps that I make in the course of my life, but in my <hi>first step</hi> into the
<hi>Church,</hi> nay before I can make any step, when I was carried in anothers armes thither, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the beginning of this life; and so do divers of the later Men, and of those whom we
call <hi>ours,</hi> understand all this, of <hi>baptisme;</hi> because if we consider this <hi>washing away of
teares,</hi> as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> says, <hi>young children</hi> doe most of all need this mercy of
God and this assistance of Man, because as soone as they come into this world
<hi>Plorantes, ac flentes, nihil aliud faciunt, quam deprecantur,</hi> they beg with teares something
at our hands, and therefore need this abstersion, this wiping. For though <hi>they</hi> cannot tell
<hi>us,</hi> what they aile, though (if we will enter into curiosities) <hi>we</hi> cannot tell <hi>them</hi> what they
aile, that is, we cannot tell them what properly, and exactly <hi>Originall sin is,</hi> yet they aile
something, which naturally disposes them, to <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>beg,</hi> that something might be
done, for the <hi>wiping away of teares from their eyes.</hi> And therefore though the other errors
of the <hi>Anabaptist</hi> be ancient, 1000. year old, yet the <hi>denying of baptisme</hi> to children, was
never heard of till within 100. years, and lesse. The <hi>Arrians,</hi> and the <hi>Donatists</hi> did <hi>rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size</hi>
those who were baptized by the true Christians, whom they counted <hi>Heretiques;</hi> but
yet they refused not to baptize children: The <hi>Pelegians</hi> denied <hi>originall sin</hi> in children;
but yet they <hi>baptized</hi> them. All Churches, <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Russian,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopique,</hi> howsoever
they differ in the <hi>body</hi> of the Church, yet they meet, they agree in the <hi>porch,</hi> in <hi>Limine
Ecclesiae,</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>baptisme,</hi> and acknowledge that it is communicable to <hi>all
children,</hi> and to <hi>all Men;</hi> from the child new borne to the decrepit old Man, from him
that is come out of one mothers wombe, to him that is going into another, into his
grave, <hi>Sicut nullus prohibendus à baptisme,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augustin.</note> 
                        <hi>it a nullus est qui non peccate moritur in baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,
As baptisme is to be denied to none, so neither is it to be denied, that all, that are rightly
baptized, are washed from sin.</hi> Let him that will contentiously say, that there are <hi>some</hi>
children, that take no profit by baptisme, shew me <hi>which</hi> is one of them, and <hi>qui testatur
de scientia, testetur de mode scientiae;</hi> If he say he knowes it, let him tell us <hi>how</hi> he knowes
that which the Church of God doth not know.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the second part; in which we consider first, this firstword,<note place="margin">2. Part.</note> 
                        <hi>quoniam,</hi> for,
which is <hi>verbum praegnans,</hi> a word that includes all those great blessings, which God hath
ordained for them, whom in his <hi>eternall decree,</hi> he hath prepared for this <hi>sealing</hi> and this
<hi>washing.</hi> Those blessings, which are immediately before the text, are, that in Gods <hi>purpose,</hi>
they are <hi>already come out of great tribulations,</hi> they have <hi>already</hi> received a <hi>whitenes</hi> by the
bloud of the Lambe, they are <hi>already in the presence of the threne of the Lambe,</hi> they have
already <hi>overcome all hunger, and thirst, and heat.</hi> Those particular blessings we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon; that requires rather a <hi>Comment</hi> upon the Chapter, then a <hi>Sermon</hi> upon the text.
But in this word of inference, <hi>for,</hi> we onely wil observe this: That though <hi>all the promises of
God in him, are Yea, and Amen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> certain, and infallible in <hi>themselves,</hi> though his <hi>Name,</hi> that
makes them be <hi>Amen, (Thus saith Amen, the faithfull and true witnesse</hi>) and therefore
there needs no better security,<note place="margin">Revel. 3. 14.</note> then <hi>his word,</hi> for all those blessings, yet God is pleased to
give that abundant satisfaction to Man, as that his <hi>reason</hi> shall have something to build
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93359:18"/>
upon, as well as his <hi>faith,</hi> he shall know <hi>why</hi> he should beleeve all these blessings to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them who are to have these Seales, and this washing. For God requires no such
<hi>faith,</hi> nay he accepts, nay he excuses no such faith, as <hi>beleeves without reason;</hi> beleeves he
knows not why. As faith witout <hi>fruit,</hi> witout <hi>works,</hi> is no faith; to faith without a <hi>roct,</hi>
without <hi>reason,</hi> is no faith, but an <hi>opinion.</hi> All those blessings by the <hi>Sacrament of Baptism,</hi>
&amp; all Gods other promises to his children, and all the mysteries of Christrian Religion, are
therefore beleeved by us, becuase they are grounded in the Scriptures of God; we
beleeve them for that reason; and then it is not a worke of my <hi>faith</hi> primarily, but
it is a worke of my <hi>reason,</hi> that assures me, that these are the Scriptures, that these
Scriptures are the word of God. I can answer other Mens reasons, that argue against
it, I can convince other men by reason, that my reasons are true: and therefore it is
a worke of reason, that I beleeve these to be Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>To prove a beginning of the world, I need not the Scriptures, <hi>reason</hi> will evict
it forceibly enough against all the world; but, when I come beyond all Philosophy,
that for <hi>Adams</hi> fault six thousand year agoe, I should be condemned now, because
that fault is naturally in me, I must find <hi>reason,</hi> before I beleeve this, and my reason
is, because I find it in the <hi>Scrpiture; Nascimur filii Irae,</hi> and therefore, <hi>nifi renatus,
we are borne children of wrath,</hi> and therefore must be borne againe. That a <hi>Messias</hi>
should come to deliver Mankind from this sinne, and all other fins, my reason is,
the <hi>Semen mulieris, the seed of the woman,</hi> for the promise, and the <hi>Ecce agnus Dei,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Lambe of God, for the performance. That he <hi>should</hi> come, I reft in that,
<hi>The seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpents head;</hi> And that he is come, I rest in this,
that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> shewed the <hi>Lambs of God that taketh away the sinnes of the world.</hi>
That this merit of his should be applied to <hi>certaine Men,</hi> my reason is in the <hi>Semini
two,</hi> Gods Covenant, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>to his seed;</hi> That we are of that number,
included in that Covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> my reason is, <hi>in spiritu adoptionis,</hi> the
spirit of adoption hath ingraffed us, inserted us into the same Covenant. When
my reason tells me that the <hi>Seale</hi> of that Covenant, <hi>Circumcision</hi> is gone, (I am
not circumcised, and therefore might doubt) my reason tells me too, that in
the Scriptures, there is a <hi>new Seals, Baptisme:</hi> when my reason tells mee, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that <hi>regeneration,</hi> I have <hi>degenerated</hi> againe, I have fallen from those graces
which I received in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> my reason leades mee againe to those places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where God hath established a <hi>Church for the remession</hi> and absolution of sinnes. If I
have been negligent of all these helpes, and now my reason beginnes to worke to my
prejudice, that I beginne to gather and <hi>heape up</hi> all those places of the <hi>Law,</hi>
and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Gospell,</hi> which threaten certaine condemnation unto such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as I find my selfe to bee, yet if my reason can see light at the <hi>Nolo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
peccatoris,</hi> at the <hi>Quandocunque resipiscct;</hi> That <hi>God would not the death of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinner,</hi> That no time is unseasonable for repentance: That scatters the <hi>clands
of witnesses</hi> againe; and to till my reason can tell me (which it can never doe)
that it hath found places in Scripture, of a measure, and <hi>finitenesse</hi> in <hi>God,</hi>
(that his <hi>mercy</hi> can goe no farther) and then of an <hi>infinitenesse</hi> in <hi>Man</hi> (that his finne
can goe beyond God) my reason will defend me from <hi>desperation;</hi> I meane the
reason, that is grounded upon the Scripture; still I shall find there, that <hi>Quia,</hi>
which <hi>David</hi> delighted in so much, as that he repears it almost <hi>thirty times,</hi> in one
Psalm,<note place="margin">136.</note> 
                        <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God leaves no way of satisfaction unperformed unto us; sometimes he workes
upon the phantasie of Man; as in those often <hi>

no judgment, he bids us hope for no mercy, except it have a <hi>Quia, a reason,</hi> a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,

is true, that we have a <hi>Sophistry,</hi> which as farre as concerns our owne destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                        <hi>Come now, and let us reason together;</hi> that which was in <hi>Iob,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 31. 13.</note> is a
bundantly in God, <hi>That he did not contemne the judgment of his servant, nor of his maid,
when they did contend with him. Nec decet Dei judicium quicquid habere affine tyrannidi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Basil.</note> we
may not think that here is any thing in God, like a <hi>Tyran;</hi> and it is a Tyrannicall proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to give no reason of his cruelties, so to give no assurance of his benefits; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God seales his promises with a <hi>Quia,</hi> a reason, an assurance.</p>
                     <p>Now much of the strength of the assurance, consists in the person,<note place="margin">Persona.</note> whose seale it is;
and therefore as Christ did, we aske next, <hi>Cujus inscriptio,</hi> whose Image, whose inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is upon his seale, who gives this assurance? And it is the <hi>Lambe that is in the midst of
the throne;</hi> If it werethe <hi>Lion,</hi> the Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> is able to perform his promises:
but there are more then Christ, out of this world, that beare the Lion; The <hi>devill</hi> is a
<hi>Lion</hi> too, that <hi>seeketh whom he may devoure:</hi> but he never seales with that <hi>Lambe,</hi>
with any impression of <hi>humility;</hi> to a <hi>Lambe</hi> he is never compared; in the likenesse of a
lambe, he is never noted to have appeared, in all the <hi>Legends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the Lambe, <hi>that is in the midst,</hi> thereby disposed to shed, and dispense his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
benefits on all sides; The Lambe is not immured in <hi>Rome,</hi> not coffined up in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
and tubbidge of old wals, nor thrust into a corner in <hi>Conventicles. The Lambe is in the
midst;</hi> &amp; he is in the midst <hi>of the throne;</hi> though al his great, &amp; glorious company be round
about him, <hi>one hundred and forty foure thousand Israelites, innumerable multitudes of all
Nations, Angels, and Elders,</hi> yet it is the Lambe, that is in the midst of them, and not they
that are about him, that sheds down these blessings upon us; And it is the Lambe, that is
there still, in the <hi>midst of the throne;</hi> not kneaded into an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> of <hi>wax,</hi> or <hi>wafer</hi> here,
not called down from heaven, to an <hi>Altar,</hi> by every Priests charme, to be a witnesse of
secrecy in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for every bloudy, and feditious enterprise, that they undertake;
It is <hi>Agnus qui est in medio Throni,</hi> the Lambe that is there, and shall be so, till he come
at last, as a <hi>Lion</hi> also, to devoure them, who have made false opinions of him to serve
their mischievous purposes here.</p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>person</hi> then, that gives the assurance, that all these blessings belong to them
who are ordained to be so <hi>sealed,</hi> and so <hi>washed;</hi> this is he that assures us, and approves to
us, that all this shall be, first, <hi>Quia reget,</hi> because he shall <hi>govern them,</hi> secondly, <hi>Quia
deducet,</hi> because he <hi>shall lead them to the fountaines of waters;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Quia absterget,</hi>
because <hi>he shall wipe all teares from their eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, <hi>he shall govern them;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Reget.</note> he shall establish a <hi>spiritual Kingdome</hi> for them in this world;
for to <hi>govern,</hi> which is the word, of the first translation, and to <hi>feed,</hi> which is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
is all one in Scriptures. <hi>Dominabitur gentium,</hi> he shall be Lord of the Gentiles; but
<hi>Rex Israelis,</hi> he shall governe his people Israel, <hi>as a King,</hi> by a certain, and a cleare <hi>law;</hi> So
that, as we shal have interest in the Covenant, as well as the <hi>Israclites,</hi> so we shal have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in that glorious acclamation of theirs; Unto <hi>what nation are their Gods come so neare
unto them, as the Lord our God, is come near unto us; what nation hath Laws, and ordinances so
righteous as we have?</hi> for in that <hi>Paul &amp; Barnabas</hi> express the heaviest indignation of God
upon the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>that God suffered the Gentiles to walke in their own ways;</hi> he shewed them
not his ways, he setled no church, no kingdome, amongst them, he did not govern them.

Except one of those <hi>Eight</hi> persons whom God preserved in <hi>the Arke,</hi> were here to tell
us, the unexpressible comfort, that he conceived in his safety, when he saw that flood
wash away Princes from their thrones, misers from their bagges, lovers from their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements,
Courtiers from their wardrobes, no man is able to expresse that true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which a Christian is to take, even in this, That God hath taken him into his <hi>Church,</hi>
and not left him in that desperate, and irremediable inundation of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>paganisace</hi>
that overflowes all the world beside. For beloved, who can expresse, who can conceive
that strange confusion, which shall overtake, and oppresse those infinite multitudes of
Soules, which <hi>shall be changed</hi> at the last day, and shall meet Christ Jesus in the clouds,
and shall receive an irrevocable judgment, of everlasting condemnation, dut of his
mouth, whose name they never heard of <hi>before,</hi> that must be condemned by a Judge, of
whom they knew nothing <hi>before,</hi> and who never had <hi>before</hi> any apprehension of torments
of <hi>Hell,</hi> till by that lamentable experience they began to learn it? What blessed meanes
of preparation against that fearfull day doth he afford us, even in this, that he <hi>governes
us</hi> by his law, delivered in his Church.</p>
                     <p>The first thing, that the <hi>housholder in the parable,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 33.</note> is noted to have done for his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
was, <hi>Sepe circumdedit, he hedged it in.</hi> That, God hath done for us, in making us <hi>his</hi>
Church;<note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 8.</note> he hath inlaid us, he hath hedged us in. <hi>But he that breaketh the hedge, a Serpent
shall bite him,</hi> he that breaketh this hedge, the peace of the Church, by his <hi>Schisme,</hi> the <hi>old
Serpent</hi> hath bitten, and poysoned him, and shall bite worse hereafter: and if God, having
thus severed us, and hedged us in, have expected <hi>grapes,</hi> and we bring none, though we
breake no hedge here amongst our selves, that is, no <hi>Papist</hi> breaks in upon us, no <hi>Separatist</hi>
breakes out from us, we enjoy security enough, yet even for our own barrennes, <hi>Godwill
take away the hedge,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay 5. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>and it shall be eaten up, he will breake the wall, and it shall be troden down.</hi>
Surely, says the Prohet there, <hi>The Vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel,</hi> and
the <hi>Men of Indah are his pleasant plans:</hi> Surely we are the <hi>Church,</hi> which God hath hedged
in; but yet if we answer not his expectation, certainly the confusion of the Gentiles, at
the last day, (when they shal say to themselves of Christ <hi>Nescivi te, dost thou condemne us,
and we know thee not?</hi>) shall not be so great, as out confusion shall be, when we shall hear
Christ say to us, whom he bred in his Church, <hi>Nesiciovos, I know not whence you are.</hi> Even
this, that the ill use of this mercy of having been bred in his Church, shall aggravate our
condemnation then, shewes the great benefit, which we may receive now by this <hi>Quod
regit nos,</hi> that he takes care of us in his Church; for how many in the world would have
lived ten times more <hi>christianly</hi> then we do, if they had but halfe that knowledge of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which we have?</p>
                     <p>When he hath then brought us into his kingdome,<note place="margin">Deducet.</note> that we are his <hi>subjects,</hi> (for all the
heathen are in the condition of <hi>slaves</hi>) he brings us nearer, into his <hi>service;</hi> he gives us out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
distinctions, liveries, badges, names, <hi>visible markes in Baptisme:</hi> yea he incorporates
us more inseparably to himself, then that which they imagine to be done in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> where their <hi>Canonists,</hi> say; that a <hi>Cardinall</hi> is to incorporated in the <hi>Pope,</hi> he is so
made one flesh, and bloud with him, as that he may not let bloud without his leave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he bleeds not his own, but the <hi>Popes</hi> bloud: But of us it is true, that by this <hi>Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi>
we are so incorporated into Christ, that in all our afflictions after we fulfill the sufferings
of Christ in our flesh, and in all afflictions, which we lay upon any of our Christian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
our consciences hear Christ crying to us, <hi>Quid me persequerts?</hi> why persecutest thou
me? Christs body is wounded <hi>in us,</hi> when we suffer, Christs body is wounded <hi>by us,</hi> when
we violate the peace of the Church, or offend the particular members thereof.</p>
                     <p>First then <hi>deducet,</hi> he <hi>shall lead them,</hi> it is not he shall <hi>force them,</hi> he shall <hi>thrust them,</hi> he

which come to <hi>Christianity,</hi> from <hi>Iudaisme,</hi> or <hi>Gentisme,</hi> when they are of <hi>years of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,</hi>
he shall lead them by instruction, by <hi>Catechisme,</hi> by <hi>preaching</hi> of his word, before

so such a Man, may perish eternally in <hi>baptisme,</hi> if he take it, for satisfaction of the <hi>State,</hi> or
any other by respect, to which that Sacrament is not ordained, in the word of God. He

now in the Scriptures nothing is more ordianry, then by the name of <hi>waters</hi> to designe

                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 19.</note> that he
would make it a desolate: City, and bring the deep upon it, and <hi>great waters should co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

we puddle it with impertinent <hi>questions</hi> in disputation, however we soule it with our

                     <p>Nay not onely, this <hi>fountaine</hi> of water, but the greatest water of all, the <hi>flood</hi> it selfe,
Saint <hi>Basil</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Psal. 29. 10.</note> for upon that place, The <hi>Lord sitseth upon the

his sinnes) I thought I would confesse against my selfe my wickednesse, unto

him, peccato non appropinquabunt;</hi> says he, <hi>originall sinne</hi> shall not come neare him, that
is truly <hi>baptized;</hi> nay all the <hi>actuall sinnes</hi> in his future life, shall be drowned in this bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
as often, as he doth religiously, and repentantly consider, that in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> when
the merit of Christ was communicated to him, he received an <hi>Antidote</hi> against all poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
against all sinne, if he applied them together, sinne and the merit of Christ; for so
also he says, of that place, God will subdue all our iniquities, and <hi>cast our sinnes into the
bottome of the Sea, Hoc est, in mare Baptismi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mic. 7. 19.</note> says <hi>Basil,</hi> into the <hi>Sea of Baptisme;</hi> There

                     <p>These fountaines of waters then in the text, are the waters of baptisime: and if we
should take them also, in that sense, that waters signifie <hi>tribulations,</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> it
is true too, that in <hi>baptisme,</hi> (that is, in the profession of Christ,) we are delivered over

with thee, disposing all things, at the Creation, As then God seemes to have been
eternally delighted, with this eternall generation, (with persons that had ever a relation
to one another, <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Sonne</hi>) so when he came to the Creation of this lower
world, he came presently to those three relations, of which the whole frame of this
world consists; of which, (because the principall foundation, and preservation of all
States that are to continue, is <hi>power</hi>) the first relation was between <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note>
when God said to Man, <hi>Subjecite &amp; dominamini,</hi> subdue and govern all Creatures; The
second relation was between <hi>husband and wife,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. 23.</note> when <hi>Adam</hi> said, <hi>This now is house of my
bone, and flesh of my flesh;</hi> And the third relation was between <hi>parents</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> when
<hi>Eve</hi> said, that she <hi>had obtained</hi> a Man <hi>by the</hi> Lord, that by the plentifull favour of God,<note place="margin">4. 1.</note>
she had conceived and borne a sonne: from that time, to the dissolution of that frame,
from that beginning to the end of the world, these three relations, of <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
Mans</hi> and <hi>Wife, Father</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> have been, and ever shall be the materialls,
and the elements of all society, of families, and of Cities, and of Kingdomes. And
therefore it is a large, and a subtill philosophy which S. <hi>Paul</hi> professes in this place, to
shew all the qualities, and properties of these several <hi>Elements,</hi> that is, all the duties
of these severall callings; but in this text, he handles onely the mutuall duties of the
second couple, <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> and in that consideration, shall we determine this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
because a great part of that concernes the education of Children, (which especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
occasions our meeting now.)</p>
                     <p>The generall duty, that goes through all these three relations,<note place="margin">v. 12.</note> is expressed, <hi>Subditi
estate invicevs, Submit your selves to one another, in the feare of God;</hi> for God hath given
no Master such imperiousnesse, no husband such a superiority, no father such a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainty,
but that there lies a burden upon them too, to consider with a compassionate
sensiblenesse, the grievances, that oppresse the other part, which is coupled to them.
For if the servant, the wife, the sonne be oppressed, worne out, annihilated, there is no
such thing left as a Master, or a husband, or a father; They depend upon one another,
and therefore he that hath not care of his fellow, destroys himselfe.</p>
                     <p>The wife is to submit herselfe; and so is the husband too: They have a burden both,
There is a greater subjection lies upon her, then upon the <hi>Man,</hi> in respect of her trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
towards her husband at first: Eyen before there was any Man in the world, to
sollicite, or tempt her <hi>chastity,</hi> she could sinde another way to be salfe and treacherous
to her husband: both the husband, and the wife offended against God, but the husband
offended not towards his wife, but rather eate the Apple,<note place="margin">Hier.</note> 
                        <hi>Ne contristaretur delicias suas,</hi>
as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> assignes the cause, left by refusing to cate, when she had done so, he
should deject her into a desperate sense of her sinne. And for this fault of hers, her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was so much aggravated, <hi>Thy desire shall be subject to thy husband,</hi> and <hi>he shall rule
over thee,</hi> But if she had not committed that fault, yet there would have been a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
subjection between them; as there is even in <hi>Nature,</hi> between both the other cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
for if <hi>Man</hi> had continued in innocency, yet it is most probably thought, that as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93359:21"/>
there would certainly have been <hi>Mariage,</hi> and so <hi>children,</hi> so also there would have
been <hi>Magistracy,</hi> and <hi>propriety,</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> and so a mutuall submitting, a mutuall
assisting of one another, in all these three relations.</p>
                     <p>Now, that submitting, of which the Apostle speakes of here; is a submitting to one
another, <hi>a bearing</hi> of <hi>one anothers burthens:</hi> what this submission is on the wives part,
is expressed in the two former verses; And I forbeare that, because husbands at home,
are likely enough to remember them of it; but in the duty, in the submitting of the
husband, we shall consider first, what that submitting is, and that is <hi>love, Husbands
love your wives;</hi> Even the love of the husband to the wife, is a burthen, a submitting,
a descent; and secondly, the patterne and example of this love, <hi>Even as</hi> Christ <hi>loved
his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which second part, as sometimes the accessory is greater then the principall,
the <hi>Symptome,</hi> the accident, is greater then the <hi>disease,</hi> so that from which the comparison
is drawn in this place, is greater then that which is illustrated by it; the love of Christ
to his Church requires more consideration, then the love of the husband to the wife;
and therefore it will become us to spend most of our thoughts upon that; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
in that, <hi>Quod factum,</hi> and <hi>Quis sinis;</hi> what Christ did for his Church; and that
was, a bounty, which could not be exceeded, <hi>seipsum tradidit,</hi> he gave, he delivered
himselfe for it; And then, secondly, what he intended that should worke; and that was,
first, that he might make it to himselfe <hi>a glorious Church,</hi> and <hi>without spot</hi> and <hi>wrinkle,</hi>
in the <hi>Triumphant</hi> state of the Church at last; And then, that whilst it continues in a
<hi>Militant</hi> state upon Earth, it might have preparations to that glory, by being <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
and <hi>cleansed by the washing of water, through his Word;</hi> he provides the Church
meanes of sanctification here, by his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi>

                     <p>First then <hi>De Amoremaritali,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Amor.</note> of this contracting a Mans love to the person of a wife,

<hi>chastity,</hi> he expressed it by saying that he <hi>waried young;</hi> that as soon as his years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
him, <hi>formavit animum maritalem, nihil de concessu atati voluptatibus admittens:</hi>
he was content to be a husband, and accepted not that freedome of pleasure, which his

Behold a miracle, such a young Man, limiting his affections, in a wife. At
first the heates and lusts of youth overflow all, as the waters overflowed all at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and when they did so, the <hi>Earth</hi> was not onely <hi>barren,</hi> (there were no Creatures,
no herbs produced in <hi>that</hi>) but even the <hi>waters</hi> themselves, that did overflow all, were
barren too; there were no fishes, no fowls produced out of that; as long as a Mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are scattered, there is nothing but accursed barrennesse; but when God says,
and is heard,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 9.</note> and obeyed in it, <hi>Let the waters be gathered into one place,</hi> let all thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be setled upon one wife, then the earth and the waters became fruitfull, then God
gives us a type, and figure of the eternity of the <hi>joyes</hi> of heaven, in the succession, and
propagation of children here upon the earth. It is true, this contracting of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is a <hi>burden,</hi> it is a submitting of our selves; All States that made Lawes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>rewards</hi> for <hi>maried Men,</hi> conceived it so; that naturally they would be loth to doe
it. God maried his first couple, as soone as he made them; he dignified the state of
Mariage, by so many <hi>Allegories,</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> to which he compares the uniting of Christ
to his Church, and the uniting of our soules to Christ, and by directing the first Miracle
of Christ, to be done at a Mariage. Many things must concurre to the dignifying of
<hi>Mariage,</hi> because in our corrupt nature, the apprehension is generall, that it is burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and a submitting, and a descending thing, to mary. And therefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
argues truly out of these words,<note place="margin">Hier.</note> 
                        <hi>Husbands love your Wifes, Audiant Episcopi, audiant

subject to their Subjects. For by being a husband, I become subject, to that sex
which is naturally subject to Man, though this subjection be no more in this place, but
to <hi>love</hi> that one woman.</p>
                     <p>Love then, when it is limited by a law, is a subjection, but it is a subjection comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

hunger, and wearinesse, and sadnesse, and death, actually in his own person;
but so, he contracted no <hi>sin</hi> in himselfe, nor encouraged us to proceed in sin. Christ
was <hi>Salvator corporis,</hi> A Saviour of his body, of the Church,<note place="margin">v. 23.</note> to which he maried
himselfe, but it is a tyranny, and a devastation of the body, to whom we mary our
selves, if we love them so much, as that we love their <hi>Sin</hi> too, suffer them to goe on
in that, or if we love them so little, as to make their sin our way to profit, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by prostituting them, and abandoning them to the solicitation of others. still
we must love them so, as that this love be a subjection; not a neglecting, to let them
doe, what they will, nor a <hi>tyrannizing,</hi> to make them doe what we will.</p>
                     <p>You must love them then, first, <hi>Quia vestrae,</hi> because they are yours; As we said at
first, God loves <hi>Couples;</hi> He suffers not our body to be alone,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 20.</note> nor our soule alone,
but he maries them together; when that's done, to remedy the <hi>vae soli,</hi> left this
Man should be alone, he maries him to a help meet for him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(that is, if fornication cannot be avoided otherwise) Every Man is to have his wife,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 1.</note> and
every woman her own husband. When the love comes to exceed these bounds, that
it departs <hi>à vestris,</hi> from a Mans <hi>own</hi> wife, and settles upon another, though he may
think he discharges himselfe of some of his subjection which he was in before, yet he
becomes much more subject, subject to houshold and forain <hi>Iealousies,</hi> subject to ill
grounded <hi>quarrels,</hi> subject to blasphemous protestations, to treacherous misuse of a
confident friend, to ignoble an unworthy disguises, to base <hi>satisfactions;</hi> subject,
lastly, either to a clamorous <hi>Conscience,</hi> or that which is worse slavery, to a sear'd and

Christ, and thou shalt follow me the better. But there is no selling, nor giving, nor
lending, nor borrowing of wives; we must love them <hi>Quia nostrae,</hi> because they are
ours; and if that be not a ty, and obligation strong enough, that they are <hi>Nostrae,</hi> ours,

hath given us, and <hi>Quia uxores,</hi> because they are our wives. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> does not bid
us love them here, <hi>Quanquam uxores,</hi> but <hi>Quia,</hi> not <hi>though</hi> they be, but <hi>because</hi> they are
our wives; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> never thought of that indisposition, of that disaffection, of that
impotency, that a Man should come to hate her, whom he could love well enough,
<hi>but that she is his wife.</hi> Were it not a strange distemper, if upon consideration of my
soule, finding it to have some seeds of good dispositions in it, some compassion of the
miseries of others, some inclination of the glory of God, some possibility, some interest
in the kingdome of heaven, I should say of this soule, that I would fast, and pray, and
give, and suffer any thing for the salvation of this Soule if it were not mine own soule, if
it were any bodies else, and now abandon it to eternall destruction, because it is mine
own? If no Man have felt this barbarous inhumanity towards his owne soul, I pray
God no man have felt it towards his own wife neither, That he loves her the lesse, for
being his own wife. For we must love them, not <hi>Quanquam,</hi> says Saint <hi>Paul, though</hi>
she be so; That was a Caution, which the Apostle never thought he needed, but <hi>Quia,</hi>
because in the sight of God, and all the Triumphant Church, we have bound our selves,

he love it; Husbands therefore are to love wives <hi>Ad Sobolem,</hi> as the Mothers of their

we are commanded to be holy, and pure, <hi>as our Father is holy, and pure;</hi> but that's a

from Christ, <hi>Discite à me,</hi> learn of me; there is no more looked for, but that
we should still be Scholars, and learners how to <hi>love;</hi> we can never love so much as

not apt to leave her unprovided of apparell, and decent ornaments, for I have allow'd
her such <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as conduce to edification; not apt to pinch her in her diet; she

Herein consists the substance of the Comparison, <hi>Husbands love your wives, as Christ
did his Church:</hi> that is, expresse your loves in a gentle behaviour towards them, and
in a carefull providence of Conveniencies for them. The comparison goes no farther,

not have given him, if he had not given himselfe, <hi>Pilate</hi> could not give him, <hi>Iudas</hi>
could not give him; nay, if we could consider severall wils in the severall Persons
of the Trinity, we might be bold to say, <hi>That the Father could not have given him,
if he had not given himselfe.</hi> We consider the unexpressible mercy of the <hi>Father,</hi> in
that he would accept any satisfaction at all for all our Sinnes. We consider the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
working of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that brings this satisfaction and our soules to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
for without that, without the application of the Holy Ghost, we are as far
from Christ's love now, as we were from the Father's before Christ suffered. But the
unexpressible and unconceiveable love of Christ is in this, that there was in him a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse,
a propensnesse, a forwardnesse to give himselfe to make this great peace and
reconciliation, between God and Man; It was himselfe that gave himselfe; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
enclined him, nothing wrought upon him, but his own goodnesse.</p>
                     <p>It was then his Deed; and it was his gift; it was his <hi>Deed of gift:</hi> and it hath all
the formalities and circumstances that belong to that; for here is a <hi>seale</hi> in his blood;
and here is a <hi>delivering,</hi> pregnantly implied in this word, which is not onely <hi>Dedit,</hi>

he gave, but <hi>Tradidit,</hi> he delivered. First, <hi>Dedit,</hi> he gave himselfe for us to his
Father, in that eternall Decree, by which he was <hi>Agnus occisus ab origine mundi,</hi> The
Lamb slain from the beginning of the world. And then <hi>Tradidit,</hi> he delivered pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of himselfe to <hi>Death,</hi> and to all humane infirmities, when he took our <hi>Nature</hi>
upon him, and became one of us. Yea this word implies a further operativenesse, and
working upon himself, then all this; for the word which the <hi>Apostle</hi> uses here, for
Christ giving of himselfe, is the same word, which the <hi>Evangelists</hi> use still, for <hi>Iudas</hi>
betraying of him: so that Christ did not onely <hi>give</hi> himselfe to the will of the Father,

in the eternall Decree; nor onely deliver himselfe to the power of death in his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

us, that make finne our sport, and so make the Crucifying of the Lord of life a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
                     <p>It was a <hi>gift</hi> then, free, and absolute; Hee keeps us not in fear of <hi>Resumption;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Seipsum.</note> of

a permanent gift; <hi>Dedit,</hi> and <hi>Dedit seipsum;</hi> It was he that did it; That which he did was
to give; and that which he gave, was himselfe. Now since the Holy Ghost, that is

was himselfe. Let us abstain from all such curiosities, which are all but forc'd dishes of
hot brains, and not sound meat, that is, from all perverse wranglings, whether <hi>God,</hi>
or <hi>Man</hi> redeemed us; and then, whether this God, and Man suffered in <hi>soule,</hi> or in <hi>body;</hi>
and then whether this person, consisting of soule and body, redeemed us, by his <hi>action,</hi>
or by his <hi>passion</hi> onely; for as there are spirituall <hi>wickednesses,</hi> so there are spirituall
<hi>wantonnesses,</hi> and unlawfull and dangerous dallyings with mysteries of Divinity. Money
that is changed into small pieces is easily lost; gold that is beat out into leaf-gold, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be coyned, nor made currant money: we know the Heathens lost the true God, in
a thrust; they made so many false gods, of every particular quality, and attribute of
God, that they scattered him, and evacuated him, to an utter vanishing; so doth true,
and sound, and nourishing Divinity vanish away, in those impertinent Questions. All
that the wit of Man adds to the Word of God, is all <hi>quicksilver,</hi> and it evaporates
easily. Beloved, <hi>Custodi Depositum,</hi> sayes the Apostle, keep that which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to thee; for that God himselfe cals thy <hi>Talent;</hi> it hath weight and substance
in it. Depart not from thy <hi>old gold;</hi> leave not thy <hi>Catechism-divinity,</hi> for all the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divinity</hi>
in the world; when we have all, what would we have more? if we know that
Christ hath given himselfe for us, that we are redeemed, and not redeemed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
things but with the precious blood of Christ Jesus, we care for no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
but that, <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ crucified</hi> for us; for this is another, and a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and profitable giving of himselfe <hi>for</hi> thee, when he gives himselfe to thee, that
is, when he gives thee a sense, and apprehension, and application of the gift, to thy self,
that Christ hath given himselfe, to thy selfe.</p>
                     <p>We are come now to his exchange;<note place="margin">Pro Ecclesia.</note> what Christ had for himselfe when he gave
himselfe; And he had <hi>a Church.</hi> So this Apostle, which in this place, writes to the
<hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> when he preached personally to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> he told them so too, <hi>The Church</hi>
is that <hi>Quam acquisivit sanguine suo,</hi> which he purchased with his bloud. Here Christ
bought a Church, but I would there were no worse Simony then this. Christ received
no profit from the Church, and yet he gave himselfe for it; and he stayes with it to
the end of the world; Here is no such <hi>Non-residency,</hi> as that the Church is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served:
other men give enough for their Church, but they withraw themselves, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93359:23"/>
necessary provision; And if we consider this Church that Christ bought, and paid
so dearly for, it was rather an <hi>Hospitall,</hi> then a <hi>Church:</hi> A place where the <hi>blind</hi>
might recover sight; that is, Men borne in <hi>Paganisme,</hi> or <hi>Superstition,</hi> might see
the true God, truly worshipped: and where the <hi>lame</hi> might be established; that is,
those that <hi>Halted between two Religions,</hi> might be <hi>rectified</hi> in the truth: where the <hi>Deaf</hi>
might receive so quicke a hearing, as that they might discerne <hi>Musique</hi> in his <hi>Thunder,</hi> in
all his fearefull threatnings; that is, mercy in his Judgments, which are still accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with conditions of repentance; and they might finde <hi>Thunder,</hi> in his <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique,</hi>
in all his <hi>promises;</hi> that is, threatnings of Judgements, in our misuse of his
mercies. Where the hereditary <hi>Leper,</hi> the new borne Child, into whose marrow, his
fathers transgression, cleaves in <hi>originall sinne,</hi> and he that hath enwrapped <hi>Implicatos
morbos,</hi> one disease in another, in <hi>Actuall sinnes,</hi> might not onely come, if he would
but be intreated to come, yea <hi>compelled</hi> to come, as it is expressed in the Gospell,
when the Master of the feast sends into the streets, and to the hedges to <hi>compell blind
and lame to come in to his feast.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 14. 21.</note> A fountaine breaks out in the wildernesse, but that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
cares not, whether any Man come to fetch water, or no; A fresh, and fit gale
blowes upon the Sea, but it cares not whether the Mariners hoise saile or no; A rose
blowes in your garden, but it calls you not to smell to it. Christ Jesus hath done all
this abundantly; he hath bought an <hi>Hospitall,</hi> he hath stored it with the true balme
of <hi>Palestine,</hi> with his bloud, which he shed there, and he calls upon you all to come
for it, <hi>Hoe every one that thirsteth; you that have no money, come buy Wine, and Milke
without money:</hi> eate that which is good, and let your soules delight in fatnesse,<note place="margin">Esay 55. 1.</note> and I
will make an everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure mercies of <hi>David.</hi> This
<hi>Hospitall,</hi> this way, and meanes to cure spirituall diseases, was all that Christ had for
himselfe: but he improved it, he makes it a <hi>Church,</hi> and a glorious Church:
which is our last consideration, <hi>Quis sinis,</hi> to what end, he bestowed all
this cost.</p>
                     <p>His end was,<note place="margin">Quis finis.</note> that <hi>he might make it to himselfe a glorious Church, not having spot, or
wrinkle;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augstin. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trac. l. 1. c. 7.</note> but that end, must be in the end of all; here it cannot be: <hi>Cum tot a dicat
ecclesia, quamdiu hîc est, Dimitte debita nostra, non utique hîc est sine macula et ruga,</hi> Since
as yet the whole Church says, <hi>forgive us our Trespasses,</hi> the Church as yet is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
spots or wrinkles. The <hi>wrinkles</hi> are the Testimonies of our <hi>age;</hi> that is, our
sinne derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> and the <hi>spots</hi> are the sinnes, which we contract our selves;
and of these <hi>spots,</hi> and <hi>wrinkles,</hi> we cannot be delivered in this world. And therefore
the Apostle says here, that Christ hath bestowed all this cost on this purchase, <hi>ut sisteret
sibi Ecclesiam,</hi> that he might setle such a glorious, and pure Church to himselfe: first,
<hi>ut sisteret,</hi> that he might setle it; which can onely be done in <hi>heaven;</hi> for here in
Earth, the Church will always have <hi>earthquakes. Opartet haereses esse;</hi> stormes, and
schismes must necessarily be; the Church is in a warfare, the Church is in a pilgrimage,
and therefore here is no setling. And then he doth it, <hi>ut sisteret sibi,</hi> to setle it <hi>to
himselfe;</hi> for, in the tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Church was in some sort setled, things
were carried quietly enough; for no Man durst complaine; but the Church was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all upon the <hi>Vicar,</hi> and none upon the <hi>Parson:</hi> the glory of the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> had
eclipsed, and extinguished the glory of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> In other places we have seen the
Church setled, so as that no man hath done or spoken any thing against the <hi>government</hi>
thereof; but, this may have been a setling by strong hand, by severed <hi>discipline,</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Lawes; we see where Princes have changed the Religion, the Church may be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon
the <hi>Prince,</hi> or setled upon the <hi>Prelates,</hi> that is, be serviceable to them, and be
ready to promote and further any purpose of theirs, and all this while, not be setled
upon <hi>Christ:</hi> this purpose, <hi>ut sisteret sibi,</hi> to setle such a glorious Church, without
spot, or wrinkle, holy to <hi>himselfe,</hi> is reserved for the Triumphant time when she shall
be in possession of that beauty, which Christ foresaw in her, long before when he said,

the <hi>eternall decree</hi> between the Father, and him, that he should really pay this price,

                        </gap> Here was a long lease, here were
many lives; the lives of all the men in the world, to be served before him; But it is
not altogether so; for he gave himselfe, that he might settle such a Church <hi>then,</hi> a
glorious, and a pure Church: but all this while, the Church is building in heaven, by
continuall accesse of holy <hi>Soules,</hi> which come thither, and all the way he workes to
that end, <hi>He sanctifies it, and cleanses it,</hi> by the <hi>washing of water, through the word,</hi>
as we find in our Text.</p>
                     <p>He therefore stays not so long, for our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> but that we have meanes
of being sanctified here; Christ stays not so long for his glory, but that he hath here
a <hi>glorious Gospell,</hi> his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>mysterious Sacraments</hi> here. Here then is the <hi>writing,</hi>
and the <hi>Seale,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and he hath given power, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to his Ministers to deliver both writing, and Seale, the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Baptisme</hi>
to his children. This Sacrament of Baptisme is the first; It is the Sacrament of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choation,</hi>
of <hi>Initiation;</hi> The Sacrament of the <hi>Supper,</hi> is not given but to them, who
are instructed and presum'd to understand all Christian duties, and therefore the <hi>Word,</hi>
(if we understand the Word, for the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Word) may seeme more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
at the administration of this Sacrament, then at the other. Some such thing seems
to be intimated in the institution of the Sacraments. In the institution of the Supper, it
is onely said,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26.</note>

is more solemnity,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 19.</note> more circumstance; for first, it was instituted after Christs <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi>
and then Christ proceeds to it,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18.</note> with that majesticall preamble, <hi>All power

                        </hi> and therefore, upon that title he gives power
to his Apostles, to joine heaven and earth by <hi>preaching,</hi> and by <hi>baptisme:</hi> but here

but because it is <hi>beleeved;</hi> and That, <hi>Beleese, faith,</hi> belongs not at all to the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the child, but to the disposition of the rest; A <hi>Sermon</hi> is usefull for
the congregation, not necessary for the <hi>child,</hi> and the accomplishment of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                     <p>From hence then arises a convenience, little lesse, then necessary, (in a kind) that
this administration of the Sacrament be accompanied with <hi>preaching;</hi> but yet they
that would evict an <hi>absolute necessity</hi> of it, out of these words, force them too much,
for here the direct meaning of the Apostle is, That the Church is <hi>cleansed by water,
through the word,</hi> when the promises of God expressed in his word, are sealed to us
by this Sacrament of Baptisme: for so <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> answers himselfe in that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
which he makes to himselfe, <hi>Cum per Baptis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

though it be administred, without the <hi>word,</hi> that is, without the <hi>word preached,</hi> yet
it is never without the word, because the whole Sacrament, and the power thereof
is rooted in the word, in the <hi>Gospell.</hi> And therefore since this <hi>Sacrament</hi> belongs
to the Church, as it is said here (that Christ doth <hi>cleanse his Church by Baptisme)</hi>
as it is argued with a strong probability, That because the Apostles did <hi>baptize</hi> whole
families, therefore they did baptize some <hi>children,</hi> so we argue with an invincible
certainty, that because this Sacrament belongs generally to the Church as the <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory</hi>
Sacrament, it belongs to <hi>children,</hi> who are a part, and for the most part, the
most innocent part of the Church.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, As all those Virgins which were beautifull, were brought into
<hi>Susan, Ad domum mulierum,</hi> to be anointed,<note place="margin">Esther 2.</note> and persumed, and prepared there for
<hi>Assuerus</hi> delight, and pleasure, though <hi>Assuerus</hi> tooke not delight, and pleasure in them
<hi>all,</hi> so we admit <hi>all</hi> those children which are within the Covenant made by God,
to the <hi>elect,</hi> and their seed, <hi>In domum Sanctorum,</hi> into the <hi>houshold</hi> of the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
into the communion of Saints: whom he chooseth for his <hi>Mariage day,</hi> that is,
for that Church which he will settle upon himselfe in heaven, we know not; but
we know that he hath not promised, to take any into that glory, but those upon
whom he hath first shed these fainter beames of glory, and <hi>sanctification,</hi> exhibited
in this Sacrament: Neither hath he threatned to exclude any but for <hi>sinne</hi> after.
And therefore when this blessed child derived from faithfull <hi>parents,</hi> and presented
by <hi>sureties</hi> within the obedience of the Church, shall have been <hi>so cleansed,</hi> by <hi>the
washing of water, through the word,</hi> it is presently sealed to the possession of that

Now, this was a sentence, a Condemnation so pregnant, so full of so many
heavy afflictions, as that he, who by the law was made intestable, was all these ways
intestable: First, he was able to make no <hi>Testament</hi> of his owne, he had lost all his
interest in his owne estate, and in his owne will; Secondly, he could receive no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by any testament of any other Man, he had lost all the effects of the love, and good
disposition of other Men to him; Thirdly, he was <hi>Intestable,</hi> so, as that he could
not testifie, he should not be beleeved in the behalfe of another; and lastly the
testimony of another could doe him no good, no Man could be admitted to speake
for him. After that first, and heavy curse of Almighty God upon Man, <hi>Morte mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieris,</hi>
If thou eate, thou shalt die, and die twice, thou shall die a <hi>bodily,</hi> thou shalt
die a <hi>spirituall</hi> death (a punishment which no sentence of any law, or law-maker could
ever equall, to deterre Men from offending, by threatning to take away their lives
twice, and by inflicting a spirituall death eternally upon the Soule,) after we have all
incurred that malediction, <hi>Morte moriemur,</hi> we shall die both death, we cannot
thinke to scape any lesse malediction of any law, and therefore we are all <hi>Intestabiles</hi>
we are all intestable, in all these senses, and apprehensions, which we have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon.</p>
                     <p>We can make no <hi>testament</hi> of our owne; we have no good thing in us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
we have no good inclination, no good disposition, in our <hi>Will;</hi> we can make
no use of <hi>anothers</hi> testament; not of the double testaments of <hi>Almighty God;</hi> for
in the Old testament, he gives promises of a <hi>Messias,</hi> but we bring into the world
no <hi>Faith,</hi> to apprehend those promises; and in the <hi>New</hi> testament, he gives a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
the Messias is come, but he is communicable to us, no way but by <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi>
and we cannot baptize our selves; we can profit no body else by our testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
we are not able to endure <hi>persecution,</hi> for the testimony of Christ, to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of others, we are not able to doe such <hi>workes,</hi> as may <hi>shine before Men, to
the glorifying of our God.</hi> Neither doth the testimony of others doe us any good;
for neither the <hi>Martyrdome</hi> of so many Millions, in the primitive Church, nor the
execution of so many judgments of God, in our owne times, doe restifie any thing
to our Consciences; neither at the last day, when those Saints of God, whom we
have accompanied in the outward worship of God here in the visible Church, shall
be called to the <hi>right hand,</hi> and we detruded to the left, shall they dare to open
their mouthes for us, or to testifie of us, or to say, Why Lord, these Men, when
they were in the world, did as we did, appeared, and served thee in thy house, as
we did, they seem'd to goe the same way that we did upon Earth, why goe they
a <hi>sinister</hi> way now in heaven? We are utterly <hi>intestable;</hi> we can give nothing; we
can take nothing; nothing will be beleeved from us, who are all falshood it selfe;
nor can we be releeved by any thing, that any other will say for us. As long, as we
are considered under the penalty of that law, this is our case; <hi>Interdicti, intesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi>
we are accursed, and so, as that we are <hi>intestable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as this great malediction, <hi>Morte marieris,</hi> in volves all other punishments,
(upon whom that falls, all fall) so when our Saviour Christ Jesus hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to take away <hi>that,</hi> or the most dangerous part of that, the <hi>spirituall death,</hi>
when he will reverse that judgment, <hi>Aqua &amp; igni interdicitur,</hi> to make us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of his <hi>water,</hi> and his <hi>fire;</hi> when he will reverse the <hi>intestabiles,</hi> the inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and make us able to receive his graces by faith, and declare them by works;
then, as he that will reedifie a demolished house, begins not at the top but at
the bottome, so Christ Jesus, when he will make this great preparation, this great
reedification of mankind, he beginnes at the lowest step, which is, that we may
have use of the <hi>testimony of others,</hi> in our behalfe: and he proceeds strongly, and
effectually; he produces <hi>three witnesses</hi> from heaven, so powerfull, that they will
be heard, they will be beleeved; and <hi>three witnesses on earth,</hi> so neare us, so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93359:25"/>
so domestique as that they will not be denied, they will not be discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<hi>Three are three that beare Record in heaven, and three that beare record in
earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since then Christ Jesus makes us all our owne <hi>Iury,</hi> able to conceive, and judge
upon the Evidence, and testimony of these three heavenly, and three earthly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
let us draw neare, and hearken to the evidence, and consider three things;
<hi>Testimonium esse. Quid sit,</hi> and <hi>Qui testes.</hi> That God descends to meanes propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to Man;<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> he affords him witnesse; and secondly, the matter of the proofe,
what all these six witnesses testifie, what they establish; Thirdly, the quality, and
value of the witnesses, and whether the matter be to be beleeved, for their sakes,
and for their reasons. God requires nothing of us, but <hi>Testimony:</hi> for <hi>Martyrdome</hi>
is but that; A Martyr is but a witnesse. God offers us nothing without testimony:
for his <hi>Testament,</hi> is but a witnesse. <hi>Teste ipso,</hi> is shrewd evidence; when God
says, <hi>I will speake, and I will testifie against thee;</hi> I am God,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 7.</note> even thy God: when
the voice of God testifies against me in mine owne conscience. It is more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
evidence then this, when his voice testifies against me in his word, in his
Scriptures: <hi>The Lord testified against Israel, by all the Prophets and by all the Seers.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Reg. 17. 13.</note>
When I can never be alone, but that God speakes in me, but speakes against me;
when I can never open his booke, but the first sentence mine eye is upon, is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against me, this is fearfull evidence. But in this text, we are not in that storme,
for he hath made us <hi>Testabiles,</hi> that is, ready to testifie for him, to the effusion of
our bloud; and <hi>Testabiles,</hi> that is, fit to take benefit by the testament, that hee
hath made for us, The effusion of his bloud; which is our second branch: what
is testified for us, what these witnesses establish.</p>
                     <p>First then, that which a sinner must be brought to understand, and beleeve,<note place="margin">2. Part. <hi>Integritas Christi.</hi>
                        </note> by
the strength of these witnesses, is <hi>Integritas Christi;</hi> not the Integrity, as it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the <hi>Innocency</hi> of Christ: but integrity, as it signifies <hi>Intireness,</hi> not as it is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teger
vitae,</hi> but <hi>Integra vita;</hi> not as he kept an integrity in his life, but as he onely,
is intirely our life. That Christ was a person composed of those <hi>two Natures,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and humane, whereby he was a fit, and a full satisfaction for all our sinnes,
and by death could be our life: for when the Apostle writ this Epistle, it seemes
there had been a <hi>schisme,</hi> not about the <hi>Mysticall</hi> body of Christ, the Church,
but even about the <hi>Naturall;</hi> that is to say, in the person of Christ, there had
been a schisme, a separation of his two natures: for, as we see certainly before the
death of this Apostle, that the Heresie of <hi>Ebion</hi> and of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> (which denied
the divine nature of Christ) was set on foot, (for against them purposely was the
Gospell of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> written) so by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his ranking of the Heresies, as
they arose, where he makes <hi>Basilides</hi> his Heresie, (which denied that Christ had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
naturall body) to be the <hi>fourth</hi> herefie, and <hi>Ebions,</hi> to be the <hi>tenth,</hi> it seemes,
that they denied his <hi>humanity,</hi> before they denied his <hi>Divinity.</hi> And therefore it
is well collected, that this <hi>Epistle</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> being written long before his <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi>
was written principally, and purposely against the opposers of Christs huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
but occasionally also, in defence of his divine nature too. Because there is
<hi>Solutio Iesu,</hi> a dissolving of Jesus, a taking of Jesus in peeces, a dividing of his
<hi>Natures,</hi> or of his <hi>Offices,</hi> which overthrowes all the testimonies of these six great
witnesses when Christ said, <hi>Solvite templum hoc, destroy, dissolve this temple, and in
three dayes I will raise it,</hi> he spoke that but of his naturall body; there was <hi>Solutio
corporis,</hi> Christs body and soule were parted, but there was not <hi>Solutio Iesu;</hi> the
divine nature parted not from the humane, no not in death, but adhered to, and
accompanied the soule, even in hell, and accompanied the body in the grave.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, says the Apostle, <hi>Omnis spiritus qui solvit Iesum, ex deo non est;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 3.</note>
(for so <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> with the Grecians, read
those words) That spirit which receives not Jesus intirely, which <hi>dissolves</hi> Jesus
and breakes him in peeces, that spirit is not of God. All this then is the subject
of this testimony; first that Christ Jesus is come in the flesh;<note place="margin">4. 2.</note> (there
is a Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of his <hi>humane nature</hi>) And then that this Jesus is the sonne of God;<note place="margin">5. 5</note> (there
is a subscription to his <hi>divine nature:)</hi> he that separates these, and thereby makes
him not able, or not willing to satisfie for Man, he that separates his <hi>Nature,</hi> or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93359:26"/>
he that separates the <hi>worke</hi> of the Redemption, and says, Christ suffered for us
onely <hi>as Man,</hi> and not <hi>as God,</hi> or he that separates the manner of the worke, and says
that the <hi>passive obedience</hi> of Christ onely redeemed us, without any respect at all,
to his <hi>active obedience,</hi> onely as he died, and nothing as he died innocently, or he
that separates the <hi>perfection,</hi> and consummation of the worke, from his worke, and
findes something to be done by <hi>Man himselfe,</hi> meritorious to salvation, or he that
separates the Prince, and the Subject, Christ and his members, by nourishing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
in Religion,</hi> when they might be well reconciled, or he that separates
himselfe from the body of the Church, and from the communion of Saints, for
the fashion of the garments, for the variety of indifferent Ceremonies, all these
do <hi>Solvere Iesum,</hi> they slacken, they dissolve that Jesus, whose bones God provided for,
that they should not be broken, whose flesh God provided for, that it should not see
Corruption, and whose garments God provided, that they should not bee
divided.</p>
                     <p>There are other luxations, other dislocations, of Jesus, when we displace him
for any <hi>worldly respect,</hi> and prefer <hi>preforment</hi> before him; there are other wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Jesus, in blasphemous <hi>oathes,</hi> and exerations; there are other maimings
of Jesus, in pretending to serve him intirely, and yet retaine one particular beloved
sinne still; there are other rackings, and extendings of Jesus when we delay him
and his patience to our death-bed, when we stretch the string so farre, that it cracks
there, that is, appoint him to come then, and he comes not; there are other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of Jesus, when men will melt him, and powre him out, and mold him up
in a waser Cake, or a peece of bread; there are other annihilations of Jesus when Men will
make him, and his Sacraments, to be nothing but bare signes; but all these will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
by us, if we be gained by the testimony of these six witnesses to hold fast
that integrity, that intirensse of Jesus, which is here delivered to us by this
Apostle.</p>
                     <p>In which we beleeve first <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to save us; and then we beleeve <hi>Christum,</hi> the anointed, that is God and man, able,

purpose; and this implies the decree, the contract, and bargaine, of acceptation by
the Father, that <hi>Pactum salis,</hi> that eternall covenant which seasons all, by which, that
which he meant to doe, as he was <hi>Iesus,</hi> should be done, as he was <hi>Christ.</hi> And then
as the intirenesse of Jesus is expressed, in the verse before the text, we beleeve, <hi>Quod

this Jesus is already come; and that, for the father intirenesse, for the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and consummation, and declaration of all, <hi>venit per aquam &amp; sanguinem,</hi> He came
by <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>bloud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which words Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> understands to imply but a difference between the
comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the comming of <hi>Moses;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> who was drawen out of the <hi>water,</hi>
and therefore called by that name of <hi>Moses.</hi> But before <hi>Moses</hi> came to be a leader of
the people, he passed through <hi>bloud</hi> too, through the bloud of the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> whom
he slew; and much more when he established all their <hi>bloudy sacrifices,</hi> so that <hi>Mases</hi>
came not onely by water. Neither was the first Testament ordained without bloud.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 18.</note> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
understand the words onely to put a difference between <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and <hi>Christ:</hi>
because <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> is still said to <hi>baptize with water<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> Because he should be declared to
<hi>Israel;</hi> therefore am I come, <hi>baptizing with water:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 31.</note> but yet <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> baptisme had
not onely a relation to bloud, but a demonstration of it, when still he pointed to the
Lambe, <hi>Ecce Agnus,</hi> for that <hi>Lambe</hi> was <hi>sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ine</hi> from the beginning of the world. So
that Christ, which was this Lambe, came by water, and bloud, when he came, in the
<hi>risuall types,</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> and when he came in the baptisme of <hi>Iohn:</hi> for in
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> there was so frequent use of <hi>water,</hi> as that we reckon above <hi>fifty</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Immunditi as</hi> uncleannesses, which might receive their expiation by washing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being put to their bloudy sacrifies for them: And then there was so frequent use
of <hi>bloud,</hi> that almost all things are by the Law purged with bloud,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> and <hi>without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of bloud, is no Remission,</hi> But this was such water, and such bloud, as could not
perfect the worke, but therefore was to be renewed every day. The water that Jesus
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93359:26"/>
comes by, is such a water, as he <hi>that arinketh of it, shall thirst no more;</hi> nay there shall
spring up in him a <hi>well</hi> of water; that is, his example shall worke to the <hi>satisfaction of</hi>
others; (we doe not say to a satisfaction <hi>for</hi> others.) And then this is that bloud, that
perfected the whole worke at once, <hi>By his own bloud entred he once into the holy place,<note place="margin">Heb. 19. 12.</note>
and obtained eternall Redemption for us.</hi> So that Christ came by water, and bloud,
(according to the old ablutions, and old sacrifices) when he wept, when he sweat,
when he powred out bloud; pretious, incorruptible, inestimable bloud, at so many
channels, as he did, all the while that he was upon the altar, sacrificing himselfe
in his passion. But after the immolation of this sacrifice, after his <hi>Consummatum est;</hi>
when Christ was come and gone for so much as belonged to the accomplishing of the
types of the old law, then Christ came againe to us by water and bloud, in that wound,
which he received upon his side, from which there flowed out miraculously true water, &amp;
true bloud. This wound Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls <hi>Ianuam utriusque Sacramenti,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augustine.</note> the doore of
both sacraments; where we see he acknowledges but two, and both presented in this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and bloud and so certainely doe most of the fathers, make this wound if not the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
yet at least a <hi>sacrament</hi> of both the <hi>sacraments.</hi> And to this water and bloud doth
the Apostle here, without doubt, aime principally; which he onely of all the Evangelists
hath recorded; and with so great asseveration, and assurednesse in the recording there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>He that saw it bare record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he saith truth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 19. 34.</note>
                        <hi>that yee might beleeve it.</hi> Here then is the matter which these six witnesses must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
in, here is <hi>Integritas Iesu, quae non solvenda,</hi> the intirenesse of Christ Jesus, which
must not be broken, That a Saviour, which is <hi>Iesus,</hi> appointed to that office, that is
<hi>Christ,</hi> figured in the law, by <hi>ablutions</hi> of <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>sacrifices</hi> of <hi>bloud,</hi> is come, and
hath perfected all those figures in water, and bloud too; and then, that he remaines
still with us in water, and bloud, by meanes instituted in his Church, to wash away
our uncleannesses, and to purge away our iniquities, and to apply his worke unto our
Soules; this is <hi>Integritas Iesu,</hi> Iesus the sonne of God in heaven, Jesus the Redeemer of
man, upon earth, Jesus the head of a Church to apply that to the end, this is <hi>Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
Iesu;</hi> all that is to be beleeved of him.</p>
                     <p>Take thus much more, that when thou comest to hearken what these witnesses
shall say to this purpose, thou must finde something in their testimony, to prove him
to be come not onely <hi>into the world,</hi> but <hi>into thee;</hi> He is a mighty prince, and hath a
great traine; millions of ministring spirits attend him, and the whole army of Martyrs
follow the Lambe wheresoever he goes: Though the whole world be his <hi>Court,</hi> thy
soule is his <hi>bedchamber;</hi> there thou maist contract him, there thou maist lodge, and
entertaine <hi>Integrum Iesum,</hi> thy whole Saviour. And never trouble thy selfe, how another
shall have him, if thou have him all; leave him, and his Church to that; make thou
sure thine owne salvation. When he comes to thee, he comes by <hi>water</hi> and by <hi>bloud;</hi>
If thy heart, and bowels have not yet melted in compassion of his passion for thy soule,
if thine eyes have not yet melted, in <hi>tears of repentanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> and contrition, he is not yet
come <hi>by water</hi> into thee; If thou have suffered nothing for sinne, nor found in thy
selfe a chearfull disposition to suffer, if thou have found no wresting in thy selfe, no
resistance of Concupiscences, he that comes not to set peace, but to kindle this war,
is not yet come into thee, by <hi>bloud.</hi> Christ can come by land, by purchases, by Revenues,
by <hi>temporall blessings,</hi> for so he did still convey himselfe to the Jewes, by the blessing
of the land of promise, but here he comes by <hi>water,</hi> by his owne passion, by his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by thy tears: Christ can come in a mariage and in Musique, for so he delivers
himselfe to the <hi>spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles;</hi> but here he comes in bloud; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in water, and bloud (that is, in meanes for the salvation of our soules, here in
the militant Church) is the comming that he stands upon and which includes all the
Christian Religion; and therefore he proves that comming to them, by these three
great witnesses in heaven, and three in earth. <hi>For there are three which beare record in
heaven. The Father, the word, and the holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are
three which bear record in the earth; The spirit, and the water, and the bloud, and these
three agree in one.</hi>

                        <hi>By the mouth of two, or three witnesses every word shall be confirmed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Part. Mat. 18. 16.</note> says Christ out of
the law. That's as much as can be required, in any Civill, or Criminall businesse; and
yet Christ gives more testimony of himselfe, for here he produces not <hi>Duos testes,</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:93359:27"/>
but <hi>Duas Classes;</hi> two rankes of witnesses; and the fullest number of each, not two, but
<hi>three in heaven,</hi> and <hi>three in earth.</hi> And such witnesses upon earth, as are <hi>omni ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione
majores,</hi> without all exception. It is not the testimony of earthly men; for
when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> produces them in abundance, (The <hi>Patriarch,</hi> the <hi>Iudges,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
the <hi>elders</hi> of the old times; of whom he exhibits an exact Catalogue,) yet he calls
all them but <hi>Nubes testium</hi> cloudes of witnesses;<note place="margin">Heb. 11. Heb. 12.</note> for though they be cloudes in Saint
<hi>Chrysostomes</hi> sense, (that they invest us, and enwrap us, and so defend us from all
diffidence in God,) (we have their witnesse what God did for them, why should we
doubt of the like?) though they be cloudes in <hi>Athanasius</hi> sense, they being in heaven,
showre downe by their prayers, the dew of Gods grace upon the Church; Though
they be cloudes, they are <hi>but cloudes;</hi> some darkenesse mingled in them, some contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
arising from them; but his witnesses here, are <hi>Lux inaccessibilis,</hi> that light, that
no eye can attaine to, and <hi>Pater Luminum,</hi> the father of lights, from whom all these
testimonies are derived. When God imployed a man, to be the witnesse of Christ,
because men might doubt of his testimony, God was content to assigne him his <hi>Compur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 3</note>
when <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> must preach, that the kingdome of God, was at hand, God
fortifies the testimony of his witnesse, then, <hi>Hic enim est,</hi> for <hi>this is he of whom that
is spoken by the prophet Esay;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar.1.2.</note> and lest one were not enough, he multiplies them, as it is
written, in <hi>the prophets. Iohn Baptist</hi> might be thought to testifie as a <hi>man,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men must testifie for him; but these witnesses are of a higher nature; these of
heaven are the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and those of earth, are the <hi>sacraments</hi> and seales of the Church.
The prophets were full of favor with God, <hi>Abraham</hi> full of faith, <hi>Stephen</hi> full of
the Holy Ghost, <hi>many</hi> full of grace, and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> a prophet, and <hi>more then a prophet,</hi>
yet never any prophet, never any man, how much soever interessed in the favor of
Almighty God was such an instrument of grace, as a <hi>sacrament</hi> or as Gods seales
and institutions in his Church: and the least of these six witnesses, is of that nature,
and therefore might be beleeved without more witnesses.</p>
                     <p>To speake then first of the three first,<note place="margin">3 In Caelis.</note> 
                        <hi>the Father, the Word,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghost,</hi> it was
but a poore plot of the devill, to goe about to rob us, of their testimony; for as long
as we have the three last, <hi>the spirit, the water,</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> we have testimony enough of
Christ, because God is involved in his ordinance; and though he be not tyed to the
worke of the Sacrament, yet he is always present in it. Yet this plot, the devill had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church: And whereas this <hi>first Epistle of</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was never doubted to be
Canonicall, (whereas both the other have been called into some question) yet in this
first Epistle, <hi>the first verse</hi> of this text, was for a long time removed, or expung'd,
whether by malice of Heretiques, or negligence of transcribers. The first Translation
of the new testament, (which was into <hi>Syriaque)</hi> hath not this verse; That which was
first called <hi>Vulgata editio,</hi> had it not, neither hath <hi>Luther</hi> it in his <hi>Germane translation:</hi>
very many of the <hi>Latine Fathers</hi> have it not; and some very ancient <hi>Greeke Fathers</hi>
want it, though more ancient then they, have it; for <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the Councell of
Nice cites it, and makes use of it; and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> beheaded before that Councell, hath
it too. But now, he that is one of the witnesses himselfe, the Holy Ghost hath assured
the Church, that this verse belongs to the Scripture; and therefore it becomes us to
consider thankfully, and reverently, this first ranke of witnesses, <hi>the Father, the Word,
and the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Father then hath testified <hi>De integritate Christi,</hi> of this intirenesse,<note place="margin">Pater.</note> that Christ
should be all this and doe all this, which we have spoken of, abundantly: he begunne

shall call his name Emanuel,</hi> which is by interpretation <hi>God with us:</hi> This seemes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
an incertaine testimony, of a Man, with an <hi>Aliàs dictus,</hi> with two names. God
says he shall be called <hi>Iesus,</hi> that the prophecy may be fulfilled which says he shall be
called <hi>Emanuel:</hi> but therein consists, <hi>Integritas Christi,</hi> this intirenesse; he could not be
Jesus, not a <hi>Saviour,</hi> except he were <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, God in our nature. Here
then is Jesus, a Saviour, a Saviour that is God, and Man, but where is the Testimony
<hi>De Christo;</hi> that he was anointed, and prepared for this sacrifice; that this worke of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93359:27"/>
his was contracted between the Father, and him, and acceptable to him? It is twice
testified by the Father; both in Christs act of <hi>humiliation,</hi> when he would be <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by Iohn;</hi> when he would accept an ablution, who had no uncleannesse, then God
says, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleased,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 3. ult.</note> he was well pleased in his
<hi>person,</hi> and he was well pleased, in his <hi>act,</hi> in his <hi>office.</hi> And he testifies it againe in his
first act of glory, in his <hi>transfiguration;</hi> where the Father repeates the same words with
an addition,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.5.</note> 
                        <hi>Heare him:</hi> God is pleased in him, and would have Men pleased in him
too. He testified first, onely for <hi>Iosephs sak</hi> that had entertained, and lodged some
scrupulous suspition against his <hi>wife,</hi> the Blessed Virgine; His second testimony at
the <hi>baptisme,</hi> had a farther extent; for that was for the confirmation of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
of the preacher himselfe, who was to convey his doctrine to many others; His third
testimony in the <hi>transfiguration,</hi> was larger then the <hi>Baptisme;</hi> for that satisfied <hi>three,</hi>
and <hi>three</hi> such as were to carry it farre, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> All which no
doubt made the same use of his testimony, as we see <hi>Peter</hi> did, who preached out of
the strength of his manifestation,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 16.</note> we <hi>followed not deceivable fables, but with our owne
eyes we saw his Majesty; for he received of God the Father, honor, and glory, when
there came such a voice to him, from the Excellent glory, This is my beloved Sonne, in
whom I am well pleased.</hi> But yet the Father gave a more free, a more liberall testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of him, then this, at his <hi>Conception,</hi> or <hi>Baptisme,</hi> or <hi>Transfiguration:</hi> when upon
Christs prayer, <hi>Father glorifie thy Name,</hi> there came a voice from heaven,<note place="margin">Iohn 19. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>I have
both glorified it and will glorifie it againe.</hi> For this all the people apprehended; some
imputed it to <hi>Thunder,</hi> some to an <hi>Angel;</hi> but all heard it; and all heard Christs
comment upon it, <hi>That that voice came not for him,</hi> but <hi>for their sakes;</hi> so that when
the Father had testified of <hi>a Iesus, a Saviour,</hi> and a Christ, a Saviour sent to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

                        </gap> All consists in this, that he was <hi>Iesus,</hi> capable in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

then <hi>Quod venit,</hi> that be was come, and come, <hi>in aqus &amp; sanguine,</hi> in water and

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93359:28"/>
capable, his <hi>miracles</hi> testified aloud and frequently: that he was <hi>Christ,</hi> anointed, and
sent for that, his reference of all his actions to his Father testified; both these were
enwrapped in that, that he was the <hi>Sonne of God;</hi> and that he professed himselfe upon
the earth to be so; for so it appeares plainely, that he had plainely done: <hi>We have a
law,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 9. 7.</note> say the Jews to <hi>Pilate, and by our law, he ought to die, because he made himselfe the
Sonne of God.</hi> And for the last part, that he came <hi>In aqua &amp; sanguine,</hi> in water, and bloud,
in such meanes, as were to continue in the Church, for our spirituall reparation, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation,
he testified that, in preaching so piercing <hi>Sermons,</hi> in instituting so powerfull
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> in assuring us, that the love of God expressed to mankind in him, extended
to all persons,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> and all times, <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne,
that whoseever beleeveth in him, should not perish, but have life everlasting.</hi> And so the
words beare record, <hi>De Integritate,</hi> of this Intirenesse, of the whole worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
and therefore, Christ is not onely truely called a <hi>Martyr,</hi> in that sense, as
Martyr signifies a <hi>witnesse,</hi> but he is truly called a <hi>Martyr,</hi> in that sense, as we use the word
ordinarily; for he testified this truth, and suffered for the testimony of it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is called Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Martyr,</hi> a <hi>faithfull witnesse.</hi> And there is <hi>Martyrium,</hi> a
Martyrdome attributed to him, where it is said, Jesus Christ under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>
witnessed a good confession;<note place="margin">Tim. 6. 13.</note> so he was a <hi>speaking,</hi> and a <hi>doing,</hi> and a <hi>suffering</hi>
witnesse.</p>
                     <p>Now for the third witnesse in heaven,<note place="margin">Spiritus sanctus.</note> which is the holy Ghost; we may contract
our selves in that; for the whole work was his; Before <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 18.</note> she was found with <hi>Child of the holy Ghost:</hi> which (if we take it, as <hi>Saint Basil,</hi>
and divers others of the Fathers doe) that <hi>Ioseph</hi> found it, by the holy Ghost, that
is, the holy Ghost informed him of it, then here the holy Ghost was a witnesse to
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> of this <hi>Conception:</hi> but we rather take it (as it is most ordinarily taken) that
the Angell intimated this to <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">v. 20.</note> That <hi>that which was conceived in her, was of the
holy Ghost;</hi> and then the holy Ghost did so primarily testifie, this decree of God,
to send a <hi>Iesus,</hi> and a <hi>Christ,</hi> for our Redemption, that himselfe was a blessed and
bountifull actor in that Conception, he was conceived <hi>by him,</hi> by his overshadowing.
So that the holy Ghost did not onely testifie his comming, but he brought him: And
then, for his comming in <hi>Aqua &amp; sanguine,</hi> in water and bloud, that is, in <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in
meanes, by which he might be able to make his comming usefull, and appliable to us,
first the holy Ghost, was a pregnant witnesse of that, at his <hi>Baptisme;</hi> for the holy
Ghost had told <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> before-hand, <hi>That upon whomsoever he should descend, and
tarry still, that should be he, that should baptize with the holy Ghost:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 31.</note> and then according
to those Markes, he did descend, and tarry still upon <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> in his baptisme. And
after this falling upon him, and tarrying upon him, (which testified his <hi>power)</hi> in all his
life, expressed in his doctrine, and in his Sermons, after his death, and Resurrection, and
Ascension, the holy Ghost gave a new testimony, when he fell upon the Apostles in
<hi>Cloventongues,</hi> and made them spirituall channells, in which this water and bloud, the
meanes of applying Christ to us, should be convey'd to all Nations; and thus also the
third witnesse in heaven, testified <hi>De integritate,</hi> of this intirenesse of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of these three witnesses then,<note place="margin">3. Vnum.</note> which are of heaven, we shall need to adde no more,
but that which the text addes, that is, <hi>That these three are one;</hi> that is, not onely one
in <hi>Consent,</hi> (they all testifie of one point, they all speake to one Intergatory; <hi>Ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritatem
Christi,</hi> to prove this intirenesse of Christ;) but they are <hi>Vnum Essentia,</hi>
The Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost are all one <hi>Godhead,</hi> and so meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be in this place. And therefore as <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> complained, when some
Copies were without this <hi>seventh</hi> verse, that thereby we had lost a good argument for
the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>three Persons,</hi> because this verse said plainely that the three witnesses
were <hi>all one,</hi> so I am sorry, when I see any of our later expositors deny, that in this place,
there is any proofe, of such an unity, but that this <hi>Vnum sunt, (They are one)</hi> is onely
an unity of <hi>consent,</hi> and not of <hi>essence.</hi> It is an unthrifty prodigality (howsoever we
be abundantly provided with arguments, from other places of Scriptures, to prove this
<hi>Vnity in Trinity)</hi> to cast away so strong an argument, against <hi>Iew,</hi> and <hi>Turke,</hi> as is in
these words, for that, and for the <hi>consubstantiality</hi> of Christ, which was the Tempest,
and the Earthquake of the Primitive Church, raised by <hi>Arius;</hi> and his followers then,
and (God knowes) not extinguished yet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:93359:28"/>Thus much I adde of these three witnesses, that though they be in heaven, their
testimony is upon the earth; for they need not to testifie to one another, this matter
of Jesus: The Father heares of it every day, by the continuall <hi>intercession</hi> of Christ
Jesus: The Sonne feeles it every day; in his new crucifying by our sinnes, and in the
perfecution of his Mysticall body here: The holy Ghost hath a bitter sense of it, in
our sinnes against the holy Ghost, and he hath a loving sense of it, in those abundant
seas of <hi>graces,</hi> which flow continually from him upon us; They need no witnesses in
heaven; but these three witnesses testifie all this, to our Consciences. And therefore
the first author, that is observed to have read, and made use of this seventh verse
(which was one of the first Bishops of <hi>Rome)</hi> he reads the words thus,<note place="margin">Higinus.</note> 
                        <hi>Tres in nobis,</hi>
there are three <hi>in us,</hi> which beare witnesse in heaven; they testifie for our sakes, and
to establish our assurance, <hi>De Integritate Iesu;</hi> that Jesus is come, and come with
meanes, to save the world, and to save us. And therefore upon these words, Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> collects thus much more,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> that there are other witnesses in heaven, which
restifie this worke of our Redemption, <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> all the Court, all the Quire
of heaven testifie it; but <hi>catera nobis occults,</hi> says he, what all they doe we know not:
but (according to the best dispositions here in this world) we acquaint our selves, and
we choose to keep company with the best, and so not onely the poore Church s
the earth, but every poore soule in the Church, may heare all these three witnesses
testifying to him, <hi>Integrum Iesum suum,</hi> that <hi>all,</hi> which Christ Jesus hath done, and
suffered, appertaines to him: but yet, to bring it nearer him, in visible and sensible
things, <hi>There are, tres de terra, three upon earth too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of these three upon earth, is the <hi>Spirit:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spiritus.</note> which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
of the spirit, the <hi>soule</hi> of Christ: for when Christ commended his spirit, into
the hands of his Father, this was a testimony, that he was <hi>Verus hemo,</hi> that he had a
soule; and in that he laid downe his spirit, his soule, (for no Man could take it from
him) and tooke it againe, at his pleasure, in his resurrection, this was a testimony, that
he was <hi>Verus Deus,</hi> true God; And so says Saint <hi>Augustine, Spiritus,</hi> The spirit, that
is <hi>anima Christi,</hi> the soule of Christ, did testifie <hi>De integritate Iesu,</hi> all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to Jesus, as he was <hi>God,</hi> and as he was <hi>Man.</hi> But this makes the witnesses in
heaven, and the witnesses in earth all one; for the personall testimony of Christs
<hi>preaching,</hi> and living, and dying, the testimony which was given by these three Persons
of the Trinity, was all involv'd in the first rank of witnesses: Those three which are
in heaven. Other later Men understand by the <hi>Spirit</hi> here the Spirit of every <hi>Regenerate
Man;</hi> and that in the other heavenly witnesses, the spirit is <hi>Spiritus sanctus,</hi> the spirit
that is holy in it selfe, the holy Ghost, and here it is <hi>Spiritus sanctificatus,</hi> that spirit
of Man, which is made holy by the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> according to that, <hi>The same spirit,
beareth witnesse, with our spirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> But in this sense, it is
too particular a witnesse, too singular, to be intended here; for that speakes but to
one Man, at once; The spirit therefore here is; <hi>Spiritus oris,</hi> the word of God, the
<hi>Gospell;</hi> and the preaching, and ministration thereof.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6. Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>We are made Ministers of the New
testament of the spirit,</hi> that <hi>giveth life:</hi> And if the ministration of death were glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
how shall not the <hi>ministration of the spirit,</hi> be more glorious? It is not therefore
the Gospell meerly, but the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Gospell, that is this spirit. <hi>Spiritus
sacerdotis vehioulum Spiritus Dei;</hi> The spirit of the Minister, is not so pure, as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, but it is the chariot, the meanes, by which God will enter into you. The
Gospell is the Gospell, at home, at your house; and there you doe well to read it,
and reverence it, as the Gospell: but yet it is not <hi>Spiritus,</hi> it is not this Spirit, this first
witnesse upon earth, but onely there, where God hath blessed it with his institution,
and ordinance, that is, in the <hi>preaching</hi> thereof. The stewardship, and the dispensation
of the graces of God, the directing of his threatnings against refractary, and wilfull
sinners, the directing of his promises to simple, and supple, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

breaking of the bread, the applying of the Gospell according to their particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digences,
in the preaching thereof, this is the first witnesse.</p>
                     <p>The second witnesse here is <hi>The water,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aqua.</note> and I know there are some Men which will
not have this to be understood of the water of <hi>Baptisme;</hi> but onely of the naturall
effect of water; that as the <hi>abtutions</hi> of the old law, by water did purge us, so we
have an inward testimony, that Christ doth likewise wash us cleane; so the water
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93359:29"/>
here, must not be so much as water; but a metaphoricall, and figurative water. These
men will not allow water, in this place, to have any relation to the <hi>sacrament;</hi> and
<hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> was so far from doubting that water in this place belonged to the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he applies all these three witnesses to the Sacrament of <hi>Baptisme: Spiritus
mentem renovat,</hi> All this is done in Baptisme, says he; The Spirit renewes and disposes
the mind; <hi>Aqua perficit ad Lavacrum;</hi> The water is applied to cleanse the body;
<hi>Sanguis Spectat ad pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>lium;</hi> and the bloud intimates the price, and ransome, which
gives force, and virtue to this sacrament: And so also (says he in another place) <hi>In
sanguine mors,</hi> in the bloud there is a representation of death, in the water, of our
buriall, and in the spirit, of our owne life. Some will have none of these witnesses on
earth to belong to <hi>baptisme,</hi> not the water; and <hi>Ambrose</hi> will have all, spirit, and
water, and bloud to belong to it.</p>
                     <p>Now both Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who applies all the three witnesses to <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and
those later men which deny any of the witnesses to belong to baptisme, doe both
depart from the generall acceptation of these words, that <hi>water</hi> here, and onely that,
signifies the Sacrament of <hi>baptisme.</hi> For as in the first creation, the first thing, that the
spirit of God, is noted to have moved upon, was the <hi>waters,</hi> so the first creature, that
is sanctified by Christs institution, to our Salvation, is this element of water.
The first thing that produced any living sensible creature was the <hi>water; Primus liquor
qnod viveret edidit; ne mirum sit quod in Baptismo, aquae a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nimare noverunt;</hi> water
brought forth the first creatures,<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> says <hi>Tertullian;</hi> That we should not wonder, that
water should bring forth Christians. The first of Gods afficting miracles in Egypt, was
the changing of <hi>water</hi> into <hi>bloud;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> and the first miracle of <hi>grace,</hi> in the new Testament,
was the changing of water into wine at the mariage. So that <hi>water</hi> hath still been a
subject, and instrument of Gods conversation with man: So then <hi>Aqua janua ecclesiae,</hi>
we cannot come into the Church, but by water, <hi>by baptisme:</hi> for though the Church
have taken knowledge of other <hi>Baptismes, (Baptisma sanguinis,</hi> which is Martyrdome,
and <hi>Baptisma Flaminis,</hi> which is a religious desire to be baptized when no meanes can
be got) yet there is no other <hi>sacrament</hi> of Baptisme, but <hi>Baptisma Fluminis,</hi> the
Baptisme of water; for the rest, <hi>Conveniunt in causando, sed non in significando,</hi> says
the Schoole; that is, God doth afford a plentifull retribution to the other baptismes
<hi>Flaminis</hi> and <hi>Sanguinis,</hi> but God hath not ordained them, to be outward <hi>seales,</hi> and
significations of his grace, and to be witnesses of <hi>Iesus</hi> his comming upon earth, as
this water is. And therefore they that provide not duly to bring their children to
this water of life, (not to speake of the essentiall necessity thereof) they take from
them one of the <hi>witnesses,</hi> that <hi>Iesus</hi> is come into them; and (as much as they can)
they shut the Church dore against them, they leave them out of the <hi>Arke,</hi> and for
want of this water, cast them into that generall water, which overflowes all the rest
of the world, which are not brought within the Covenant, by this water of baptisme.
For, though in the first Translation of the new Testament, into <hi>Syriaque,</hi> that be said
in the sixth verse, that Jesus is come <hi>per manus aquarum,</hi> by the power of waters,
many waters, and in this verse, this witnesse is delivered in the plurall, <hi>spirit and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>

the Word preached; he mistakes the <hi>spirit,</hi> the first witnesse; if he refuse the <hi>water</hi> the

                     <p>The third witnesse upon earth,<note place="margin">Sanguinis.</note> is bloud: and that is briefly the <hi>Communion of the

not ashamed to confesse, that I know not <hi>how,</hi> but the bloud of Christ is a <hi>witnesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

they would give the Sacrament of the body of Christ to <hi>Children,</hi> as soon as they
were <hi>baptized;</hi> yea, and to <hi>dead man</hi> too. But because this Sacrament is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>precepts,</hi> which can belong onely to <hi>Men of understanding,</hi> (for they must
doe it in <hi>Remembrance,</hi> and they must <hi>discerne</hi> the Lords body) therefore the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
lies onely upon such, as are come to those <hi>graces,</hi> and to that understanding.
For they that take it, and doe not <hi>discerne it,</hi> (not know what they do) they take
it dangerously. But else, for them, to whom this Sacrament belongs, if they take it
not, their <hi>hearing of Sermons,</hi> and their <hi>baptisme</hi> doth them no good; for what good
can they have done them, if they have not prepared themselves for it? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the Religion of the Church holds a stubborne <hi>Recusant at the table,</hi> at the

we shall heare that fearfull disclaiming from Christ Jesus, <hi>Nescio vos,</hi> I
know not whence you are. But these witnesses, he will always heare, if they testifie
for us, that Jesus is come unto us; for the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and the <hi>preaching</hi> thereof, is as
the deed that conveys <hi>Iesus</hi> unto us; the <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>baptisme,</hi> is as the <hi>Seale,</hi> that
assures it; and the <hi>bloud,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is the <hi>delivery</hi> of Christ into us; and this
is <hi>Integritas Iesu,</hi> the entire, and full possession of him.</p>
                     <p>To this purpose therefore, as we have found a <hi>Trinity</hi> in heaven, and a <hi>Trinity</hi> in
earth, so we must make it up a Trinity of Trinities, and finde a <hi>third Trinity</hi> in our
selves. God created one <hi>Trinity</hi> in us; (the observation, and the enumeration is
Saint <hi>Bernards)</hi> which are those <hi>three faculties</hi> of our soule, the <hi>reason,</hi> the <hi>memory,</hi>
the <hi>will;</hi> That Trinity in us, by another Trinity too, (by <hi>suggestion</hi> towards sin, by
<hi>delight</hi> in sinne, by <hi>consent</hi> to sinne) is fallen into a third Trinity; The <hi>memory</hi> into
a weaknesse, that that comprehends not <hi>God,</hi> it glorifies him not for benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
The <hi>reasen</hi> to a blindnesse, that that discernes not what is <hi>true;</hi> and the <hi>will</hi>
to a perversnesse, that that wishes not what's <hi>good;</hi> But the goodnesse of God, by
these three witnesses on earth regenerates, and reestablishes a new Trinity in us, <hi>faith,</hi>
and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>charity;</hi> Thus farre that devout Man carries it; And if this new Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

of that glory which he purchased for every beleever; and my <hi>charity</hi> testifies to the
world, that I labour to make sure that salvation, by a good life, then there's a <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of <hi>Trinities,</hi> and the <hi>six</hi> are made <hi>nine</hi> witnesses: There are three in heaven that
testifie that this is done for all Mankinde, Three in the Church that testifie, this may
be done for me, and three in my soule, that testifie, that all this is applied to me;
and then the verdict, and the Judgement must necessarily goe for me. And beloved,
this Judgement will be grounded upon this intirenesse of Jesus, and therefore let
me dismisse you with this note, That <hi>Integritas</hi> is <hi>in continuitate,</hi> not <hi>in contignitate;</hi>
It is not the touching upon a thing, nor the comming neare to a thing, that makes it
intire; a fagot, where the sticks touch, a peece of cloth, where the threds touch, is
not intire; To come as neare Christ as we can conveniently, to trie how neare we

can bring <hi>two Religions</hi> together, this is not to preserve <hi>Integritatem Iesu:</hi> In a word,
Intirenesse excludes deficiency, and redundancy, and discontinuance; we preserve
not intirenesse, if we preserve not the dignity of Christ, in his Church, and in his
<hi>discipline,</hi> and that excludes the defective <hi>Separatist;</hi> we doe not preserve that entirenesse
if we admit <hi>traditions,</hi> and additions of Men, in an equality to the word of God,
and that excludes the redundant <hi>Papist;</hi> neither doe we preserve the entirenesse, if we
admit a discontinuance, a slumbring of our Religion for a time, and that excludes the
<hi>temporisers,</hi> the <hi>Statist,</hi> the <hi>Politician.</hi> And so, beloved, I recommend unto you <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritatem

                     <p>So that our happinesse is now at that height, and so much are we preferred before
the <hi>Iews,</hi> that whereas the chiefest happinesse of the Jews was to have <hi>the law, (for
without the law they could not have known sinne,</hi> and the law was their <hi>Schoolmaster</hi> to
find out Christ) we are admitted to that degree of perfection, that we are got above
the law; It was their happinesse to have had the law, but it is ours, <hi>not to need it:</hi>
They had the benefit of a <hi>guide,</hi> to direct them, but we are at our journies end; They
had a <hi>schoolmaster</hi> to lead them to Christ; but we have proceeded so farre, as that
we are in possession of Christ. The law of <hi>Moses</hi> therefore, binds us not at all, as it
is <hi>his Law;</hi> Whatsoever binds a Christian, in that law, would have bound him,
though there had been no law given to <hi>Moses.</hi> The <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> part of that law, which
was in the institution, <hi>Mortale,</hi> (it was mortall, It <hi>might</hi> die) and by Christs determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of those Typicall things, <hi>Mortuum,</hi> (It <hi>did</hi> die) is now also <hi>Mortiferum,</hi> (dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
so that it is sinne to draw any part of that law, into a <hi>necessity</hi> of observation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the necessary admission of any <hi>Type,</hi> or <hi>figure,</hi> implies a confession, that that
which was signified, or figured, is not yet come; So that that law, and Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist together. The <hi>Iudiciall</hi> law of <hi>Moses,</hi> was certainly the most absolute, and
perfect law of government, which could have been given <hi>to that people,</hi> for whom it
was given; but yet to thinke, that all <hi>States</hi> are bound to observe those lawes, because
God gave them, hath no more ground, then that all Men are bound to goe clothed in
<hi>beasts skinnes,</hi> because God apparelled <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in that fashion.</p>
                     <p>And for the <hi>morall part</hi> of that law, and the abridgement of that morall part, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,</hi>
that begunne not to have force, and efficacy then, when God writ it in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
but was always, and always shall be written in the <hi>hearts</hi> of Men; And though
God of his goodnesse, was pleased to give that <hi>declaration</hi> of it, and that <hi>provocation</hi>
to it, by so writing it, yet if he had not written it, or if (which is impossible) that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93359:30"/>
could perish, yet that morall law, those commandements, would bind us, that
are <hi>Christians,</hi> after the expiration of that law, which was <hi>Moses</hi> law, as it did <hi>(de
Iure)</hi> bind all those which lived, before any written law was. So that he that will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
understand, what appertaines to his duty in any of the <hi>ten Commandements;</hi>
he must not consider that law, with any limitation, as it was given to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but
consider what he would have done, if he had lived before the <hi>Tables</hi> had been written.
For certainely, even in the Commandement of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which was accompanied
with so many <hi>Ceremonies amongst</hi> the <hi>Iews, that part onely is morall, which had bound
us, though that Commandement had never been given;</hi> and he that performes that part,
keepes the Sabbath; the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> part of it, is not onely not necessary; but when it
is done with an opinion of necessity, it is erroneous, and sinfull. For neither that
Commandement nor any other of the <hi>ten,</hi> began to bind them, when they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
nor doth bind now, except it bound before that.</p>
                     <p>Thus far then we are directed by this Text, (which is as far, as we can goe in this
life) To prove to our selves, that we have <hi>faith,</hi> we must prove, that wee need not the
<hi>law;</hi> To prove that <hi>emanecipation,</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> we must prove, that we are the <hi>sonnes
of God;</hi> To prove that ingraffing, and that <hi>adoption,</hi> we must prove, that we have
<hi>put on Christ Iesus;</hi> And to prove that apparelling of our selves, our proofe is, that
<hi>we are baptized</hi> into him.</p>
                     <p>All proofes must either arrest, and determine in some things confessed, and agreed
upon, or else they proceed <hi>in infinitum.</hi> That which the Apostle takes to be that
which is granted on all sides, and which none can deny, is this, that <hi>to be baptized is
to put on Christ:</hi> And this putting on of Christ, doth so far carry us to that <hi>Infinitissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi>
to God himselfe, that we are thereby made <hi>Semen Dei,</hi> the seed of God; The

of the Divine nature;</hi> yea, we are discharged of all bodily, and earthly incombrances,
and we are made <hi>all spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> yea the spirit of God himselfe, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord,
is one spirit with him.</hi> All this we have, if we doe put on Christ: and we doe put on

                     <p>
                        <hi>Induere,</hi> is to cover so far, as that Covering can reach; A hat covers the head; a
glove the hand; and other garments, more; But Christ, when he is put on, Covers
us all. If we have <hi>weake heads,</hi> shallow brains, either a <hi>silexce,</hi> and a reservednes, which
make the foole and the wise equall, or the good interpretation of friends, which put
<hi>good Constructions</hi> upon all that we say, or the dignity of <hi>autority,</hi> and some great place,
which we hold, which puts an opinion in the people, that we are wise, or else we had
never been brought thither, these cover our heads, and hide any defect in them. If we
have foule hands, we can cover them, with excuses; If they be foule with <hi>usurious
Extortion,</hi> we can put on a glove, an excuse, and say, He that borrowed my money,
got more by it, then I that lent it; If, with <hi>bribery in an office,</hi> we can cover it and say,
He that knew, that I bought my office, will be content to let me be a saver by it; If
our hands be foule with <hi>shedding of innocent bloud,</hi> as <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> sayes that <hi>Adam</hi> eate
the Apple, <hi>Ne contristaretur Delicias suas,</hi> left he should over grieve his wife, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
it, <hi>Ne contristaremur Delicias nostras,</hi> either because we would not displease a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
or because our <hi>beloved sinne,</hi> to which we had maried our selves, did sollicite
us to it. Particular excuses cover our particular defects, from the sight of men, but to
put on Christ, covers us all over, even from the <hi>sight of God</hi> himselfe. So that how nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
so ever he search into us, he sees nothing but the whitenesse of his Sonnes inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and the rednesse of his Sonnes bloud.</p>
                     <p>When the prodigall child returned to his father, his father clothed him intirely,
and all at once; he put a <hi>robe</hi> upon him, to cover all his defects: which Robe, when
God puts upon us, in clothing us with Christ, that robe is not onely <hi>Dignitaes quam
perdidit Adam,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> says, but it is <hi>Amictus sapientiae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augustine. Ambrose.</note> as <hi>Ambrase</hi> enlarges
it, It does not onely make us aswell, as we were in <hi>Adam,</hi> but it enables us better, to
preserve that state; It does not onely <hi>cover us,</hi> that is, make us excusable, for our past,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93359:31"/>
and present sinnes, but it indues us with <hi>grace;</hi> and <hi>wisdome</hi> to keep that robe still,
and never to returne to our former foulnesses, and deformities.</p>
                     <p>Our first parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were naked all over; but they were not sensible
of <hi>all</hi> their nakednesse, but onely of those parts whereof they were <hi>ashamed.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the shame of the world makes us discerne our deformities; And onely for
those faults, which shame makes us take knowledge of, we goe about to provide;
And we provide nothing but <hi>short Aprons,</hi> as that word signified; and those but of
<hi>fig-leaves;</hi> That which comes first to hand, and that which is withered before it is
made, that doe we take for an excuse, for an aversion of our owne conscience,
when she begins to cast an eye, or to examine the nakednesse, and deformities of our
soules.</p>
                     <p>But when God came to cloath them, their short <hi>aprons</hi> were extended to <hi>coates,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 21.</note>
that covered them all over, and their <hi>fig-leaves</hi> to strong <hi>skins;</hi> for God saw that not
onely those parts, of which they were already ashamed, needed covering, but that in
all their other parts, if they continued, naked, and still exposed to the Injurie, and
violence of the weather, they would contract diseases, and infirmities; and therefore
God covers them so throughly, as he doth not onely provide for reparation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
inconveniences, but prepare against future.</p>
                     <p>And so perfect effects doth this garment, <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> work upon us, if we put
him on; He doth not onely cover <hi>Originall sinnes,</hi> (which is the effect of those disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Members, which derive sinne, upon us, in the sinfull generation of our parents)
but he covers all our <hi>actuall sinnes,</hi> which we multiplie every day: and not onely those,
which the world makes us <hi>ashamed of,</hi> but which we hide from the world; yea which
we hide from our selfes; that is, sinnes, which by a long custome of practise, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
so habitually, and so indifferently, as that we have forgot, that they are sinnes.</p>
                     <p>But as it was in <hi>Adams Clothing</hi> there, so must it be in our spirituall putting on of
Christ. The word used there, <hi>Labash,</hi> doth not signifie that God cloathed <hi>Adam,</hi> nor
that <hi>Adam</hi> cloathed himselfe; but as the <hi>Grammarians</hi> call it, it is in <hi>Hiphil,</hi> and it
signified <hi>Induere fecit eos;</hi> God caused them to be cloathed, or God caused them to
cloath themselves; which is also intimated, nay evidently expressed in the words of
this text; we are our selves poore, and impotent creatures, we cannot make our selves
ready; we are poore and beggerly creatures, we have nothing to put on; Christ is
that garment; and then Christ is the very life, by which we stretch out our armes and
our legs, to put on that garment; yea he puts it on upon us, he doth the whole worke:
but yet he doth not thrust it on: He makes us <hi>Able</hi> to put it on: but if we be not <hi>willing,</hi>
then he puts <hi>no necessity upon our will:</hi> but we remaine naked still.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Induere</hi> then, to put on, is an extension, a dilatation over all; And sometimes it
signifies an abundant, and overflowing, and overwhelming measure of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon us, <hi>Princeps Induetur desolatione,</hi>

                     <p>As then this word, <hi>Induere,</hi> to put on, to be clothed, signifies a largenesse, and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,

                     <p>This Baptisme then is so necessary, that first, as <hi>Baptisme</hi> (in a large acceptation)
signifies our dying, and buriall with Christ, and all the acts of our regeneration, so

for <hi>legall</hi> and <hi>Civill</hi> uses, (as in the law, that child, that dyed without circumcision,
had no interest in the family, no participation of the honor, nor name thereof) So
that we see in the reckning of the Genealogy,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 3.</note> and pedegree of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>first</hi> sonne of

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> And so, out of a mistaking of those
words,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>Else what shall they doe, Qui baptizantur pro mortuis</hi> (which is, that are ready
to dye, when they are baptized) the <hi>Marcionites</hi> induc'd a custome, to lay one under
the dead bodyes bed, that he, in the name of the dead man, might answer to all the
questions usually asked, in administring of Baptisme.</p>
                     <p>But this was a corrupt effect of pure, and sincere doctrine, which doctrine is,
<hi>That Baptisme is so necessary, as that God. hath placed no other ordinary scale, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of his graces in his Church, to them that have not received that, then buptisme.</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:93359:33"/>
And they, who doe not provide duly, for the Baptisme of their children, if their children
die, have a heavier accompt to make to God for that child, then if they had not provided
a <hi>Nurse,</hi> and suffered the child to starve. God can preserve the child without <hi>Milke;</hi>
and he can save the child without a sacrament; but as that mother that throwes out,
and forsakes her child in the field, or wood, is guilty before God of the Temporall
murder of that child, though the child die not, so are those parents of a spirituall mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if their children, by their fault die unbaptized, though God preserve that child
out of his abundant, and miraculous mercy, from spirituall destruction.</p>
                     <p>When the custome of the Christian Church was to baptize but <hi>twice</hi> in the year, at
<hi>Easter,</hi> and <hi>Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

custome was grown (as it was even in the Primitive Church) that upon an opinion, that
all sins were absolutely forgiven in Baptisme, Men did defer their Baptisme, till their
<hi>death-bed,</hi> (as we see the Ecclesiasticall histories full of such examples, even in some of
the Christian <hi>Emperors:</hi> and according to this ill custome, we see <hi>Tertullian</hi> chides

                           </gap>ssionem peccatorum,</hi> why should this child, that as yet hath done no sinne, make
such hast to be washed from sinnce?) which opinion had got so much strength, that <hi>Saint
Basil</hi> was faine to oppose it, in the Easterne Church, and both the <hi>Gregories, Nazianzen</hi>
and <hi>Nissen,</hi> and <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> in the Western; yet, in the height of both their customes,
of <hi>seldome baptizing,</hi> and of <hi>late baptizing,</hi> the case of <hi>insants,</hi> that might be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of dying without baptisme, was ever excepted, So that none of those old customes,
(though some of them were extreamly ill) went ever so farre, as to an opinion, that it
were all one, whether the child were baptized or no.</p>
                     <p>I speake not this, as though the state of <hi>children</hi> that died without baptisme were
desperate; God forbid, for who shall shorten the Arme of the Lord? God is able to
raine downe <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quailes</hi> into the soules of these children, though negligent
parents turne them out into the wildernesse, and put God to that extraordinary work.
They may have <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>Quailes,</hi> but they have not the <hi>Milke,</hi> and <hi>Hony,</hi> of the
Land of promise; They may have salvation from God, but they have not those graces,
so sealed, and so testified to them, as God hath promised they should be in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
When God in spirituall offences, makes <hi>Inquisition of bloud,</hi> he proceeds not,
as Man proceeds; for we, till there appear a Man to be dead, never inquire who killed
him; but in the spirituall Murder, of an unbaptized child, though there be no child
spiritually dead, (though Gods mercy have preserved the child from that) yet God
imputes this as such a murder to them, who endangered the child, as farre as they could,
by neglecting his ordinance of baptisme.</p>
                     <p>This is then the necessity of this Sacrament; not absolutely necessary, but necessary
by Gods ordinary institution; and as it is always necessary, so is it always certaine; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is baptized according to Christs institution, receives the Sacrament of baptisme;
and the truth is always infallibly annexed with the signe; <hi>Nec fieri potest visio hominis,
ut non sit Sacramentum quod figurat;</hi> Though the wicked may feele no working
by the Sacrament, yet the Sacrament doth offer, and present grace as well to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
as to the worthy Receiver:<note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                        <hi>Nec fallaciter promittit;</hi> The wicked may be a
cause, that the Sacrament shall doe <hi>them no good;</hi> but that the Sacrament, become <hi>no
Sacrament,</hi> or that God should be false in his promises, and offer no grace, where he
pretends to offer it, this the wicked cannot doe; baptisme doth truly, and without
collusion, offer grace <hi>to all;</hi> and nothing but baptisme, by an ordinary institution, and
as an ordinary meanes, doth so: for when <hi>baptisme</hi> is called <hi>a figure,</hi> yet both that
figure is said there <hi>to save us,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> (The <hi>figure that now saveth us, baptisme;</hi> and it is a figure
<hi>of the Arke;</hi> it hath relation to it, to that Arke which did save the world, when it is
called a figure; So it may be a figure; but if we speake of reall salvation by it, baptisme
is more then a figure.</p>
                     <p>Now as our putting on of Christ was double, by <hi>faith,</hi> and by <hi>sanctification,</hi> so
by this Sacrament also, we are baptized <hi>in Nomen Christi,</hi> into the <hi>Name</hi> of Christ,
and <hi>in mortem Christi,</hi> into the <hi>death</hi> of Christ: we are not therefore baptized into
his <hi>Name,</hi> because names are imposed upon us in our baptisme: for that was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
permanently accustomed, in the Christian Church, to give a name at baptisme.
To men who were of years, and well known in the world already by their name<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> if
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93359:33"/>
they were converted to the Christian faith, the Church did not use to give <hi>new names</hi>
at their baptisme: neither to Children alwayes; but sometimes as an indifferent thing,
they left them to the custome of that country, or of that family, from which they
were derived. When <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> sayes, that he came to Milan, to <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> at
that time, <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> dari nomina oportuit,</hi> when Names were to be given, it is true, that he
speaks of a time, when <hi>Baptisme</hi> was to be administred, but that phrase of <hi>Giving of
Names,</hi> was not a receiving of Names at Baptisme, (for neither <hi>Ambrose,</hi> nor <hi>Augustine,</hi>
received any new name at their Baptisme) but it was a giving up of their Names, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistring,
a Matriculating of their Names in the book of the profession of the Christian
Religion, and a publique declaration of that profession.</p>
                     <p>To be baptized therefore <hi>into the name</hi> of Christ, is to be translated into his <hi>Family,</hi>
by this spirituall adoption, in which adoption (when it was <hi>legall</hi>) as they that were
adopted, had also the name of the family into which they were adopted, as of <hi>octavius
Octavianus,</hi> and the rest, so are we so baptized, into <hi>his name,</hi> that we are of <hi>Christus
Christiani;</hi> and therefore to become truly <hi>Christians,</hi> to live Christianly, this is truly
to be baptized into <hi>his name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>No other name is given under heaven, whereby we can be saved;</hi> nor must any other
name accompany the name of God, in our Baptisme. When therefore they teach in
the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> that it is a good Baptisme, which is administred in this forme,
<hi>I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and Sonne, and holy Ghost, and the virgin Mary,</hi>
if he which baptizes so, doe not meane in his intention, that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is <hi>equall</hi>
to the Trinity, but onely an <hi>assistant,</hi> this is not onely an impertinent, but an impious
addition to that God, that needs no assistant. And as in our baptisme, we take no
other name necessarily, but the name of Christ: So in our Christian life, we accept
no other distinctions of <hi>Iesuits,</hi> or <hi>Franciscans;</hi> but onely <hi>Christians:</hi> for we are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<hi>into his name,</hi> and the whole life of a regenerate man is a Baptisme. For as in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on Christ, <hi>sanctification</hi> doth accompany <hi>faith,</hi> so in baptisme, the imitation of
his death (that is, <hi>mortification</hi>) and the application of his passion, (by fulfilling the
sufferings of Christ in our flesh) is that <hi>baptisme into his death.</hi> Which doe so certainly
follow one another, (that he that is truly baptized into <hi>the name</hi> of Christ, is also
baptized into <hi>his death</hi>) as that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> couples them together,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note>

not suffer for you, (if all that any <hi>Paul</hi> (much lesse any <hi>Ignatins</hi>) could doe, were but
enough, and too little for himselfe) then you are not baptized into <hi>his name,</hi> nor to be

dost thou renounce the Devill?</hi> perchance they may ly in their owne behalfes; perchance
they doe not <hi>beleeve,</hi> they doe not <hi>renounce,</hi> but they speake truth in the behalfe of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93359:34"/>
the child, when they speake in the voyce of the Church who receives this child for
her childe, and binds her selfe to exhibit, and reach out to that child, her spirituall
<hi>paps,</hi> for her future nourishment thereof. How comes it to passe, says <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi>
that when a man presents another mans child at the font, to be baptized, if the
Minister should aske him, Shall this man child be a valiant man, or a wise man, shall
this woman child, be a chast, and a continent woman? the surety would answer, I <hi>cannot
tell,</hi> and yet, if he be ask'd, of that child, of so few dayes old, <hi>Doth that child beleeve
in God now, will he renounce the Devill hereafter?</hi> the surety answers confidently, in his
behalfe, for the beleefe, and for the renouncing: How comes this to passe, says <hi>Saint
Augustine?</hi> He answers to this, that as <hi>Sacramentum Corporis Christi, est secundum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Corpus Christi,</hi> so <hi>Sacramentum fidei est fides;</hi> As the Sacrament of the body, and
bloud of Christ is, in some sense, and in a kinde, the body, and bloud of Christ, says
<hi>Augustine,</hi> so in the <hi>sacrament of faith,</hi> says he, (that is, Baptisme) there is <hi>some kinde of
faith.</hi> Here is a child borne of <hi>faithfull parents;</hi> and there is the voyce of God, who hath
sealed a Covenant <hi>to them, and their seed;</hi> Here are <hi>sureties,</hi> that live (by Gods grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spirit) in the unity, and in the bosome of the Church: and so, the parents present
it to <hi>them,</hi> they present it to the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Church takes it into her care; It is
still the <hi>naturall child,</hi> of her parents, who begot it, it is the <hi>spirituall child</hi> of the
Sureties that present it; but it is the <hi>Christian child</hi> of the Church, who in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Baptisme, gives it a new inanimation, and who, if either <hi>parents,</hi> or <hi>sureties,</hi>
should neglect their parts, will have a care of it, and breed it up to a perfection, and full
growth of that faith, whereof it hath this day, an inchoation and beginning.</p>
                     <p>As then we have said, that <hi>Baptisme</hi> is a death, a death of sinne, and as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
sinne dyes not without <hi>faith,</hi> so also can there be no death of sinne, without
<hi>sorrow,</hi> and <hi>contrition,</hi> which onely washes away sinne: as therefore we see the Church,
and Christs institution, furnishes this child, with <hi>faith,</hi> which it hath not of it selfe,
so let us bring to this action, that <hi>sorrow</hi> and that condoling, that we produce into
the world such miserable wretches, as even by <hi>peccatum involuntarium,</hi> by that sinne,
to which no act, nay no will of theirs concurred, that is, <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> are yet put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the state of damnation.</p>
                     <p>But let us also rejoyce, in our owne, and this childes behalfe, that as we that have
been baptized, so this child, that shall be, have, and shall put on Christ Jesus in
Baptisme.<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> Both as a <hi>garment,</hi> for <hi>Sacramenta sunt vestimenta,</hi> As Christ is a garment,
so the Sacraments are Christs garment,<note place="margin">Idem.</note> and as such a garment; as <hi>Ornat militem,</hi> and
<hi>convincit desertores,</hi> It gives him, that continues in Gods battailes, a dignity, and
discovers him that forsakes Gods tents, to be a fugitive; Baptisme is a <hi>garland,</hi>
in which two ends are brought together, he begins aright, and perseveres, so,
<hi>Ornat militem,</hi> It is an honour to him, that fights out in Gods battaile, but
<hi>Convincit Desertorem,</hi> Baptisme is our prest-money, and if we forsake our colours,
after we have received that, even that forfaits our lives; our very having been
baptized, shall aggravate our condemnation. Yea it is such a garment, as those
of the children of Israel in the wildernesse, which are (by some expositors)
thought to have growne all the forty yeares, with their bodies; for so by Gods blessed
provision, shall <hi>grace</hi> grow with this infant, to the lifes end. And both we and it,
shall not onely put on Christ, as a <hi>garment,</hi> but we shall put on his <hi>person,</hi> and we shall
stand before his Father, with the confidence, and assurance of bearing his person, and
the dignity of his innocence.</p>

no morter, all of one <hi>Nature;</hi> Nothing but <hi>spirit,</hi> and <hi>spirit,</hi> and <hi>spirit,</hi> the soule

they imply a delay in the spouse of Christ, and so in every soule too, that when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93359:35"/>
Christ called here, the soule was not ready to come forth to him, but made her
<hi>excuses,</hi> that she <hi>had put off her coate,</hi> and <hi>was loath to rise to put it on,</hi> that she had
<hi>washed her feet,</hi> and <hi>was loath to rise,</hi> and <hi>foule them againe,</hi> yet because the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
it selfe, (if it were an excuse) hath a piety, and a Religious care in it, the Fathers
for the most part, pretermit that weaknesse that produced an excuse, and consider in

once washed.<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> says, that the soule had laid off, <hi>Omnia externa, quae

suing therefore their pious acceptation of these words, we have in them, two <hi>festivalls</hi>
of the soule, a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and an <hi>ascension</hi> of it; This soule hath raised it selfe, from

how shall I defile them? Call these two parts a <hi>Gratulation</hi> of the soule, and an

                        </hi> and then she
conceives a Religious scorne and indignation, of setting her foot in the same foule

&amp; this <hi>Ascension</hi> of the soul &amp; <hi>Indignation,</hi> will be our two parts. And in the first, we shal

is a washing, that is necessary to all; for we enter in foulenesse, and corruption into

sealed in the other <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and properly, that is for <hi>actuall sinnes;</hi>
Thirdly, in this ablution, there is an <hi>Ego lavi,</hi> there is a washing, and <hi>I my selfe</hi> doe
something towards this cleansing of my selfe; And fourthly, it is <hi>Lavi,</hi> it is, I <hi>have</hi>
washed, not <hi>Lavabo,</hi> it is not, I <hi>will</hi> wash; it is already done, it is not put off to mine
<hi>age,</hi> nor to my <hi>death bed,</hi> but <hi>Lavi,</hi> I <hi>have</hi> washed; And lastly, it is <hi>Pedes meas,</hi> I
have washed <hi>mine owne feet;</hi> for if by my teaching, I cleanse <hi>others,</hi> and remaine, by
my bad life, in foule ways my selfe, I am not within this text, <hi>Lavi pedes meos;</hi> I
have not washed my feet; But if we have sincerely performed the first part, we shall
performe the other too, <hi>Quomodo,</hi> we shall come into a religious detestation, and
indignation of falling into the same foulenesse againe.</p>
                     <p>To passe then through all these (for of all these that's true which Saint <hi>Basil</hi> says of

to his Apostles, and in them, to all the world, by his <hi>practise,</hi> and by his <hi>precept</hi>

he <hi>washed their feet;</hi>

These preparatory waters are the gift of the holy Ghost, the working of
his grace in repentance; but <hi>pelvis Ecclesia,</hi> the bason is the Church; that is,
these graces are distributed, and dispensed to us, in his institution, and ordinance
in the Church: No Man can wash himselfe at first, by <hi>Baptisme;</hi> no Man can
<hi>baptize himselfe;</hi> no Man can wash in the second liquor, no Man, (that is but a
Man) can administer the <hi>other Sacrament to himselfe: Pelvis ecclesia,</hi> the Church is
the bason, and Gods Minister in the Church, washes in both these cases. And, in
this <hi>ablutione pedum,</hi> in the preparatory washing of our feet, by a survey of all our
sinfull actions and repentance of them, no Man can <hi>absolve himselfe,</hi> but <hi>pelvis

                     <p>First then this washing of the feet, which prepares us for the great washing, in

                     <p>The washing of our feet then, being a cleane, and pure and sincere examination

<hi>Castitas in Iuventute,</hi> a pure, and chaste disposition, in the years, and places of

that washes our feet; This is <hi>sound wisdome,</hi> and discretion, to strip, and lay open
our feet, our sinfull actions, by <hi>Confession;</hi> To cover them, and wrap them up by

of the <hi>bloud</hi> of Christ Jesus, in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> for that's the seale of all;
And Christ in the washing of his disciples feet, tooke <hi>a towell to dry them,</hi> as well,
as water to wash them; so when he hath brought us to this washing of our feet,
to a serious consideration of our actions, and to repentant teares, for them, <hi>Absterget

                     <p>There is a washing then, absolutely, generally necessary, the water of <hi>Baptisme;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ego.</note>
and a washing occasionally necessary, because we fall into actuall sinnes, the <hi>bloud</hi>
of our Saviour in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and there is a washing between these, preparatory
to the last washing, the water of <hi>Contrite,</hi> and <hi>repentant teares,</hi> in opening our selves
to God, and shutting up of our selves against future tentations: of the two first, the
<hi>two Sacraments, sons in Ecclesia,</hi> the whole <hi>spring,</hi> and river is in the Church,
there is no <hi>baptisme,</hi> no <hi>bloud</hi> of Christ, but in the Church; And of this later,
which is most properly <hi>ablutio pedum,</hi> the washing of the feet, that is, <hi>teares</hi> shed
in repentance of our sinfull lives, of this water, there is <hi>Pelvis in Ecclesia,</hi> the
<hi>Bason</hi> is in the Church; for our best repentance (though this repentance be at home
in our owne hearts) doth yet receive a Seale, from the <hi>absolution</hi> of Gods Ministers
in the Church. But yet though there be no cleansing, but from the spirit of God,
no ordinary working of Gods spirit, but in the Church, and his ordinances there,
yet <hi>we our selves</hi> are not so left out, in this work, but that the spouse here, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
carefull soule here says, truly, <hi>Ego lavi, I</hi> my <hi>selfe</hi> have <hi>washed my feet;</hi> which
is our third branch.</p>
                     <p>It is said often in Philosophy, <hi>Nihil in intellectu, quod non prius in sensu;</hi> till
some <hi>sense</hi> apprehend a thing, the <hi>Iudgment</hi> cannot debate it, nor discourse it; It
may well be said in <hi>Divinity</hi> too, <hi>Nihil in gratia, quod non prius in natura,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in grace, that was not first in nature, so farre, as that grace always finds
nature, and naturall faculties to work on; though that nature be not disposed to
the receiving of grace, when it comes, yet that nature, and those faculties, which
may be so disposed by grace, are there, before that grace comes. And the grace of
God doth not work this cleansing, but where there is a sweet, and souple, and
tractable, and ductile disposition wrought in that soule. This disposition is <hi>no cause
why</hi> God gives his grace; for there is no cause, but his own meer, and unmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
goodnesse; But yet, <hi>without</hi> such a disposition, God would not give that;
and therefore <hi>let us cleanse our selves from all filthinesse,</hi> says the Apostle;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> There
is something, which <hi>we ourselves</hi> may doe. A Man that had powred out himselfe
in a vehement, and corrupt solicitation of the chastity of any woman, if he found
himselfe surprized by the presence of a husband, or a father, he could give over in
the midst of a protestation; A Man that had set one foot into a house of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
provocations, if he saw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

backe; A Man that had drawne his sword to rob a passenger, if he saw a <hi>hue and cry</hi>
come, could give over that; and all this is upon the <hi>Ego lavi,</hi> I have washed;
without use of <hi>grace,</hi> his owne <hi>naturall reason</hi> declines him from that sinne then.
How long shall we make this bad use, of this true doctrine, that, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe <hi>enough,</hi> for our salvation, therefore we will doe <hi>nothing?</hi> Shall I see any
Man shut out of heaven, that did what he could upon earth? Thou that canst
mourne for any worldly losse, mourne for thy sinne; Thou that lovest meetings of
company for society, and conversation, love the meeting of the Saints of God, in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93359:37"/>
the Congregation, and communion of Saints; Thou that lovest the Rhetorique, the
Musique, the wit, the sharpnesse, the eloquence, the elegancy, of <hi>other authors,</hi> love
even those things in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> in the word of God, where they abound more,
then in other authors. Put but thy affections out of their ordinary sinfull way,
and then <hi>Lavasti pedes,</hi> thou hast washed thy feet; and God will take thy work
in hand, and raise a building farre beyond the compasse, and comprehension of thy
foundation; that which the soule began, but in <hi>good nature,</hi> shall be perfected in
<hi>grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But doe it quickly; for the glory of this soule here was in the <hi>Lavi;</hi> It is not
<hi>Lavabo;</hi> that she <hi>had</hi> already; not that she <hi>would</hi> wash her feet;<note place="margin">Lavi.</note> since thou art come
to know thy naturall uncleannesse, and <hi>baptisme</hi> for that, and thine actuall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and that for that, there is a River, that brings thee into the maine Sea, (the
water of <hi>repentance</hi> leads thee to the bottomelesse Sea of the bloud of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
in the Sacrament) continue not in thy foulenesse, in confidence that all shall
be drowned in that at last, whensoever thou wilt come to it. It was a common,
but an erroneous practise, even in the Primitive Church, to defer their <hi>baptisme,</hi> till
they were <hi>old;</hi> because an opinion prevailed upon them, that baptisme discharged
them of all sinnes, they used to be baptized then, when they were past sinning, that
so they might passe out of this world, in that innocency, which their baptisme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in them: And out of this custome; Men grew to be the more carelesse all
their lives, because all was done at once in baptisme. But says Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in

doe not thinke to put off all to the <hi>washing weeke;</hi> all thy sinnes, all thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,

and not find it; teares for worldly losses, teares for sinne, teares for bodily anguish,
may overflow thee then; and whereas Gods goodnesse to those, that are his, is, <hi>ut
abstergat omnem Lachrymam,</hi> to <hi>wipe all teares from their eyes; absterget nullam Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi>
he may leave all unwiped upon thee, he may leave thy soule to sinke, and to
shipwracke, under this tempest, and inundation, and current of divers tides; teares
of all kinds, and ease of none: for those of whom it is said, <hi>Deus absterget omnem lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi>
God shall wipe all teares from their eyes, are they <hi>Qui laverunt Stolas,</hi> (as we
see there) who have <hi>already washed their long robes, and made them white in the bloud
of the Lambe:</hi> who have already by teares of repentance, become worthy receivers of
the seale of reconciliation, in the Sacrament of his body, and bloud; To them, God
shall wipe all teares from their eyes; but to the unrepentant sinner, he shall multiply
teares; from teares, for the losse, of a horse, or of a house, to teares for the losse of
a soule, and wipe no teare from his eyes.</p>
                     <p>But yet though this <hi>Lavi,</hi> exclude the <hi>Lavabo,</hi> as it is dilatory, that is, I will wash,
but not yet, yet it excludes not the <hi>Lavabo,</hi> I will wash, as it is an <hi>often washing;</hi> I
must come to that, <hi>Lavi,</hi> I have washed, but yet I will wash againe: for till our feet
be so washed, as that they be wrapped up in our last linnen, and so raised from the
ground, as that they be laid upon other Mens shoulders, our feet will touch the
ground againe and need new washing. When Christ washed his disciples feet, there is
agreat difference amongst the Fathers, where he beganne, <hi>whose feet he washed first:</hi>
Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> thinke he beganne with <hi>Peter;</hi> they thinke Christ
respected the dignity of his person: <hi>origen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augustine &amp; Bernard. Origen &amp; Chrysostome.</note> and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> thinke he beganne with
<hi>Iudas;</hi> they thinke Christ respected the necessity of the Patient, and applied the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique
soonest, where the disease was most malignant, and venemous. None of them
say he beganne with <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom it is cleere he loved most. If any soule have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
that Christ came <hi>late</hi> to her washing, not till now, let her not argue, to her
owne danger, that he loved her the lesse for that: if he have suffered <hi>sinne to abound,</hi>
that <hi>grace might abound,</hi> what Patient shall dare to appoint, that Physitian his <hi>Dosis,</hi>
or his times; whomsoever he washed <hi>first</hi> of his Apostles, he washed them <hi>all;</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93359:37"/>
to him that was forwardest ever in his owne strength, to <hi>Peter,</hi> he said, <hi>Non habebis
partem,</hi> If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me; If we come not to this
washing of our feet, this preparatory washing by teares of <hi>repentance,</hi> we can have no
part in him, that is, in the participation of his body, and his bloud; but when he hath
brought us to this <hi>Iordan,</hi> which is <hi>Fluvius Iudicii,</hi> the water of Judgment, and that
we have judged, and condemned our selves of this Leprosie of sinne, <hi>Lavemur septies,</hi>
let us often call our selves to account, implore the councell often, often accept the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
of Gods Minister, and often settle our soules, in a true peace, by a worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the seale thereof, in the Sacrament: And as in that we come to the <hi>Lavi,</hi>
(a peacefull testimony, that we <hi>have</hi> washed our consciences) so let us pursue it with
a <hi>Lavabo,</hi> with an humble acknowledgment, that we fall every day, and every day

their rent at the years end, but <hi>quarterly,</hi> or in shorter termes, so from such beggerly
and bankrupt soules as ours are, God is not content with an anniversary repentance
once a yeare, at <hi>Easter;</hi> but we shall finde our rent, our payment heavy enough, if we
pay every day, and wash our feet every night, for the uncleannesses of that one day.</p>
                     <p>To shut up this part then; This washing of the feet, is the spirit of <hi>discerning,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There remaines yet a second part: and perchance but a little time for it; and I shall
proportion, and fit my selfe to it. It is, That as this soule had a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> she hath

                           </gap>scension;</hi> As she had <hi>vocem gratulantis,</hi> a thanksgiving, that she hath washed her
feet, so she hath <hi>vocem indignantis,</hi> a religious scorne and indignation, to fall into those
foule ways againe. For this holy indignation, is one linke in the Apostles chaine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
where, upon Godly <hi>sorrow,</hi> depends <hi>care,</hi> and upon that, cleansing of our selves,
and upon that <hi>indignation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note> and so <hi>feare,</hi> and so <hi>desire,</hi> and so <hi>zeale,</hi> and
so <hi>punishments</hi> of our selves: every linke worthy of a longer consideration;
but here we consider onely this <hi>indignation;</hi> when that soule that is washed, and
thereby sees, to what a faire conformity with her Saviour she is come, is come also to
a scorne, to a disdaine to compare any beauty in this world, to that face, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells desire to looke upon; any nearenesse to great persons in this world, to the <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of the Lambe wheresoever he goes;</hi> any riches of this world, to that riches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the poverty of Christ Jesus hath made us rich; any length of life in this world,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93359:38"/>
to that union which we shall have, to the <hi>Antient of dayes;</hi> where even the everli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, shall not overlive us, but carry out our days to the unmeasured measure
of his owne, to eternity. This indignation, this soule expresses here, in this question,
<hi>Quomodo, how shall I defile them?</hi> First then, this voice of indignation, hath this force;
<hi>Quomodo, how shall I defile them,</hi> is, <hi>how is it possible,</hi> that <hi>I should defile</hi> them? I have
washed my feet, repented my sinnes and taken the seale of my Reconciliation, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> and that hath this effect, <hi>ut sensum minuat in minimis, &amp; toliat consensum in
magnis peccatis,</hi> That <hi>grace,</hi> that God gives in the Sacrament, makes us lesse sensible
of small tentations, (they move us not) and it makes us resist, and not yeild to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
tentations; since I am in this state, <hi>Quomodo inquinubo? How shall I defile them?</hi>
The difference will be, of whom thou askest this question: If thou aske the world, the
world will tell thee, well enough. <hi>Quomodo, How;</hi> It will tell thee, that it is a <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi>
thing, to sit thinking upon thy sinnes; That it is an unsociable thing, to seeke him,
who cannot be seen, an invisible God; That it is poore company, to passe thy time
with a <hi>Priest;</hi> Thou maiest defile thy selfe againe, by forgetting thy sinnes, and so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them over againe: And thou maist defile thy selfe againe by <hi>remembring</hi> thy sins,
and so sinne over thy sinnes againe, in a sinfull delight of thy passed sinnes, and a desire
that thou couldst commit them againe. There are answers enough to this <hi>Quomodo,
How, how should I defile them,</hi> if thou aske the world: but aske thy Saviour, and he shall
tell thee,<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>That whosoever hath this water, shall never thirst more, but that water shall be in
him an everlasting spring;</hi> that is, he shall find meanes to keep himselfe in that clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> to which he is come; and neither <hi>things present, nor things to come shall separate
him from the love of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the voice of this religious indignation, <hi>Quomodo,</hi> is, how is it <hi>possible,</hi> but it is
also, <hi>Quomodo, how,</hi> that is, <hi>why should I?</hi> The first is, <hi>how should I be so base,</hi> the other,
<hi>how should I be so bold?</hi> Though I have my pardon, written in the bloud of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
sealed to me in his Sacrament, brought home to me in the testimony of the holy
Ghost, pleaded for me, at the tribunall of the Father, yet as Princes pardons have, so
Gods pardons have too, this clause, <hi>It a quod se bene gerat;</hi> He that is pardoned must
continue of good behaviour; for whensoever he breakes the peace, he forfeits his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
When I returne to my repented sinnes againe, I am under the burden of all my
former sinnes, and my very repentance, contracts the nature of a sinne: and therefore
<hi>Quomodo, how should I,</hi> that is, <hi>why should I defile them?</hi> To restore you to your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to send you away with the meditation, which concernes you most, consider,
what an astonishment this would be, that when Christ Jesus shall lay open the great
volumes of all your sinnes, to <hi>your sight,</hi> who had forgot them, and to <hi>their sight,</hi>
from whom you had disguised them, at the last judgement, when you shall heare all the
wantonnesses of your youth, all the Ambitions of your middle years, all the covetous
desires of your age, published in that presence, and thinke then, this is the worst that
can be said, or laid to my charge, this is the last indictment, and the last evidence, there
shall follow your very <hi>repentances</hi> in the list of your <hi>sinnes,</hi> and it shall be told you, and
all the world then, Here, and here you deluded that God, that forbore to inflict his
Judgements, upon <hi>new vowes, new contracts, new promises,</hi> between <hi>you</hi> and <hi>him;</hi> even
your repentances shall bind up that booke, and tye your old sinnes, and new relapses
into one body. And let this meditation bring you <hi>ad vocem gratulantis,</hi> to rejoyce once
againe in this <hi>Lavi pedes,</hi> that you have now washed your feet, in a present sorrow, and
<hi>ad vocem indignantis,</hi> to a stronger indignation, and faster resolution, then heretofore
you have had, never to defile them againe.</p>

this Prophet. These words have a three-fold acceptation, and admit a three-fold
exposition; for, first, they are a <hi>Commination,</hi> the Prophet threatens the Jewes;
Secondly, they are a <hi>Commonition,</hi> the Prophet instructs all future ages; Thirdly,
they are<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a <hi>Consolation,</hi> which hath reference to the Consummation of all, to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at the generall Judgement. First, he foretels the Jewes of their imminent <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;</hi>
Howsoever you build upon the <hi>pactum salis,</hi> the Covenant of salt, the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Covenant, that God will be your God, and this land your land, yet since that
confidence sears you up in your sins, <hi>Arise and depart, for this is not your rest,</hi> your
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> must be chang'd into <hi>Babylon;</hi> there's the Commination: Secondly, he
warns us, who are bedded and bedrid in our sins; howsoever you say to your selves,
<hi>Soule take thy rest,</hi> enjoy the honors, the pleasures, the abundances of this world, <hi>Tush
the Lord sees it not,</hi> The Master will not come, we may ly still safely, and rest in the
fruition of this Happinesse, yet this Rest will betray you, this rest will deliver you over
to eternall disquiet: And therefore <hi>arise and depart, for this is not your Rest,</hi> and that's
the Commonition. And in the third acceptation of the words as they may have relation
to the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> they may well admit a little inversion; Howsoever you feel a
Resurrection by <hi>grace</hi> from the works of death, and darknesse in this life, yet in this
life, there is no assurednesse, that he that is risen, and thinks he stands, shall not fall;
here you <hi>arise and depart,</hi> that is, rise from your sins, and depart from your sinfull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
but you arise, and depart so too, that you fall, and depart again into your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
purposes, after you have risen; and therefore <hi>Depart and arise, for here is not your
rest;</hi> till you depart altogether out of this world, and rise to Judgement, you can have
no such rest, as can admit no disquiet no perturbation; but then you shall; and that's
the Consolation.</p>
                     <p>First then, as the words concern the <hi>Iewes;</hi> Here is first an increpation,<note place="margin">1. Part. Divisio.</note> a rebuke,
that they are fallen from their station, and their dignity, implied in the first word, <hi>Arise,</hi>
for then they were <hi>fallen;</hi> Secondly, here is a demonstration in the same word, That
though they lik'd that state into which they were fallen, which was a security, and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse
in their sins, yet they should not enjoy even that security, and that stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse,
that fall of theirs, but they should lose that; though it were but a false
contentment, yet they should be rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'d out of that, <hi>Arise;</hi> first <hi>arise,</hi> because you are
<hi>fallen,</hi> and then, <hi>arise,</hi> though you think your selves at <hi>ease<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> by that fall. And then
thirdly, here is a continuation of Gods anger, when they are risen; for they are not
rais'd to their former state and dignity, from which they were fallen, they are not rais'd
to be established, but it is <hi>arise,</hi> and <hi>depart;</hi> And in all this (which is a fourth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration)
God precludes them from any hope by solicitation, he reveales his purpose
his Decree, and consequently his inexorablenesse evidently, in that word, <hi>for;</hi> never
murmur, never dispute, never intreat, you must depart, <hi>For</hi> it is determined, it
is resolved, and here is not <hi>your Rest;</hi> In which also the Commination is yet more and
more aggravated; first, in that they lose their Rest, which God hath sold them so dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by so many battailes, and so many afflictions, and which God had sworn to them
so solemnly by so many ratifications; they must lose their Rest, they must have no
Rest, <hi>Here;</hi> not there; not in the Land of Promise it selfe; And then lastly, as they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93359:39"/>
are denied all rest there; There, where was the wombe, and Center of their Rest, so
there is no intimation, no hope given, that they should have rest any where else, for as
they were <hi>to rise,</hi> onely <hi>to depart,</hi> so they were to depart into Captivity.</p>
                     <p>The first is an increpation, they were <hi>fallen;</hi> but from whence? It was once said,<note place="margin">Increpatio. Ceciderunt.</note>
                        <hi>Qui jacet in terra, non habet unde cadat,</hi> but he that is earth it selfe, whither can he
fall? whither can Man, derived from earth before his life, enamored of the earth, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
it, and maried to it in his life, destined to the earth, betrothed to it for a second
mariage after this life, whither can he fall? It is true of us all, <hi>I shall say to corruption,
Thou art my father, and to the worme, Thou art my Mother, and my sister;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 16. 14.</note> and can we fall
into worse company, contract an alliance with a more base, and beggerly kindred then
this? Not if we were left there; then we could not: but when we consider a nation,
of whom God hath said, <hi>sponsabo te mihi,</hi> I will mary thee, without any respect of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
in thy lownesse, I will not refuse thee for it, I will not upbraid thee with it,
<hi>I will mary thee for ever,</hi> and without any purpose of divorce <hi>(sponsabo in aeternum,)</hi> of
this nation thus assum'd, thus contracted, thus endowed, thus assured, why may not
we wonder as vehemently, as the Prophet did, of the fallen Angels, <hi>Quomodo cecidisti
de caelo, Lucifer filius Orientis,</hi> how did this nation fall out of Gods armes, out of Gods
bosome? Himselfe tells us how; what he had done to exalt them, what they had done
to devest his favours: for their <hi>naturall lownes,</hi> he says, <hi>In thy nativity when thou wast born,
thy Navell was not cut, thou wast not washed, thou wast not salted, thou wast not swadled; No
eye pitied thee, but thou wast cast into the open fields in contempt, I passed by,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 3.</note> and saw thee in
thy bloud, and said thou shalt live;</hi> I sware unto thee, and entred into a covenant with
thee, and thou becamest mine; I washed thee, anointed thee, and adorned thee:
and thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I set upon thee; well then, in this state,
<hi>Quomodo cecidisti de caelo;</hi> how fell she out of Gods armes, out of his bosome? thus;
<hi>Thou didst trust in thine owne beauty,</hi> because of thy renowne, <hi>and so playedst the harlor.</hi>
When that nation was <hi>in massa damnata,</hi> a loafe of <hi>Adams</hi> dow, through all which the
infectious leaven of sin had passed without difference, when that nation had no more
title, nor pretence to Gods mercy, then any of their fellow wormes, when God
had heaped, and accumulated his <hi>tempor all blessings</hi> upon them, and above all, dwelt
with them, in the alliance, and in the familiarity of a <hi>particular Religion,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
God and them, and left out all the world beside, when God had imprinted
this beauty in them, and that they had a renowne, and reputation for that, <hi>they trusted
to their owne beauty,</hi> (to worship whom they would, and how they would) they <hi>followed
their own invention;</hi> yea they trusted in beauty, which was not their owne, in borrowed
beauty, in painted beauty, and so tooke in, and applied themselves to all the spirituall
fornications, to all the Idolatries of the nations about them; some that were too <hi>absurd</hi>
to be hearkned to; some too <hi>obscene,</hi> and foule to be named now by us, though the
Prophets, (to their farther reproach, and confusion) have named them; some, too
<hi>ridiculous</hi> to fall into any Mans consideration, that could seriously thinke of a Majesty,
in a God, which should be worshipped; yet all these, absurd, and obscene, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Idolatries, they prostituted them selves unto.</p>
                     <p>Take them in their lowness, for any disposition towards the next world, and this was
their state, <hi>Their navell was not cut;</hi> that is, they were still incorporated into their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to earth, and to sinne; and they were not one step higher, then all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
in <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, whose top is in heaven. Take them in their <hi>dignity in this
world,</hi> and then we finde them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they were not <hi>Personae,</hi> but <hi>Res,</hi> they
were not their <hi>Masters Men,</hi> but their <hi>Masters goods;</hi> they were their cattell, to vex, and
wear out, with their labours spent upon the delights of others; They must goe farre
<hi>for straw;</hi> a great labour, for a little matter; and they must <hi>burne it,</hi> when they had
brought it; they must <hi>make bricke,</hi> but others must build houses, with their materialls,

them then?</p>
                     <p>This was their dejection, their exinanition in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if we shall beginne there to
consider, what he did for them: As after, in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> he made the <hi>bloud</hi> of
the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the seed of the Church, so in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he propagated, and multiplied his

Children, in the midst of their cruell oppressions, and slaughters, as though their <hi>bloud</hi>
had been <hi>seed</hi> to encrease by; under the weight of their depressions, he gave them growth,
and stature, and strength, as though their <hi>wounds</hi> had been <hi>playsters,</hi> and their <hi>vexations
cordials;</hi> when he had made Egypt as a <hi>Hell,</hi> by kindling all his plagues, in her bosome,

sword should have lessen'd, whom labour should have creepled, whom contempt should

the <hi>booke of life,</hi> to shew them their Names, their security, and he shut the sea, as
that book, upon the Egyptians, to shew them their irrecoverable exclusion. If we

that he fought for them, in an out-stretched arm, the battails, that they fought against
him, in the stifnesse of their necks, and their <hi>murmuring,</hi> we must, to their confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

would have come in to his subjection, upon the thousand part of that which he did for
the Israelites in their way. But for that which he did for them, at home, when he had
planted them in the Land of Promise, as it were an ungratefull thing, not to remember

and Prophers, in the mean time, and there you see their true height; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the abominations, and Idolatries, in which they had plung'd, and buried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and there you see their lownesse, how far they were fallen.</p>
                     <p>This then was their descent;<note place="margin">Non gaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt.</note> and as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> sayes (when he describes this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
of the Jewes, into all manner of abominations) one step of this stayre, of this
descent, is, <hi>unnaturall affection,</hi> they were unnaturall to themselves; that is, not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of their own misery, but were proud of their fall, and thought themselves at ease
in their ruine; and another stayre in this fall is,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28.</note> that <hi>God had delivered them up to a
reprobate mind,</hi> to suffer them to think so still. And then for their farther vexation,
God would take from them, even that false, that imaginary comfort of theirs. <hi>Surgite,</hi>
sayes God, since you have made that perverse shift, to take comfort in your fall, Arise
from that, from that security, from that stupidity, for you shall not chuse but see your
misery; when all the people were descended to that basenesse, (as nothing is more
base, then to court the world, and the Devill, for poore and wretched delights, when
we may have plentifull, and rich abundance in our confidence in God) when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were all of one mind, and one voice, <hi>omnes unius labii,</hi> their hearts,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. Aug.</note> and tongues
spoke all one language, and, <hi>(populus tanto deterior, quanto in deterioribus concors,</hi> Men
are the worse, the more they are, and the more unanime, and constant they are in ill
purposes) when they were all come to that <hi>Venite comburamus,</hi> Come, and let us burn
brick, and trust in our own work, and <hi>Venite, aedificemus,</hi> Come, and let us build a
tower, and provide a safety for our selves; since they would descend from their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
(which dignity consists in the service of God, whose service is perfect freedome)
God would descend with them, <hi>Venite descendamus,</hi> sayes God; but what to doe?
<hi>Descendamus, ut confundamus,</hi> let us goe down to confound their language, and to
scatter them upon the earth. <hi>Ascensio mendax, descensio crudelis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bern.</note> sayes holy <hi>Bernard,</hi>
A false ascending, is a cruell descending: when we lye weltring in our bloud, secure
in our sins, and can flatter our selves, that we are well, and where we would be, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
ascension, is a cruell descent into hell; we lye still, we feel no pain, but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have broke our necks; we doe not grone, we doe not sigh, but it is, because
our breath is gone, the spirit of God is departed from us. They were descended to
a flatnesse of tast, Egyptian <hi>Onions</hi> had a better savor, then the <hi>Manna</hi> of heaven; They
were descended to a new-fanglednesse in <hi>Civill government,</hi> they liked the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
amongst their neighbours, better then that of <hi>Iudges,</hi> which God had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93359:40"/>
for them then; They were descended to a newfanglednesse in matter of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
to the embracing of a foraine, and a frivolous, and an Idolatrous worship of
God: but then being in their descent, when they delighted in it, as <hi>Sea-sick</hi> men, who
had rather be troden upon, then rise up, then God frustrate that false joy and false ease
of theirs, he rouses them from all that, which they had proposed to themselves, <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite,
arise,</hi> arise from this security, because you are fallen, you <hi>should</hi> rise, but because
you love your misery, you <hi>shall</hi> rise, you shall come to a sense, and knowledge of it, you
shall not enjoy the ease of an ignorance.</p>
                     <p>But he raised them not,<note place="margin">Depart.</note> to reestablish them, to restore them to their former dignity;
there was no comfort in that <hi>Surgite,</hi> which was accompanied with an <hi>Ite, arise and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part:</hi>
and depart into captivity. If we compare the captivity, which they were going
into, (that of <hi>Babylon</hi>) with the other bondage, which they had been delivered from,
(that of <hi>Egypt</hi>) it is true, there were many, and reall, and important differences. That
of <hi>Egypt</hi> was <hi>Ergastulum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 6. 6. Deut. 4. 20.</note> a <hi>prison;</hi> and it was <hi>fornax ferrea,</hi> an Iron fornace; but in
<hi>Babylon,</hi> they were not <hi>slaves,</hi> as they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but they were such a kind of <hi>prisoners,</hi>
as onely had not liberty, to returne to their owne countrey. But yet, if we consider
their state in <hi>Egypt</hi> in their <hi>roote,</hi> in <hi>Iacob,</hi> and in his sonnes, they came for food thither
in a time of necessity; and consider them in that <hi>branch</hi> that overshadowed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
them, in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> he came thither as a bondman, in a servile condition. So that
they were but few persons, and not so great, as that their pressures could be aggravated,
or taste much more the bitterly, by comparing it, with any greatnesse which they had
before; Though they were fallen into great misery, they were not fallen from any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
greatnesse. But between the two captivities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> they
were come to that greatnesse, and reputation, as that they had the testimony of all the
world,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Onely this people is wise, and of understanding, and a great nation.</hi> Now wherein? In
that which followes; <hi>what nation is so great, as to have the Lord come so neare unto them;</hi>
so great, as to have <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances, so righteous, as they had?</hi> Now
this peculiar greatnesse, they lost in this captivity; whether they lost absolutely the
<hi>bookes of the Law,</hi> or not, and that they were reinspired, and redictated againe by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost to <hi>Esdras,</hi> or whether <hi>Esdras</hi> did but recollect them, and recompile them,
Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> will not determine: He will not say whether <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Esdras,</hi> be author
of the first five bookes of the Bible; but it is cleare enough, that they were out of that
ordinary use wherein they had been before: and though they kept their <hi>Circumcision,</hi>
and their <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet being cast thither for their sinnes, they had lost all
ordinary expiations of their sinnes, for they had <hi>no sacrifices</hi> there; (as the <hi>Iews,</hi>
which are now <hi>in dispersion,</hi> are everywhere without their sacrifices) They were to
rise, but not to stay, <hi>Arise and depart;</hi> And they were to depart, both from their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
comforts, which they had framed, and proposed to themselves (when they were
fallen from God, they should be deceived in their trust in themselves) and they were
to depart even with the law, and ordinances, in which their preheminence, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
above all nations consisted: when Man comes to be content with this world,
God will take this world from him: when Man frames to himselfe imaginary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
God will inflict reall punishments; when he would lie still, he shall not sleep; but
God will take him and raise him, but to a farther vexation.</p>
                     <p>And this vexation hath another heavy weight upon it,<note place="margin">Quia.</note> in this little word, <hi>for;</hi> for
this drawes a Curtain between the face of God, and them: this locks a dore between
the Court of mercy, and them, when God presents his judgements with such an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse,
such a resolution, as leaves no hope in their heart, that God will alter it, no
power in themselves to solicite God to a pardon,<note place="margin">Prov.</note> or a reprieve; but as he was led <hi>as a
foole to the stocks,</hi> when he hearkened to pleasant sins before, so he is led <hi>as an oxe to
the slaughters,</hi> when he hears of Gods Judgements now; his own Conscience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
God, and tels him, there is a <hi>for,</hi> a reason, a necessity, an irrecoverablenesse in
his condemnation. God had iterated, and multiplied this <hi>Quia,</hi> this <hi>for,</hi> oftentimes
in their ears: This Prophet was no upstart, no sodain, no transitory Man, to passe
through the streets with a <hi>Vae, Vae, Wo, wo unto this City,</hi> and no more; but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
constantly,<note place="margin">v. 1.</note> during the reign of <hi>three Kings,</hi> of <hi>Iotham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah:</hi>
He was no suspitious Man out of his singularity; but he prophecied jointly with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah,</hi>
without separation, and he held the communion of his fellow-Prophets; He
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93359:40"/>
was no particular man, (as many Interpreters have taken it) so, as that he addressed
his prophecies upon <hi>Iudah</hi> onely; but he extended it to all, to all the Tribes. It
is not a prophecy limited to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the sins against the first Table, but to rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
and murder, and fornication, and oppression, and the sins between <hi>Man,</hi> and
<hi>Man:</hi> It is not a timorous prophecy, directed onely to persons, whom a low fortune,
and a miserable estate, or a sense of sin, and a wounded Conscience, had depress'd, and
dejected, but principally bent upon rulers and Magistrates, and great persons. So
that no Man hath a <hi>Quia</hi> against this <hi>Quia,</hi> a <hi>for</hi> against this <hi>for,</hi> to say, we need not
heed him, for he is an upstart, a singular person, and all these his threatnings are rather
<hi>Satyricall,</hi> then <hi>Propheticall,</hi> or Theologicall; but this thunderbolt, this <hi>Quia,</hi> this
reason, why these judgements must necessarily fall upon them, fell upon them with so
much violence, as that it stupefied with the weight, and precluded all wayes of escape.
These be the heaviest Texts that a Man can light upon in the Scriptures of God, and
these be the heaviest Commentaries, that a Man can make upon these Texts, that when
God wakens him and raises him from his dream, and bed of sin, and pleasure, and raises
him with the voice of his judgements, he suffers him to read to the <hi>Quia,</hi> but not to
come to the <hi>Tamen;</hi> He comes to see reason why that Judgement must fall, but not to
see any remedy. His inordinate <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and halfe desperate sadnesse carries his
eye, and mind upon a hundred places of Commination, of threatning in the Prophets,
and in them all he finds quickly that <hi>Quia,</hi> This curse must fall upon me, for I am
faln into it; but he comes not to the <hi>Tamen,</hi> to that reliefe, <hi>yet turn to the Lord, and
he will turne to thee.</hi> This was a particular step in their misery, that when they were
awaked, and risen, that is, taken away from all tast, and comfort, in their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
and pleasures, when God was ready to give fire to all that artillery, which
he had charged against them, in the service of all the Prophets, they could see no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
no sanctuary, nothing but a <hi>quia,</hi> an irresistiblenesse, an irremediablenesse, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of perishing; a great while there was no such thing, as Judgement, (God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see us) Now, there is no such thing as Mercy, (God will not see us.)</p>

It is no reason, that any Man should think himselfe born for others, since he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

and so, even <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Christian Philosophy, places happinesse in <hi>rest;</hi>
Now, he speaks not onely of the things of this world, they must necessarily be car'd

of society, out of an aëry, and imaginary affection of <hi>rest:</hi> our principall rest is, in the
testimony of our <hi>Conscience,</hi> and in doing that which we were sent to doe; And to have
a Rest, and peace, in a Conscience of having done that religiously, and acceptably to
God, is our true Rest: and this was the rest, which the Jewes were to lose in this place,
the testimony of their consciences, that they had perform'd their part, their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so, that they might rely upon Gods promises, of a perpetuall rest in the Land
of Canaan; and that rest they could not have; not that peacefull testimony of their
Consciences.</p>
                     <p>They could not have that rest,<note place="margin">Hic.</note> no Rest, not there, not in <hi>Canaan;</hi> which was the
highest degree of the misery, because they were confident in their term, their state in
that Land, that it should be perpetuall; and they were confident in the goodnesse of
the Land, that it should evermore give them all conveniencies in abundance, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to all kind of rest: for, this Land, God himself cals by the name of <hi>rest,</hi> and of
<hi>his rest;</hi>

                        <hi>I sware they should not enter into my rest;</hi> So that, rest was proper to this Land,
and this Land was proper to them. For, (as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> notes well) though God
recover'd this Land for them, and reestablish'd miraculously their possession, yet they
came but in their <hi>Remitter,</hi> and <hi>in postliminio,</hi> the inheritance of that Land, was <hi>theirs</hi>
before: for, <hi>Sem</hi> the son of <hi>Neah,</hi> was in possession of this Land; and the sons of
<hi>Cham,</hi> the Canaanites, expel'd his race out of it; and <hi>Abraham</hi> of the race of <hi>Sem,</hi> was

those conditions were broken, he takes knowledge that he had sworne, he denies
not that,<note place="margin">Psal. 95. 11.</note> but he sweares againe, and in his anger, <hi>I sware in my wrath, that they should

pleads not <hi>Non est factum,</hi> but he pleads <hi>conditions</hi> performed; he denies not that he swore
but he justifies himselfe, that he had done as much as he promised; for his promise was
<hi>conditionall.</hi> The Apostle seemes to assigne but one reason of their exclusion, from this
Land, and from this rest, and yet he expresses that one Reason so, as <hi>that</hi> it hath two
branches;<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 18, 19.</note> He sayes, <hi>we see that they could not enter, because of unbeleef</hi> and yet he asks
the question; <hi>To whom sware he, that they should not enter into his Rest, but unto them, that
obeyed not? Vnbeleef</hi> is assigned for the cause, and yet they were shut out for <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
now, if the Apostle make it all one, whether want of <hi>faith,</hi> or want of <hi>works,</hi>
exclude us from the Land of Rest, let not us be too curious enquirers, whether <hi>faith</hi>
or <hi>works</hi> bring us thither; for neither faith, nor works bring us thither, as a full cause;

to all succeeding Ages, and to us, so they are a <hi>Commonition,</hi> an alarm,
to raise us from the sleep, and death of sin: And then in a third acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
they are a <hi>Consolation,</hi> that at last we shall have a <hi>rising,</hi> and a <hi>departing</hi> into
such a state, in the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> as we shall no more need this voice, <hi>Arise, and depart,</hi>
because we shall be no more in danger of falling, no more in danger of departing
from the presence, and contemplation; and service, and fruition of God; And in both
these latter senses, the words admit a just accommodation to this present occasion,
God having rais'd his honorable servant, and hand-maid here present, to a sense of the
<hi>Curse,</hi> that lyes upon <hi>women,</hi> for the transgression of the first woman, which is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and dangerous <hi>Child-birth;</hi> and given her also, a sense of the last glorious resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
in having rais'd her, from that Bed of weaknesse, to the ability of coming
into his presence, here in his house.</p>
                     <p>First then to consider them, in the first of these two latter senses,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> as a <hi>Commonition</hi>
to them, that are in the state of <hi>sin,</hi> first there is an increpation implied in this word
<hi>Arise;</hi> when we are bid arise, we are told, that we are faln: sin is an unworthy descent,
and an ignoble fall; Secondly, we are bid to doe something, and therefore we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe something, God commands nothing impossible so, as that that degree of
performance, which he will accept, should be impossible, to the man, whom his grace
hath affected; That which God will accept, is possible to the godly; And thirdly,
that which he commands here, is deriv'd into two branches; We are bidden to <hi>rise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and not onely that but to <hi>depart</hi> into <hi>another way,</hi> a habit of Actions, contrary
to our former Sins. And then, all this is press'd, and urged upon us, by a Reason; The
Holy Ghost appears not like a ghost in one sodain glance, or glimmering, but he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
his presence, and he presses the businesse, that he comes for; And the reason that
he uses here, is, <hi>Quia non requies,</hi> because otherwise we lose the <hi>Pondus animae,</hi> the weight,

                     <p>For that then, which rises first; the increpation of our fall implied in the word, <hi>Arise,</hi>

there is nothing,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> in which, that which is the mother of all vertues, <hi>discretion,</hi> is more
tryed, then in the conveying, and imprinting profitably a rebuke, an increpation, a
knowledge, and sense of sinne, in the conscience of another. The rebuke of sin, is like
the fishing of <hi>Whales;</hi> the Marke is great enough; one can scarse misse hitting; but if
there be not <hi>sea room</hi> and line enough, &amp; a dexterity in letting out that line, he that hath
fixed his harping Iron, in the Whale, endangers himselfe, and his boate; God hath
made us <hi>fishers of Men;</hi> and when we have struck a <hi>Whale,</hi> touch'd the conscience of any
person, which thought himselfe above rebuke, and increpation, it struggles, and strives,
and as much as it can, endevours to draw fishers, and boate, the Man and his fortune
into contempt, and danger. But if God tye a <hi>sicknesse,</hi> or any other calamity, to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93359:42"/>
end of the line, that will winde up this Whale againe, to the boate, bring back this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
sinner better advised, to the mouth of the Minister, for more counsaile, and to
a better souplenesse, and inclinablenesse to conforme himselfe, to that which he shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
receive from him; onely calamity makes way for a rebuke to enter. There was
such a tendernesse, amongst the orators, which were used to speake in the presence of
the people, to the Romane Emperors, (which was a way of <hi>Civill preaching</hi>) that they
durst not tell them then their duties, nor instruct them, what they should doe, any other
way then by saying, that they had done so before; They had no way to make the
Prince wise, and just, and temperate, but by a false praising him, for his former acts of
wisedome, and justice, and temperance, which he had never done; and that served to
make the people beleeve, that the Princes were so; and it served to teach the Prince,
that he ought to be so. And so, though this were an expresse, and a direct flattery, yet
it was a collaterall increpation too; And on the other side, our later times have seen,
another art, another invention, another workmanship, that when a great person hath so
abused the favour of his Prince, that he hath growne subject to great, and weighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepations,
his owne friends have made <hi>Libells</hi> against him, thereby to lay some light
aspersions upon him, that the Prince might thinke, that this comming with the malice
of a <hi>Libell,</hi> was the worst that could be said of him: and so, as the first way to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
though it were a direct flattery, yet it was a <hi>collater all Increpation</hi> too, so this
way, though it were a direct increpation, yet it was a <hi>collater all flattery</hi> too. If I should
say of such a congregation as this, with acclamations and showes of much joy, Blessed
company, holy congregation, in which there is no pride at all, no vanity at all, no preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication
at all, I could be thought in that, but to convey an increpation, and a rebuke
mannerly, in a wish that it were so altogether. If I should say of such a congregation as
this, with exclamations and show of much bitternesse, that they were sometimes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too worldly in their owne businesse, sometimes somewhat too remisse, in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the next world, and adde no more to it, this were but as a plot, and a <hi>faint li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling,</hi>
a publishing of small sinnes to keep greater from being talk'd of: slight incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
are but as <hi>whisperings,</hi> and work no farther, but to bring men to say, Tush, no
body hears it, no body heeds it, we are never the worse, nor never the worse thought of
for all that he says. And loud and bitter increpations, are as a <hi>trumpet,</hi> and work no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
but to bring them to say, Since he hath published all to the world already, since
all the world knowes of it, the shame is past, and we may goe forward in our ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
Is there then no way to convey an increpation profitably? <hi>David</hi> could find no
way; <hi>Vidi praevaricatores &amp; tabescebam,</hi> says he, <hi>I saw the transgressors,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 158.</note> but I languished
and consumed away with griefe, because they would not keep the law;</hi> he could not mend
them, and so impaired himselfe with his compassion: but God hath provided a way here,
to convey, to imprint this increpation, this rebuke, sweetly, and succesfully; that is,
by way of counsaile: by bidding them <hi>arise,</hi> he chides them them for falling, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the exaltation and exultation of a peacefull conscience, he brings them to a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
to what miserable distractions, and distortions of the soule, a habite of sinne will
bring them to. If you will take knowledge of Gods fearfull judgements no other way,
but by hearing his mercies preached, his <hi>Mercie is new every morning,</hi> and his dew falls
every evening; and morning, and evening we will preach his mercies unto you. If
you will beleeve a <hi>hell</hi> no other way, but by hearing the joyes of heaven presented to
you, you shall heare enough of that; we will receive you in the morning, and dismisse
you in the evening, in a religious assurance, in a present inchoation of the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It is Gods way, and we are willing to pursue it; to shew you that you are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Christ, <hi>we pray you in Christs stead, that you would be reconciled to him:</hi> to shew
you, that you are faln, we pray you to <hi>arise,</hi> and <hi>si audieritis,</hi> if you hear us so, if any
way, any means, convey this rebuke,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 15.</note> this sense into you, <hi>Si audieritis, lucrati sumus
fratrem, If you hear, we have gain'd a brother;</hi> and that's the richest gain, that we can
get, if you may get salvation by us.</p>
                     <p>Gods rebukes and increpations then are sweet, and gentle, to the binding up, not to
the scattering of a Conscience; And the particular Rebuke in this place, conveyed by
way of counsail, is, That they were <hi>faln;</hi> and worse could not be said, how mild,<note place="margin">Dejectio.</note> and
easie soever the word be. The ruin of the <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven, the ruin of <hi>Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
is still call'd by that word, it is but the <hi>fall</hi> of Angels, and the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Adam;</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93359:43"/>
and yet this fall of <hi>Adam</hi> cost the bloud of Christ, and this bloud of Christ, did not
rectifie the Angels after their fall. <hi>Inter objectos, objectissimus peccator;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> amongst

                        <note place="margin">Idem.</note>
the world, and himselfe, (which is a lesse world, but a greater dominion) are within his
Jurisdiction; and then servilly, he submits himselfe, and all, to that, <hi>Qua nihil magis
barbarum,</hi> then which nothing is more tyrannous, more barbarous. All persons have
naturally, all Nations ever had, a detestation of falling into their hands who were
more barbarous, more uncivill then themselves, <hi>&amp; peccato nihil magis barbarum;</hi> (sayes
that Father) sin doth not govern us by a rule, by a Law, but tyrannically, impetuously,
and tempestuously; It hath been said of Rome, <hi>Romae regulariter malè agitur;</hi> There
a man may know the price of a sin, before he doe it; and he knowes what his <hi>dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
will cost; whether he be able to sin at that rate, whether he have wherewithall, that
if not, he may take a cheap sin. Thou canst never say that of thy soule, <hi>Intus regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter

Law, for the Law is in thy heart; nor to sin wisely, and so to escape witnesses, for the
testimony is in thy Conscience; nor to sin providently, and thriftily, and cheaply, and
compound for the penalty, and stall the fine, for thy soule, that is the price, is indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and perishes entirely, and eternally at one payment, and yet ten thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

or so far in that sin, and no farther; If thou fall from an high place, thou maist fall
through thick clouds, and through moist clouds, but yet through nothing that can
sustain thee, but thou fall'st to the earth; If thou fall from the grace of God, thou
maist passe through <hi>dark Clouds,</hi> oppression of heart, and through <hi>moist Clouds,</hi> some
compunction, some remorsefull tears; but yet, (of thy selfe) thou hast nothing to take

would come in scorn to a prisoner, and bid him shake off his fetters, or to a man in a
Consumption, and bid him grow strong; when God bids us arise, he tels us, we are
able to rise; God bad <hi>Moses</hi> goe to <hi>Pharaoh; Moses</hi> said he was <hi>Incircumcisus labiis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 10.</note>
heavy, and slow of tongue; but he did not deny, but he had a tongue: God bade him
goe, and <hi>I will be with thy mouth,</hi> sayes he; He does not say, I will be thy mouth; but,
thou hast a mouth, and I will be <hi>with</hi> thy Mouth. It was Gods presence, that made
that mouth serviceable, and usefull, but it was <hi>Moses</hi> mouth; <hi>Moses</hi> had a mouth
of his own; we have <hi>faculties,</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> of our own, to be employed in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
So when God employed <hi>Ieremy,</hi> the Prophet sayes, <hi>O Lord God, behold,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 1. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>I cannot
speak, for I am a child;</hi> but God replies, <hi>say</hi> not thou, <hi>I am a child; for whatsoever
I command thee, thou shalt speake:</hi> When God bids thee rise from thy sin, say not thou
it is <hi>too late,</hi> or that thou art bedrid in the custome of thy sin, and so canst not rise;
when he bids thee rise, he enables thee to rise; and thou maist rise, by the power of that
<hi>will</hi> which onely his mercy, and his grace, hath created in thee; for as God conveyes
a rebuke in that counsaile, <hi>Surgite,</hi> arise, so he conveyes a power in it too; when he
bids thee rise, he enables thee to rise.</p>
                     <p>That which we are to doe then, is <hi>to rise;</hi> to leave our bed, our sleep of Sin.<note place="margin">Surgite.</note> Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> takes knowledge of three wayes,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> by which he escaped sins; first, <hi>occasionis
substractione;</hi> and that's the safest way, not to come within distance of a tentation;
secondly, <hi>resistendi data virtute,</hi> That the love, and the fear of God, imprinted in him,
made him strong enough for the sin; Can I love God, and love this person thus? thus,
that my love to it, should draw away my love from God? Can I feare God, and fear
any Man, (who can have power but over my body) so, as for feare of him, to renounce
my God, or the truth, or my Religion? Or <hi>affectionis sanitate,</hi> that his affections,
had, by a good diet, by a continuall feeding upon the Contemplation of God, such a
degree of health, and good temper, as that some sins he did naturally detest, and, though
he had not wanted opportunity, and had wanted particular grace, yet he had been safe
enough from them. But, for this help, this detestation, <hi>of some</hi> particular <hi>sins,</hi> that
will not hold out; We have seen men infinitely <hi>prodigall</hi> grow infinitely <hi>Covetous</hi> at
last. For the other way, (the assistance of <hi>particular grace)</hi> that we must not presume
upon; for, he that opens himselfe to a tentation, upon presumption of grace to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
him, forfaits by that, even that grace, which he had. And therefore there is no
safe way, but <hi>occasionis substractio,</hi> the forbearing of those places, and that Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ministers occasion of tentation to us. First therefore, let us find, that
we are in our bed, that we are naturally unable to rise; We are not born <hi>Noble:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 3.</note> Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> considers himselfe, and his birth, and his Title to grace, at best; <hi>That he was
a Iew,</hi> and <hi>of the Tribe of Benjamin, and of holy</hi> parents, and within the Covenant;
yet all this rais'd him not out of his bed, for, sayes he,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>we were by nature the Children
of wrath, as well as others.</hi> But where then was the <hi>rising?</hi> that is, in the true recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Christ. <hi>To as many as received him, he gave, Potestatem praerogativae,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12.</note> to be the
sons of God;</hi> yea, <hi>power to become the sons of God,</hi> as it is in our last Translation.

rising is first, from <hi>Originall sin,</hi> by baptism, and then from <hi>actuall sin,</hi> best, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from the occasions of tentation to future sins, after repentance of former.</p>
                     <p>But it is not, <hi>Arise,</hi> and stand still: But <hi>Surgite, &amp; ite,</hi> arise, and depart;<note place="margin">Ite.</note> But whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

though we have left a sinne, there is a weaknesse upon us, that makes us reel, and leane

<hi>Memento peregisse te aliquid, restare aliquid:</hi> Remember,<note place="margin">Augusti.</note> (and do not deceive thy selfe,
to remember that, which was never done) but remember truely, that thou hast done
something, towards making sure thy salvation already, and that thou hast much more
to doe; <hi>Divertisse te ad Refectionem, non ad defectionem,</hi> that God hath given thee a
bayting place, a resting place; peace in conscience, for all thy past sinnes, in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
repentance; but it is, to refresh thy selfe with that peace; it is not to take new cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and strength to sinne againe. Let not the ease which thou hast found in the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinnes now embolden thee to commit them againe; not to trust to that strength
which thou hast already recovered; but <hi>arise and depart;</hi> avoid old tentations, and
apply thy selfe to a new course in the world, and in a calling; for there may be as
much sinne, to leave the world, as to cleave to the world: and he may be as inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
at the last day, that hath done <hi>Nothing</hi> in the world, as hee that hath done

                     </p>
                     <p>Now, we noted it to be a particular degree of Gods mercy, that he insisted upon it,<note place="margin">Quia.</note>
that he pressed it, that he urged it with a reason; doe thus, says God, <hi>for,</hi> it stands thus
with you. It is always a boldnesse, to aske a reason of those decrees of God, which
were founded, and established onely in his owne gratious will, and pleasure; In those
cases, <hi>Exitiales vaculae, our &amp; quomodo;</hi> to aske, <hi>why</hi> God elected some,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> and <hi>how</hi> it
can consist with his goodnesse, to leave out others there the <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>why</hi> are dangerous,
and deadly Monosyllables. But of Gods particular purposes upon us, and revealed to
us, which are so to be wrought and executed upon us, as that we our selves have a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-working,
and co-operation with God, of those, it becomes us to aske, and to
know the reason. When the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> promised such unexpected blessings to
<hi>Zachary, Zachary</hi> askes, <hi>whereby shall I know this?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 1. 18.</note> and the Angel does not leave him
unsatisfied. When that Angel promises a greater miracle to the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
she says also, <hi>Quomodo, how shall this be?</hi> and the Angel settles, and establishes the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in her: Whatsoever we are bid to beleeve, whatsoever we are bid to doe, God
affords us a reason for it, and we may try it by reason, but because that sinner, whom in
this text, he speakes to, <hi>to arise and depart,</hi> is likely to stand upon false reasons, against
his rising, to murmur, and ask <hi>Cur</hi> or <hi>quomodo, why</hi> should I arise, since me thinkes
I lye at my ease, <hi>how</hi> shall I arise, that am already at the top of my wishes? God who is
loath to lose any soule, that he undertakes, followes him with this reason. <hi>Quia non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,

it is not peace. Let us depart out of our selves, and looke upon that, in which most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

(which is <hi>repentance</hi> after sinne) this <hi>departing</hi> into a safer station, (which is the building
of habits contrary to the former) doe bring an ease to the conscience, (as it doth that

How mercifully hath God proceeded with Man, in making his life short? for by that

upon the pleasures of this life, because the end of both is short. It is a weaknesse, sayes

                        <hi>Secundum aliquem modum,

by the same Father; If there were any one minute in a mans life, in which he were

life; for this <hi>Ite,</hi> depart out of this world, is part of the Consolation. I have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
upon my friend, and (though I wish it not) yet I am glad, if he die; Men
that have inheritances after their fathers, are glad when they dye; though not glad that
they die, yet glad when they die: I have a greater, after the death of this body, and shall
I be loath to come to that? Yet, it is not so a Consolation, as that we should by

They are both necessary to one another; but the poor man is the more necessary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though one man might be rich, though no man were poor, yet he could have no
exercise of his charity, he could send none of his riches to heaven, to help him there,

                     <p>He that is too fat, would fain devest some of that, though he could give that to no

heavily laden, and encombred with temporall abundances, be content to discharge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of some of that, wherewith he is over-straighted, upon those poor souls, whom God
hath not made poor for any sin of theirs, or of their fathers, but onely to present rich
men exercise of their charity, and occasions of testifying their love to Christ; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given himselfe, to convey salvation upon thee, if that conveyance may be sealed
to thee, by giving a little of thine own, is it not an easie purchase? When a poore
wretch beggs <hi>of</hi> thee, and thou givest, thou dost but justice, it is his. But when he
begs of <hi>God for</hi> thee, and God gives thee, this is mercy; this was none of thine.</p>

goe with more case to Heaven, then he doth to Hell. Every man hath some means to

to give <hi>God:</hi> Money, or labor, or counsail, or prayers. Every man can give, and he gives
to God, who gives to them that need it, for his sake. Come not to that expostulation,
<hi>When did we see thee</hi> hungry, or sick, or imprisoned, and did not minister? Nor to

fills every place, and fills it by containing that place in himselfe; but he is tyed <hi>by his

<hi>God</hi> were long before he required, or admitted a sumptuous Temple, (for <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was not built, in almost <hi>five hundred years</hi> after their returne out of Egypt) though
God were content to accept their worship, and their sacrifices, at the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> (which
was a transitory, and moveable Temple) yet at last he was so carefull of his house, as
that himselfe gave the modell, and platforme of it; and when it was built, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
again, he was so jealous of appropriating, and confining all his solemne worship
to that particular place, as that he permitted that long schisme, and dissention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> onely about the place of the worship of God;
They differed not in other things: but whether in <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> or in <hi>Mount Garizim.</hi>
And the feast of the dedication of this Temple, which was yearly celebrated, received
so much honor, as that Christ himselfe vouchsafed to be personally present at that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity;
though it were a feast of the institution of the Church, and not of <hi>God</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly,
as their other festivalls were, yet Christ forbore not to observe it, upon that
pretence, that it was <hi>but</hi> the Church that had appointed it to be observed. So that, as
in all times, God had manifested, and exhibited himselfe in some particular <hi>places,</hi> more
then other, (in the <hi>Pillar</hi> in the <hi>wildernesse,</hi> and in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and in the <hi>poole,</hi>
which the Angell troubled) so did Christ himselfe, by his owne presence, ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
justifie, and authorise this <hi>dedication</hi> of places consecrated to Gods outward
worship, not onely once, but <hi>anniversarily</hi> by a yearly celebration thereof.</p>

building Churches, first that they built them onely to the honour, and glory of God,
without giving him any partner, and then they built them for the conserving of the
memory of those blessed servants of God, who had sealed their profession with their
bloud, and at whose Tombs, God had done such Miracles, as these times needed, for
the propagation of his Church. They built their Churches principally for the glory

for so says he, (who as he was <hi>Peters successor,</hi> so he is the most sensible feeler, and

all the Fathers) speaking of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, <hi>Beato Petri Basilica, quae uni Deo vero
&amp; vivo dicata est,</hi> Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church is dedicated to the onely living God; They
are things compatible enough to beare the name of a Saint, and yet to be dedicated to
God. There the <hi>bodies</hi> of the blessed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> did peacefully attend their glorification;
There the <hi>Histories</hi> of the Martyrs were recited and proposed to the Congregation, for
their example, and imitation; There the <hi>names</hi> of the Martyrs were inserted into the
publique prayers, and liturgies, by way of presenting the thanks of the Congregation
to <hi>God,</hi> for having raised so profitable men in the Church; and there the Church did
present their prayers to God, for those Martyrs, that God would hasten their glory,
and finall consummation, in reuniting their bodies, and soules, in a joyfull resurrection.
But yet though this divers mention were made of the Saints of God, in the house of
God, <hi>Non Martyres ipsi, sed Deus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in which God hath appointed us severall services; Those who have done their days
work, God hath given them their wages, and hath given them leave to goe to bed;
they have laid down their bodies in peace to sleep there, till the Sunne rise againe; till
the Sunne of grace and glory, <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> appeare in judgment; we that are yet left
to work, and to watch, we must goe forward in the services of God in his house, with
that moderation, and that equality, as that we worship onely our Master, but yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
not our fellow servants, that are gone before us: That we give to no person, the
glory of God, but that we give God the more glory, for having raised such servants:
That we acknowledge the Church to be the house <hi>onely</hi> of God, and that we admit no
Saint, no Martyr, to be a <hi>lointenant</hi> with him; but yet that their memory may be an
encouragement, yea and a seale to us, that that peace, and glory, which they possesse,
belongs also unto us in reversion, and that therefore we may cheerfully gratulate their
present happinesse, by a devout commemoration of them, with such a temper, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennesse,
as that we neither dishonor God, by attributing to them, that which is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
his, nor dishonor them in taking away that which is theirs, in removing their
Names out of the Collects, and prayers of the Church, or their Monuments, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls

                     <p>This then was in all times, a religious work, an acceptable testimony of devotion, to
build God a house; to contribute something to his outward glory. The goodnesse,
and greatnesse of which work, appears evidently, and shines gloriously, even in those

house: but the Church is his standing house; there are his offices fixed: there are his

bloud, and body: there work his seales; there beats his Mint; there is absolution,
and pardon for past sinnes, there is grace for prevention of future in his Sacraments.
But the Church is not onely <hi>Domus Dei,</hi> but <hi>Basilica;</hi> not onely his house,<note place="margin">Basilica.</note> but his
Court: he doth not onely dwell there, but reigne there: which multiplies the joy of

who have been Gods instruments, for providing such places, as God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in, and the godly benefited in all these ways.</p>
                     <p>But of all Names, which were then usually given to the Church, the name of <hi>Temple</hi>
seems to be most large, and significant, as they derive it <hi>à Tuendo;</hi> for <hi>Tueri</hi> signifies
both our beholding, and contemplating <hi>God</hi> in the Church: and it signifies Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting,
and defending those that are his, in his Church: <hi>Tueri</hi> embraces both; And
therefore, though in the very beginning of the Primitive Church, to depart from the
custome, and language, and phrase of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as farre as they could,
they did much abstain from this name of <hi>Temple,</hi> and of <hi>Priest,</hi> so that till <hi>Ireneus</hi> time,
some <hi>hundred eighty years after Christ,</hi> we shall not so often find those words, <hi>Temple,</hi>
or <hi>Priest,</hi> yet when that danger was overcome, when the Christian Church, and
doctrine was established, from that time downward, all the <hi>Fathers</hi> did freely, and
safely call the Church the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers</hi> in the Church, <hi>Priests,</hi> as names
of a religious, and pious signification; where before out of a loathnesse to doe, or say
any thing like the <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> where a concurrence with them, might have been
misinterpretable, and of ill consequence, they had called the Church by all those other
names, which we passed through before; and they called their <hi>Priests,</hi> by the name of
<hi>Elders, Presbyteros:</hi> but after they resumed the use of the word Temple againe, as the
Apostle had given a good patterne, who to expresse the principall holinesse of the
Saints of God, he chooses to doe it, in that word,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>ye are the Temples of the holy Ghost:</hi>
which should encline us to that moderation, that when the danger of these ceremonies
which corrupt times had corrupted, is taken away, we should returne to a love of that
Antiquity, which did purely, and harmelesly induce them: when there is no danger of
abuse, there should be no difference for the use of things, (in themselves indifferent)
made necessary by the just commandement of lawfull authority.</p>
                     <p>Thus then you see as farre (as the narrownesse of the time will give us leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it) the generall manner of the best times, to declare devotion towards God, to
have been in appropriating certaine places to his worship; And since it is so in this
particular history of <hi>Iacobs</hi> proceeding in my text, I may be hold to invert these words
of <hi>David, Nisi Deus aedificaverit domum,</hi> unlesse the Lord doe build the house, in vaine
doe the labourers work, thus much, as to say, <hi>Nisi Domino aedificaveritis domum,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou build a house for the Lord, in vaine dost thou goe about any other buildings,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93359:49"/>
or any other businesse in this world. I speake not meerly literally of building <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Chappells;</hi> (yet I would speake also to further that;) but I speake principally of
building such a Church, as every man may build in himselfe: for whensoever we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
our prayers, and devotions deliberately, and advisedly to God, there we <hi>consecrate</hi>
that place, there we build a Church. And therefore, beloved, since every master of a
family, who is a <hi>Bishop in his house,</hi> should call his family together, to humble, and
powre out their soules to God, let him consider, that when he comes to kneele at the
<hi>side of his table,</hi> to pray, he comes to build a Church there; and therefore should
sanctifie that place, with a due, and penitent consideration how voluptuously he hath
formerly abused Gods blessings at that place, how superstitiously, and idolatrously
he hath flatter'd and humour'd some great and usefull ghests invited by him to that
place, how expensively, he hath served his owne ostentation and vain-glory, by exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
feasts at that place, whilest <hi>Lazarus</hi> hath lien panting, and gasping at the gate; and
let him consider what a dangerous Mockery this is to Christ <hi>Iesus,</hi> if he pretend by
kneeling at that table, fashionally to build Christ a Church by that solemnity at the
table side, and then crucifie Christ again, by these sinnes, when he is sat at the table.
When thou kneelest down at thy <hi>bed side,</hi> to shut up the day at night, or to beginne it
in the morning, thy servants, thy children, thy little flock about thee, there thou buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
a Church too: And therefore sanctifie that place; wash it with thy tears, and
with a repentant consideration; That in that bed thy children were conceived in sinne,
that in that bed thou hast turned mariage which God afforded thee for remedy, and
physique to voluptuosnesse, and licenciousnesse; That thou hast made that bed which
God gave thee for rest, and for reparation of thy weary body, to be as thy dwelling,
and delight, and the bed of idlenesse, and stupidity. Briefly, you that are Masters,
continue in this building of Churches, that is, in drawing your families to pray, and
praise God, and sanctifie those severall places of bed, and board, with a right use of
them; And for you that are servants, you have also foundations of Churches in you,
if you dedicate all your actions, consecrate all your services principally to God, and
respectively to them, whom God hath placed over you. But principally, let all of all
sorts, who present themselves at <hi>this table,</hi> consider, that in that receiving his body,
and his bloud, every one doth as it were conceive Christ Jesus anew; Christ Jesus
hath in every one of them, as it were a <hi>new incarnation,</hi> by uniting himselfe to them in
these visible signes. And therefore let no Man come hither, without a search, and a
privy search, without a consideration, and re-consideration of his conscience. Let
him that beganne to think of it, but this morning, stay till the next. When <hi>Moses</hi>
pulled his hand first out of his bosome, it was <hi>white</hi> as snow, but it was <hi>leprous;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 4. 6.</note> when
he pulled it the second time, it was of the color of flesh, but it was sound. When thou
examinest thy conscience but once, but flightly, it may appear, white as snow, innocent;
but examine it againe, and it will confesse many fleshly infirmities, and then it is the
sounder for that; though not for the infirmity, yet for the confession of the infirmity.
Neither let that hand, that reaches out to this body, in a guiltinesse of pollution, and
uncleannesse, or in a guiltinesse of extortion, or undeserved <hi>see,</hi> ever hope to signe a
conveyance, that shall fasten his inheritance upon his children, to the third generation,
ever hope to assigne a will that shall be observed after his death; ever hope to lift up it
selfe for mercy to God, at his death; but his case shall be like the case of <hi>Iudas,</hi> if the
devill have put in his heart, to betray <hi>Christ,</hi> to make the body and bloud of Christ
Jesus false witnesses to the congregation of his hypocriticall sanctity, Satan shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into him, with this sop, and seale his condemnation. Beloved, in the bowels of that
Jesus, who is coming into you, even in spirituall riches, it is an unthrifty thing, to
anticipate your monies, to receive your rents, before they are due: and this treasure of
the soule, the body, and bloud of your Saviour, is not due to you yet, if you have
not yet passed, a mature, and a severe examination, of your conscience. It were better
that your particular friends, or that the congregation, should observe in you, an absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and forbearing to day, and make what interpretation, they would of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
then that the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> should deprehend you, in an unworthy receiving;
lest, as the Master of the feast said to him that came without his wedding garment, then
when he was set, <hi>Amice quomodo intrâsti,</hi> friend how came you in? so Christ should say
to thee, then when thou art upon thy knees, and hast taken him into thy hands, <hi>Amice
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93359:49"/>

hast made no preparation for me? But to those that have, he knocks and he enters, and

Churches of our houses, and of our hearts, leads us to a third part, the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
in <hi>Iacobs</hi> action.</p>
                     <p>In which there is such a change, such a dependence,<note place="margin">3. Part.</note> whether we consider the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,

then <hi>Iacob;</hi> which is a <hi>Tunc consequentiae,</hi> rather then a <hi>Tunc temporis;</hi> It is not so

<hi>Quid operatum,</hi> what this wrought upon <hi>Iacob;</hi> It <hi>awaked</hi> him out <hi>of his sleep,</hi> A third

that, which he conceived, he said; and a fourth is, <hi>Quid dixit,</hi> what this profession was;
And in that, which is a branch with much fruit, a pregnant part, a part containing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts, thus much is considerable, that he presently acknowledged, and assented to
their light which was given him, <hi>the Lord is in this place;</hi> And he acknowledged his
owne darknesse, till that light came upon him, <hi>Et ego nesciebam,</hi> I knew it not; And
then upon this light received, he admitted no scruple, no hesitation, but came present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to a confident assurance, <hi>Verè Dominus,</hi> surely, of a certainty, the Lord is in this
place; And then another doctrine is, <hi>Et timuit,</hi> he was afraid; for all his confidence he
had a reverentiall feare; not a distrust, but a reverent respect to that great Majesty;
and upon this feare, there is a second, <hi>Et dixit,</hi> he spoke againe; this feare did not stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie
him, he recovers againe and discerned the manifestation of God, in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
place, <hi>Quam terribilis,</hi> how fearfull is this place; And then the last linke of this chaine
is, <hi>Quid inde,</hi> what was the effect of all this; and that is, that he might erect a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and marke for the worship of God in this place, <hi>Quia non nisi domus,</hi> because
this is none other then the house of God, and the gate of heaven. Now I have no
purpose to make you afraid of enlarging all these points: I shall onely passe through
some of them, <hi>paraphrastically,</hi> and trust them with the rest, (for they insinuate
one another) and trust your christianly meditation with them all.</p>
                     <p>The first linke then is, the <hi>Tunc Iacob,</hi> the <hi>occasion,</hi> (then <hi>Iocob</hi> did this) which was,<note place="margin">Tunc.</note>
that God had revealed to <hi>Iocob,</hi> that vision of the ladder, whose foot stood upon earth,
and whose top reached to heaven, upon which ladder God stood, and Angels went up
and down. Now this ladder is for the most part, understood to be <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe;
whose foot, that touched the earth, is his <hi>humanity,</hi> and his top that reached to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
his <hi>Divinity;</hi> The ladder is Christ, and upon him the Angels, (his Ministers) labour
for the edifying of the Church; And in this labour, upon this ladder, God stands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it, governing, and ordering all things, according to his providence in his Church.
Now when this was revealed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> now when this is revealed to you, that God hath
let fall a ladder, a bridge between heaven, and earth, that Christ, whose divinity depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not from heaven, came downe to us into this world, that God the father stands
upon this ladder, as the <hi>Originall</hi> hath it, <hi>Nitzab,</hi> that he leanes upon this ladder, as
the <hi>vulgar</hi> hath it, <hi>Innixus scalae,</hi> that he rests upon it, as the holy Ghost did, upon the

so farre, and is provided so well, the Angels labour, the Ministers of God doe their
offices, when this was, when this is manifested, then it became <hi>Iacob,</hi> and now it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
every Christian, to doe something for the advancing of the outward glory, and
worship of God in his Church: when Christ is content to be this ladder, when God is
content to govern this ladder, when the Angels are content to labour upon this ladder,
which ladder is Christ, and the Christian Church, shall any Christian Man forbeare
his help to the necessary building, and to the sober and modest adorning of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Church of God? God studies the good of the Church, Angels labour for it; and
shall Man, who is to receive all the profit of this, doe nothing? This is the <hi>Tunc Iacob;</hi>

of the world, and a retiring to the onely contemplation of heaven, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things) <hi>Iacob</hi> may be conceived to have awaked, and we must awake; It is note
enough to shut our selves in a cloister, in a Monastery, to sleep out the tentations of the
world, but since the ladder is placed, the Church established, since God, and the
Angels are awake in this businesse, in advancing the Church, we also must labour,
in our severall vocations, and not content our selves with our own spirituall sleep; the
peace of conscience in our selves; for we cannot have that long,<note place="margin">Mar. 4. 37.</note> if we doe not some
good to others. When the storm had almost drown'd the ship, Christ was at his ease
in that storm, asleep upon a pillow. Now Christ was in no danger himself; All the
water of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, multiplyed over again by every drop, could not have drown'd
him. All the swords of an Army could not have killed him, till the houre was come,
when hee was pleased to lay down his soul. But though he were safe, yet they awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him, and said, <hi>Master car'st thou not though we perish?</hi> So though a man may be in a
good state, in a good peace of conscience, and sleep confidently in it, yet other mens
necessities must awaken him, and though perchance he might passe more safely, if he
might live a retired life, yet upon this ladder some Angels ascended, some descended,
but none stood still but God himself. Till we come to him, to sleep an eternall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
in heaven, though this religious sleep of enjoying or retiring and contemplation of
God, be a heavenly thing, yet we must awake even out of this sleep, and contribute our
paines, to the building, or furnishing, or serving of God in his Church.</p>
                     <p>Out of a sleep (conceive it what sleep soever) <hi>Iacob</hi> awaked; and then,<note place="margin">Quid ille dixit.</note>

what did he? <hi>Dixit,</hi> he spoke, he entred presently into an <hi>open profession</hi> of his

former speech is forgotten by God, and unprofitable to thee. <hi>Iacob</hi> at first speaking
confessed God to be in that place; but so he might be every where; but he conceived

state of God so often incultated, as this Judge, and Judgment: no word concerning

where we read, <hi>God judgeth among the Gods,</hi> the Latine Church ever read it,<note place="margin">Psal. 82. 1.</note>

many others too, and it fills the world with horror for the present, and ominous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

must come to Judgment, and therefore that Psalme which begins so, is concluded thus,
<hi>Surge Domine, arise ô God, and judge the earth:</hi> If he have power to judge the earth,
he is God, and even in God himselfe it is expressed as a kind of rising, as some exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his power, that he is to Judge; And that place in the beginning of that Psalme
many of the antients read in the future <hi>Dijudicabit,</hi> God, shall judge the Gods, because
the frame of the Psalme seems to referre it to the last Judgment; <hi>Turtullian</hi> reads it
<hi>Dijudicavit,</hi> as a thing past, God hath judged in all times; and the letter of the text
requires it to be in the present, <hi>Dijudicat.</hi> Collect all, and Judgment is so essentiall to
God, as that it is coeternall with him, he hath, he doth, and he will judge the world,
and the Judges of the world, other Judges die likemen, weakely, and they fall, that's
worse ignominiously, and they fall like Princes, that's worst, fearfully, and yet scornfully,
and when they are dead and faln, they rise no more to execute Judgment, but have
Judgment executed upon them the Lord dyes not, nor he falls not, and if he seem to
slumber, the Martyrs under the Altar awake him with their <hi>Vsque quo Domine, how
long O Lord before thou execute Iudgment?</hi> And he will arise and Judge the world, for
Judgment is his; <hi>God putteth downe one, and setteth up another,</hi> says <hi>David;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal 75. 7.</note> where hath
he that power? Why, God is the Judge, not a Judge, but the Judge, and in that right
he putteth downe one, and setteth up another.</p>
                     <p>Now for this Judgment, which we place in God,<note place="margin">Iudicinm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testationis.</note> we must consider in God three
notions, three apprehensions, three kinds of Judgment. First, God hath <hi>Iudicium
detestationis,</hi> God doth naturally know, and therefore naturally detest evill; for no man
in the extreamest corruption of nature is yet fallen so far, as to love or approve evill at
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93359:53"/>
the same time that he knows, and acknowledges it to be evill. But we are so blind in
the knowledge of evill, that we needed that great supplement, and assistance of the law
it self to make us know what was evill; <hi>Moses</hi> magnifies (and justly) the law, <hi>Non ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propinqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vit,</hi>
says <hi>Moses,</hi> God came not so neare to any nation as to the <hi>Iews; Non
taliter fecit,</hi> God dealt not so well with any nation, as with the <hi>Iews,</hi> and wherein?
because he had given them a law, and yet we see the greatest dignity of this law, to be,
That by the law is the knowledge of sinne; for though by the law of nature written in
our hearts, there be some condemnation of some sinnes, yet to know that every sinne
was Treason against God, to know that every sinne hath the reward of death, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death annexed to it; this knowledge we have onely by the law. Now if man will
pretend to be a Judge, what an exact knowledge of the law is required at his hand?
for some things are sinne to one nation, which are not to another, as where the just
authority of the lawfull Magistrate, changes the nature of the thing, and makes a thing
naturally indifferent, necessary to them, who are under his obedience; some things are
sinnes at one time, which are not at another, as all the ceremoniall law, created new
sinnes which were not sinnes before the law was given, nor since it expir'd; some things
are sinnes in a man now, which will not be sinnes in the same man to morrow, as when
a man hath contracted a just scruple, against any particular action, it is a sinne to doe it
during the scruple, and it may be sinne in him to omit it, when he hath devested the
scruple; onely God hath <hi>Iudicium detestationis,</hi> he knows, and therefore detests evill,
and therefore flatter not thy self with a Tush, God sees it not, or, Tush, God cares not,
Doth it disquiet him or trouble his rest in heaven that I breake his Sabbath here? Doth
it wound his body, or draw his bloud there, that I swear by his body and bloud here?
Doth it corrupt any of his virgins there, that I sollicit the chastity of a woman here?
Are his Martyrs withdrawn from their Allegeance, or retarded in their service to him
there, because I dare not defend his cause, nor speake for him, nor fight for him here?
Beloved, it is a degree of superstition, and an effect of an undiscreet zeale, perchance,
to be too forward in making indifferent things necessary, and so to imprint the nature,
and sting of sin where naturally it is not so: certainly it a more slippery and irreligious
thing to be too apt to call things meerely indifferent, and to forget that even in eating
and drinking, waking and sleeping, the glory of God is intermingled, as if we knew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the prescience and foreknowledge of God, there could be nothing contingent or
casuall, (for though there be a contingency in the nature of the thing, yet it is certain
to God) so if we considered duly, wherein the glory of God might be promov'd in
every action of ours, there could scarce by any action so indifferent, but that the glory
of God would turne the scale and make it necessary to me, at that time; but then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
interests, and private respects create a new indifferency to my apprehension, and
calls me to consider that thing as it is in nature, and not as it is considered with that
circumstance of the glory of God, and so I lose that <hi>Iudicium detestationis,</hi> which
onely God hath absolutely and perfectly to know, and therefore to detest evill, and so
he is a Judge.</p>
                     <p>And as he is a Judge, so <hi>Iudicat rem,</hi> he judges the nature of the thing, he is so too,
as he hath <hi>Iudicium discretionis,</hi> and so <hi>Iudicat personam,</hi> he knows what is evill,<note place="margin">Iudicium dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionis.</note> and
he discernes when thou committest that evill. Here you are fain to supply defects of
laws, that things done in one County may be tryed in another; And that in offences of
high nature, transmarine offences may be inquir'd and tryed here; But as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
says;<note place="margin">Esay 40. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Who measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or meted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

with a span, who comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, or weighed the mountains
in a scale?</hi> So I say, who hath divided heaven into shires or parishes, or limited the
territories and Jurisdictions there, that God should not have <hi>Iudicium discretionis,</hi> the
power of discerning all actions, in all places? When there was no more to be seen, or
considered upon the whole earth but the garden of Paradise, for from the beginning
<hi>Deliciae ejus esse cum filiis hominum,</hi> Gods delight was to be with the sons of men, and
man was only there, shal we not deminish God nor speak too vulgarly of him to say, that
he hovered like a Falcon over Paradise, and that from that height of heaven, the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
eye of God, saw so little a thing, as the forbidden fruit, and what became of that,
and the reaching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>are of God heard the hissing of the Serpent, and the whispering of
the woman, and what was concluded upon that? Shall we think it little to have seen to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93359:53"/>
have things done in Paradise when there was nothing else to divert his eye, nothing else
to distract his counsels, nothing else done upon the face of the earth? Take the earth
now as it is replenished, and take it either as it is torn and crumbled into raggs, and
shivers, not a kingdome, not a family, not a man agreeing with himselfe; Or take it
in that concord which is in it, as <hi>All the Kings of the earth set themselves,<note place="margin">Psalm 2. 2.</note> and all the
Rulers of the earth take counsell together against the Lord;</hi> take it in this union, or this
division, in this concord, or this discord, still the Lord that sitteth in the heavens dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
all, looks at all, laughs at all, and hath them all in derision. Earthly Judges have
their distinctions, and so their restrictions, some things they cannot know, what mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man can know all? Some things they cannot take knowledge of, for they are
bound to evidence: But God hath <hi>Iudicium discretionis,</hi> no mist, no cloud, no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
no disguise keeps him from discerning, and judging all our actions, and so he is a
Judge too.</p>
                     <p>And he is so lastly, as he hath <hi>Iudicium retributionis,</hi> God knows what is evill, he
knows when that evill is done, and he knows, how to punish and recompense that evill:
for the office of a Judge who judges according to a law, being not to contract, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that law, but to declare what was the true meaning of that Law-maker when
hee made that law, God hath this judgement in perfection, because hee himself
made that law by which he judges, and therefore when he hath said, <hi>Morte morieris;
If thou do this, thou shalt die a double death,</hi> where he hath said, <hi>Stipendium peccati mors est,</hi>
every sin shall be rewarded with <hi>death; If I sinne against the Lord, who shall entreat
for me?</hi> Who shall give any other interpretation,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 15.</note> any modification, any <hi>Non obstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
upon his law in my behalf, when he comes to judge me according to that law
which himself hath made? Who shall think to delude the Judge, and say, Surely this
was not the meaning of the Law-giver, when he who is the Judge was the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
too?</p>
                     <p>And then as God is Judge in all these respects,<note place="margin">Sine Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione.</note> so is he a Judge in them all,

Appeal, to call to the Hils to fall down upon us, and the Mountains to cover, and hide

any Appeal, from him, he is so too <hi>Sine judiciis,</hi> without needing any evidence
from us. Now if I be wary in my actions here, incarnate Devils, detractors, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
cannot accuse me; If my sinne come not to action, but lye onely in my heart,
the Devill himself who is the accuser of the brethren, hath no evidence against me,
but God knows my heart; doth not he that <hi>pondereth the heart, understand it?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 12.</note> where it
is not in that faint word, which the vulgar Edition hath expressed it in, <hi>inspector cordium,</hi>
That God sees the heart; but the word is <hi>Tochen,</hi> which signifies every where to
weigh, to number, to search, to examine, as the word is used by <hi>Salomon</hi> again, <hi>The
Lord weigheth the spirits,</hi> and it must be a ready hand,<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 2.</note> and exact scales that shall weigh
spirits. So that though neither man, nor Devill, nay nor my self give evidence against
me, yea, though I know nothing by my selfe, I am not thereby justified, why? where
is the farther danger?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4.</note> In this which follows there in Saint <hi>Paul, He that judges me is
the Lord,</hi> and the Lord hath meanes to know my heart better then my self: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> makes use of those words, <hi>Abyssus Abyssum invocat,</hi> one depth
cals upon another, The infinite depth of my sins must call upon the more infinite depth
of Gods mercy, for if God, who is Judge in all these respects, <hi>judicio detestationis,</hi> he
knows, and abhors evill, and <hi>judicio discretionis,</hi> he discerns every evill person, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
evill action, <hi>judicio retributionis,</hi> he can, and will recompense evill with evill;
And all these <hi>Sine Appellatione,</hi> we cannot appeal from him, &amp; <hi>Sine judiciis,</hi> he needs no
evidence from us; If this judgement enter into judgement with me, not onely not I,
but not the most righteous man, no, nor the Church whom he hath washed in his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93359:54"/>
blood, that she might be without spot or wrinckle, shall appear righteous in his sight.</p>
                     <p>This being then thus, that <hi>Iudgement</hi> is an unseparable character of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">2. Part.</note> being <hi>Fons Deitatis,</hi> the root and spring of the whole Deity, how is it said,
that the Father judgeth no man? Not that we should conceive a wearinesse, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
in the Father, or a discharging of himself upon the shoulders, and labours
of another, in the administration, and judging of this world; for as it is truly said,
that God rested the seventh day, that is, he rested from working in that kind,
from creating, so it is true that Christ says here; <hi>My Father worketh yet, and I
work,</hi> and so as it is truly said here, <hi>The Father judgeth no man,</hi> it is truly
sayd by Christ too, of the Father, I seek not mine own glory, there is one that seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and judgeth; still it is true, that God hath <hi>Iudicium detestationis, Thy eyes are
pure eyes O Lord, and cannot behold iniquity,</hi> says the Prophet, still it is true, that hee
hath <hi>Iudicium discretionis</hi> (because <hi>they committed villany in Israel, and I know it,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 29. 23.</note> saith
the Lord;) still it is true, that he hath <hi>Iudicium retributionis, The Lord killeth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

all these <hi>sine appellatione;</hi> for go to the Sea, or Earth, or Hell, as <hi>David</hi> makes the
distribution, and God is there; and he hath them <hi>sine judiciis,</hi> for <hi>our witnesse is in
heaven, and our record is on high:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 16. 19.</note> All this is undeniably true, and besides this, that
great name of God, by which he is first called in the Scriptures <hi>Elohim,</hi> is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
deriv'd from <hi>Elah,</hi> which is <hi>Iurare</hi> to swear, God is able as a Judge to
minister an oath unto us, and to draw evidence from our own consciences against our
selves, so that then, the Father he judges still, but he judges as God, and not as
the Father. In the three great judgements of God, the whole Trinity judges, In
the first judgement, before all times, which was Gods Judiciary separating of ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of honour, from vessels of dishonour, in our Election, and Reprobation; In his
second judgement, which is in execution now, which is Gods judiciary separating
of servants from enemies, in the seales, and in the administration of the Christian
Church; and in the last judgement, which shall be Gods Judiciary separating of sheep
from goats, to everlasting glory, or condemnation; in all these three judgements, all
the three Persons of the Trinity are Judges. Consider God altogether, and so in all
outward works, all the Trinity concurres, because all are but <hi>one</hi> God; but consider
God in relation, in distinct Persons, and so the severall Persons do something in which
the other Persons are not interessed; The Sonne hath not a generation from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so, as he had from the Father, and from the holy Ghost, as a distinct person,
he had none at all; the holy Ghost had a proceeding from the Father and Son, but from
the Sonne as a person, who had his generation from another, but not so from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Not to stray into clouds, or perplexities in this contemplation, God, that is,
the whole Trinity, judges still, but so as the Sonne judgeth, the Father judgeth
not, for that Judgment he hath committed.</p>
                     <p>That we may husband our hour well,<note place="margin">Commisit.</note> and reserve as much as we can for our two
last considerations, the <hi>Cui, &amp; Quid,</hi> to whom, and that's <hi>to the Sonne,</hi> and what
he hath committed, and that's <hi>all Iudgement,</hi> we will not stand much upon this,
more needs not then this; That God in his wisdome foreseeing, that man for his
weaknesse would not be able to settle himself upon God and his judgments, as they
are meerly heavenly, and spirituall, out of his abundant goodnesse hath established
a judgement, and ordained a Judge upon earth like himself, and like our selves too,
That as no man hath seen God, so no man should goe about to see his unsearchable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
and judgements, but rest in those sensible, and visible meanes which he hath
afforded, that is, Christ Jesus speaking in his Church, and applying his blood unto
us in the Sacraments to the worlds end: God might have suffered <hi>Abraham</hi> to rest
in the first generall promise, <hi>Semen mulieris, the Seed of the woman shall bruise the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
head,</hi> but he would bring it neerer to a visible, to a personall Covenant, <hi>In semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
tuo, In thy Seed shall all nations be blessed;</hi> he might well have let him rest in that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
of the promise to his race, but he would proceed farther, and seal it with
a sensible seal in his flesh with Circumcision; he might have let him rest in that ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that a Messias should come by that way, but he would continue it by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
succession of Prophets, till that Messias should come; and now that he is come
and gone, still God pursues the same way; <hi>How should they believe, except they hear?</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:93359:54"/>
and therefore God evermore supplies his Church with visible and sensible meanes,
and knowing the naturall inclination of man, when he cannot have, or cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the originall, and prototype, to satisfie, and refresh himself with a picture, or
representation; So, though God hath forbidden us that slippery, and frivolous, and
dangerous use of graven Images, yet hee hath afforded us his Sonne, who is the
image of the invisible God, and so more proportionall unto us, more apprehensible
by us;<note place="margin">Col. 1. 15.</note> And so this committing is no more but that God in another form, then that
of God, hath manifested his power of judging, and this committing, this manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is <hi>in Filio,</hi> in his Son.</p>
                     <p>But in the entrance into the handling of this,<note place="margin">Filio.</note> we aske onely this question, <hi>Cui filio,</hi>
to which Sonne of God is this commission given? Not that God hath more Sons
then one; but because that Sonne is his Sonne by a two-fold filiation; by an eternall,
and inexpressible generation, and by a temporary, but miraculous incarnation, in which
of these rights is this commission derived upon him? doth he judge as he is the Son
of God? or as he is the Son of man? I am not ordinarily bold in determining points
(especially if they were fundamentall) wherein I find the Fathers among themselves,
and the School in it selfe, and the reverend Divines of the Reformation amongst
themselves to differ; But yet neither am I willing to raise doubts, and leave the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory
unsatisfyed, and unsetled; we are not upon a Lecture, but upon a Sermon,
and therefore we will not multiply variety of opinions; summe up the Fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one side in Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> mouth, and they will say with him, <hi>Huic dedit ubique ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerundo,
non largiendo,</hi> God gave his Sonne this commission then (and when was
that then?) then when he begot him, and then he must have it by his eternall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the Son of God: sum up the Fathers on the other side, in <hi>Saint Augustines</hi>
mouth, and there they will say with him, that it is so clear, and so certain, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is said in the Scripture to be committed, and given to Christ, belongs to Christ
as the Son of man, and not as the Son of God, as that th'other opinion cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
and at this distance we shall never bring them to meet, but take in this rule, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium
convenit ei ut homo, causa ut Deus,</hi> God hath given Christ this commission as
man, but <hi>Christ</hi> had not been capable of this commission if he had not been God
too, and so it is easily reconcil'd: If we shall hold simply to the letter of the text,
<hi>Pater dedit,</hi> then it will seem to have been committed to him in his eternall generation,
because that was a work of the Fathers onely, and in that generation the holy Ghost
had no part; But since in this judgement, which is now committed to him, the holy
Ghost hath a part, (for as we said before, the Judgement is an act of the whole Trinity)
we must look for a commission from the whole Trinity, and that is as he is man, for, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

                     <p>Taking it then so setled, that the capacity of this Judgment, and (if we may say so)
the future title to it, was given to him, as God by his essence, in his eternall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

of this Judgement, which is given, and is committed, is in him as man: because
as the same Father says, <hi>Ad heminem dicitur, Quid habes quod non accepisti?</hi> When
<hi>Saint Past</hi> says, <hi>What hast thou that thou hast not received?</hi> he asks that question of a
man, that which is received, is received as man, For as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in a place where

the Father does, the Sonne does too, <hi>In carne,</hi> because now there is an unsepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
union betwixt God and the humane nature: The Father creates new souls every

concurs with all second causes as the first moving cause of all naturall things, and
all this the Sonne does too; but all this <hi>in carne;</hi> Though he be in our humane flesh,
he is not the lesse able to doe the acts belonging to the Godhead, but <hi>per carnem,</hi> by
the flesh instrumentally, visibly, he executes judgement, because he is the Son of man,
God hath been so indulgent to man, as that there should be no judgement given upon
man, but man should give it; Christ then having all Judgment, we refresh to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
those three Judgements which we toucht upon before; first, the Judgement of
our Election, severing of vessels of honour and dishonor; next, the Judgement of our
Justification here severing of friends from enemies; and then the Judgment of our Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
severing sheep from goats;<note place="margin">Iudicium E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionis.</note> and for the first, of our Election, As if I were under
the condemnation of the Law, for some capitall offence, and going to execution, and
the Kings mercy expressed in a sealed pardon were presented me, I should not stand
to enquire what mov'd the King to doe it, what hee said to any body else,
what any body else said to him, what hee saw in mee, or what hee look't for
at my hands, but embrace that mercy cheerfully, and thankfully, and attribute
it onely to his abundant goodnesse: So, when I consider my selfe to have been
let fall into this world, <hi>in massa Damnata,</hi> under the generall condemnation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and yet by the working of Gods Spirit, I find at first a desire, and after a
modest assurance, that I am delivered from that condemnation, I enquire not what
God did in his bed-chamber, in his cabinet counsell, in his eternall decree, I
know that hee hath made <hi>Iudicium electionis</hi> in Christ Jesus: And therefore that
I may know, whether I doe not deceive my selfe, in presuming my self to be
of that number, I come down, and examine my selfe whether I can truly tell
my conscience, that Christ Jesus dyed for mee, which I cannot doe, if I have
not a desire and an endevour to conform my self to him; And if I do that,
there I finde my Predestination, I am a Christian, and I will not offer to goe before
my Master Christ Jesus, I cannot be sav'd before there was a Saviour, In Christ
Jesus is <hi>Omne judicium,</hi> all judgement, and therefore the judgment of Election,
the first separation of vessels of honour and dishonour in Election and Reprobation
was in Christ Jesus.</p>
                     <p>Much more evidently is the second judgement of our Justification by means ordain'd
in the Christian Church, the Judgement of Christ, it is the Gospel of Christ which is
preacht to you there, There is no name given under heaven whereby you should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
there are no other means wherby salvation should be applyed in his name given, but
those which he hath instituted in his Church; So that when I come to the second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>udge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to try whether I stand justifyed in the sight of Christ, or no, I come for that
Judgement to Christ in his Church; Doe I remember what I contracted with
Christ Jesus, when I took the name of a Christian at my entrance into his
Church by Baptism? Doe I find I have endevoured to perform those Conditions?
Doe I find a remorse when I have not performed them? Doe I feele the remission
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93359:56"/>
of those sinnes applyed to me when I hear the gracious promises of the Gospel shed
upon repentant sinners by the mouth of his Minister? Have I a true and solid consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(without shift, or disguise, or flattering of my conscience) when I receive the seal
of his pardon in the Sacrament? Beloved, not in any morall integrity, not in keeping
the conscience of an honest man, in generall, but in using well the meanes ordain'd by
Christ in the Christian Church, am I justified. And therefore this Judgement of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is his too. And then the third and last judgement, which is the judgment of
Glorification,<note place="margin">Iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificationis. Apot. 1. 7.</note> that's easily agreed by all to appertain unto Christ, <hi>Idem Iesus, The
same Iesus that ascended, shall come to judgement, Videbunt quem pupugerant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Every eye
shall see him, and they also which pierc't him;</hi> Then the Son of man shall come in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and he, as man, shall give the judgement, for things done, or omitted towards
him as man, for not feeding, for not clothing, for not harbouring, for not visiting.
The sum of all is, that this is the overflowing goodnesse of God, that he deales with
man by the sonne of man; and that hee hath so given all judgement to the Sonne, as
that if you would be tryed by the first judgement; are you elected or no? The issue
is, doe you believe in Christ Jesus, or no? If you would be tryed by the second judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are you justified or no? The issue is, doe you find comfort in the application of
the Word, and Sacraments of Christ Jesus, or no? If you would be tryed by the third
Judgement, do you expect a Glorification, or no? The issue is, Are you so reconcil'd
to Christ Jesus now, by hearty repentance for sinnes past, and by detestation of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of future sin, that you durst welcome that Angel which should come at this time,
and sweare that time should be no more, that your transmigration out of this world
should be this minute, and that this minute you might say unfeignedly and effectually,
<hi>Veni Domine Iesu;</hi> come quickly, come now; if this be your state, then are you parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of all that blessednesse, which the Father intended to you, when for your sake, he
committed all Judgment to the Son.</p>

Was he our Judge then, and is hee not so still? still he is present in his Church, and

when Christ was not Judge, but there were some manner of Judgements which Christ
did never exercise, and Christ had no commission which he did not execute; for hee did
all his Fathers will. 1. <hi>In secularibus,</hi> in civill, or criminall businesses, which belong meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Judicatures, and cognisance of this world, <hi>Iudicat neminem,</hi> Christ judges no

<hi>Ad internecionem,</hi> so as that upon that Judgement, a man should despair of any recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
any redintegration with God again, and be without hope of pardon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

to be just, and hee thought Christ to bee a competent Judge in the cause, and yet
Christ declines the judgement, disavows the authority, and he answers, <hi>Homo, quis me
constituit Iudicem,</hi> Man, who made me a Judge between you? To that Generall, which
we had in the morning, <hi>Omne judicium,</hi> the Son hath all judgement; here is an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same Judges own making, for in secular judgements, <hi>Nemo constituit,</hi> he had
no commission, and therefore <hi>Iudicat neminem,</hi> he judges no man; he forbore in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
matters too, for when the woman taken in adultery, was brought before him,
he condemned her not; It is true, he absolv'd her not, the evidence was pregnant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, but he condemned her not, he undertook no office of a Judge, but of a
sweet and spirituall Counsellor, <hi>Go, and sinne no more,</hi> for this was his Element, his
Tribunall.</p>
                     <p>When then Christ says of himself, with such a pregnant negative, <hi>Quis me constituit

Who made you Judge of Kings, that you should depose them, in criminall causes? Or
who made you proprietary of Kingdomes, that you should dispose of them, as of civill

not onely perversly, but senselesly, blasphemously, ridiculously, (as ridicolously as in
their pasquils, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an undiscreet shamlesnes, to make their power greater then it is, they

the Primitive Church abstain'd from deposing Emperors, onely because she was not
strong enough to do it, when some of them say, That all Christian Kingdomes of
the earth, may fall into the Church of Rome, by faults in those Princes, when some of
them say, that <hi>De facto,</hi> the Pope hath already a good title to every Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

Authors of good credit amongst them) will be not endure Christs own question, <hi>Quis
te constituit?</hi> Who made you Judge of all this? If they say Christ did; did he it in
his Doctrine? It is hard to pretend that, for such an institution as that must have very
cleer, very pregnant words the carry in; did he doe it by his example and practice? wee
see hee abstain'd in criminall causes, when they come to their last shift, that is, that
Christ did exercise Judiciary Authority, when he whipped Merchants out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93359:57"/>
when he curs'd the fig-tree, and damnified the owner thereof, and when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the Heard of Swine, (for there, say they, the Devill was but the Executioner,
Christ was the Judge) to all these, and such as these, it is enough to say, All these were
miraculous, and not ordinary; and though it might seem half a miracle how that
should exercise so much authority as he hath done over the world, yet when we look
neerer, and see his means, that he hath done all this by Massacres of millions, by
withdrawing Subjects from their Allegiance, by assasinating and murthering of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
when we know that miracles are without meanes, and we see the means of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
the miracle ceases, howsoever that Bishop as Christs Vicar can claim no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

so large a field, as that we may fight out the last drop of our bloud, preach out
the last gaspe of our breath, before we overcome it, those to whom Christ spake here,
were such as gave perverse judgments, caluminiating censures upon him, and so he
judges no man, we need not insist upon that, for it is <hi>manifestè verum;</hi> but that we
may see our danger, and our duty, what calumny is, and so how to avoid it actively,
and how to beare it passively, I must by your leave stop a little upon it.</p>
                     <p>When then we would present unto you that monster Slander, and Calumny, though
it be hard to bring it within any compasse of a division, yet to take the largenesse of the
schoole, and say, that every calumny is either direct, or indirect, that will compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all, and then a direct calumny, will have three branches, either to lay a false and
unjust imputation, or else to aggravate a just imputation, with unnecessary, but heavy
circumstances, or thirdly to reveale of fault which in it selfe was secret and I by no duty
bound to discover it, and then the indirect calumny will have three branches too, either
to deny expressly some good that is in another, or to smother it in silence, when my
testimony were due to him, and might advantage him, or lastly to diminish his good
parts, and say they are well, but not such as you would esteeme them to be; collect then
again, for that's all, that we shall be able to doe, that he is a calumniator directly, that
imputes a false crime, that aggravates a true crime, that discovers any crime extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially;
That he is an indirect calumniator, that denies another mans sufficiencies, that
conceales them, that diminishes them; Take in some of Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> examples of
these rules, that it is a calumny to say, <hi>Doles vehementer,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Serm. 24. in Can.</note> I am sorry at the heart for such
a man because I love him, but I could never draw him from such and such a vice, or
to say, <hi>per me nunquam innotuisset,</hi> I would never have spoken of it, yet since all the world
talkes of it, the truth must not be disguised, and so take occasion to discover a fault
which no body knew before, and thereby (as the same Father says) <hi>cum gravitate et
tarditate aggredi maledictionem,</hi> to cut a mans throat gravely, and soberly, and so much
the more perswasively; because he seems, and pretends to do it all against his will;
This being the rule, and this the exumple, who amongst us is free from the passive ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny?
Who amongst us hath not some other man calumniated? Nay who is free
from the active part? Which of us in some of these degrees hath not calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated

of calumny, which is the bitterest of all, they abounded most, which is in scorne and

complaine passionately that they were made a scorne, that the wits made libells, that
drunkards sung songs, that fooles, and the children of fooles derided them; And
when <hi>Saul</hi> was in his last, and worst agony, and had abandoned himselfe to a present

should not kill him (for he desired death, and he had their deadly arrowes already in

and abuse him, he was afraid of scorne when he had but a few minutes of life. Since

                     <p>Lastly, Christ judges no man <hi>Ad internecionem,</hi> he judges no man so,<note place="margin">Non ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternecionem.</note> in this world,
as to give a finall condemnation upon him here; There is no error in any of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

against every man, every man may find his case recorded, and his sinne condemned in

every man sav'd by his book, by the apprehension, and application of the gratious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospell, to his case, and his conscience, Christ judges no man so, as that
he should see no remedy, but to curse God, and die, not so, as that he should say, his

                     <p>Now to collect both our Exercises, and to connexe both Texts, <hi>Christ judgeth
all men</hi> and <hi>Christ judgeth no man,</hi> he claimes all judgment, and he disavows all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and they consist well together, he was at our creation, but that was not his first
sense; the Arians who say, <hi>Erat quando non erat,</hi> there was a time when Christ was not,
intimating that he had a beginning, and therefore was a creature, yet they will allow
that he was created before the generall creation, and so assisted at ours, but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
generations before that, in the bosome of his Father, at our election, and there in
him was executed the first judgment of separating those who were his, the elect from
the reprobate, and then he knows who are his by that first Judgment: And so comes
to his second Judgment, to seale all those in the visible Church with the outward mark
of his baptisme, and the inward marke of his Spirit, and those whom he calls so, he
justifies, and sanctifies, and brings them to his third Judgment, to an established and
perpetuall glory. And so all Judgment is his. But then to judge out of humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and passions, by detraction, and calumny, as they did to whom he spoke at this
time, so he judges no man, so he denies judgment: To usurpe upon the jurisdiction of
others, or to exercise any other judgment, then was his commission, as his pretended
Vicar doth so he judges no man, so he disavows all judgment: To judge so as that our
condemnation should be irremediable in this life, so he judges no man, so he forswears all
judgment, As I live, saith the Lord of hosts, and as I have died, saith the Lord Jesus, so
I judge none. Acknowledge his first Judgment, thy election in him, Christ his second
Judgment, thy justification by him, breath and pant after his third Judgement, thy
Crown of glory for him; intrude not upon the right of other men, which is the first, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
not, calumniate not other men, which is the second, lay not the name of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
in this life upon any man, which is the third Judgement, that Christ disavows
here, and then thou shalt have well understood, and well practised both these texts,
<hi>The Father hath committed all Iudgment to the Sonne,</hi> and yet <hi>The Sonne judges no

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst those <hi>Articles,</hi> in which our Church hath explain'd, and declar'd
her faith, this is the <hi>eight</hi> Article, that the three Creeds, (that of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Nice,</hi> that of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and that which is commonly known
by the name of the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi>) ought throughly to be received, and
embrac'd. The meaning of the Church is not, that onely that should be
beleev'd in which those <hi>three Creeds agree;</hi> (for, the <hi>Nicen Creed</hi> mentions no Article
after that of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> not the Catholique Church, not the Communion of Saints,
not the Resurrection of the flesh; <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed does mention the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not the Catholique Church, nor the communion of Saints,) but that <hi>all</hi>
should be beleev'd, which is in any of them, all which is summ'd up in the Apostles
Creed. Now, the reason expressed in that Article of our Church, why all this is to be
beleeved, is; <hi>Because all this may be prov'd by most certaine warrants of holy Scriptures.</hi>
The Article does not insist upon particular places of Scripture; not so much as point
to them. But, they who have enlarged the Articles, by way of explanation, have done
that. And when they come to cite those places of Scripture, which prove the Article
of the Resurrection, I observe that amongst those places they forbeare this text; so that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93359:59"/>
it may seem, that in their opinion, this Scripture doth not concerne the <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
It will not therefore be impertinent, to make it a first part of this exercise, whether this
Scripture be to be understood of the Resurrection, or no; And then, to make the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
handling of the words, a second part. In the first, we shall see, that the <hi>Iews</hi>
always had, and have still, a persuasion of the Resurrection. We shall look after, by
<hi>what light</hi> they saw that; whether by the light of <hi>naturall reason;</hi> And, if not by that,
by what light given in other places of Scripture; and then, we shall shut up this inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
with a unanime consent, (so unanime, as I can remember but <hi>one</hi> that denies it,
and he but faintly) that in this text, the doctrine of the resurrection is established. In
the second part, the doctrine it selfe comprised in the words of the text, <hi>(And though
after my skin, wormes destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God)</hi> we shall see first,
that the <hi>Saints</hi> of God themselves, are not priviledged from the common corruption
and dissolution of the body; After that curse upon the Serpent, <hi>super pectus gradieris,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 14.</note>
upon thy belly shalt thou goe, we shall as soon see a Serpent goe upright, and not
craule, as, after that Judgment, <hi>In pulverem revertêris,</hi> to dust thou shalt returne, see a
man, that shall not see death, and corruption in death. Corruption upon our <hi>skin,</hi>
says the text, (our outward beauty;) corruption upon our <hi>body,</hi> (our whole strength,
and constitution.) And, this corruption, not a green palenesse, not a yellow jaundise,
not a blue lividnesse, not a black morpheu upon our skin, not a bony leannesse, not a
sweaty faintnesse, not an ungratious decrepitnesse upon our body, but a destruction, a
destruction to both, <hi>After my skin my body shall be destroyed.</hi> Though not destroyed
by being resolved to ashes in the fire, (perchance I shall not be burnt) not destroyed
by being washed to slime, in the sea, (perchance I shall not be drowned) but destroyed
contemptibly, by those whom I breed, and feed, by wormes; <hi>(After my skin wormes
shall destroy my body.)</hi> And thus farre our case is equall; one event to the good and bad;
wormes shall destroy all in them all. And farther then this, their case is equall too,
for, they shall both rise againe from this destruction. But in this lies the future glory,
in this lies the present comfort of the Saints of God, that, <hi>after all this,</hi> (so that this is
not my last act, to dye, nor my last scene, to lie in the grave, nor my last <hi>exit,</hi> to goe
out of the grave) <hi>after,</hi> says <hi>Iob;</hi> And indefinitely, <hi>After,</hi> I know not how soone,
nor how late, I presse not into Gods secrets for that; but, <hi>after all this, Ego,</hi> I, I that
speak now, and shall not speak then, silenced in the grave, I that see now, and shall not
see then, <hi>ego videbo,</hi> I shall see, (I shall have a new <hi>faculty) videbo Deam,</hi> I shall see <hi>God</hi>
(I shall have a new <hi>object</hi>) and, <hi>In carne,</hi> I shall see him in the <hi>flesh,</hi> (I shall have a new

new propriety in that flesh) this flesh which I have now, is not <hi>mine,</hi> but the wormes;
but that flesh shall be so mine, as I shall never <hi>devest it more,</hi> but <hi>in my flesh I shall see

                     <p>In the first part then, which is an inquiry,<note place="margin">1. Part.</note> whether this text concerne the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or no, we take knowledge of a <hi>Crediderunt,</hi> and of a <hi>Credunt</hi> in the <hi>Iews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iudhi cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt.</note> that the
<hi>Iews</hi> did beleeve a Resurrection, and that they doe beleeve it still. That they doe so
now, appears out of the doctrine of their <hi>Talmud,</hi> where we find, that <hi>onely the Iews</hi>
shall rise againe, but all the Gentiles shall perish, body and soule together, as <hi>Korah,<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 31. 26. 19.</note>
Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were swallowed all at once, body, and soule into hell. And to this
purpose, (for the first part thereof, that the <hi>Iews</hi> shall rise) they abuse that place of
<hi>Esay; Thy dead men shall live; awake and sing, yee that dwell in the dust.</hi> And,<note place="margin">14.</note> for the
second part, that the Gentiles shall not rise, they apply the words of the same Prophet
before, <hi>They are dead, they shall not live, they are deceased, they shall not rise.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi>
onely, say they shall rise; but, <hi>not all they;</hi> but onely the <hi>righteous</hi> amongst them.
And, to that purpose, they abuse that place of the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> two <hi>parts shall be
cut off, and dye, but the third shall be left therein, and I will bring that third part,<note place="margin">13. 8.</note> through
the fire, and will refine them, as silver is refined, and try them, as gold is tried.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi>

who were buried in the land of promise shall have this present, and immediate resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And to that purpose they force that place in <hi>Genesis</hi> where <hi>Iacob,</hi> upon his death-bed,
advised his sonne <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to bury him in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">47. 29.</note> and to that
purpose, they detort also, that place of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> where the Prophet lays that curse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Pashur, That he should dye in Babylon, and be buried there.</hi> For,<note place="margin">20. 6.</note> though the <hi>Iews</hi> doe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93359:60"/>
not absolutely say, that all that are buried out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> shall be without a resurrection,
yet, they say, that even those good and righteous <hi>Iews,</hi> which are not buried in that
great Churchyard, the land of promise, must, at the day of judgment, be brought
through the hollow parts of the earth into the land of promise at that time, and onely
in that place, receive their resurrection, wheresoever they were buried. But yet, though
none but <hi>Iews,</hi> none but righteous <hi>Iews,</hi> none but righteous <hi>Iews</hi> in that place, must

                     <p>It is so now; it was so always. We see, in that time, when <hi>Christ</hi> walked upon the
earth,<note place="margin">Crediderunt. Iohn 11. 23.</note> when he came to the raising of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and said to his sister <hi>Martha, Thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall rise againe,</hi> she replies to Christ, <hi>Alas,</hi> I know <hi>he shall rise</hi> againe, at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the last day,</hi> I make no doubt of that, we all know that. So also, when
Christ put forth that parable, that in placing of benefits,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 12.</note> we should rather choose such
persons, as were able to make no recompense, he gives that reason, <hi>Thou shalt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed
at the resurrection of the just.</hi> The Resurrection was a vulgar doctrine, well
knowne to the <hi>Iews</hi> then, and always. For, even <hi>Herod,</hi> when Christ preached and
did miracles, was apt to say,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn Baptist is risen from the dead;</hi> And when it is said of
those two great <hi>Apostles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 20. 9.</note> (the loving, and the beloved Apostle, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>) that
as yet they knew not the Scripture, that <hi>Christ must rise from the dead,</hi> this argues no
more, but that as <hi>Peters</hi> compassion before Christs death, made him disswade Christ
from going up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to suffer,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 12.</note> so their extreme passion after Christs death,
made them the lesse attentively to consider those particular Scriptures, which spoke of
the Resurrection. For, the <hi>Iews</hi> in generall, (much more, they) had always an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
and an acknowledgment of the Resurrection of the dead. By what light
they saw this, and how they came to this knowledge, is our next consideration.</p>
                     <p>Had they this by the common notions of other men,<note place="margin">An exratione.</note> out of naturall <hi>Reason? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanothon,</hi>
(who is no bold, nor rash, nor dangerous expressor of himselfe) says well,
<hi>Articulus resurrectionis propria Ecclesiaevox;</hi> It is the Christian Church, that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to us the article of the resurrection. Nature says it not, Philosophy says it not;
it is the language and the Idiotisme of the Church of God, that the resurrection is to
be beleeved as an article of faith. For, though articles of faith be not <hi>facta Ecclesiae,</hi>
they are <hi>dicta Ecclesiae,</hi> though the Church doe not <hi>make</hi> articles, yet she <hi>declares</hi>
them. In the Creation, the way was, <hi>Dixit &amp; facta sunt,</hi> God spake, and so things
were made; In the Gospell, the way is, <hi>Fecit, &amp; dicta sunt,</hi> God makes articles of
faith, and the Church utters them, presents them. That's <hi>manifestè verum,</hi> evidently,
undeniably true, that Nature, and Philosophy say nothing of articles of faith. But,
even in Nature, and in Philosophy, there is some preparation <hi>A priore,</hi> and much illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<hi>A posteriore,</hi> of the Resurrection. For, first, we know by naturall reason, that it
is no such thing, as God cannot doe; It implies no contradiction in it selfe, as that
new article of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> does; It implies no defectivenesse in God, as that
new article, <hi>The necessity of a perpetuall Vicar upon earth,</hi> does. For, things contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in themselves, (which necessarily imply a falshood) things arguing a defectivenesse
in God, (which implies necessarily a derogation, to his nature, to his naturall goodnesse,
to that which we may justly call even <hi>the God of God,</hi> that which makes him God to us,
<hi>his mercy)</hi> such things God himselfe cannot doe, not things which make him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull,
a cruell, a precondemning God. But, excepting onely such things, God,
who is that,<note place="margin">Grog. Narianz.</note> 
                        <hi>Quod cum dicitur, non potest dici,</hi> whom if you name you cannot give him

<hi>Quod cum definitur, ipsa definitione crescit,</hi> says the same Father; If you limit God with

God, I say, <hi>that works,</hi> and <hi>who shall let it? can</hi> raise our bodies again from the
dead, because, to doe so, implies no derogation to himselfe,<note place="margin">Esay 43. 13.</note> no contradiction to his word.</p>
                     <p>Our reason tells us, he <hi>can</hi> doe it; doth our reason tell us as much of his <hi>will,</hi> that
he will doe it? Our reason tells us, that he will doe,<note place="margin">Anvelit.</note> whatsoever is most convenient
for the Creature, whom, because he hath made him, he loves, and for his owne glory.
Now this dignity afforded to the dead body of man, cannot be conceived, but, as a
great addition to him. Nor can it be such a diminution to God, to take man into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as it was for God to descend, and to take mans nature upon him, upon Earth. A
King does not diminish himselfe so much, by taking an inferior person into his bosome
at Court, as he should doe by going to live with that person, in the Countrey, or City;
and this God did, in the incarnation of his Sonne. It cannot be thought inconvenient,
it cannot be thought hard. Our reason tells us, that in all Gods works, in all his materiall
works, still his latter works are easier then his former. The <hi>Creation,</hi> which was the
first, and was a meer production out of nothing, was the hardest of all. The <hi>specific ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Creatures, and the disposing of them, into their severall kinds, the making of that
which was made something of nothing before, a particular thing, a beast, afowle, a fish,
a plant, a man, a Sun or Moon, was not so hard, as the first production out of nothing.
And then, the <hi>conservation</hi> of all these, in that order in which they are first created, and
then distinguished, the Administration of these creatures by a constant working of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
causes, which naturally produce their effects, is not so hard as that. And so, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,

to mend, and, to give thee that which was mine, then to restore thee that which was

it before) to see an Oake that spreads so farre, rise out of an Akorne? Or if
Churchyards did vent themselves every spring, and that there were such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of bodies every yeare, when thou hadst seen as many Resurrections as

thus, this, and many other good and reverend men, and so the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

that nothing is as much in his power, as the world which he made of nothing;
And, as he called thee when thou wast not, as if thou hadst been, so will he
call thee againe, when thou art ignorant of that being which thou hast in the grave,
and give thee againe thy former, and glorifie it with a better being.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> then, if they had no other helpes,<note place="margin">Anex Scripturis.</note> might have, (as naturall men
may) preparations <hi>a Priore,</hi> and illustrations <hi>a Posteriore,</hi> for the doctrine of the
Resurrection. The <hi>Iews</hi> had seen resuscitations, from the dead in particular persons,
and they had seen miraculous cures done by their Prophets. And <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi>
says well,<note place="margin">Greg. Nyss.</note> that those miraculous cures which Christ wrought, with a <hi>Tolle gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum,</hi>
and an <hi>Este sanus,</hi> and no more, they were <hi>praeludia resurrectionis,</hi> halfe-resurrections,
prologues, and inducements to the doctrine of the resurrection, which
shall be transacted with a <hi>Surgite mortui,</hi> and no more. So these naturall helps
in the consideration of the creature, are <hi>praeludia resurrectionis,</hi> they are halfe-resurrections,
and these naturall resurrections carry us halfe way to the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
resurrection. But certainely, the <hi>Iews,</hi> who had that, which the Gentiles
wanted, <hi>The Scriptures,</hi> had from them, a generall, though not an explicite
knowledge of the resurrection. That they had it, we see by that practise of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
the Maccabee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Macab. 12. 43.</note> in gathering a contribution to send to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is
therefore commended, because he was therein mindefull of the Resurrection. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth Christ find any that opposed the doctrine of the Resurrection, but
those, who though they were tolerated in the State, because they were otherwise
great persons,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 5.</note> were absolute <hi>Heretiques,</hi> even amongst the <hi>Iews, The Sadduces.</hi>
And <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> when, finding himselfe to bee oppressed in Judgement, hee
used his Christian wisedome, and to draw a strong party to himselfe, protested
himselfe to bee of the sect of the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> and that, as they, and all the rest,
in generall, did, he maintained the Resurrection, he knew it would seem a strange
injury, and an oppression, to be called in question for that, that they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved;
Though therefore our Saviour Christ, who disputed then, onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Sadduces, argued for the doctrine of the Resurrection, onely from that
place of the Scripture, which those Sadduces acknowledged to be Scripture, (for
they denied all but the <hi>bookes of Moses</hi>)<note place="margin">Luke 20. 37.</note> and so insisted upon those words,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>I am
the God of Abraham,</hi> the <hi>God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob,</hi> yet certainely the
<hi>Iews</hi> had established that doctrine, upon other places too, though to the Sadduces
who accepted <hi>Moses</hi> onely, <hi>Moses</hi> were the best evidence. It is evident enough
in that particular place of <hi>Daniel, Many of them that sleep in the dust of the
earth, shall awake,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">12. 2.</note> some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting
contempt. And in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that word <hi>many,</hi> must not be restrained to lesse
then all; <hi>Daniel</hi> intends by that many, that how many soever they are, they
shall all arise;<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19. 12.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> does, when he says, By one mans disobedience, <hi>many</hi>
were made sinners; that is, <hi>All,</hi> for, death passed over <hi>all men,</hi> for all have sinned. And
Christ doth but paraphrase that place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who says, <hi>Multi,</hi> many, when he says,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93359:61"/>
                        <hi>Omnes,</hi> all; <hi>All that are in the grave shall heare his voyce and shall come forth;</hi> They that
have done good,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 28.</note> unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evill to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of damnation. This then being thus far settled, that the <hi>Iews understood</hi> the
resurrection, and more then that, they <hi>beleeved</hi> it, and therefore, as they had light
in nature, they had assurance in Scripture, come we now, to that which was our last
purpose in this first part, whether in <hi>this</hi> text, in these words of <hi>Iob, (though after my
skin, wormes destroy my body)</hi> there be any such light of the Resurrection given.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that in the new Testament, where the doctrine of the resurrection is more
evidently,<note place="margin">An ex hâc Scripturá.</note> more liquidly delivered, then in the old, (though it be delivered in the old
too) there is no place cited out of the book of <hi>Iob,</hi> for the resurrection; and so, this
is not. But it is no marvaile; both upon that reason which we noted before, that they
who were to be convinced, were such as received onely the <hi>books</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore
all citations from this booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> or any other had been impertinently and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
employed, and, because in the new Testament, there is but one place of this
booke of <hi>Iob</hi> cited at all.<note place="margin">1. 3. 19. 5. 13.</note> To the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the Apostle makes use of those words in
<hi>Iob, God taketh the wise in their owne craft;</hi> And more then this one place, is not, (I
thinke) cited out of this booke of <hi>Iob</hi> in the new Testament. But, the authority of <hi>Iob</hi>
is established in another place; <hi>you have heard of the patience of Iob, and you have seen
the end of the Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">5. 11.</note> says Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> As you have seen this, so you have heard that;
seen and heard one way, out of the Scripture; you have hard that out of the booke
of <hi>Iob,</hi> you have seen this out of the Gospell. And further then this, there is no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of <hi>Iobs</hi> person, or his booke in the new Testament. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> confesses,<note place="margin">Praefat. in Iob.</note> that
both the Greeke, and Latine Copies of this booke, were so defective in his time, that
seven or eight hundred verses of the originall were wanting in the booke. And, for the
originall it selfe, he says, <hi>Obliquus totus liber fertur, &amp; lubricus,</hi> it is an uncertaine and
slippery book. But this is onely for the sense of some places of the book; And that
made the authority of this book, to be longer suspended in the Church, and oftner
called into question by particular men, then any other book of the Bible. But, in those
who have, for many ages, received this book for Canonicall, there is an unanime ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
(at least, tacitely) that this peece of it, this text, <hi>(When, after my skin,
wormes shall destroy my body, yet in my flesh I shall see God)</hi> does establish the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                     <p>Divide the expositors into three branches; (for, so, the world will needs divide
them) The first,<note place="margin">Partes.</note> the Roman Church will call theirs; though they have no other title
to them, but that they received the same translation that they doe. And all they use this

<hi>Iobs</hi> case thus; God promised <hi>Iob twofold</hi> of all that he had lost; And in his
sheep and camels, and oxen, and asses, which were utterly destroyed, and brought to
nothing, God performes it punctually, he had all in a double proportion.<note place="margin">12.</note> But <hi>Iob</hi> had
seven sonnes; and three daughters before, and God gives him but seven sonnes;
and three daughters againe; And yet <hi>Iob</hi> had <hi>twofold</hi> of these too; for <hi>Postnati cum
prioribus numerantur, quia omnes deo vivunt;</hi> Those which were gone, and those which
were new given, lived all one life, because they lived all in God; <hi>Necquicquam aliud est
mors nisi viti, ositatis expiatio;</hi> Death is nothing else, but a devesting of those defects,
which made us lesse fit for God. And therefore, agreeably to this purpose, says Saint
<hi>Cyprian, Scimus non amitti, sed praemitti;</hi>

then to <hi>believe</hi> it now, after it hath been so evidently declar'd, not onely to be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
truth, but to be an article of faith) <hi>Scio Redemptorem,</hi> says he; I know not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Creator, but a Redeemer; And, <hi>Redemptorem meum,</hi> My Redeemer, which
implies a confidence, and a personall application of that Redemption to himself. <hi>Scio
vivere,</hi> says he; I know that he lives; I know that hee begunne not in his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I know he ended not in his death, but it always was, and is now, and shall for ever
be true, <hi>Vivit,</hi> that he lives still. And then, <hi>Scio venturum,</hi> says he too; I know hee
shall stand at the last day to Judge me and all the world; And after that, and <hi>after
my skinne and body is destroyed by worms, yet in my flesh I shall see God.</hi> And so have you
as much as we proposed for our first part; That the Jews do now, that they always
did believe a Resurrection; That as naturall men, and by naturall reason they might
know it, both in the possibility of the thing, and in the purpose of God, that they
had better helpes then naturall reason, for they had divers places of their Scripture,
and that this place of Scripture, which is our text, hath evermore been received for
a proof of the Resurrection. Proceed we now, to those particulars which constitute
our second part, such instructions concerning the Resurrection, as arise out of these
words, <hi>Though after my skinne, worms destroy my body, yet in my flesh I shall see God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this second part, the first thing that was propos'd, was, That the Saints of God,<note place="margin">2. Part. Sancti non eximuntur.</note>
are not priviledg'd from this, which fell upon <hi>Iob,</hi> This Death, this dissolution after
death. Upon the <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> that double death, interminated by God upon <hi>Adam,</hi>
there is a <hi>Non obstante; Revertere,</hi> turn to God, and thou shalt not dy the death, not the
second death. But upon that part of the sentence, <hi>In pulverem reverteris, To dust thou shalt
return,</hi> there is no <hi>Non obstante;</hi> though thou turn to God, thou must turn into the grave;
for, hee that redeem'd thee from the other death, redeem'd not himself from this.
Carry this consideration to the last minute of the world,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 17.</note> when we that remain shall bee
caught up in the clouds, yet even that last fire may be our fever, those clouds our
winding sheets, that rapture our dissolution; and so, with <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> most of
the ancients, most of the latter men think, that there shall be a sudden dissolution of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soul, which is death, and a sudden re-uniting of both, which is resurrection,
in that instant; <hi>Quis Homeo,</hi> is <hi>Davids</hi> question; <hi>What man is he that liveth and shall
not see death?</hi> Let us adde, <hi>Quis Deoram?</hi> What god is he amongst the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Psal. 89. 48.</note>
that hath not seen death? Which of their three hundred <hi>Iupiters,</hi> which of their
thousands of other gods, have not seen death? <hi>Mortibus morjuntur;</hi> we may adde to
that double death in Gods mouth, another death; The gods of the Gentiles have
dyed <hi>thrice;</hi> In body, in soul, and in fame; for, though they have been glorified with
a Deification, nor one of all those old gods, is, at this day, worshipt, in any part of
the world, but all those temporary, and transitory Gods, are worn out, and dead in
all senses. Those gods, who were but men, fall under <hi>Davids</hi> question, <hi>Quis Home?</hi>
And that man who was truly God, fals under it too, Christ Jesus; He saw death,
though he saw not the death of this text, <hi>Corruption.</hi> And, if we consider the effusion
of his precious blood, the contusion of his sacred flesh, the extention of those sinews,
and ligaments which tyed heaven, and earth together, in a reconciliation, the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of that Intelligence from that sphear, of that high Priest from that Temple, of
that Dove from that Arke, of that soul from that body, that dissolution (which, as an

the infallibility of the manifold prophesies, preserv'd him from it) had been but a

<hi>Pliny</hi> says, that when their thin silke stuffes were first invented at Rome, <hi>Excogitatum

Our women are not so carefull, but they expose their nakednesse professedly, and
paint it, to cast bird-lime for the passengers eye. Beloved, good dyet makes the best
Complexion, and a good Conscience is a continuall feast; A cheerfull

or an ear, where in the grave they doe not praise God? Doth not that body
that boasted but yesterday of that priviledge above all creatures, that it onely could

And doth it not to morrow lose his other priviledge, of looking up to heaven? Is it

remove us from any high valuation, or any great confidence, in that skinne, and in

high-way, and dust upon the Kings grave, are both, or neither, Dust Royall, and
may change places; who knows the revolutions of dust? Even in the dead body of
Christ Jesus himself, one dram of the decree of his Father, one sheet, one sentence of
the prediction of the Prophets preserv'd his body from corruption, and incineration,
more then all <hi>Iosephs</hi> new tombs, and fine linnen, and great proportion of spices
could have done. O, who can expresse this inexpreffible mystery? The foul of Christ
Jesus, which took no harm by him, contracted no Originall sin, in coming to him,
was guilty of no more sin, when it went out, then when it came from the breath
and bosome of God, yet this soul left this body in death. And the Divinity, the
Godhead, incomparably better then that soul, which soul was incomparably better
then all the Saints, and Angels in heaven, that Divinity, that God-head did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake

it was nothing so much, that God did assume mans nature, as that God did still

Thou that wouldst not admit the breath of the ayre upon thy skinne, and yet hast ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the spirit of lust, and unchast solicitations to breath upon thee, in execrable
oathes, and blasphemies, to vicious purposes; Thou, whose body hath (as farre as it
can) putrefyed and corrupted even the body of thy Saviour, in an unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thereof, in this <hi>skinne,</hi> in this <hi>body,</hi> must be the food of worms, the prey of
destroying worms. After a low birth thou mayst passe an honourable life, after a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

canst thou make these worms silke worms? They were bold and early worms that
eat up <hi>Herod</hi> before he dyed; They are bold and everlasting worms, which after thy
skinne and body is destroyed, shall remain as long as God remains, in an eternall

                     <p>Thus farre then to the <hi>destroying of skinne and body by worms,</hi> all men are equall;

The Resurrection is common to all. The prerogative lies not in the Rising, but in the
rising to the fruition of the sight of God; in which consideration, the first beam of
comfort is the <hi>Postquam, After all this,</hi> destruction before by worms; ruinous misery
before; but there is something else to be done upon me after. God leaves no state
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93359:63"/>
without comfort. God leaves some inhabitants of the earth, under longer nights then
others, but none under an everlasting night; and, those, whom he leaves under those
long nights, he recompenses with as long days, after. I were miserable, if there were
not an <hi>Antequam</hi> in my behalfe; if before I had done well or ill actually in this world,
God had not wrapped me up, in his <hi>good purpose</hi> upon me. And I were miserable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if there were not a <hi>Postquam</hi> in my behalfe; If, after my sinne had cast me into
the grave, there were not a lowd trumpet to call me up, and a gracious countenance to
looke upon me, when I were risen. Nay, let my life have been as religious, as
the infirmities of this life can admit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> yet, <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Christ, we
are, of all men, most miserable.</hi> For, for the worldly things of this life, first, the children
of God have them in the least proportions of any; and besides that, those children of
God, which have them in larger proportion, do yet make the least use of them, of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because the children of the world, are not so tender conscienced, nor so much
afraid, lest those worldly things should become snares, and occasions of tentation to
them, if they open themselves to a full enjoying thereof, as the children of God are.
And therefore, after my wanting of many worldly things, (after a penurious life) and,
after my not daring to use those things that I have, so freely as others doe, after that
holy and conscientious forbearing of those things that other men afford themselves,
after my leaving all these absolutely behind me here, and my skin and body in destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

they that knew nothing. After, when he had invested immortality, <hi>per sui exceptionem,</hi>
(says that Father) he excepts none but himselfe; all the rest, even the <hi>Apostles,</hi> were
left ignorant thereof. For this <hi>non est vestrum,</hi> (it is not for you) is part of the last
sentence that ever Christ spake to them. If it be a convenient answer to say, Christ
knew it not, as man, how bold is that man that will pretend to know it? And, if it be
a convenient interpretation of Christs words, that he knew it not, that is, knew it not
so, as that he might tell it them, how indiscreet are they, who, though they may seem
to know it, will publish it? For, thereby they fill other men with scruples, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and they open themselves to scorne and reproach, when their predictions prove
false, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> observed in his time, and every age hath given examples since,
of confident men that have failed in these conjectures. It is a poore pretence to say,
this intimation, this impression of a certaine time, prepares men with better dispositions.
For, they have so often been found false, that it rather weakens the credit of the thing
it selfe. In the old world they knew exactly the time of the destruction of the world;
that there should be an hundred &amp; twenty years,<note place="margin">Gén. 6. 3.</note> before the flood came; And yet, upon

Christ in the flesh one thousand two hundred yeares; in Christs glorifyed

the Resurrection, cannot be a spectacle, a perspective glasse to our soul. We shall see
the Humanity of Christ with our bodily eyes, then glorifyed; but, that flesh, though
glorifyed, cannot make us see God better, nor clearer, then the soul alone hath done,

and reduced to a thinnesse, and subtlenesse, that they were <hi>aery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and not bodies of flesh and blood. This error made a great noise, and raised a
great dust, till the Emperour, to avoid scandall, (which for the most part arises out
of publick conferences) was pleased to hear <hi>Eutychius,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> dispute this point
privately before himself, and a small company; And, that upon conference, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
was so well satisfyed, that hee commanded <hi>Eutychius</hi> his books to bee
burnt. That after this, both <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Eutychius</hi> fell sicke; but <hi>Eutychius</hi>
dyed; and dyed with this protestation, <hi>In hâc carne,</hi> in this flesh, (taking up
the flesh of his hand in the presence of them that were there) in this flesh, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that I, and all men shall arise at the day of Judgement. Now, the principall
place of Scripture, which in his book, and in that conference <hi>Eutychius</hi> stood upon,
was this Text, these words of <hi>Saint Paul; (This I say brethren, that flesh and blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inherit the Kingdome of God.)</hi> And the directest answer that <hi>Gregory</hi> gave to it was,
<hi>Caro secundum culpam non regnabit, sed Caro secundum naturam;</hi> sinfull flesh shall not,
but naturall flesh, that is, flesh indued with all qualities of flesh, all such qualities
as imply no defect, no corruption, (for there was <hi>flesh</hi> before there was <hi>sin</hi>) such flesh,
and such blood shall inherit the Kingdome of God.</p>
                     <p>As there have been more Heresies about the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Christ, then about his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi>
so there have been more heresies about the Resurrection of his body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of ours, then about any other particular article, that concerns his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Exaltation. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> strook deepest at first, to the root; That there
was no Resurrection at all; The Gnosticks, (who took their name from <hi>knowledge,</hi>
as though they knew all, and no body else any thing, which is a pride transferr'd
through all Heretickes: for, as that sect in the Roman Church, which call themselves
<hi>Ignorantes,</hi> and seem to pretend to no knowledge, doe yet believe that they know a
better way to heaven, then all other men doe, so that sect amongst them, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
themselves <hi>Nullanos,</hi> Nothings, thought themselves greater in the Kingdome of
God, then either of the other two sects of diminution, the <hi>Minorits,</hi> or the <hi>Minims</hi>
did) These Gnosticks acknowledged a Resurrection, but they said it was of the <hi>soul</hi>
onely, and not of the body, for they thought that the soul lay dead (at least, in a dead
sleep) till the Resurrection. Those Heretickes that are called the <hi>Arabians,</hi> did (as
the Gnosticks did) affirm a temporary death of the soul, as well as of the body, but
then they allowed a Resurrection to both soul, and body, after that death, which the
Gnostickes did not, but to the soul onely. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> (of whom <hi>Saint
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93359:65"/>
Paul</hi> speakes) they restrained the Resurrection to the soule,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 18.</note> but then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
this Resurrection of the soule to this life, and that in those who were
baptized, the Resurrection was accomplished already. <hi>Eutychius,</hi> (whom wee
mentioned before) enlarged the Resurrection to the body, as well as to the soul, but
enlarged the qualities of the body so far, as that it was scarce a body. The <hi>Armenian</hi>
hereticks said; that it was not onely <hi>Corpus hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>num,</hi> but <hi>Corpus masculinum,</hi> That
all should rise in the perfecter sex, and none, as <hi>women. Origen</hi> allowed a Resurrection,
and allowed the Body to be a naturall body; but the contracted the time; he said, that
when we rose we should enjoy the benefits of the resurrection, even in <hi>bodily pleasures,</hi>
for a <hi>thousand years,</hi> and then be annihilated, or absorpted and swallowed up into the
nature, and essence of God himselfe; (for, it will be hard to state <hi>Origens</hi> opinion in
this point; <hi>Origen</hi> was not, herein, well understood in his owne time; not doe we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
him now, (for the most part) but by his accusers, and those that have written
against him.) Divers of these Heretiques, for the maintenance of their severall heresies,
perverted this Scripture, <hi>(Flesh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God)</hi> and that
occasioned those <hi>Fathers</hi> who opposed those heresies, so diverse from one another, to
interpret these words diversly, according to the heresie they opposed. All agree, that
they are an argument for the resurrection, though they seem at first, to oppose it. For,
this Chapter hath three generall parts; first, <hi>Resurrectionem esse,</hi> that there shall be a
Resurrection, which the Apostle proves by many and various arguments to the <hi>thirty
fifth verse.</hi> And then <hi>Quati corpore,</hi> the body shall rise, but some will say, <hi>How are the
dead raised,</hi> and <hi>with what body, doe they come?</hi> in that <hi>thirty fifth verse:</hi> And lastly, <hi>Quid
de superstitibus,</hi> what shall become of them, who shall be found alive, at the day? <hi>We
shall all be changed, verse fifty one.</hi> Now, this text is the knot, and corollary or all the
second part, concerning the qualities of the bodies in the resurrection; <hi>Now,</hi> says the
Apostle, now that I have said enough to prove that a resurrection there is, now, now that
I have said enough what kind of bodies shall arise, now, I show you as much in the
Negative as I have done in the Affirmative, now I teach you what to avoid, as well as
I have done what to affect, <hi>now</hi> this <hi>I say brethren,</hi> that <hi>flesh and bloud cannot inherit the
kingdome of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, though those words be primarily, principally intended of the <hi>last</hi> Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
yet in a secondary respect, they are appliable in themselves, and very often
applied by the ancients,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> to the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> our resurrection in this life. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
hath intimated, and presented both together, elegantly, when he says of God, <hi>Nobis
arrhabonem spiritus reliquit, &amp; arrhabonem à nobis accepit,</hi> God hath given us his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and a pawn from him upon earth, in giving us the holy Ghost, and he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
our earnest, and a pawn from us into heaven, by receiving our nature, in the
body of Christ Jesus there. Flesh and bloud, when it is conformed to the flesh and bloud
of Christ now <hi>glorified,</hi> and made like his, by our <hi>resurrectien,</hi> may inherite the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, in heaven. Yea flesh and bloud being conformed to Christ by the
<hi>sanctification</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> here, in this world, may inherit the kingdome of God,
here upon earth; for, God hath a kingdome here; and there is a Communion in
<hi>Armes,</hi> as well as a communion in <hi>Triumph.</hi> Leaving then that acceptation of flesh
and bloud, which many thinke to be intended in this text, that is, <hi>Animalis caro,</hi> flesh
and bloud that must be maintained by eating, and drinking, and preserved by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and generation, that flesh, and that bloud cannot inherit heaven, where there
is no marying, nor giving in mariage, but <hi>Erimus sicut Angeli,</hi> we shall be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
(though such a heaven, in part, <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath proposed to his followers, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that should abound with worldly delights, and such a heaven the Disciples of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
and the <hi>Millenarians,</hi> that look for one thousand years of all temporall felicity,
proposed to themselves; And, though amongst our latter men, <hi>Cajetan</hi> doe thinke,
that the Apostle in this text, bent himselfe upon that doctrine, <hi>non caro, non Animalis
caro,</hi> flesh and bloud, that is, no carnall, no worldly delights are to be looked for, in

corruptibilis,</hi> flesh and bloud cannot, that is, flesh that is yet subject to corruption, and
dissolution, and naturall passions and impressions, tending to defectivenesse, flesh that
is still subject to any punishment that God lays upon flesh, for sinne, such flesh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inherit the kingdome of God hereafter; for our present possession of the kingdome
of God here, our <hi>corrupt</hi> flesh must be purged by <hi>Sanctification</hi> here, for the future
kingdome, our naturall <hi>Corruptiblenesse</hi> must be purged by <hi>glorification</hi> there. We will
make the last part first, as this flesh, and this bloud, by devesting the corruptiblenesse it
suffers here, by that glorification, shall inherit that kingdome; and, not stay long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it neither. For, of that we have spoken conveniently before, of the resurrection it
selfe. Now we shall looke a little into <hi>the qualities</hi> of <hi>bodies</hi> in <hi>the resurrection;</hi> and
that, not in the intricacies, and subtilties of the Schoole, but onely in that one patterne,
which hath been given us of that glory, upon earth, which is the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> of
Christ; for, that Transfiguration of his, was a representation of a glorified body in a
glorified state. And then in the second place, we shall come to our first part, what that
flesh and bloud is that is denied to be capable of the inheritance of that kingdome here,
that is, that earnest of heaven, and that inchoation of heaven which may be had in this

here, and what this kingdome of God, that heaven which is proposed to us here, is.</p>
                     <p>First then,<note place="margin">1. Part. Melancthon.</note> for the first acceptation, (which is of the <hi>later</hi> resurrection) no man denies
that which <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath collected and established to be the summe of this text,
<hi>Statuit resurrectionem in corpore, sed non quale jam corpus est;</hi> The Apostle establishes
a resurrection of the body, but yet not such a body as this is. It is the <hi>same</hi> body, and
yet not <hi>such</hi> a body; which is a mysterious consideration, that it is the <hi>same</hi> body, and
yet not <hi>such</hi> as it selfe, nor like any other body of the same substance. But, what kind
of body then? We content ourselves with that, <hi>Transfiguratio specimen appositissimum
Resurrectionis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Musculus.</note> the Transfiguration of Christ, is the best glasse to see this resurrection,
and state of glory in. But how was that transfiguration wrought? We content our
selves with Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> expressing of it,<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> 
                        <hi>non pristinam amisit veritatem, vel formam
corporis;</hi> Christ had still the same ture, and reall body, and he had the same forme, and
proportion, and lineaments, and dimensions of his body, in it selfe. <hi>Transfiguratio non
faciem subtraxit, sed splendorem ad didit,</hi> sayes he; It gave him not another face, but
it super-immitted such a light, such an illustration upon him, as, by that irradiation,
that coruscation, the beames of their eys were scattered, and disgregated, dissipated so,
as that they could not collect them, as at other times, nor constantly, and confidently
discerne him. <hi>Moses</hi> had a measure, a proportion of this; but yet when <hi>Moses</hi> came
down with his shining face,<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 29. Mat. 17.</note> though they were not able to looke long upon him, they
knew him to be <hi>Moses.</hi> When Christ was transfigured in the presence of <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and
<hi>Iohn,</hi> yet they knew him to be Christ. Transfiguration did not so change him, nor shall
glorification so change us, as that we shall not be <hi>known.</hi> There is nothing to convince a
man of error, nothing in nature, nothing in Scriptures, if he beleeve that he shall know
those persons in heaven, whom he knew upon earth; and, if he conceive soberly, that it
were a lesse degree of blessednesse, <hi>not</hi> to know them, then to know them, he is bound to
beleeve that he shall know them,<note place="margin">Aquin.</note> for he is bound to beleeve, that all that conduces to
blessednes shall be given him. The School resolves, that at the Judgement, all the <hi>sins</hi>
of all, shall be manifested to all; even those secret sinfull <hi>thoughts</hi> that never came out of
the heart. And, when any in the School differs or departs from this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion, they
say onely,<note place="margin">Lombar.</note> that those sins which have been, in <hi>particular, repented,</hi> shall not be manifested:
all others shall. And therefore it is a deep uncharitablenes, to reproach any man, of sins
formerly repented; and a deep uncharitablenesse not to beleeve, that he whom thou seest
at the <hi>Communion,</hi> hath repented his former sins; Reproach no man, after thou hast seen
him <hi>receive,</hi> with last years sins; except thou have good evidence of his <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> then,
or of his <hi>Relapsing</hi> after; For, in those two cases, a man remaines, or becomes againe
guilty of his former sinnes. Now, if in heaven they shall know the hearts of one another,
whose faces they never knew before, there is lesse difficulty in knowing them, whom we
did know before. From this transfiguration of Christ, in which, the mortall eye of the
Apostles, did see that representation of the glory of Christ, the Schooles make a good
argument, that in heaven we shall doe it much more. And though in this case of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93359:66"/>
Transfiguration, in which the eyes of mortall men could have no proportion with that
glory of heaven, this may bee well said to have been done, either <hi>Moderando lumen,</hi>
(that God abated that light of glory) or <hi>Confortando visum,</hi> (that God exalted their
sense of seeing supernaturally) no such distinctions, or modifications will bee
needfull in heaven, because how highly soever the body of my Father, or of my
friend shall bee glorifyed there, mine eyes shall be glorifyed as much, and we are
both kept in the same proportion there, as wee had towards one another here;
here my naturall eye could see his naturall face, and there mine eye is as much
mended, as his body is, and my sense as much exalted as mine object; And as
well, as I may know, that I am I; I may know, that He is He; for, I shall not know
my selfe, nor that state of glory which I am then in, by any light of Nature which
I brought thither, but by that light of Glory which I shall receive there. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man finds, that this consideration does him good in his conversation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards
him towards some sinnes; how shall I stand then, when all the world shall see,
that my solicitation hath brought such a woman to the stews, to the Hospitall, to
hell, who had scap'd all this, if I had not corrupted her at first, (which no man in
the world knew before, and all shall know then.) Or that my whispering, and my
calumny hath overthrown such a man in his place, in his reputation, in his fortune
(which he himself knew not before, and all shall know then.) Or, that my counsell,
or my example hath been a furtherance to any mans spirituall edification here. He that
in rectified reason, and a rectified conscience finds this, in Gods name let him beleeve;
yea, for Gods sake let him take heed of not beleeving that we shall know one another,
<hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> in the Resurrection, as the Apostles did know Christ at the
Transfiguration, which was a Type of it.</p>
                     <p>This Transfiguration then upon earth; was the same glory, which Christ had after,
in heaven.<note place="margin">

even of this transfiguration upon earth, there is but little said to us. Let us
modestly take that which is expressed in it, and not search over-curiously farther into
that which is signifyed, and represented by it; which is, the state of glory in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
First, his face shin'd as the <hi>Sunne,</hi> says that Gospell, he could not take a
higher comparison,<note place="margin">Sol. Mat. 17. 2.</note> for our Information, and for our admiration in this world, then
the Sunne. And then, the Saints of God in their glorifyed state are admitted to the
same comparison. <hi>The righteous shall shine out as the Sunne in the Kingdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
the Sunne of the firmament which should be their comparison,<note place="margin">13. 43.</note> will be gone;
But the Sun of grace and of glory, the Son of God shall remain; and they shall shine

power, Light is operative, and works upon others. The bodies of the Saints of God;
shall receive all impressions of glory in themselves, and they shall doe all that is to bee
done, for the glory of God there. There, they shall stand in his service, and they shall
kneel in his worship, and they shall fall in his reverence, and they shall sing in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

                     <p>Now,<note place="margin">Societas.</note> there is thus much more considerable, and applyable to our present purpose,
in this tranfiguration of Christ, that there was <hi>company</hi> with them. Be not apt to think

                     <p>There was company in the transfiguration;<note place="margin">Quaesocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</note> but no other company then <hi>Moses,</hi> and
<hi>Elias,</hi> and Christ, and the Apostles; none but they, to whom God had manifested
himself otherwise then to a meer naturall man, otherwise then as a generall God.
For, in the <hi>Law,</hi> and in the <hi>Padagogie,</hi> and Schoolmastership, and instruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
God had manifested himself particularly by <hi>Moses,</hi> In <hi>Elias</hi> and the Prophets,
whom God sent in a continuall succession, to refresh that manifestation which he had
given of himself in the <hi>Law,</hi> before, in the example of these rules, in <hi>him,</hi> who was the
consummation of the Law, and the Prophets, <hi>Christ Iesus;</hi> And then, in the <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of all this, by the Apostles, and by the Church established by them, God
had more particularly manifested himself, then to <hi>naturall</hi> men. <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> Christ,
and the Apostles, make up the houshold of the faithfull; and none have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in the Resurrection, but in, and by these; These, to whom, and by whom,
God hath exhibited himself, to his Church, by other notions, then as one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
God; For, nothing will save a man, but to believe in God; so as God hath
proposed himself, in <hi>his Son,</hi> in his Scriptures, in his Christ.</p>
                     <p>These were with him in the transfiguration,<note place="margin">Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> and they <hi>talked with him,</hi> says that text.

in every age raised up some to declare their impieties and usurpations. But then, when
they bent all their thoughts entirely, and prosperously upon possessing this <hi>world,</hi>
they thought they might spare the Resurrection well enough; As hee that hath
a plentifull fortune in Europe, cares not much though there be no land of perfumes in
the East, nor of gold, in the West-Indies; God in our days, hath given us, and our
Church, the fat of the glory of this world too, and we also neglect the other: But
when men of a different religion from them, (for they will needs call a differing from
their errours, a different Religion, as though all their religion were errours, for (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
errours) we differ in no point) when, I say, such men came to enquire into
them, to discover them, and to induce or to attempt in divers parts of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a reformation, then they shut themselves up closer, then they grew more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of their manners, and did reform themselves somewhat, though not thoroughly,
and are the better for that reformat on which was offered to them, and wrought more
effectually upon others? As we say in the School, that even the Devill is somewhat
the better for the death of Christ, so the Roman Church is somewhat the better
for the Reformation. Our assiduity of <hi>preaching</hi> hath brought them to another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of frequency in preaching, then before the Reformation they were accustomed to,
and our answers to their books have brought them to a more reserved manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
then they used before. Let us therefore by their example, make as good use of
our enemies, as our enemies have done of us. For, though we have no military enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
no hostility with any nation, though we must all, and doe, out of a true sense of
our duty to God, pray ever for the continuance of peace amongst Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and to withhold the effusion of Christian blood, yet to that intendment, and in
that capacity as they were our enemies in 88. when they provoked by their <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,</hi>
dangerous invasions, and in that capacity as they were our enemies in
603. when they bent their malice even against that place, where the Laws for the
maintenance of our religion were enacted, so they are our enemies still, if we be still
of the same religion. He that by Gods mercy to us, leads us, is as sure that the <hi>Pope</hi> is
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> now, as he was <hi>then;</hi> and we that are blessedly led by him, are as sure, that
their doctrine is the doctrine of <hi>Devils,</hi> now, as we were then. Let us therefore
make use of those enemies, and of their aery insolences, and their frothy confidences, as
thereby to be the firmer in our selves, and the carefuller of our children, and servants,
that we send not for such a Physitian as brings a <hi>Roman Priest</hi> for his <hi>Apothecary,</hi> nor
entertain such a School-master, as brings a <hi>Roman Priest</hi> for his <hi>Vsher,</hi> nor such a <hi>Mercer,</hi>
as brings a Priest for his <hi>Tayler;)</hi> for, in these shapes they have, and will appear.) But
in true <hi>faith</hi> to God, true <hi>Allegiance</hi> to our Prince, <hi>true obedience</hi> to the Church, <hi>true
dealing</hi> with all men, make our selves sure of the Resurrection in the next life; <hi>In

which cleave to our flesh here, that we bee not corrupted <hi>spiritually,</hi> (not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
out of our Religion, nor jeasted out, nor threatened out, nor bought out,
nor beat out of the truth of God) nor corrupted <hi>carnally</hi> by the <hi>pleasures</hi> or <hi>profits</hi>
of this world, but that wee may conforme our selves to the purity of Christ
Jesus, in that measure, which wee are able to attain to, which is our spirituall
Resurrection, and constitutes our second part, That Kingdome of God, which flesh
and blood may inherit in this life.</p>
                     <p>From the beginning we setled that,<note place="margin">2. Part.</note> That the primary purpose of the Apostle in

endevour a conformity to him, in our life, and conversation; In this, hee is our
King, and wee are his Subjects, and this is this Kingdome of God, the Kingdome
of Grace. Now the title, by which we make claim to this Kingdome, is in our text
<hi>Inheritance:</hi> Who can, and who cannot inherit this Kingdome of God. I cannot
have it by purchase, by mine own merits and good works; It is neither my former
good disposition, nor Gods fore-sight of my future cooperation with him, that
is the cause of his giving mee his grace. I cannot have this by Covenant, or
by the gift, or bequeathing of another, by works of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> (that a
Martyr of the primitive Church should send mee a violl of his blood, a splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his bone, a Collop of his flesh, wrapped up in a halfe sheet of paper,
in an imaginary six-penny Indulgence from Rome, and bid mee receive grace;
and peace of Conscience in that.) I cannot have it by purchase, I cannot have it
by gift, I cannot have it by Curtesie, in the right of my wife, That if I will let
her live in the obedience of the Roman Church, and let her bring up my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

whence growes mine Inheritance? <hi>Ex semine Dei;</hi> because I am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated

                        <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 9.</note> for, <hi>his seed remaineth in him,</hi> and hee cannot sinne, because
hee is born of God: That is, hee cannot desire to sinne; Hee cannot <hi>antidate</hi>
a sinne, by delighting in the hope of a future sin, and sin in a praefruition of his sinne,
before the act; Hee cannot post-date a sinne, delight in the memory of a past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinne,
and sin it over againe, in a post-fruition of that sinne; Hee cannot boast
himself of sinne, much lesse bely himself in glorying in sinnes, never done; Hee
cannot take sinnes dyet, therefore, that hee may bee able to sinne againe next
Spring; Hee cannot hunger and thirst, and then digest and sleepe quietly after a
sinne; and to this purpose, and in this sense Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> says, <hi>Praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati
non possunt peccare,</hi> That the Elect cannot sinne; And in this also,
That when the sinnes of the Elect, are brought to tryall, and to judgement,
there their sinnes are no sinnes; not because they are none in themselves,
but because the blood of Jesus covering them, they are <hi>none in the eyes of God.</hi> I am
Heir then as I am the Son of God, born of the seed of God. But, what is that seed?
<hi>Verbum Dei,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iames 1. 18.</note> the seed is the word of God, <hi>Of his own will beg at he us,</hi> (says that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle)

                        <hi>The seed is the word of God.</hi> We have this Kingdome of God,

thine, says the <hi>Septuagint:</hi> You see then how much goes to the making up of this <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi>
of the Kingdome of God in this world, First, <hi>Vt habeamus verbum,</hi> That we
have this <hi>seed</hi> of God, his <hi>word;</hi> (In the Roman Church they have it not; not that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93359:69"/>
that Church hath it not, not that it is not there; but they, the people that have
it not) and then, <hi>Vt possideamus,</hi> That we possesse it, or rather that it possesse us; that
we make the Word the <hi>onely rule</hi> of our faith, and of our actions; (In the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> they do not so, they have not pure wheat, but <hi>mestlin,</hi> other things joyned
with this good seed, the word of God) and lastly, <hi>Vt simus Deo,</hi> That we be his, that we be
so <hi>still,</hi> that we doe not begin with God, and give over, but that this seed of God, of
which we are born,<note place="margin">11. 23.</note> may (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> says) <hi>be incorruptible,</hi> and abide for ever; that
wee may be his so entirely, and so constantly, as that we had rather have no <hi>beeing,</hi>
then for any time of suspension, or for any part of his fundamentall truth, be without
it, and this the <hi>Roman</hi> Church cannot be said to do, that expunges and interlines ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of faith,<note place="margin">Mal. 2: 15.</note> upon <hi>Reason of State,</hi> and emergent occasions. <hi>God hath made you one,</hi>
says the Prophet,<note place="margin">Ribera.</note> who bee the parties whom God hath maryed together, and made
<hi>One,</hi> in that place? you and your religion; (as our expositors interpret that place.)
And why <hi>One,</hi> says the Prophet there; <hi>That God might have a godly seed,</hi> says he, that
is, a continuation, a propagation, a race, a posterity of the same religion; Therefore
says he, <hi>Let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</hi> Let none divorce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from that religion, and that worship of God, which God put into his armes, and
which he embraced in his Baptism. Except there be errour in <hi>fundamentall</hi> points,
such as make that Church no Church, let no man depart from that Church, and that
religion, in which he delivered himself to the service of God at first. Wo be unto us,
if we deliver not over our religion to our posterity, in the same sincerity, and the same
totality in which our Fathers have delivered it us; for that, that continuation, is that,
that makes it an inheritance: for, (to conclude this) every man hath an inheritance in
the <hi>Law,</hi> and yet if he be hanged, he is hanged <hi>by the Law,</hi> in which hee had his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
so wee have our inheritance in the Word of God, and yet, if wee bee damned,
we are damned by that Word;<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>If thy heart turn away, so as that thou worship other Gods,
I denounce unto you this day, that you shall surely perish.</hi> So then, wee have an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in this Kingdome, if we preserve it, and we incurre a forfeiture of it, if wee have
not <hi>this seed,</hi> (The Word, the truth of Religion) so as that we <hi>possesse</hi> it; that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our selves to him, whose Word it is, by it, and possesse it so, as that we perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in the true profession of it, to our end; for, <hi>Perseverance,</hi> as well as <hi>Possession,</hi> enters
into our title, and inheritance to this Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>You see then,<note place="margin">Caro &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis.</note> what this Kingdome of God is; It is, when he comes, and his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
when he comes in his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and speaks in his <hi>Word;</hi> when he speaks and
is answered; knocks and is received, (he knocks in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and is received in
our <hi>Obedience</hi> to them, he knocks in his <hi>example,</hi> and most holy conversation, and
is received in our <hi>conformity,</hi> and imitation.) So have you seen what the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of
this Kingdome is, it is a Having, and Holding of the Gospel, a present, and a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
possession,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 11.</note> a holding fast, lest another (another Nation, another Church) take
our Crown. There remains onely that you see, upon whom the exclusion fals; and for
the clearing of that, <hi>This I say brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is fully express'd by Saint <hi>Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> The carnall mind is enmity against God.</hi> It is not a
coldnesse, a slacknesse, an omission, a preterition of some duties towards God, but it is
<hi>Enmity,</hi> and that's an exclusion out of the Kingdome; for, (says the Apostle there)
it is not <hi>subject to the Law of God;</hi> and no subjection, no Kingdome; it is not, says hee,
neither can it be; <hi>It is not,</hi> that excludes the <hi>present; It cannot be,</hi> that excludes the
<hi>future;</hi> so that it is onely this incorrigible, this desperate state that constitutes this
flesh, and blood, that cannot inherit the Kingdome of God; for this implies <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitablenesse,</hi>
which is the sin against the holy Ghost. Take the word <hi>flesh,</hi> so literally,
as that it be either the <hi>adorning</hi> of my flesh in pride, or the <hi>polluting</hi> of my flesh in
<hi>wantonnes,</hi> whether it be a <hi>pampering</hi> of my flesh with voluptuous provocations, or a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
a shriveling of my flesh with <hi>superstitious</hi> and <hi>meritorious</hi> fastings, or other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerations,
and lacerations by inhumane violence upon my body; Take the word
<hi>Bloud</hi> so literally, as that it be either an admiring and adoring of honourable blood, in
a servile flattering of great persons, or an insinuating of false and <hi>adulterous</hi> blood, in a
<hi>bastardizing</hi> a race, by supposititious children, whether it bee the inflaming the
blood of young persons by lascivious discourse, or <hi>shedding</hi> the blood of another in a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93359:69"/>
murderous quarrell, whether it be in <hi>blaspheming</hi> the blood of my Saviour, in execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
oathes, or the prophaning of his blood in an <hi>unworthy receiving</hi> thereof, all these
ways, and all such, doth this flesh and blood exclude from the Kingdome of God;
It is summarily, all those works which proceed meerly out of the nature of man,
without the regeneration of the Spirit of God; all that is <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, says the Apostle in that place.</p>
                     <p>But in another place,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 19.</note> that Apostle leads us into other considerations; to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
he says, <hi>The works of the flesh are manifest:</hi> And amongst those manifest works
of the flesh, he reckons not onely sins of wantonnesse, and sins of anger, not onely
sins <hi>in concupiscibili,</hi> and <hi>in irascibili,</hi> but <hi>in intelligibili,</hi> sins and errours in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
particularly <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> are <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in that place, <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> are <hi>that flesh and blood which shall not inherit the
Kingdome of God.</hi> Bring wee this consideration home to our selves. The Church of
Rome does not charge us with affirming any <hi>Heresie,</hi> nor does she charge us with any
<hi>Idolatry</hi> in our practise. So far we are discharged from the works of the flesh. If they
charge us with Doctrine of <hi>flesh and blood</hi> because we prefer Mariage before Chastity,
it is a charge ill laid, for Mariage and Chastity consist well together; <hi>The bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
is chastity.</hi> If they charge us that wee prefer Mariage before Continency, they
charge us unjustly, for we do not so: Let them contain that can, and blesse God for
that heavenly gift of Continency, and let them that cannot, mary, and serve God,
and blesse him for affording them that Physick for that infirmity. As Mariage was
ordained at first, for those two uses, <hi>Procreation of children,</hi> and <hi>mutuall assistance of
man, and wife,</hi> so Continency was not preferr'd before Mariage. As there was a third
use of Mariage added after the fall, by way of <hi>Remedy,</hi> so Mariage may well be said
to be inferiour to continency, as physick is in respect of health. If they charge us with
it, because our Priests mary, they doe it frivolously, and impertinently, because they
deny that wee are Priests. We charge them with <hi>Heresie</hi> in the whole <hi>new Creed</hi> of
the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> (for, if all the particular doctrines be not <hi>Hereticall,</hi> yet, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of inducing new Articles of faith is <hi>Hereticall,</hi> and that doctrine runs through
all the Articles, for else they could not be Articles.) And we charge them with <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
in the <hi>peoples practise,</hi> (and that practise is never controld by them) in the greatest
mystery of all their Religion, in the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Sacrament; And <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
are manifest works of the flesh. Our Kingdome is the Gospel; our Inheritance
is our holding that; our exclusion is <hi>flesh and blood, Heresie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us be able to say with the Apostle, <hi>when God had called us,</hi> and <hi>separated us, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
we conferred not with flesh and blood.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> Since God hath brought us into a fair
prospect, let us have no <hi>retrospect</hi> back; In Canaan, let us not look towards Aegypt,
nor towards <hi>Sodom</hi> being got to the Mountain; since God hath setled us in a true
Church, let us have no kind of byas, and declination towards a false; for that is one of
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> manifest works of the flesh, and I shall lose all the benefit of the flesh and
bloud of Christ Jesus, if I doe so, for <hi>flesh and bloud cannot inherite the kingdome
of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have done; Adde we but this, by way of recollecting this which hath been
said now, upon these words, and that which hath been formerly said upon those words
of <hi>Iob,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">19. 26.</note> which may seem to differ from these, <hi>(In my flesh I shall see God) Omne verum

that which <hi>Iob</hi> says, and that which <hi>Saint Paul</hi> says, agree with the truth, they
agree with one another. For, as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> says, <hi>Non omni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> caro eadem caro, there is one

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 39.</note> And
<hi>Iobs</hi> flesh can see God, and <hi>Pauls</hi> cannot; because the flesh that <hi>Iob</hi> speakes of hath
overcome the destruction of skin and body by wormes in the grave, and so is mellowed
and prepared for the sight of God in heaven; And <hi>Pauls</hi> flesh is overcome by the
world. <hi>Iobs</hi> flesh triumphes over <hi>Satan,</hi> and hath made a victorious use of Gods cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
<hi>Pauls</hi> flesh is still subject to tentations, and <hi>carnalities. Iobs</hi> argument is but
this, <hi>some</hi> flesh shall see God, <hi>(Mortified</hi> men here, <hi>Glorified</hi> men there shall) <hi>Pauls</hi>
argument is this, <hi>All</hi> flesh <hi>shall not</hi> see God, <hi>(Carnall</hi> men here, <hi>Impenitent</hi> men there,
shall not.) And therefore, that as our texts answer one another, so your resurrections
may answer one another too, as at the last resurrection, all that heare the sound of the

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now to enter into the handling of the doctrine of Evangelicall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes;
And these words have been ordinarily used by the writers of the
Roman Church, for the defence of a point in controversie between them
and us; which is a preparatory to that which hereafter is to be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled upon another Text. Out of these words, they labour to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
works of supererogation, in which (they say) men doe or suffer more then was
necessary for their owne salvation; and then the superfluity of those accrues to the
Treasury of the Church, and by the Stewardship, and dispensation of the Church may
be applied to other men living here, or suffering in Purgatory by way of satisfaction to
Gods justice; But this is a doctrine which I have had occasion heretofore in this place
to handle; And a doctrine which indeed deserves not the dignity to be too diligently
disputed against; And as we will not stop upon the disproving of the doctrine, so we
need not stay long, nor insist upon the vindicating of these words, from that wresting
and detortion of theirs, in using them for the proofe of that doctrine. Because though
at first,<note place="margin">Greg. de Valent.</note> they presented them with great eagernesse and vehemence, and assurance, <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
haeretici obstrepunt, illustris hic locus,</hi> say the Heretiques what they can, this is a clear
and evident place for that doctrine, yet another after him is a little more cautelous and
reserv'd,<note place="margin">Bellar.</note> 
                        <hi>Negari non potest quin ita expeni possint,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that these
words may admit such an exposition; And then another more modified then both
says,<note place="margin">Cornel a Lapide.</note> 
                        <hi>Primò &amp; propriè non id intendit Apostolus;</hi> the Apostle had no such purpose in his
first and proper intention to prove that doctrine in these words. <hi>Sed innuitur ille sensus;
qui et si non genuinus, tamen à pari deduci potest:</hi> some such sense (says that author) may
be implied and intimated, because, though it be not the true and naturall sense, yet by
way of comparison, and convenience, such a meaning may be deduced. Generally
their difference in having any patronage for that corrupt doctrine out of these words,
appeares best in this, that if we consider their authors who have written in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
we shall see that most of them have laid hold upon these words for this doctrine;
because they are destitute of all Scriptures, and glad of any, that appear to any, any
whit that way inclinable; But if we consider those authors, who by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
and exposition (either before, or since the controversies have been stirred)
have handled these words, we shall find none of their owne authors of that kind, which
by way of exposition of these words doth deliver this to be the meaning of them, that
satisfaction may be made to the justice of God by the works of supererogation one
man for another.</p>
                     <p>To come then to the words themselves in their true sense, and interpretation,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> we shall
find in them two generall considerations. First, that to him that is become a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a true Christian, all old things are done away, and all things are made new: As
he hath a new birth, as he hath put on a new man, as he is going towards a new <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:93359:70"/>
so hath he a new Philosophy, a new production, and generation of effects out of
other causes, then before, he finds light out of darknesse, fire out of water, life out of
death, joy out of afflictions, <hi>Nunc ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, now I rejoyce in my sufferings &amp;c.</hi> And then
in a second consideration he finds that this is not by miracle, that he should hope for
it but once, but he finds an expresse, and certaine, and constant reason why it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be so, because I <hi>still up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ &amp;c.</hi> It is
strange that I should conceive joy out of affliction, but when I come to see the reason
that by that affliction, <hi>I fill up the sufferings of Christ &amp;c.</hi> it is not strange, it cannot
chuse but be so. The parts then will be but two, a proposition, and a reason; But in
the first part it will be sit to consider first, the person, not meerely who it is, but in what
capacity, the Apostle conceives this joy; And secondly, the season, Now, for joy is
not always seasonable, there is a time of mourning, but now rejoycing; And then in a
third place we shall come to the affection it selfe, Joy, which when it is true, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
placed, is the nearest representation of heaven it selfe to this world. From thence
we shall descend to the production of this joy, from whence it is derived, and that is
out of sufferings, for this phrase <hi>in passionibus, in my sufferings,</hi> is not in the middest o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
my sufferings, it is not that I have joy and comfort, though I suffer, but <hi>in passionibus</hi>
is so in suffering as that the very suffering is the subject of my joy, I had no joy, no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of joy, if I did not suffer. But then these sufferings which must occasion this joy,
are thus conditioned, thus qualified in our text; That, first, it be <hi>passio mea, my suffering,</hi>
and not a suffering cast by my occasion upon the whole Church, or upon other men,
<hi>mea,</hi> it is determined and limited in my selfe, and <hi>mea,</hi> but not <hi>prome,</hi> not for my
selfe, not for mine owne transgressions, and violating of the law, but it is for others,
<hi>pro vobis,</hi> says the Apostle, for out of that root springs the whole second part why there
appertaines a joy to such sufferings, which is that the suffering of Christ being yet, not
unperfect, but unperfected, Christ having not yet suffered all, which he is to suffer to
this purpose, for the gathering of his Church, I fill up that which remaines undone;
And that <hi>in Carne,</hi> not onely in spirit and disposition, but really in my flesh, And all
this not only for making sure of mine own salvation, but for the establishing and edifying
a Church, but yet, his Church, for men seduced, and seducers of men have their
Churches too, and suffer for those Churches; but this is for his Church, and that
Church of his which is properly <hi>his body,</hi> and that is the visible Church: and these will
be the particular branches of our two generall parts, the proposition, <hi>Gaudeo in afflictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
&amp;c.</hi> And the reason, <hi>Quiae adimpleo &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

and over all the Church; And then, as a man whose miraculous conversion, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

famous, and reverend over the whole Church of God, all that proceeded from him
had much authority, and power, in all places to which it was directed; As himselfe

becomes him not to depart from his ingenuity, and freedome, to a servile humoring,
but to be negligent of their opinion of him, with whom he is to converse, and upon
whose conscience he is to worke, becomes him not neither. It is his doctrine that must
beare him out; But if his discretion doe not make him acceptable too, his doctrine
will have the weaker root when; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Colossians</hi> thought well of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
the work of God was likely to goe forward amongst them; And where it is
not so, the work prospers not.</p>

                        <hi>Paul,</hi> as he had a calling, and an authority by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship,
and <hi>Paul</hi> as he had made his calling, and authority, and Apostleship acceptable
to them, by his wisedome and descreet behaviour towards them, and the whole
Church. The season followes next, when he presents this doctrine to them <hi>Nunc
Gaudeo,</hi> now I rejoyce, and there is a <hi>Nunc illi,</hi> and a <hi>Nunc illis</hi> to be considered, one
time it hath relation to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, and another that hath relation to the

for from thence he writ this Epistle; Ordinarily a prisoner is the lesse to be beleeved
for his being in prison and in fetters, if he speak such things as conduce to his discharge
of those fetters, or his deliverance from that imprisonment, it is likely enough that a
prisoner will lye for such an advantage; But when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being now a prisoner for
the preaching of the Gospell, speaks still for the advancement of the Gospell, that he
suffers for, and finds out another way of preaching it by letters and by epistles, when
he opens himselfe to more danger, to open to them more doctrine, then that was
very credible which he spake, though in prison; There is in all his epistles <hi>impetus Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
Christi,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> says, a vehemence of the holy Ghost, but yet <hi>amplius habent

more of this vehemency in them: a sentence written with a cole upon a wall by a close

the losse of that liberty which he had, come therefore the more welcome, if they
come; It is not always a bold and veliement reprehension of great persons, that is
argument enough of a good and a rectified zeale, for an intemperate use of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Gospell, and sometimes the impotency of a satyricall humor, makes men
preach freely, and over-freely, offensively, scandalously; and so exasperate the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
God forbid that a man should build a reputation of zeale, for having been
called in question for preaching of a Sermon; And then to think it wisdome, <hi>redimere
se quo queat minimo,</hi> to sinke againe and get off as good cheape as he can; But when
the malignity of others hath slandred his doctrine, or their galled consciences make
them kicke at his doctrine, then to proceed with a Christian magnanimity, and a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Nobility in the maintenance of that doctrine, to preferre then before the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the their persons and the greatnesse of his owne danger, the greatnesse of the
glory of God, and the greatnesse of the losse which Gods Church should suffer by his
lenity and prevarication: To edifie others by his constancy, then when this building in
apparence and likelyhood must be raised upon his owne ruine, then was Saint <hi>Pauls
Nunc,</hi> concerning himselfe, then was his season to plant and convey this doctrine to
these <hi>Colossians,</hi> when it was most dangerous for him to doe so.</p>
                     <p>Now to consider this season and fitnesse as it concerned them; The <hi>Nunc illis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Illis.</note> It
was then, when <hi>Epaphras</hi> had declrared unto him their love, and when upon so good
testimony of their disposition, he had a desire that they might be fulfilled with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods will in all wisdome and spirituall understanding, as he says <hi>verse</hi> 9. when
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93359:71"/>
he knew how farre they had proceeded in mysteries of the Christian Religion, and
that they had a spirituall hunger of more, then it was seasonable to present to them this
great point, that Christ had suffered throughly, sufficiently, aboundantly, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
of the whole world, and yet that there remained some sufferings, (and those
of Christ too) to be fulfilled, by us; That all was done; and yet there remained more
to be done, that after Christs <hi>consummatum est,</hi> which was all the text, there should be

walk with the Lamb wheresoever he goes in heaven, that ranne away from the Lamb
whensoever he came towards him, in this life; so he shall never possesse the joyes of
heaven hereafter, that feels no joy here; There must be joy here, which <hi>Tanquam
Cellulae mellis</hi> (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> says in his mellifluous language) as the honey-comb
walles in,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> and prepares, and preserves the honey, and is as a shell to that kernell; so
there must bee a joy here, which must prepare and preserve the joys of heaven it self,
and be as a shell of those joys. For heaven and salvation is not a Creation, but a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication;
it begins not when wee dye, but it increases and dilates it self infinitely
then; Christ himself, when he was pleased to feed all that people in the wildernesse,
he asks first, <hi>Quot panes habetis, how many loafes have you?</hi> and then multiplyed them
abundantly, as conduced most to his glory; but some there was before. <hi>When thou
goest to eat that bread, of which whosoever eates shall never dye,</hi> the bread of life
in the Land of life, Christ shall consider what joy thou broughtest with thee
out of this world, and he shall extend and multiply that joy unexpressibly; but
if thou carry none from hence, thou shalt find none there. Hee that were to travell
into a far country, would study before, somewhat the map, and the manners, and
the language of the Country; Hee that looks for the fulnesse of the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hereafter, will have a taste, an insight in them before he goe: And as it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for him that would travail, to study any language indifferently (were it not an
impertinent thing for him that went to lye in France, to study Dutch?) So if wee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

the world; The Kingdome of <hi>heaven is righteousnesse, and peace, and joy in the Holy

grieved for this; hath he raised his Son to life again? <hi>Infirmatur ipse, doluit, abstulit

for that sinne? <hi>peccata delevit</hi> he hath wash't away that sinne, from his soule; for
sorrow is good for nothing else, intended for nothing else, but onely for our sinnes, out
of which sadnesse first arose: And then, considered so, this sadnesse is not truly, nor
properly sadnesse, because it is not so intirely; There is health in the bitternesse of

may call it sorrow or no, but our joy is perfect joy, because it is rooted in an assurance:
<hi>Est in spe certa,</hi> our hope of deliverance is in him that never deceived any; for says he
then, our sadnesse passes away as a dreame, <hi>Et qui insomnium judicat, addit quasi, quasi

phrase, me thought I spoke, me thought I went, and me thought I thought, so all the
sorrow of Gods children is but a <hi>quasi tristes,</hi> because it determines in joy, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines

between delight and joy (for delight is in sensuall things, and in beasts, as well as in
men, but joy is grounded in reason, and in reason rectified, which is, conscience (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are called to rejoyce againe; to try whether our joy be true joy, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a delight, and when it is found to be a true joy, we say still rejoyce, that is, continue
your spirituall joy till it meet the eternall joy in the kingdome of heaven, and grow up
into one joy, but because sadnesse and sorrow have but one use, and a determined and
limited imployment, onely for sin, we doe not say, be sorry, and again be sorry, but when
you have been truly sorry for your sinnes, when you have taken that spirituall phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique,
beleeve your selfe to be well, accept the seale of the holy Ghost, for the remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your sins, in Christ Jesus, and come to that health which that physique promises,
peace of conscience.</p>
                     <p>This joy then which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> found to be so essentiall,<note place="margin">In passioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> so necessary for man, he
found that God placed within mans reach; so neare him as that God afforded man
this joy where he least looked for it, even in affliction; And of this joy in affliction, we
may observe three steps, three degrees; one is indeed but halfe a joy; and that the
Philosophers had; A second is a true joy, and that all Christians have; but the third
is an overflowing, and aboundant joy, to which the Apostle was come,
and to which by his example, hee would rouse others, that joy, of
which himselfe speaks againe;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 17. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>I am filled with comfort and am exceeding joyfull, in
all our tribulations;</hi> The first of these, which we call a halfe joy, is but an indolency,
and a forced unsensiblenesse of those miseries which were upon them; a searing up, a
stupefaction, is not of the senses, yet of the affections; That resolution which some
morall men had against misery, <hi>Non facies ut te dicam malam,</hi> no misery should draw
them to doe misery that honour, as to call it misery; And, in respect of that extreme
anguish which out of an over tendernesse, ordinary men did suffer under the calamities
of this life, even this poore indolency and privation of griefe, was a joy, but yet but a
halfe joy; the second joy, which is a true joy, but common to all Christians, is that
assurance, which they have in their tribulations, that God will give them the issue with
the temptation; not that they pretend not to feel that calamity, so the Philosophers
did, but that it shall not swallow them, this is naturall to a Christian, he is not a
Christian without this; Thinke it not strange, says the Apostle, as though some strange
thing were come unto you, (for we must accustome our selves to the expectation of
tribulation) but rejoyce, says he, and when his glory shall appeare, yee shall be made
glad and rejoyce; He bids us rejoyce, and yet all that he promises, is but rejoycing at
last, he bids us rejoyce, all the way; though the consummate, aud determinable joy come
not till the end, yet God hath set bounds to our tribulations, as to the sea, and they
shall not overflow us; But this perfect joy (to speake of such degrees of perfection,
as may be had in this life) this third joy, the joy of this text, is not a collaterall joy,
that stands by us in the tribulation, and sustaines us, but it is a fundamentall joy, a
radicall joy, a viscerall, a gremiall joy, that arises out of the bosome and wombe and
bowels of the tribulation it selfe. It is not that I rejoyce, though I be afflicted, but I
rejoyce because I am afflicted; It is not because I shall not sink in my calamity, and
be buried in that valley, but because my calamity raises me, and makes my valley a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93359:73"/>
hill, and gives me an eminency, and brings God and me nearer to one another, then
without that calamity I should have been,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> when I can depart rejoycing, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because I am worthy to suffer rebuke for the name of Christ, as the Apostles did,
when I can feel that pattern proposed to my joy,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 12.</note> and to my tribulation, which Christ
gives, <hi>Rejoyce and be glad,</hi> for so persecuted they the Prophets, when I can find that seale
printed upon me,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 14.</note> by my tribulation, If ye be railed on for the name of Christ, blessed
are ye, for the spirit of God and of glory resteth on you, that is, that affliction fixes the
holy Ghost upon me, which in prosperity, falls upon me but as Sun-beames; Briefly
if my soule have had that conference, that discourse with God, that he hath declared to
me his purpose in all my calamities, (as he told <hi>Ananias</hi> that he had done to <hi>Paul,</hi> he is
a chosen vessell unto me,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>for I will shew him how many things he must suffer for my sake)</hi>
If the light of Gods Spirit shew us the number, the force, the intent of our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then is our soule come to that highest joy, which she is capable of in this life, when
as cold and dead water, when it comes to the fire, hath a motion and dilatation and a
bubling and a kind of dancing in the vessell, so my soule, that lay asleep in prosperity,
hath by this fire of Tribulation, a motion, a joy, an exaltation.</p>
                     <p>This is the highest degree of suffering;<note place="margin">In passioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus meis.</note> but this suffering hath this condition here,
that it be <hi>passio mea;</hi> And this too, that it be <hi>mea,</hi> and not <hi>pro me,</hi> but <hi>pro aliis:</hi> that
it be mine, and no bodies else, by my occasion; That it be mine without any fault of
mine, that I be no cause that it fell upon me, and that I be no occasion, that it fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others. And first, it is not mine, if I borrow it; I can have no joy in the sufferings
of Martyrs and other Saints of God, by way of applying their sufferings to me, by
way of imitation and example I may, by way of application and satisfaction I cannot,
borrowed sufferings are not my sufferings: They are not mine neither, if I steale them,
if I force them; If my intemperate, and scandalous zeal, or pretence of zeal, extort a
chastisement from the State, if I exasperate the Magistrate and draw an affliction upon
my self, this stoln suffering, this forced suffering is not <hi>passio mea,</hi> it is not mine, if it
should not be mine;<note place="margin">August.</note> 
                        <hi>Natura cujusque rei est, quam Deus indidit,</hi> That onely is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of every thing which God hath imprinted in it: That affliction onely is mine,
which God hath appointed for me, and what he hath appointed we may see by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions:
Let none of you suffer as a murtherer,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 15.</note> or as a thief, or as an evill doer, or as
a busie-body in other mens matters, (and that reaches far:) I am not <hi>possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I come not to this suffering by a good title, I cannot call it mine; I may finde joy in it,
that is, in the middest of it, I may finde comfort in the mercy of Christ, though I
suffer as a malefactor; But there is no joy in the suffering it self, for it is not mine, it
is not I, but my sinne, my breach of the law, my disobedience that suffers. It is not
mine again, if it be not mine in particular, mine, and limited in me. To those suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
that fall upon me for my conscience, or for the discharge of my duty, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
a joy, but when the whole Church is in persecution, and by my occasion espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<hi>or at all,</hi> woe unto them, by whom the first offence comes; this is no joyfull
matter, and therefore <hi>vae illis per quos scandalum,</hi> they who by their ambition of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or indulgence to their present case, or indifferency how things fall out, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
confidence in Gods care, for looking well enough to his own, how little
soever they doe, give way to the beginnings of superstition, in the times of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
when persecutions come, either they shall have no sufferings, that is, God shall
suffer them to fall away, and refuse their testimony in his cause, or they shall have no
joy in their sufferings, because they shall see this persecution is not theirs, it is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
in them, but induced by their prevarication upon the whole Church; And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this suffering is not mine, if I stretch it too far; if I over-value it, it is not mine; A
man forfeits his priviledge, by exceeding it; There is no joy belongs to my suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
if I place a merit in it; <hi>Meum non est cujus nomine nulla mihi superest acti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> can I
bring against God, for a reward of my merit? Have I given him any thing of mine?
<hi>Quid habeo quod non accepi?</hi> what have I that I received not from him? Have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him all his own? how came I to abound then, and see him starve in the streets in
his distressed members? Hath he changed his blessings unto me in single mony? Hath
he made me rich by half pence and farthings; and yet have I done so much as that for
him? Have I suffered for his glory? Am not I <hi>vas figuli,</hi> a potters vessell, and that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93359:73"/>
Potters vessel; and whose hand soever he imploys, the hand of sicknesse, the hand
of poverty, the hand of justice, the hand of malice, still it is his hand that breakes the
vessell, and this vessell which is his own; for, can any such vessell have a propriety in
it selfe, or bee any other bodies primarily then his, from whom it hath the beeing?
To recollect these, if I will have joy in suffering it must be mine, mine, and not borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of an imaginary treasure of the Church; from the works of others Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
mine, and not stollen or enforced by exasperating the Magistrate to a persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
mine by good title and not by suffering for breach of the Law, mine in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and not a generall persecution upon the Church by my occasion; And mine by
a stranger title then all this, mine by resignation, mine by disavowing it, mine by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
that it is none of mine; Till I acknowledge, that all my sufferings are even
for Gods glory, are his works, and none of mine, they are none of mine, and by that
humility they become mine, and then I may rejoyce in my sufferings.</p>
                     <p>Through all our sufferings then, there must passe an acknowledgement that we are
unprofitable servants;<note place="margin">Pro vobis.</note> towards God utterly unprofitable; So unprofitable to our
selves, as that we can merit nothing by our sufferings; but still we may and must have
a purpose to profit others by our constancy; it is <hi>Pro vobis,</hi> that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> says hee
suffers for them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 15.</note> for their souls; <hi>I will most gladly bestow, and be bestowed for your soules,</hi>
(says he.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note>) But <hi>Numquid Paulus crucifixus pro vobis,</hi> was <hi>Paul</hi> crucified for you? is his
own question, as he suffered for them here, so we may be bold to say he was crucified
for them; that is, that by his crucifying and suffering, the benefit of Christs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and crucifying might be the more cheerfully embraced by them, and the more
effectually applyed to them; <hi>Pro vobis,</hi> is <hi>Pro vestro commodo,</hi> for your advantage, and
to make you the more active in making sure your own salvation;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>We are afflicted</hi> (says
he) <hi>for your consolation;</hi> that's first, that you might take comfort, and spirituall cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
by our example, that God will no more forsake you, then he hath done us, and
then, hee addes <hi>salvation</hi> too; for your consolation and salvation; for our sufferings
beget this consolation; and then, this consolation facilitates your salvation; and then,
when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had that testimony in his own conscience, that his purpose in his
sufferings, was <hi>Pro illis,</hi> to advantage Gods children, and then saw in his experience so
good effect of it, as that it wrought, and begot faith in them, then the more his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
encreast, the more his joys encreast; Though (says he) I be offered up, upon the
service, and sacrifice of your faith, I am glad and rejoyce with you all; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee calls the Philippians, who were converted by him, <hi>Gaudium, &amp; Coronam,</hi>
his Joy and his Crown; not onely a Crown, in that sense, as an auditory, a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that compasses the Preacher, was ordinarily called a Crown, <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to have received Letters from Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> against the State, <hi>Ego de
Corona Domini,</hi> (says he, from Gods Church, 'tis true, I have, but <hi>Contra Rempublicam,</hi>
against the State, I have received no Letters.) But not onely in this sense, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
calls those whom he had converted, his Crown, his Crown, that is, his Church; but
he cals them his Crown in heaven, <hi>What is our hope, our joy, our Crown of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
are not even you it?</hi> and where? <hi>even in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ

the labour, and diligence of your Pastors, (for that's all the suffering they are called to,
till our sins together call in a persecution) call you their painfulnesse your Crown, and
we shall call your applyablenesse to the Gospel, which we preach, our Crown, for both
conduce to both; but especially childrens children, are the Crown of the Elders, says
<hi>Solomon:</hi> If when we have begot you in Christ, by our preaching, you also beget o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

                        <note place="margin">Numb. 12. 3.</note> The man <hi>Moses</hi> was so; but the <hi>Child Iesus</hi> was meeker then
he. Compare <hi>Moses</hi> with men, and <hi>Moses</hi> will scarce be parallel'd;
Compare him with him, who being so much more then man, as that he
was God too, was made so much lesse then man, as that he was a worme
and no man, and <hi>Moses</hi> will not be admitted. If you consider <hi>Moses</hi> his highest expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
what he would have parted with for his brethren, in his <hi>Dele me, Pardon them,
or blot my name out of thy book,</hi> yet Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> zeale will enter into the balance, and come
into comparison with <hi>Moses</hi> in his <hi>Anathema pro fratribus,</hi> in that he wished himselfe to
be separated from Christ, rather then his brethren should be. But what comparison
hath a sodaine, a passionate, and indigested vehemence of love, expressed in a phrase
that tasts of <hi>zeale,</hi> but is not done, <hi>(Moses</hi> was not blotted out of the book of life, nor
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was not separated from Christ for his brethren) what comparison hath such
a love, that was but <hi>said,</hi> and perchance <hi>should</hi> not have been said (for, we can scarce
excuse <hi>Moses,</hi> or Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> of all excesse and inordinatenesse, in that that they said)
with a deliberate and an eternall purpose in Christ Jesus conceived as soon as we can
conceive God to have knowen that <hi>Adam</hi> would fall, to come into this world, &amp; dye for
man, and then actually and really, in the fulnesse of time, to do so; he did come, and he did
dye. The man <hi>Moses</hi> was very meeke, the child Jesus meeker then hee. <hi>Moses</hi> his
meeknesse had a determination, (at least an interruption, a discontinuance) when
hee revenged the wrong of another upon that <hi>Egyptian</hi> whom he slew.<note place="margin">Exod. 2. 11. Esay 42. 3.</note> But a <hi>brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
reed might have stood unbroken, and <hi>smoking flax</hi> might have lien unquenched
for ever,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 1.</note> for all Christ. And therefore though Christ send his Disciples to School,
to the Scribes and Pharisees, because they sate in <hi>Moses</hi> seat, for other lessons,
yet for this,<note place="margin">11. 29.</note> hee was their School-master himselfe, <hi>Discite à me, learne of mee,
for I am meek.</hi> In this Chapter hee gives them three lessons in this doctrine of
meeknesse; Hee gives them foundations, and upperbuildings, The <hi>Text,</hi> and a
<hi>Comment,</hi> all the Elements of true instruction, <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Example.</hi> First, hee findes
them contending for <hi>place,<note place="margin">ver. 1.</note> Quis maximus,</hi> who should be greatest in the kingdome
of heaven. The disease which they were sick of, was truly an ignorance what this
kingdome was; For, though they were never ignorant that there should bee
an eternall kingdome in heaven, yet they thought not that the kingdome of Christ
here should onely be a spirituall kingdome, but they looked for a temporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choation
of that kingdome here. That was their disease, and a dangerous one. But
as Physitians are forced to doe sometimes, to turne upon the present cure of some
vehement symptome, and accdient, and leave the consideration of the maine
disease for a time, so Christ leaves the doctrine of the kingdome for the present,
and does not rectifie them in that <hi>yet,</hi> but for this pestilent symptome, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
accident of precedency, and ambition of place, he corrects that first, and
to that purpose gives them the example <hi>of a little child,</hi> and tells them, that except
they become as humble, as gentle, as supple, as simple, as seely, as tractable,
as ductile, as carelesse of place, as negligent of precedency, as that little child,
they could not onely not be great, but they could not at all enter into the kingdome of
heaven. He gives them a second lesson in this doctrine of meeknesse against scandals,
and offences, against an easinesse in <hi>giving</hi> or an easinesse in <hi>taking</hi> offences. For,
how well soever we may seeme to be in our selves, we are not well, if we forbear
not that company, and abstaine not from that conversation, which by ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may make us worse, or if wee forbear not such things, as, though they bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93359:74"/>
in themselves, and can do us no harme, yet our example may make weaker
persons then we are, worse, because they may come to doe as we do, and not proceed
upon so good ground as we doe; They may sin in doing those things by our example,
in which we did not sinne, because we knew them to be indifferent things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did them, and they did them though they thought them to bee sinnes. And
for this Doctrine,<note place="margin">vers. 8.</note> Christ takes an example very near to them, <hi>If thy hand, or foot,
or eye offend thee, cut it off, pull it out.</hi> His third lesson in this doctrine of meeknes is against
hardnesse of heart, against a loathnesse, a wearinesse in forgiving the offences of other
men,<note place="margin">vers. 21.</note> against us, occasioned by <hi>Peters</hi> question, <hi>Quoties remittam, How oft shall my
brother sinne against me, and I forgive him?</hi> and the example in this rule Christ hath
wrapped up in a parable,<note place="margin">vers. 28.</note> The Master forgave his servant ten thousand Talents, (more
money then perchance any private man is worth) and that servant took his fellow by
the throat, and cast him into prison, because he did not presently pay an hundred
pence, perchance fifty shillings, not three pound of our money: in such a proportion was
Christ pleased to expresse the Masters inexhaustible largenesse and bounty, (which
is himselfe,) and the servants inexcusable cruelty, and penuriousnesse, (which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of us.) The root of all Christian duties is <hi>Humility,</hi> meeknesse, that's vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in an ambitious precedency, for that implyes an over-estimation of our selves,
and an undervalue of others; And it is violated in <hi>scandals,</hi> and <hi>offences,</hi> for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
an unsetlednesse and irresolution in our selves, that we can bee so easily shaked,
or a neglecting of weaker persons, of whom Christ neglected none; and it is violated
in an <hi>unmercifulnesse,</hi> and <hi>inex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>rablenesse,</hi> for that implies an <hi>indocilenesse,</hi> that we will
not learn by Christs doctrine; &amp; an <hi>ungratefulnesse,</hi> that we will not apply his example,
and do to his servants, as he, our Master, hath done to us: And so have you some Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
of the whole Chapter, as it consists of Rules and Examples in this Doctrine of
meeknes, endangered by pride, by scandall, by uncharitablenes. But of those two, pride &amp;
uncharitabenes (though they deserve to be often spoken of,) I shal have no occasion from
these words of my text, to speak, for into the second of these three parts, <hi>The Doctrine
of scandals,</hi> our text fals, and it is a Doctrine very necessary, and seldome touched upon.</p>
                     <p>As the words of our Text are,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> our parts must be three. First, that heavy word <hi>Vae,</hi>
woe; Secondly, that generall word, <hi>Mundo, Woe be unto the world;</hi> And lastly, that
mischievous word, <hi>A scandalis, Woe bee unto the, world because of scandals,</hi> of <hi>offences.</hi>
each of these three words wil receive a twofold consideration; for the first, <hi>Vae,</hi> is first <hi>Vox
dolentis,</hi> a voice of condoling and lamenting, Christ laments the miseries imminent
upon the world, <hi>because of scandals,</hi> and then it is <hi>Vox minantis,</hi> a voice of threatning,
and intermination, Christ threatens, he interminates heavy judgements upon them,
who occasion and induce these miseries by these scandals; This one <hi>Vae</hi> denotes both
these; sorrow, and yet infallibility; They always go together in God; God is loath
to doe it, and yet God will certainly inflict these judgements. The second word,
<hi>Mundo, Woe be unto the world,</hi> lookes two ways too; <hi>Vae malis,</hi> woe unto evill men
that raise scandals, <hi>vae bonis,</hi> woe unto them who are otherwise good in themselves,
if they be so various, as to be easily shaked and seduced by scandals. And then upon
the last word <hi>A scandalis, Woe be unto the world, because of scandals,</hi> of <hi>offences,</hi> wee
must look two ways also; first, as it denotes <hi>Scandalum activum,</hi> a scandall given by
another, and then, as it denotes <hi>Scandalum passivum,</hi> a scandal taken by another.</p>
                     <p>First then,<note place="margin">1. Part.</note> our first word, in the firrst acceptation thereof, is <hi>Vae dolentis,</hi> the voice of
condoling and lamentation; God laments the necessity that he is reduced to, and
those judgements which the sinnes of men have made inevitable. In the person of the
Prophets which denounced the judgements of God, it is expressed so, <hi>Onus Babyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,
Onus Egypti, Onus Damasci?</hi> O the burthen of Damascus, the burthen of Egypt,
the burthen of Babylon; And not only so, but <hi>Onus visionis,</hi> Not onely that that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be a heavy burthen, when it fell upon that Nation, but that the very
pre-contemplation, and pre-denunciation of that judgement upon that people, was a
burthen and a distastfull bitternesse, to the Prophet himself, that was sent upon that
message. In reading of an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> or of any Law that inflicts the heaviest pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
that can be imagined upon a delinquent, and transgressour of that Law, a man
is not often much affected, because hee needs not, when he does but read that
law, consider that any particular man is fallen under the penalty, and bitternesse thereof.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93359:75"/>
But if upon evidence and verdict he be put to give judgement upon a particular man
that stands before him, at the bar, according to that Law, That that man that
stands there that day, must that day be no man; that that breath breathed in by God,
to glorify him, must be suffocated and strangled with a halter, or evaporated with an
Axe, he must be hanged or beheaded, that those limbs which make up a Cabinet for
that precious Jewell, the image of God, to be kept in, must be cut into quarters, or
torne with horses; that that body which is a consecrated Temple of the Holy Ghost,
must be chained to a stake, and burnt to ashes, hee that is not affected in giving such a
judgment, upon such a man, hath no part in the bowels of Christ Jesus, that melt in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
when our sinnes draw and extort his Judgements upon us in the mouth of
those Prophets, those men whom God sends, it is so, and it is so in the mouth of
God himself that sends them.<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Heu vindicabor,</hi> (says God) <hi>Alas,</hi> I <hi>will revenge mee of
mine enemies; Alas, I will,</hi> is <hi>Alas, I must,</hi> his glory compels him to doe it, the good
of his Church, and the <unclear>sustentation</unclear> of his Saints compell him to it, and yet he comes
to it with a condolency, with a compassion, <hi>Heu vindicabor, Alas, I will revenge mee
of mine enemies:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezech. 6. 11.</note> so also in another Prophet, <hi>Heu abominationes, <hi>Alas for all the evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
of the house of Israel;</hi>
                        </hi> for (as it is added there) <hi>they shall fall,</hi> (that is, <hi>they
will fall)</hi> by the <hi>sword,</hi> by <hi>famine,</hi> by <hi>pestilence,</hi> and (as it follows) <hi>I will accomplish my
fury upon them;</hi> Though it were come to that height, fury, and accomplishment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of fury, yet it comes with a condolency, and compassion, <hi>Heu abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, Alas for all the evill abominations of the house of Israel,</hi> I would they were not so
ill, that I might be better to them. Men sent by God do so, so does God that sends
those men, &amp; he that is both God and man, Christ Jesus does so too: We have but two
clear records in the Scriptures of Christs weeping, and both in compassion for others,
when <hi>Mary</hi> wept for her dead brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 33.</note> and the Jews that were with her wept
too, <hi>Iesus also wept, and he groan'd in the spirit, and was troubled.</hi> This was but for the
discomfort of one family, (it was not a mortality over the whole Country) It was
but for one person in that family, (it was not a contagion that had swept, or did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the whole house) it was but for such a person in that family, as he meant forthwith to
restore to life again, and yet <hi>Iesus wept,</hi> &amp; <hi>groaned in the Spirits, &amp; was</hi> trobled; he would
not lose that opportunity of shewing his tendernesse, and compassion in the behalf of
others. How vehement, how passionate then, must we beleeve his other weeping to have
been,<note place="margin">Luke. 19. 41.</note> when hee had his glorious and beloved City Jerusalem in his sight, and wept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that City, and with that stream of tears powred out that Sea, that tempestuous
Sea, those heavy judgements, which, (though he wept in doing it) he denounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that City, that glorious, that beloved City, which City (though Christ charge, to
have stoned them that were sent to her,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 34.</note> and to bee guilty of all the righteous blood
shed upon the earth) the holy Ghost cals the holy City for all that,<note place="margin">4. 5.</note> not onely at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Christs appearance, <hi>(The Devill took him up into the holy City)</hi> (for at that
time she was not the unholyer for any thing that shee had done upon the person of
Christ,) but when they had exercised all their cruelty, even to death, the death of the
Crosse upon Christ himselfe,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 33.</note> the Holy Ghost calls still the holy City; Many bodies
of Saints, which slept, arose, and went into the <hi>holy City.</hi> When the Fathers take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their contemplation and discourse, that passionate exclamation of our Saviour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Crosse, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> those blessed Fathers, that
never thought of any such sense of that place, that Christ was, at that time, actually in
the <hi>reall torments of hell,</hi> assign no fitter sense of those words, then that the foresight of
those insupportable, and inevitable, and imminent judgements upon his City, and his
people, occasioned that passionate exclamation, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 9. 4.</note> That as, after he was ascended into heaven, he said to <hi>Saul, Cur me perseque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris?</hi>
He called <hi>Sauls</hi> persecuting of his Church, a persecuting of him, so when hee
considered that God had forsaken his people, his Citie, his Jerusalem, he cryed out,
that God had forsaken him. God that sent the Prophets; the Prophets that were sent;
Christ who was both, the person sent, and the sender, came to the inflicting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of judgements, with this <hi>Vae dolentis,</hi> a heart, and voice of condoling and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grieve not then the holy Spirit of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> says the Apostle; extort not from him those
Judgements, which he cannot in justice forbear, and yet is grieved to inflict. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93359:75"/>
doe we use that motive, to divert young men from some ill actions, and ill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
How will this trouble your friends, how will this grieve your Mother, this will kill
your Father? The Angels of heaven who are of a friendship and family with us, as
they rejoyce at our conversion, so are they sorry and troubled at our aversion from
God. Our sins have grieved our Mother; that is, made the Church ashamed, and
blush that he hath washed us, and clothed us, in the whitenesse and innocency of Christ
Jesus in our baptisme, and given us his bloud to drinke in the other Sacrament. Our
sins have made our mother the Church ashamed in her selfe, (we have scandalized and
offended the Congregation) and our sinnes have defamed and dishonoured our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abroad, that is, imprinted an opinion in others, that that cannot be a good
Church, in which we live so dissolutely, so falsely to our first faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and stipulation with God in Baptisme. Wee have grieved our brethren,
the Angels,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 10.</note> our mother, the Church, and we have killed our <hi>Father: God is the father of
us all;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> and we have killed him; for <hi>God hath purchased a Church with his bloud,</hi> says
Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> And, oh, how much more is God grieved now, that we will make no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of that bloud which is shed for us, then he was for the very shedding of that
bloud! We take it not so ill, (pardon solow a comparison in so high a mystery; for,
since our blessed Saviour was pleased to assume that metaphor,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 22.</note> and to call his passion a
<hi>Cup,</hi> and his death a <hi>drinking,</hi> we may be admitted to that Comparison of drinking too)
we take it not so ill, that a man go down into our Cellar, and draw, and drinke his fill,
as that he goe in, and pierce the vessells, and let them runne out, in a wastfull wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste.
To satisfie the thirst of our soules, there was a necessity that the bloud of Christ
Jesus, should be shed; To satisfie Christs own <hi>sitto,</hi> that thirst which was upon him,
when he was upon the Crosse, there was a necessity too, that Christ should bleed to
death. On our part there was an absolute and a primary necessity; God in his justice
requiring a satisfaction, nothing could redeem us, by way of satisfaction, but the bloud
of his Sonne. And though there were never act more voluntary, more spontaneous,
then Christs dying for man, nor freer from all coaction, and necessity of that kind, yet
after Christ had submitted himselfe to that <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>contract</hi> that passed between
him,<note place="margin">Luke 24. 26.</note> and his Father, that he, by shedding his bloud, should redeem Mankind, there lay
a necessity upon Christ himselfe to shed his bloud, as himselfe says first to his Disciples
that went with him to <hi>Emans, Nonne op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rtuit,</hi> ought not Christ to suffer all these things?
do ye not find by the prophets that he was bound to do it? and then to his Apostles at
<hi>Ierusalem,<note place="margin">verse 36.</note> Sic opertuit, Thus it behoved Christ to suffer.</hi> There was then an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon us, an obedientiall necessity upon Christ, that his bloud must be shed; But
to let him dye in a wantonnesse, to let out all that precious liquor, and taste no drop of
it, to draw out all that immaculate and unvaluable bloud, and make no <hi>balsamum,</hi> no
antidote, no plaister, no fomentation in the application of that bloud, to labour still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a burning fever of lust, and ambition, and presumption, and finde no cooling <hi>julips</hi>
there, in the application of that bloud, to labour under a cold damp of indevotion, and
under heartlesse desperation, and find no warming <hi>Cordialls</hi> there, to be still as farre
under judgements and executions for finne, as if there had been no <hi>Messias</hi> sent, no
ransome given, no satisfiaction made, not to apply this bloud thus shed for us, by those
meanes which God in his Church presents to us, this puts Christ to his wofull Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
to cast out this <hi>wo</hi> upon us, (which he had rather have left out) <hi>wo be unto the
world,</hi> which, though it begin in a <hi>vae dolentis,</hi> a voice of condoling and lamenting,
yet it is also <hi>vae minantis,</hi> a voice of threatning, and intermination, denoting the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of Judgements,<note place="margin">Vae minantis.</note> and that's our next consideration.</p>
                     <p>I thinke we find no words in Christs mouth so often, as <hi>vae,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> Each of them
hath two significations; as almost all Christs words, and actions have; consolation,
and commination. For, as this <hi>vae</hi> signifies (as before) a sorrow, (wo, that is, <hi>wo is me,</hi>
for this <hi>will</hi> fall upon you) and signifies also a Judgment inevitable and infallible, (wo,
that is, <hi>wo be unto you,</hi> for this Judgement <hi>shall</hi> fall upon you) so <hi>Amen</hi> is sometimes
<hi>vox Asserentis,</hi> and signifies <hi>verè,</hi> verily, <hi>Verily I say unto you,</hi> when Christ would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
and establish a beleefe in some doctrine,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 12.</note> or promise of his, (as when he says <hi>Amen,
Amen, verily verily I say unto you, he that beleeveth on me, the works that I doe, shall he
doe also, and greater works then these shall he doe)</hi> so it is <hi>vox Asserentis,</hi> a word of
assertion,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 26.</note> and it is also <hi>vox Deserentis,</hi> a word of desertion, when God denounces an
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93359:76"/>
infallibility,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 26.</note> an unavoydablenesse, an inevitablenesse in his judgements, <hi>Amen dico, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
I say unto thee, thou shalt by no meanes come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost
farthing;</hi> so this <hi>Amen</hi> signifies <hi>Fiat,</hi> this shall certainly be thus done. And this
seale, this Amen, as Amen is <hi>Fiat,</hi> is always set to his <hi>vae,</hi> as his <hi>vae</hi> is <hi>vox minantis;</hi>
whensoever God threatens any Judgement, he meanes to execute that Judgement as
farre as he threatens it; God threatens nothing <hi>in terrorem</hi> onely, onely to frighten
us; every <hi>vae</hi> hath his <hi>Amen,</hi> every Judgement denounced, a purpose of execution.
This then is our wofull case; every man may find upon record, in the Scriptures, a <hi>vae</hi>
denounced upon that sinne, which he knows to be his sinne; and if there be a <hi>vae,</hi>
there is an <hi>Amen</hi> too, if God have said it shall, it shall be executed, so that this is
not an execution of a few condemned persons, but a Massacre of all: It is not a <hi>Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as in a rebellion, to spare nine, and hang the tenth, but it is a washing, a sweeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of all: every man may find a Judgement upon record against him. It doth not
acquit him that he hath not committed an <hi>adultery;</hi> and yet, is he sure of that? He
may have done that in a <hi>looke,</hi> in a <hi>letter,</hi> in a <hi>word,</hi> in a <hi>wish:</hi> It doth not acquit him,
that he hath not done a <hi>murder;</hi> and yet, is he sure of that? He may have killed a man,
in not defending him from the oppression of another, if he have power in his hand, and
he may have killed in not relieving, if he have a plentifull fortune. He may have killed in
not reprehending him who was under his charge, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saw him kil himself in the sinful
ways of death.<note place="margin">Ardoinus.</note> As they that write of Poysons, and of those creatures that naturally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne
and would destroy man, do name the <hi>Flea,</hi> as well as the <hi>Viper,</hi> because the Flea
sucks as much bloud as he can, so that man is a murderer that stabs as deep as he can,
though it be but with his tongue, with his pen, with his frowne; for a man may kill with
a frowne, in withdrawing his countenance from that man, that lives upon so low a
pasture as his countenance, nay he may kill with a smile, with a good looke, if he afford
that good looke with a purpose to delude him. And, beloved, how many dye of this
disease; how many dye laughing, dye of a tickling; how many are overjoyed with
the good looks, and with the familiarity of greater persons then themselves, and led
on by hopes of getting more, wast that they have? An adultery, a murder may be done

we sinne some sinnes, that all the world sees, and yet we see not, but then, how many
more, which none in the world sees but our selves? Scarce any man scapes all degrees
of any sinne; scarce any man some great degree of some great sinne; no man escapes
so, but that he may find upon record, in the Scriptures, a <hi>vae,</hi> and an <hi>Amen,</hi> a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
denounced, and an execution sealed against him. And, if that be our case, where
is there any roome for this milder signification of these two words, <hi>vae,</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi>
which we spoke of before, as they are words of <hi>Consolation?</hi> If because God hath said
<hi>Stipendium peccati mors est, the wages of sinne is death,</hi> because I have sinned, I must
dye, what can I doe in a <hi>Prayer?</hi> can I flatter God? what can I doe in an <hi>Almes?</hi> Can
I bribe God, or frustrate his purpose? Can I put an <hi>Euge</hi> upon his <hi>vae,</hi> a <hi>vacat</hi> upon
his <hi>Fiat,</hi> a <hi>Nonobstante</hi> upon his <hi>Amen.</hi> God is not man, not a false man that he can
lie, nor a weake man that he can repent. Where then is the restorative, the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
nature of these words? In this, beloved, consists our comfort, that all Gods <hi>vae's</hi>
and <hi>Amens,</hi> all judgments, and all his executions are <hi>Conditionall;</hi> There is a <hi>Crede
&amp; vives,</hi> Beleeve and thou shalt live; there is a <hi>Fac hoc &amp; vives,</hi> doe this and thou shalt
live; If thou have done otherwise, there is a <hi>Converte &amp; vives,</hi> turne unto the Lord
and thou shalt live; If thou have done so, and fallen off, there is a <hi>Revertere &amp; vives,</hi>
returne againe unto the Lord, and thou shalt live. How heavy so ever any of Gods
judgements be,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 22.</note> yet there is always roome for <hi>Davids</hi> question, <hi>Quis scit,</hi> who can tell
whether God will be gracious unto mee? What better assurance could one
have, then <hi>David</hi> had? The Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> had told <hi>David</hi> immediately from the
mouth of God, <hi>this child shall surely dye,</hi> and ratified it by that reason, <hi>because thou hast
given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,</hi> this child shall surely dye, yet
<hi>David</hi> fasted, and wept, and said, <hi>who can tell whether the Lord will be gratious unto me,
that the child may live?</hi> There is always roome for <hi>Davids</hi> question, <hi>Quis scit, who can
tell?</hi> Nay there is no roome for it, as it is a question of diffidence and distrust; every man
may and must know, that whatsoever any Prophet have denounced against any sinne
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93359:76"/>
of his, yet there are conditions, upon which the Lord will be gracious and thy soule
shall live. But if the first condition, that is <hi>Innocency,</hi> and the second, that is <hi>Repentance,</hi> be
rebelliously broken, then every man hath his <hi>vae,</hi> and every <hi>vae</hi> hath his <hi>Amen,</hi> the
judgements are denounced against him; and upon him they shall bee executed; for
God threatens not to fright children, but the Mountains melt, and Powers, and
Thrones, and Principalities tremble at his threatning. And so have you the doubled
signification of the first word <hi>vae,</hi> as it is <hi>vox Dolentis,</hi> and as it is <hi>Vox minantis,</hi> God
is loath, but God will infallibly execute his judgement, and we proceed to the extension
of this <hi>vae,</hi> over all, <hi>vae mundo,</hi> woe unto the world, and the double signification of
that word.</p>

Church, <hi>Abulensis,</hi> is so free, as to confesse that some Expositors amongst them,
have taken this word in our Text, <hi>Mundo, adjectivè,</hi> not to signify the world, but a
clean person, a free man, that it should be <hi>vae immuni,</hi> woe unto him that is free from
offences, that hath had no offences; perchance they mean from crosses. And so, though
it be a most absurd, and illiterate, and ungrammaticall construction of the place that
they make, yet there is a doctrine to bee raised from thence, of good use. As
God brought light out of darknesse, and raises glory out of sin, so we may raise
good Divinity out of their ill Grammar; for <hi>vae mundo,</hi> indeed, <hi>vae immuni,</hi> woe
be unto him that hath had no crosses. There cannot be so great a crosse as to have
none. I lack one loaf of that dayly bread that I pray for, if I have no crosse; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
are our spirituall nourishment; I lacke one limb of that body I must grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
which is the body of Christ Jesus, if I have no crosses; for, my conformity to
Christ, (and that's my being made up into his body) must be accomplished in my ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
his sufferings in his flesh. So that, though our adversaries out of their ignorance
mislead us in a wrong sense of the place; the Holy Ghost leads us into a true, and right
use thereof. But there is another good use of their error too, another good doctrine
out of their ill Grammar; Take the word <hi>mundo, adjectivè,</hi> for an adjective, and <hi>vae
mundo, vae immuni,</hi> wo unto him that is so free from all offences, as to take offence
at nothing; to be indifferent to any thing, to any Religion, to any Discipline, to any

Religion soever come, it shall never trouble, never offend him; 'Tis true, <hi>Vae mundo</hi>

are intended or prepared, is a seditious disaffection to the government, and a
disloyall aspersion upon the persons of our Superiours, to suspect without cause,
so, not to be sensible that the Catterpillars of the Roman Church, doe eat up our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

unto him that is unsensible of offences. Jealously, suspiciously to mis-interpret the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Superiours, is inexcusable, but so is it also not to feel how the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gains upon us, and not to wish that it were, and not to pray that it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
<hi>vae mundo, vae immuni,</hi> wo to him that is un-offended unsensible, thus. But as
I have wondred that that Bishop would so easily confesse, that some of their Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were so very unlearned, so barbarously ignorant, so enormously stupid, as to take
this <hi>vae mundo adjective,</hi> so doe I wonder more, that after such confessions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements

admit recourse to the Originall, as to the Supreme Judge, nor to other Translations:

                        <note place="margin">2. 2. 5.</note> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> call's it; the <hi>Originall world,</hi> of which, this world;
since the flood, is but a copy, and God spared not the Old world, says that Apostle.
Take it for an elder world then that, the world in Paradise, when one <hi>Adam,</hi> the
Son of God, and one <hi>Eve</hi> produced by God, from him, made up the world: or take it
for an elder world then that, the world in heaven, when onely the Angels, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures made up the world; Take it any of these ways, we in this latter world
do, <hi>Noah</hi> in the old world did, so did <hi>Adam</hi> in the world in Paradise, and so did the
Angels in the oldest world of all, find these <hi>woes</hi> from offences, and scandals, tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and tribulations.</p>
                     <p>So it is in all persons, in all men, so it is in all times, in all ages, and so it is in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
too; for hee that retires into a Monastery upon pretence of avoiding tentations,
and offences in this world, he brings them thither, and hee meets them there; Hee
sees them <hi>intramittendo,</hi> and <hi>extramittendo,</hi> he is scandalized by others, and others
are scandalized by him. That part of the world that sweats in continuall labour in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
vocations, is scandalized with their laziness, and their riches, to see them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
themselves with other mens sweat, and lard themselves with other mens fat; and
then these retired and cloistrall men are scandalized with all the world, that is out of
their walls. There is no sort of men more exercised with contentious and scandalous
wranglings, then they are: for, first, with all eager animosity they prefer their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
life before all other secular callings, yea, before those Priests, whom they call
<hi>Secular Priests,</hi> such as have care of souls, in particular parishes, (as though it were a
Diminution, and an inferiour state to have <hi>care of souls,</hi> and study and labour the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of others.) And then as they undervalue all secular callings, (Mechaniques, and
Merchants, and Magistrates too) in respect of any <hi>Regular order,</hi> (as they call them) so
with the same animosity doe they prefer their own Order, before any other Order.
A Carthusian is but a man of fish, for one Element, to dwell still in a Pond, in his Cell
alone, but a Jesuit is a usefull <hi>ubiquitary,</hi> and his Scene is the Court, as well as the
Cloister. And howsoever they pretend to bee gone out of the world, they are never
the farther from the Exchange for all their Cloister; they buy, and sell, and purchase
in their Cloister. They are never the farther from <hi>Westminster</hi> in their Cloister, they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93359:77"/>
occasion and they maintain suits from their Cloister; and there are the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
noted to abound most with suits, where Monasteries abound most. Nay, they
are never the farther from the field for all their Cloister; for they give occasions of
<hi>armies,</hi> they raise armies, they direct armies, they pay armies from their Cloister. Men
should not retire from the mutuall duties of this world, to avoid offences, tentations,

nay for the withering of his gourd that shadowed him, in all these, they did, in all such,

tentations, and are glad of them, and sorry when they are but weak; the godly
meet tentations, and wrastle with them, and sometimes doe overcome them, and are
sometimes overcome by them; but all have them, and yet we must not break out of
the world by a retired life, nor break out of the world by a violent death, but take
Gods ways, and stay Gods leasure. In this our third part, we are to consider the <hi>root</hi>
from which this over-spreading <hi>vae,</hi> this woe proceeds, <hi>A scandalis,</hi> from scandals,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93359:78"/>
from offences, and the double signification of that word, first, <hi>Scandalum activum,</hi> the
active scandall, which is a malice, or at least an indiscretion in <hi>giving</hi> offence, and <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum
passivum,</hi> the passive scandall, which is a forwardnesse, at least an easinesse in
taking offence; To know the nature of the thing, look we to the derivation, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
the Origination of the word. The word from which scandall is derived <hi>(sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zein)</hi>
signifies <hi>claudicare, to halt;</hi> and thence, a scandall is any trap, or Engin, any
occasion of stumbling, and laming, hid in the way that I must goe, by another person;
and as it is transferred to a spirituall use, appropriated to an Ecclesiasticall sense, it is
an occasion of sinning. It hath many branches; too many to bee so much as named;
but some fruits from some of them we shall gather,<note place="margin">Activum.</note> and present you. First, in our first,
the Active Scandall, to doe any thing that is naturally ill, formally sin, whereby ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be occasioned or encouraged by my example to do the like, this is the
active scandall most evidently, and most directly, and this is <hi>morbus complicatus,</hi> a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
that carries another disease in it, a fever exalted to a frenzy; It is <hi>Peccatum prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans,
peccatum gravidum,</hi> a spauning sin, a sin of multiplication, to sinne purposely, to
lead another into tentation. But there is a lesse degree then this, and it is an active
scandall too; To doe any thing that in it selfe is <hi>indifferent,</hi> (and so no sin in mee,
that do it) in the sight of another that thinks it not indifferent, but unlawfull, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath a reall, or a reverentiall dependence upon me, (my Son, my Servant, my
Tenant) and thinks I would be displeased if he did it not, does it against his conscience
by my example, though the sinne be formally his, radically it is mine, because I gave
the occasion, And there is a lower degree then this; and yet is an active scandall. If
I doe an indifferent thing in the sight and knowledge of another, that thinks it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
though he doe not come to doe it, out of my example, by any dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, yet if he come to think uncharitably of me, or to condemn me for doing it,
though this uncharitablenesse in him bee his sinne, yet the root grew in me, and I
gave the scandall. And there is a lower degree then this, and yet is an Active scandall
too. <hi>Origen</hi> hath expressed it thus, <hi>Scandalum est quo scandentium pedes offenduntur;</hi>
To hinder the feet of another, that would goe farther, or climbe higher in the ways of
godlinesse; but for me, to say to any man, What need you be so pure, so devout, so god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so zealous, will this make you rich, will this bring you to preferment? this is an
active scandall in me, though hee that I speak to, be not damnified by me. Of which
kind of scandall,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23.</note> there is an evident, and an illustrious example, between Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
and Christ; Christ cals <hi>Peter</hi> a scandall unto him, when <hi>Peter</hi> rebuked Christ for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to goe up to Jerusalem in a time of danger. Christ was to accomplish the work
of our salvation at Jerusalem, by dying, and <hi>Peter</hi> disswades, discounsels that journey;
and for this, Christ lays that heavy name upon his indiscreet zeal, and that heavy
name upon his person, <hi>Vade retro,</hi> Get thee behind me Satan, thou art a scandall unto
me. This is <hi>Scandalum oppositionis,</hi> the scandall of opposing, disswading, discounsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
discountenancing, and consequently the frustrating of Gods purpose in man;
This is but by word, and yet there is a lesse then this, which is <hi>Scandalum timoris,</hi>
when he that hath power in his hand, in a family, in a parish, in a City, in a Court, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidates
them who depend upon him, (though nothing bee expressely done or said
that way) and so slackens them in their religious duties to God; and in their constancy
in Religion it selfe; And <hi>vae illis,</hi> woe unto them that doe so, and <hi>vae mundo ab illis;</hi>
woe unto the world, because there are so many that doe so. And yet there is another
scandall which seems lesse then this, <hi>Scandalum amoris,</hi> the scandall of love; as <hi>Saul</hi>
gave <hi>David</hi> his daughter <hi>Mich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thereby lye the more open to <hi>Sauls</hi> mischievous purposes upon him, and <hi>vae illis,</hi> woe
unto them that doe so; and <hi>vae munde ab illis,</hi> woe unto the world, because there are
so many that doe so, that study the affections, and dispositions, and inclinations of men,
and then, minister those things to them, that affect them most, which is the way of the
instruments of the Roman Church, to promise preferments to discontented persons,
and is indeed, his way, whose instrument the Roman Church is, <hi>The Devill;</hi> for this
is all that the Devill is able to doe, in the ways of tentation, <hi>Applicare passivis activa,</hi>
To finde out what will work upon a man, and to work by that. The Devill did not

that choler, that makes me ignorantly and indiscreetly zealous, nor that flegm that
choakes mee with a stupid indevotion; Hee did not infuse into mee that bloud, that
inflames mee in licentiousnesse, nor that melancholy that dampes me in a jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and suspicion, a diffidence and distrust in God. The Devill had no hand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
me in my constitution. But the Devill knows, which of these govern, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in me, and ministers such tentations, as are most acceptable to me, and this is
<hi>Scandalum amoris,</hi> the scandall of Love.</p>
                     <p>So have ye then the Name, and Nature, and extent of the Active Scandall; against
which, the inhibition given in this Text is generall, wee are forbidden to scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
any person by any of these ways, The scandall of Example, or the scandall
of Perswasion, The scandall of Fear, or the scandall of Love. For, there is scarce
any so free to himselfe, so entirely his own, so independent upon others, but that
Example, or Perswasion, or Fear, or Love may scandalize him, that is, <hi>Lead him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
tentation,</hi> and make him doe some things against his own mind. Our Saviour
Christ had spoken, <hi>De pusillis,</hi> of little children, of weak persons, easie to be scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
before this Text, and he returns, <hi>ad pusillos,</hi> to the consideration of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
persons easie to bee scandalized again;<note place="margin">ver. 10.</note> this Text is not of <hi>them,</hi> or not of <hi>them
onely,</hi> but of <hi>all;</hi> say not thou of any man, <hi>aetatem habet,</hi> he is old enough, let him look
to himselfe, he hath reason as other men have, he hath had a learned and a religious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
ill example can doe him no harm; but give no ill example to any,
study the setling, and the establishing of all; for, scarce is there any so strong, but
may bee shaked by some of these scandals, Example, Perswasion, Fear, or Love.
And hee that employs his gift of wit, and Counsell to seduce and mislead men, or
his gift of Power, and Authority to intimidate, and affright men, or his gift of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
graces, lovelinesse of person, agreeablenesse of Conversation, powerfulnesse of
speech, to ensnare and entangle men by any of these scandals, may draw others into
perdition, but he falls also with them, and shall not be left out by God in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inflicted upon them that fall by his occasion.</p>
                     <p>The Commandement is generall, scandalize none, scarce any but may bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
by some of these ways; And then the Apostles practise was generall too,
we give no occasion of offence in <hi>any thing.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 3.</note> As he requires that wee should eat

others,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31. 8. 13.</note> even in our eating and drinking; <hi>If meat make my brother to offend,</hi> (offend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of my eating) <hi>In aeternum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 15.</note> says the Apostle there, <hi>I will eat no flesh while the world
standeth;</hi> Nor, <hi>destroy my brother with my meat, for whom Christ dyed.</hi> That's the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
tendernesse in things; (He would give no occasion of offence in <hi>any thing)</hi> And it is
as generall in contemplation of persons, he would have no offence given, neither to the
<hi>Iew,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 32.</note> nor to the <hi>Grecian,</hi> nor to the Church of God: He was as carefull not to scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize,
not to give just occasion of offence to Jew, not Gentile, as not to the Church of
God; so must we be towards them of a superstitions religion amongst us, as carefull
as towards one another, not to give any scandall, any just cause of offence. But what is
to be called a just cause of offence <hi>towards</hi> those men? Good ends, and good ways,
plain, and direct, and manifest proceedings, these can be called no scandall, no just cause
of offence, to Jew, nor Gentile, to Turk, nor Papist; nor does Saint <hi>Paul</hi> intend that
we should forbear essentiall and necessary things, for fear of displeasing perverse and
peevish men. To maintain the <hi>doctrinall truths</hi> of our religion, by conferences, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
by writing, by preaching, to avow, and to prove our religion to be the same,
that Christ Jesus and his Apostles proposed at beginning, the same that the generall
Councels established after, the same that the blessed Fathers of those times, unanimely,
and dogmatically delivered, the same that those glorious Martyrs quickned by their
death, and carryed over all the world in the rivers, in the seas of their blood, to avow
our religion by writing, and preaching, to be the same religion, an then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and protect that religion which God hath put into our hearts, by all such
meanes as hee hath put into our hands, in the due execution of <hi>just Laws,</hi> this is
no scandall, no just cause of offence to Jew not Gentile, Turke nor Papists. But
when leaving fundamentall things, and necessary truths, we wrangle uncharitably
about Collaterall impertinencies, when wee will refuse to doe such things as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93359:79"/>
conduce to the exaltation of Devotion, or to the order, and peace of the Church,
not for any harme in the things, but onely therefore because the Papists doe them,
when, because they kneel in the <hi>worship</hi> of the bread in the Sacrament, wee will not
kneel in <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to God for the Sacrament; when because they pray to
Saints, we will reproach the Saints, or not <hi>name</hi> the Saints, when because they abuse
the Crosse, we will abhor the Crosse; This is that that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> protests against, and in
that protestation Catechizes us, that as he would give no just occasion of offence to
the true Church of God, so neither would hee doe it to a false or infirme Church.
He would not scandalize the true Church of God, by any modifications, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
towards the false; nor hee would not scandalize the false and infirme
Church, by refusing to communicate with them, in the practise of such things, as
might exalt our Devotion, and did not endanger nor shake any foundation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which was the wisdome of our Church, in the beginning of the Reformation,
when the <hi>Injuctions</hi> of our Princes forbad us to call one another by the odious
names of <hi>Papist,</hi> or <hi>Papisticall Heretique,</hi> or <hi>Schismatique,</hi> or <hi>Sacramentary,</hi> or such

to the true Church of God, he would not <hi>prevaricate,</hi> nor to the Jew nor Gentile nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                     <p>It is no wonder to see them who put all the world,<note place="margin">Passivum.</note> into differences, (the Jesuits) to
differ sometimes amongst themselves. And therefore though the Jesuit <hi>Maldonat</hi> say
of this Text, That Christ did not here intend to warne, or to arm his Disciples against
scandals, as scandals occasions of sin, but onely from offering injury to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That scandall in this text is nothing but <hi>wrong,</hi> yet another Jesuit, <hi>(Vincemius
Rhegius)</hi> is not onely of another opinion himselfe, but thinks that opinion (as he
calls it) absurd; It is absurd, says he, to interpret it so; for, can a mans own hand
or foot, or eye, be said to injure him? And yet, in this place, they are often said to
scandalize him, to offend him. The interpretation that <hi>Maldonat</hi> departs from, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
acknowledges to be the interpretation of Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> of <hi>Euthymius,</hi> of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophylact,</hi>
of others of the Fathers; and, by the councell of Trent, he is bound to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Scriptures according to the Fathers, and he is angry with us, if at any time we doe
not so; and here he departs from them, where, not onely his reverence to them, but the
frame, and the evidence of the place should have kept them to him; for here Christ ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
his <hi>vae,</hi> as it is <hi>vae Dolentis,</hi> as he laments their miseries, and as it is <hi>vae Minantis,</hi> as
he threatens his judgements, not onely upon them that offend and scandalize others,
but upon them also that are easily scandalized by others, and put from their religion,
and Christian constancy with every rumour.<note place="margin">Hierom.</note>

It is almost as great a sin to be shaked by a scandall given, as to give it. Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
both in this Text; the <hi>Active,</hi> and the <hi>Passive</hi> scandall; but the latter, <hi>meliùs qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drat,</hi>
says a later Divine,<note place="margin">Calvin.</note> worthy to be compared to the <hi>Ancients,</hi> for the exposition of

                     <p>In that, we consider the working of this <hi>Vae,</hi> three ways; first, <hi>vae quia illusiones for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
woe unto the world because these scandals and offences, tentations, and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are so strong in their nature; and then <hi>vae quia infirmi vas,</hi> woe because you are so
weak in your nature; and again, <hi>vae quia Pravaricatores,</hi> woe because wee prevaricate
in our own case, and make our selves weaker then we are, and are scandalized with
things which are not in their nature scandalous, nor were scandalously intended. The
two first, are woe because we shall be scandalized, for scandals are truly strong, and
you are truly weak; The other is woe because ye will bee scandalized, when, and
where you might easily unentangle the snare, and devest the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>scruple. First, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence,
the violence, the unavoydablenesse and impetuousnesse of these scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
tentations, and tribulations under which wee all suffer in this world, it may
bee enough to consider that one saying of our Saviours, <hi>They shall seduce, Si
possibile,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 23.</note> even the elect,</hi> where (by the way, it is not meerly, not altogether, as we have
translated it, <hi>If it were possible,</hi> for that sounds, as if Christ had positively, and dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93359:79"/>
determined, that it is not possible for the elect to be seduced; but Christ
says onely, <hi>Si possibile,</hi> if it be possible, as being willing to leave it in doubt, and in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
how farre, in so great scandals, so very great tentations, even the elect might bee
seduced.<note place="margin">Gregor.</note> 
                        <hi>Ista Dominici sermonis dubitatto, trepidationem mentis in electis relinquit;</hi>
this doubtfulnesse in Christs speech, makes the very elect stand in fear of falling, in the
midst of such tentations, for, howsoever the elect shall rise again, the elect may fall by
these scandals, and though they may be reduced, they may be seduced. We are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

and not as they are wrapped up in the infallible knowledge of God; and so, our election
admits an outward tryall,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 1.</note> that is, <hi>Sanctification:</hi> so S. <hi>Peter</hi> writes, <hi>to the strangers elect
through sanctification.</hi> They were <hi>strangers,</hi> strangers to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and yet <hi>Elect;</hi>
for, as all of the houshold, all within the Covenant, all children of the faithfull, are not
elect, (for to be born of <hi>Christian parents</hi> within the Covenant, gives us a <hi>title to the
Sacrament of Baptism,</hi> so as that we may claim it, and the Church cannot deny it us; but
this birth doth not give us <hi>that title to heaven,</hi> which Baptisin it self does) so all <hi>stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> all that are without the Covenant, are not excluded in the election. S. <hi>Peter</hi> admits
<hi>stragers</hi> to election, but yet no otherwise then <hi>through sanctification;</hi> when we are come
to that hill,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 13.</note> to <hi>sanctification,</hi> we have a fair prospect to see our <hi>election;</hi> in: so, God hath <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
you to salvation,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Thes.</hi> but how? <hi>To salvation through sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi>
that's your hill, there opens your prospect. Agreeably to these two great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
says the <hi>beloved Apostle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Ioh. 1. 1.</note> the Elder unto the elect Lady, and her children; but still,
how elect?<note place="margin">verse 6.</note> as he tels you, <hi>elect if she walk in the Commandements of God, elect</hi> if she lose
not her former good works,<note place="margin">verse. 8.</note> that she may receive a full reward; <hi>elect, <hi>if she abide in the
doctrine of Christ.</hi>
                        </hi> Always from that mount of <hi>sanctification</hi> arises our prospect to <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and <hi>sanctification</hi> were <hi>glorification,</hi> if it were impossible to fall from it. If a tentation
of mony made <hi>Iudas</hi> an Apostle fall from his Master, how easily will such a tentation
make men fall with their Master, that is, run into dangerous and ruinous actions with
them? How easily will our children, our servants, our tenants fall form the truth
of God, if they have both the example of their superiors to countenance them,
and their purse to reward them for it? That scandal, that tentation is a Giant,
and an armed Gyant, a <hi>Goliah,</hi> and a <hi>Goliah with a speare like a weavers beame,</hi>
that marches upon those two leggs, <hi>Example</hi> to doe it, and <hi>Preferment for</hi> doing it.</p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>vae,</hi> in the consideration of the <hi>passive</hi> scandal, as it arises out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
of the scandal,<note place="margin">Quia infirmi</note> and tentation, <hi>Quia illusiones fortes,</hi> because they are so strong
in themselves. It arises also out of our weaknesse, <hi>Quia infirmi nos,</hi> because we are
so weak, even the strongest of us. And for this, it may also be enough to consider
those words of our Saviour;<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 21.</note> That a man may <hi>receive</hi> the word, and receive it with
<hi>joy,</hi> and yet, <hi>Temporalis est,</hi> says Christ, it <hi>may bee but for a while,</hi> hee may be but
a time-server, for, assoon as persecution comes, <hi>Illico continuò scandalizatur,</hi> by
and by, instantly, forthwith hee is scandalized and shaked. Hee stays not to give
God his leasure, whether God will succour his cause to morrow, though not to day.
Hee stays not to give men their Law, to give Princes, and States time to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whether it may not be fit for them to come to leagues, and alliances, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations for the assistance of the Cause of Religion next year, though not this.
But <hi>continuò scandalizatur,</hi> as soon as a <hi>Catholique army</hi> hath given a blow, and got
a victory of any of our forces, or friends, or as soon as a <hi>crafty Iesuit</hi> hath forged
a Relation, that that Army hath given such a blow, or that such
an Army there is, (for many times they intimidate weake men, when they
shoote nothing but Paper, when they are onely <hi>Paper-Armies,</hi> and <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet-Victories,</hi> and no such in truth) <hi>Illico scandalizatur,</hi> yet with these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
rumours, presently hee is scandalized, and hee comes apace to those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
conclusions, <hi>Non potens Deus,</hi> (for any thing I see, God is not so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
a God, as they make him, for his enemies Armies prevaile against his)
<hi>Non sapiens Deus,</hi> (for any thing I see, God does not take so wise courses for
his glory, of which hee talkes so much, and pretends to bee so jealous, for
his enemies Counsels prevaile against his;) And hee comes at last to the <hi>Non
est Deus,</hi> to labour to over-rule his own Conscience, and make himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeve,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93359:80"/>
or (at least) to wish, though hee cannot beleeve it, that there were no
God.</p>
                     <p>Now to correct, or to repair this weaknesse, you see our Saviours physique here; <hi>If
thy foot, thy hand, thine eye, scandalize thee, offend thee, abscinde &amp; proj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ce, erue &amp; projice,
Cut it off, pull it out,</hi> and then cast it away. You see Christs method in his physique, It
determines not in a preparative, that does but stirre the humours, (for every
remorse, and every compunction, and every sense that a man hath, that such,
and such company leades him into tentation, does that, it workes in the nature
of such a preparative, as stirres the humours, affects the soul,) Christs physique
determines not in a blood-letting, no not in cutting off the gangren'd part, for
it is not onely <hi>Cut off,</hi> and <hi>pull out,</hi> but, <hi>Cast away,</hi> it is an absolute evacuation
and purging out of the peccant humour. It is not a halting with the foot, nor a
shifting with the hand, it is not a winking with the eye, but <hi>abscinde,</hi> and <hi>erue,
Cut off, pull out;</hi> and, after that, Though hee bee the foot upon which thou
standest, thy Master, thy Patron, thy Benefactor; Though hee be thy hand by
which thou gettest thy living, thy meanes, the instrument of thy maintenance,
or preferment; Though hee bee thine eye, the man from whom thou receivest
all thy Light, and upon whose learning thou engagest thy Religion, <hi>abscindatur,
&amp; projice,</hi> if hee scandalize thee, shake thee in thy Religion at the heart, or in
the ways of godlinesse in thine actions, Cut him off; that is, cut off thy selfe
from that conversation, and <hi>cast him away,</hi> returne no more within distance of that
tentation: for, as sinne hath that quality of a worm, that it gnawes, (it gnawes
the conscience) so hath it also that quality of a worm, that if you cut it into pieces,
yet if those pieces come together again, they will re-unite again; sinne, though
discontinued, will finde his old pieces, if they keep not farre asunder. And since
it is said of God himself by <hi>David,<note place="margin">Psalm 18.</note> Cum perverso perverteris,</hi> That God will grow fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with the froward, and since God says of himselfe, <hi>That with them that goe crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee will goe crookedly too,</hi> that the behaviour of other men are said to make impressions
upon God himselfe, cosider the slipperinesse of our corrupt nature, how easily the vices
of other men insinuate and infuse themselves into us, and how much need wee have of
all Christs physique, <hi>abscinde, erue, projice, Cut off, pull out, and cast away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to come to our last note, Besides the woe arising from the strength of the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
and the woe from the corruptnesse of our weak nature, there is a woe upon
our wilfulnesse, upon our easinesse in being scandalized by an over-jealousie, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious
mis-interpretations of the actions of other men. And for this, in the highest
consideration, as it hath relation to our Saviour himselfe, and his Gospell, it may
be enough to consider that which himselfe says,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Blessed is hee, whosoever shall not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in me.</hi> But, <hi>Quis homo,</hi> What man is hee that is not offended in him, and his
Gospel? <hi>Qui non crubescit, aut timet,</hi> what man is he that is not ashamed of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
or afraid of it; that does not desire that the religion that he professes, were a religion
of more liberty &amp; of less threatnings? We see, that though the Cross of Christ, that is,
Christ crucified, were daily represented to the Jews in their sacrifices, &amp; preached to the
in the succession of their Prophets,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23.</note> yet this Crosse of Christ was <hi>Scandalum Iudais,</hi> a
scandal to the Jews; It was, (as the Apostle says there) <hi>Stultitia Gracis,</hi> to the Gentiles,
that had no such preparation to the Gospel, as the Jews had in their Law, and Sacrifices,
the Gospel was meer foolishnes, a religion unconformable to nature, and to reason, but
even to the Jews themselves, it was a scandal, a stumbling block; they grudged that
that religion left them so narrow a way open to <hi>pleasure,</hi> and to <hi>profit,</hi> and that it referred
all to a spirituall Kingdome, whereas the Jews looked for a temporall Kingdome in
their Messias. And so truly Christ and his Gospel will be a scandal to all them that
will needs set Christ a price, at which hee shall sell his Gospel. If Tithes, or some
some small matter in lieu of Tithes, will serve his turn, and now and then a
groat to a Brief, and sometimes an extraordinary contribution, when extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
knowledge may bee taken of it, if this will serve his turn hee shall have it.
But if it must come to a <hi>Non pacem,</hi> that Christ profess hee comes not to
settle peace, but to kindle a warre, if wee must maintain armies for his Gospel,
if it come to an <hi>Odisse vitam,</hi> to hate Father, and Mother, and Wife, and
Children, and our owne lifes for his Gospel, this is too high a price, <hi>Nolumus
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93359:80"/>
hunc regnare,</hi> now the Gospell growes a Tyran, and wee will not be under a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
government; If hee will govern by his Law, that hee be content with our
coming to Church every Sunday, and our receiving every Easter, wee will live under
his Law; but if he come to <hi>exercise his Prerogative,</hi> and presse us to extraordinary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in watching all our particular actions, and calling our selves to an account, for
words and thoughts, then Christ and his Gospell become a scandall, a stumbling block
unto us, and lye in our way, and retard our ends, our pleasures, and our profits. But
if we can overcome this one scandall of the Gospell, that we be not ashamed nor afraid
of that, (that is, well satisfied in the sufficiency of that Gospel for our salvation, and
then content to suffer for that Gospel) if we can devest this scandall, no other shall
trouble us.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 165.</note> 
                        <hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law,</hi> says <hi>David;</hi> To love it, is to

that that misery shall not make them miserable; how evill so ever it be in it self, it shall

The wicked will not follow you in that strange Country; their conversation is not
in heaven; if yours be, they will not follow you thither. They will doe, as he, whose

A religious constancy blunts the edge of any sword, dampes the spirits of any counsel,
benums the strength of any arme, opens the corners of any Labyrinth, and brings the
subtilest plots against God and his servants, not onely to an invalidnesse, an ineffectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but to a derision;<note place="margin">Iude 5. 20. Psal. 2. 4.</note> not onely to a <hi>Dimicatum de coelis,</hi> that the world shall see,
that the Lord fights for his servants from heaven, but to an <hi>Irridebit in coelis,</hi> that
he that sits in heaven, shall laugh them to scorn; he shall ruine them, and ruine them in
contempt. That prayer that <hi>David</hi> makes, <hi>Libera me Domine ab homine malo, deliver
me O Lord, from the evill man,</hi> is a large, an extensive, an indefinite prayer; for, there
is an evill man (occasion of tentation) in every man, in every woman, in every action;
there is <hi>Coluber in via,</hi> a snake in every path, danger in every calling. But Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
contracts that prayer, and fixes it, <hi>Liberet te Deus à temes, noli tibi esse malius;
God blesse me from my selfe, that I be not that evill man to my selfe,</hi> that I lead not my
selfe into tentation, and nothing shall scandalize me. To which purpose it concerns us
to devest that naturall, but corrupt easinesse of uncharitable mis-construing that which
other men doe, especially those whom God hath placed in his own place, for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over us; that we doe not come to think that there is nothing done, if all bee not
done; that no abuses are corrected, if all be not removed; that there's an end of all
Protestants, if any Papists bee left in the world. Upon those words of our Saviour,
speaking of the last day of Judgement,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>The son of man shall send forth his Angels, and
they shall gather out of his Kingdome, Omnia scandala,</hi> All things that might offend:
<hi>Calvin</hi> says learnedly and wisely, <hi>Qui ad extirpandum quicquid displicet praepostere fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinant,</hi>
They that make too much haste to mend all at once, <hi>antevertunt Christi judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,
&amp; ereptum Angelis officium sibi temereusurpant,</hi> They prevent Christs judgment,
and rashly, and sacrilegiously they usurp the Angels office. Christ hath reserved the
cleansing and removing of all scandals, all offences to the last day; the Angels of
the Church, the Minister, the Angels of the State, the Magistrate, cannot doe it; not
the Angels of heaven themselves, till the day of judgement. All scandals cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
in this life; but a great many more might be then are, if men were not so apt
to suspect, and mis-constru, and imprint the name of scandall upon every action, of
which they see not the end, nor the way; for from this jealousie and suspicion; and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction
of the Angels of Church and State (our Superiours in those sphears) wee
shall become jealous, and suspicious of God himselfe, that he hath neglected us, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
us, if he do not deliver us, and establish us, at those times, and by those means,
which we prescribe him; we shall come to argue thus against God himselfe, Surely, if
God meant any good to us, he would not put us into their hands, who doe us no good.
Reduce all to the precious mediocrity; To be unsensible of any declination, of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution

<hi>meates</hi> rather then others; He knows what dish he would choose, for
his first, and for his second course. We have often the same disposition
in our <hi>spirituall Diet;</hi> a man may have a particular love towards such or
such a book of Scripture, and in such an affection, I acknowledge, that my
spirituall appetite carries me still, upon the <hi>Psalms of David,</hi> for a first course, for the
Scriptures of the Old Testament: and upon the <hi>Epistles of Saint Paul,</hi> for a second
course, for the New, and my meditations even for these <hi>publike exercises</hi> to Gods
Church, returne oftnest to these two. For, as a hearty entertainer offers to others, the
meat which he loves best himself, so doe I oftnest present to Gods people, in these
Congregations, the meditations which I feed upon at home, in those two Scriptures.
If a man be asked a reason why he loves one meat better then another, where all are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
good, (as the books of Scripture are) he will at least, finde a reason in some good
example, that he sees some man of good tast, and temperate withall, so do: And for
my Diet, I have Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> protestation, that he loved the <hi>Book of Psalms,</hi> and
Saint <hi>Chrysostomes,</hi> that he loved Saint <hi>Pauls Epistles;</hi> with a particular devotion, I
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93359:82"/>
may have another more particular reason, because they are Scriptures, written in such
forms, as I have been most accustomed to; Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> being Letters, and <hi>Davids</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poems: for, God gives us, not onely that which is meerly necessary, but that which
is convenient too; He does not onely feed us, but <hi>feed us with marrow, and with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
he gives us our instruction in cheerfull forms, not in a sowre, and sullen, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and unacceptable way, but cheerfully, in <hi>Psalms,</hi> which is also a limited, and a
restrained form; Not in an <hi>Oration,</hi> not in <hi>Prose,</hi> but in <hi>Psalms;</hi> which is such a from
as is both curious, aud requires diligence in the making, and then when it is made,
can have nothing, no syllable taken from it, nor added to it: Therefore is Gods will
delivered to us in <hi>Psalms,</hi> that we might have it the more cheerfully, and that we might
have it the more certainly, because where all the words are numbred, and measured,
and weighed, the whole work is the lesse subject to falsification, either by substracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or addition. God speaks to us <hi>in or atione strictâ,</hi> in a limited, in a diligent form;
Let us speak to him <hi>in or atione solutâ;</hi> not <hi>pray,</hi> not <hi>preach,</hi> not <hi>hear,</hi> flackly, suddenly,
unadvisedly, extemporally, occasionally, indiligently; but let all our speech to him,
be weighed, and measured in the weights of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> let us be content to preach,
and to hear within the compasse of our Articles, and content to pray in those <hi>formes</hi>
which the Church hath meditated for us, and recommended to us.</p>
                     <p>This whole Psalm is a <hi>Prayer,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Divisio.</note> and recommended by <hi>David</hi> to the Church; And a
<hi>Prayer</hi> grounded upon <hi>Reasons.</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> are multiplyed, and dilated from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to the 20. verse. But as the <hi>Prayer</hi> is made to him that is <hi>Alpha,</hi> and <hi>Omega,
first,</hi> and <hi>last;</hi> so the <hi>Prayer</hi> is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the Psalme; the <hi>Prayer</hi> possesses
the first and the last verse thereof; and though the Reasons be not left out, (Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
settles that <hi>Prayer,</hi> which he recommended to our daily use, upon a Reason, <hi>Quia
tuum est Regnum, for thine is the Kingdome,)</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> makes up his Circle, he begins,
and ends in prayer. But our text fals within his Reasons; He prays in the first verse
that God would forbear him, upon the Reasons that follow; of which some are <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall,</hi>
some arising out of the <hi>power,</hi> some out of the <hi>malice,</hi> some out of the <hi>scorn</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men; And some are <hi>intrinsecall,</hi> arising out of himself, and of his sense of Gods
Judgements upon him; and our Text begins the Reasons of that last kind, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>David</hi> enters, with that particle, not onely of <hi>Connexion,</hi> but of <hi>Argumentation</hi>
too, For, <hi>(Rebuke me not O Lord,</hi> for it stands thus and thus with me) we shall make it
a first short part, to consider, how it may become a godly man, to limit God so far, as
to present and oppose <hi>Reasons</hi> against his declared purpose, and proceedings. And then
in those calamities which he presents for his Reasons in this Text, <hi>For thine arrows stick
fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore,</hi> we shall passe by these steps, first, we shall see
in what respect, in what allusion, in what notification he cals them <hi>arrows:</hi> And therein
first, that they are <hi>alienae,</hi> they are shot from <hi>others,</hi> they are not in his own power; a man
shoots not an arrow at himselfe; And then, that they are <hi>Veloces,</hi> swift in coming, he
cannot give them their time; And again, they are <hi>Vix visibiles,</hi> though they bee not
altogether invisible in their coming, yet there is required a quick eye, and an expresse
diligence, and watchfulnesse to discern and avoid them; so they are arrows in the hand
of another; not his own; and swift as they come, and invisible before they come.
And secondly, they are <hi>many arrows;</hi> The victory lies not in scaping one or two;
And thirdly, they <hi>stick in him;</hi> they finde not <hi>David</hi> so good proof, as to rebound
back again, and imprint no sense; And <hi>they stick fast;</hi> Though the blow be felt, and the
wound discerned, yet there is not a present cure, he cannot shake them off; <hi>Infixae sunt;</hi>
And then, with all this, they <hi>stick fast in him;</hi> that is, in <hi>all him;</hi> in his body, and soul;

This was <hi>Davids</hi> case in our Text: therefore he doth not stray into the infirmities
of these great, and good Men, <hi>Moses, Iob, Elias, Ieremy,</hi> and <hi>Ionah;</hi> whose errours,
it is labour better bestowed carefully to avoid, then absolutely to excuse, for that
cannot be done. But <hi>David</hi> presents onely to God the sense of his corrections, and
implies in <hi>that,</hi> that since the cure is wrought, since Gods purpose, which is, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
to bring a sinner to <hi>himself,</hi> and so to <hi>God,</hi> is effected in him, God would
now be pleased to remember all his other gracious promises too; and to admit such
a zealous prayer as as he doth from <hi>Esay</hi> after,<note place="margin">64. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Be not angry, O Lord, above measure;</hi>
(that is, above the measure of thy <hi>promises</hi> to repentant souls, or the measure of the

thee, Behold, we are thy people.</hi> To end this first part, (because the other extends it

a peculiar character of the holy Ghosts expressing Gods anger, in that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore
of shooting <hi>Arrows.</hi> In this place, some understand by these Arrows, foul and
infectious <hi>diseases,</hi> in his body, derived by his <hi>incontinence.</hi> Others, the sting of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
and that fearfull choice, which the Prophet offered him, <hi>war, famine,</hi> and <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence.</hi>
Others, his passionate <hi>sorrow</hi> in the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Bethsheba's first childe;</hi> or in the
<hi>Incest of Amnon</hi> upon his sister, or in the <hi>murder</hi> upon <hi>Amnon</hi> by <hi>Absolon;</hi> or in the
<hi>death</hi> of <hi>Absolen</hi> by <hi>Ioab;</hi> or in many other occasions of sorrow, that surrounded <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and his family, more, perchance, then any such family in the body of story. But
these <hi>Psalmes</hi> were made, not onely to vent <hi>Davids</hi> present holy passion, but to serve
the Church of God, to the worlds end. And therefore, change the person, and wee
shall finde a whole quiver of arrows. Extend this <hi>Man,</hi> to all <hi>Mankind;</hi> carry <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
History up to <hi>Adams</hi> History, and consider us in that state, which wee inherit
from <hi>him,</hi> and we shall see <hi>arrows</hi> fly about our ears, <hi>A Deo prosequente,</hi> the anger of
God hanging over our heads, in a cloud of arrows; and <hi>à conscientia remordente,</hi> our
own consciences shooting <hi>poisoned arrows</hi> of desperation into our souls; and <hi>ab Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Contemnente,</hi> Men multiplying arrows of <hi>Detraction,</hi> and <hi>Calumny,</hi> and <hi>Contumely</hi>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:93359:83"/>
upon our good name, and estimation. Briefly, in that wound, as wee were all shot in
<hi>Adam,</hi> we bled out <hi>Impassibilitatem,</hi> and we sucked in <hi>Impossibilitatem;</hi> There we lost
our <hi>Immortality,</hi> our <hi>Impassibility,</hi> our assurance of Paradise, and then we lost <hi>Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem
boni,</hi> says S. <hi>August:</hi> all possibility of recovering any of this by our selves.
So that these arrows which are lamented here, are all those miseries, which sinne hath
cast upon us; <hi>Labor,</hi> and the childe of that, <hi>Sicknesse,</hi> and the off-spring of that,
<hi>Death;</hi> And the <hi>security</hi> of conscience, and the <hi>terrour</hi> of conscience; the <hi>searing</hi> of
the conscience, and the <hi>over-tendernesse</hi> of the conscience; Gods quiver, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
quiver, and our own quiver, and our neighbours quiver, afford, and furnish ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
to gall, and wound us. These arrows then in our Text, proceeding from <hi>sin,</hi>
and sin proceeding from <hi>tentations,</hi> and inducing <hi>tribulations,</hi> it shall advance your
spirituall edification most,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note> to fixe your consideration upon those <hi>fiery darts,</hi> as they
are <hi>tentations,</hi> and as they are <hi>tribulations. Origen</hi> says, he would wish no more, for
the recovery of any soul, but that she were able to see <hi>Cicatrices suas,</hi> those scars which
these fiery darts have left in her, the deformity which every sinne imprints upon the
soul, and <hi>Contritiones suas,</hi> the attenuating and wearing out, and consumption of
the soul, by a continuall succession of more, and men wound, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> upon the same place.
An ugly thing in a Consumption, were a fearfull spectacle, And such <hi>Origen</hi> imagins
a soul to be, if she could see <hi>Cicatrices,</hi> and <hi>Contritiones,</hi> her ill-favourednesse, and her
leannesse in the deformity, and consumption of sin. How provident, how diligent a
patience did our blessed Saviour bring to his Passion, who foreseeing that that
would be our case, our sicknesse, to be first wounded with <hi>single tentations,</hi> and then
to have even the wounds of our soul wounded again, by a daily reiterating of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the same kinde, would provide us physick agreeable to our Disease, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery
conformable to our wound, first to be <hi>scourged</hi> so, as that his holy body was
torn with <hi>wounds,</hi> and then to have those <hi>wounded again,</hi> and often, with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latings.
So then these arrows, are those <hi>tentations</hi> and those <hi>tribulations,</hi> which are
accompanied with these qualities of arrows shot at us, that they are <hi>alienae,</hi> shot
from others, not in our power; And <hi>veloces,</hi> swift and sudden, soon upon us; And
<hi>vix visibiles,</hi> not discernible in their coming, but by an exact diligence.</p>
                     <p>First then,<note place="margin">Alienae.</note> these <hi>tentations</hi> are dangerous arrows, as they are <hi>alienae,</hi> shot from <hi>others,</hi>
and not in our own power. It was the Embleme, and Inscription, which <hi>Darius</hi> took
for his coin, <hi>Insculpere sagittarium,</hi> to shew his greatnesse, that he could wound afar
off, as an Archer does. And it was the way, by which God declared the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of <hi>Israel</hi> from <hi>Syria;<note place="margin">2 Reg. 13. 17.</note> Elisha</hi> bids the King open the window East-ward, and
shoot an arrow out. The King does shoot: And the Prophet says, <hi>Sagitta salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
Domini, The arrow of the Lords deliverance:</hi> He would deliver <hi>Israel,</hi> by shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vengeance into <hi>Syria.</hi> One danger in our <hi>arrows,</hi> as they are <hi>tentations,</hi> is, that
they come <hi>unsuspectedly;</hi> they come, we know not, <hi>from whence;</hi> from <hi>others;</hi> that's a
danger; But in our tentations, there is a greater danger then that, for a man cannot
shoot an arrow at <hi>himself;</hi> but we can direct <hi>tentations</hi> upon our selves; If we were
in a wildernesse, we could sin; and where we are, we tempt temptations, and wake

and they can shoot <hi>in the dark;</hi> they can wound, and not be known. They can
<hi>whisper Thunder,</hi> and passe an arrow through another mans eare, into mine heart;
Let a man be zealous, and fervent in reprehension of sin, and there flies out an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that gives him the wound of a <hi>Puritan.</hi> Let a man be zealous of the house of
God, and say any thing by way of moderation, for the <hi>repairing</hi> of <hi>the ruines</hi> of that
house, and <hi>making up the differences</hi> of the Church of God, and there flies out an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that gives him the wound of a <hi>Papist.</hi> One shoots <hi>East,</hi> and another <hi>West,</hi> but
both these arrows meet in <hi>him,</hi> that means well, to defame him. And this is the first
misery in these arrows, these tentations, <hi>Quia alienae,</hi> they are shot from others,
they are not in our own quiver, not in our own government.</p>
                     <p>Another quality that tentations receive from the holy Ghosts Metaphore of <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi>
is,<note place="margin">Veloces.</note> 
                        <hi>Quia veloces,</hi> because this captivity to sin, comes so swiftly, so impetuously
upon us. Consider it first in our <hi>making;</hi> In the generation of <hi>our parents,</hi> we were
<hi>conceiv'd in sin;</hi> that is, they sinn'd in that action; so we were conceiv'd in sinne; in
<hi>their sin.</hi> And in <hi>our selves,</hi> we were submitted to sin, in that very act of generation,
because then we became in part the subject of <hi>Originall sin.</hi> Yet, there was no arrow
shot <hi>into</hi> us then; there was no sinne in that <hi>substance</hi> of which we were made; for
if there had been sin in that <hi>substance,</hi> that substance might be damn'd, though God
should never infuse a soul into it; and <hi>that</hi> cannot be said well then; God, whose
goodnesse, and wisdome will have that substance to become a <hi>Man,</hi> he creates a <hi>soul
for it,</hi> or creates a soul <hi>in it,</hi> (I dispute not <hi>that</hi>) he sends a light, or hee kindles a
light, in that lanthorn; and here's no arrow shot neither; here's no sin in <hi>that</hi> soul,
that God creates; for there God should create something that were <hi>evill;</hi> and that
cannot be said; Here's no arrow shot from the body, no sin in the <hi>body alone;</hi> None
from the soul, no sin in the <hi>soul alone;</hi> And yet, the <hi>union</hi> of this soul and body is so
accompanied with Gods <hi>malediction</hi> for our first transgression, that in the instant of
that <hi>union</hi> of life, as certainly as that <hi>body must die,</hi> so certainly <hi>the whole Man</hi> must
be guilty of <hi>Originall sin.</hi> No man can tell me out of what <hi>Quiver,</hi> yet here is an
arrow comes so swiftly, as that in the very first minute of our life, in our quickning in
our mothers womb, wee become guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> sin done 6000 years before, and
subject to all those arrows, <hi>Hunger, Labour, Grief, Sicknesse,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> which have
been shot after it. This is the fearfull swiftnesse of this arrow, that <hi>God himself</hi> cannot
get before it. In the first minute that my soul is infus'd, the Image of God is imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in my soul; so forward is God in my behalf, and so early does he visit me. But
yet <hi>Originall sin</hi> is there, as soon as that Image of God is there. My soul is capable
of <hi>God,</hi> as soon as it is capable of <hi>sin;</hi> and though sin doe not get the start of God,
God does not get the start of sin neither. Powers, that dwell so far asunder, as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and <hi>Hell, God</hi> and the <hi>Devill,</hi> meet in an instant in my soul, in the minute of my
quickning, and the Image of <hi>God,</hi> and the Image of <hi>Adam,</hi> Originall sin, enter into
me at once, in one, and the same act. So swift is this arrow, <hi>Originall sin,</hi> from which,
all arrows of subsequent tentations, are shot, as that God, who comes to my first mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of life, cannot come before death.</p>
                     <p>And then, a third, and last danger, which we noted in our tentations,<note place="margin">Invisibiles.</note> as they are
represented by the holy Ghost, in this Metaphore of <hi>arrows,</hi> is, that they are <hi>vix
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93359:84"/>
visibiles,</hi> hardly discernible. 'Tis true, that tentations doe not light upon us, as <hi>bullets,</hi>
that we cannot see them, till we feel them. An arrow comes not altogether so: but an
arrow comes so, as that it is not discern'd, except we consider which way it comes, and
watch it all the way. An arrow, that findes a man <hi>asleep,</hi> does not <hi>wake</hi> him first, and
<hi>wound</hi> him after; A tentation that findes a man negligent, possesses him, before be sees
it. <hi>In gravtssimis criminibus, confinia virtutum ladunt;</hi> This is it that undoes us,<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> that
vertues and vices are contiguous, and borderers upon one another; and very often, we
can hardly tell, to which action the name of <hi>vice,</hi> and to which the name of <hi>vertue</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains.
Many times, that which comes within an inch of a noble action, fals under
the infamy of an odious treason; At many executions, half the company will call a
man an <hi>Heretique,</hi> and half, a <hi>Martyr.</hi> How often, an excesse, makes a naturall affection,
an unnaturall disorder? <hi>Vtinam aut sororem non amasset, Hamon, aut non vindicasset
Absolon; Hamon</hi> lov'd his sister <hi>Tamar;</hi> but a little too well;<note place="margin">Idem.</note> 
                        <hi>Absolon</hi> hated his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
incest, but a little too ill. Though <hi>love</hi> be good, and <hi>hate</hi> be good, respectively,
yet, says S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> I would neither that love, nor that hate had gone so far. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
between <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> was, <hi>If I say, The arrow on this side of thee, all is wel;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.</note>
                        <hi>If I say, The arrow is beyond thee, thou art in an ill case.</hi> If the arrow, the tentation, be
yet on this side of thee, if it have not lighted upon thee, thou art well; God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
thy face to it, and thou may'st, if thou wilt, continue thy diligence, watch it,
and avoid it. But if the arrow be beyond thee, and thou have cast it at thy back, in
a forgetfulnesse, in a security of thy sin, thy case is dangerous. In all these respects,
are these arrows, these infirmities, deriv'd from the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> dangerous, as they
are <hi>alienae,</hi> in the hand of others, as they are <hi>veloces,</hi> swift in seising us, and as they are
<hi>vix visibiles,</hi> hardly discern'd to be such; And these considerations fell within this
first branch of this second part, <hi>Thine arrows, tentations,</hi> as they are arrows, <hi>stick
fast in me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These dangers are in them, as they are <hi>sagittae, arrows;</hi> and would be so,<note place="margin">Plures.</note> if they were
but <hi>single</hi> arrows; any <hi>one</hi> tentation would endanger us, any one tribulation would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber
us; but they are <hi>plurall, arrows,</hi> and <hi>many arrows.</hi> A man is not safe, because
one arrow hath mist him; nor though he be free from <hi>one</hi> sin.<note place="margin">Ios. 7. 25.</note> In the execution of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi>
all <hi>Israel</hi> threw stones at him, and stoned him. If <hi>Achan</hi> had had some brother, or
cousin amongst them, that would have flung over, or short, or weakly, what good had
that done him, when he must stand the mark for all the rest? All <hi>Israel</hi> must stone
him. A little disposition towards some one vertue, may keep thee from some one ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
Thou mayst think it pity to corrupt a chast soul, and forbear soliciting her; pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to oppresse a submitting wretch, and forbear to vex him; and yet practise, and that
with hunger and thirst, other sins, or those sins upon other persons. But all <hi>Israel</hi> stones
thee; arrows flie from every corner; and thy measure is not, <hi>to thank God, that thou art
not as the Publican, as some other man,</hi> but thy measure is, <hi>to be pure and holy, as thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in heaven is pure, and holy,</hi> and to conform thy self in some measure, to thy pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
Christ Jesus. Against him it is noted, that the Jews took up stones twice to stone
him. Once, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did it, <hi>He went away and hid himself.</hi> Our way to scape these arrows,<note place="margin">Iob. 8. 59.</note>
these tentations, is to goe out of the way, to abandon all occasions, and conversation,
that may lead into tentation. In the other place, Christ stands to it,<note place="margin">10. 31.</note> and disputes it
out with them, and puts them from it by the <hi>scriptum est;</hi> and that's our safe shield,
since we must necessarily live in the way of tentations, (for <hi>coluber in via,</hi> there is a
snake in every path, tentation in every calling) still to receive all these arrowes, upon
the <hi>shield of faith,</hi> still to oppose the <hi>scriptum est,</hi> the faithfull promises of God, that
he will give us the issue with the tentation, when we cannot avoid the tentation it self.
Otherwise, these arrows are so many, as would tire, and wear out, all the diligence,
and all the constancy of the best morall man. Wee finde many mentions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of filling of <hi>quivers,</hi> and emptying of <hi>quivers,</hi> and <hi>arrows,</hi> and <hi>arrows,</hi> still in
the <hi>plurall, many arrows.</hi> But in all the Bible, I think, we finde not this word, (as it
signifies tentation, or tribulation) in the <hi>singular, one arrow,</hi> any where, but once,
where <hi>David</hi> cals it, <hi>The arrow that flies by day;</hi> And is seen, that is, known by
every man; for, for that, the Fathers, and Ancients runne upon that Exposition,<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 5.</note>
that that one arrow common to all, that day-arrow visible to all, is the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall
death;</hi> (so the Chalde paraphrase calls it there expresly, <hi>Sagitta m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rtis,</hi> The
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93359:85"/>
arrow of death) which every man knows to belong to every man; (for, as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he sees the Sunne set, he sees his death before his eyes.) Therefore it is such
an arrow, as the Prophet does not say, <hi>Thou shalt not feel,</hi> but, <hi>Thou shalt not feare
the arrow that flies by day.</hi> The arrow, the <hi>singular</hi> arrow that flies by day, is that
arrow that fals upon every man, <hi>death.</hi> But every where in the Scriptures, but this
one place, they are <hi>plurall, many,</hi> so many, as that we know not <hi>whence,</hi> nor <hi>what</hi>
they are. Nor ever does any man receive one arrow alone, any one tentation, but
that he receives another tentation, to hide that, though with another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sin. And the use of arrows in the war, was not so much to <hi>kill,</hi> as to <hi>rout,</hi> and
<hi>disorder</hi> a battail; and upon that routing, followed <hi>execution.</hi> Every tentation, every
tribulation is not <hi>deadly.</hi> But their multiplicity disorders us, discomposes us, unse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>les us,
and so hazards us. Not onely every <hi>periodicall</hi> variation of our years, <hi>youth</hi> and <hi>age,</hi>
but every day hath a divers arrow, every houre of the day, a divers tentation. An old
man wonders then, how an arrow from an eye could wound him, when he was young,
and how <hi>love</hi> could make him doe those things which hee did <hi>then;</hi> And an arrow
from the tongue of inferiour people, that which we make shift to call <hi>honour,</hi> wounds
him deeper now; and <hi>ambition</hi> makes him doe as strange things now, as <hi>love</hi> did then;
A fair day shoots arrows of <hi>visits,</hi> and <hi>comedies,</hi> and <hi>conversation,</hi> and so wee goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
and a foul day shoots arrows of <hi>gaming,</hi> or <hi>chambering,</hi> and <hi>wantonnesse,</hi> and
so we stay at home. Nay, the same sin shoots arrows of <hi>presumption</hi> in God, before it
be committed, and of <hi>distrust</hi> and <hi>diffidence</hi> in God after; we doe not <hi>fear</hi> before, and
we cannot <hi>hope</hi> after: And this is that misery from this <hi>plurality,</hi> and <hi>multiplacity</hi> of
these arrows, these manifold tentations, which <hi>David</hi> intends here, and as often as he
speaks in the same phrase of plurality, <hi>vituli multi,</hi> many buls, <hi>canes multi,</hi>

me. For as it is said of the spirit of wisdome, that it is <hi>unicus multiplex,<note place="margin">Wisd. 7. 22.</note> manifoldly
one, plurally singular:</hi> so the spirit of tentation in every soul is <hi>unicus multiplex,</hi> singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
plurall, <hi>rooted</hi> in some <hi>one</hi> beloved sin, but derived into infinite branches of tentation.</p>
                     <p>And then, these arrows <hi>stick in us;</hi> the raine fals,<note place="margin">Fixae.</note> but that cold sweat hangs not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us; Hail beats us, but it leaves no pock-holes in our skin. These arrows doe not so
fall about us, as that they misse us; nor so hit us, as they rebound back without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us: But we complain with <hi>Ieremy, The sons of his quiver are entred into our reins.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 13.</note>
The Roman Translation reads that <hi>filias, The daughters of his quiver;</hi> If it were but
so, <hi>daughters,</hi> we might limit these arrows in the signification of <hi>tentations,</hi> by the
many occasions of tentation; arising from <hi>that sex.</hi> But the Originall hath it <hi>filios,</hi>
the sons of his quiver, and therefore we consider these arrows in a stronger significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>tribulations,</hi> as well as <hi>tentations; They stick in us;</hi> Consider it but in one kinde,
<hi>diseases,</hi> sicknesses. They stick to us so, as that we are not sure, that any old diseases
mentioned in Physicians books are worn out, but that every year produces <hi>new,</hi> of
which they have no mention, we are sure. We can scarce expresse the number, scarce
sound the names of the diseases of mans body; 6000 year hath scarce taught us what
they are, how they affect us, how they shall be cur'd in us, nothing, on this side the
<hi>Resurrection,</hi> can teach us. They stick to us so, as that they passe by <hi>inheritance,</hi> and
last more generations in families, then the inheritance it self does; and when no land,
no Manor, when no title, no honour descends upon the heir, the stone, or the gout
descends upon him. And as though our bodies had not <hi>naturally diseases,</hi> and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
enow, we contract more, inflict more, (and that, out of necessity too) in <hi>mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and <hi>macerations,</hi> and <hi>Disciplines</hi> of this rebellious flesh. I must have this body
with me to heaven, or else salvation it self is not perfect; And yet I cannot have this
body thither, except as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did his, <hi>I beat down this body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. ult.</note> attenuate this body by
mortification; <hi>Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi>
I have not body enough for my body, and I have too much body for my soul; not
body enough, not bloud enough, not strength enough, to sustain my self in <hi>health,</hi>
and yet body enough to destroy my soul, and frustrate the grace of God in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
perplexed, riddling condition of man; sin makes the body of man miserable,
and the remedy of sin, <hi>mortification,</hi> makes it miserable too; If we enjoy the good
things of this world, <hi>Duriorem carcerem praeparamus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Basil.</note> wee doe but carry an other wall
about our prison, an other story of unwieldy flesh about our souls; and if wee give
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93359:85"/>
our selves as much <hi>mortification</hi> as our body needs, we live a life of <hi>fridays,</hi> and see no
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> we make up our years of <hi>Lents,</hi> and see no other <hi>Easters,</hi> and whereas God
meant us <hi>Paradise,</hi> we make all the world a <hi>wildernesse.</hi> Sin hath cast a curse upon all
the creatures of the world, they are all worse then they were at first, and yet we dare not
receive so much blessing, as is left in the creature, we dare not eat or drink, and enjoy
them. The <hi>daughters</hi> of Gods quiver, and the <hi>sons</hi> of his quiver, the arrows of <hi>tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the arrows of <hi>tribulation,</hi> doe so stick in us, that as he lives miserably, that lives
in <hi>sicknes,</hi> and he as miserably, that lives in <hi>physick:</hi> so <hi>plenty</hi> is a misery, and <hi>morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is a misery too; plenty, if we consider it in the <hi>effects,</hi> is a <hi>disease,</hi> a continuall sicknes,
for it breeds diseases; And <hi>mortification,</hi> if we should consider it without the <hi>effects,</hi>
is a disease too, a continuall hunger, and fasting; and if we consider it at best, and in the
effects, mortification is but a <hi>continuall physick,</hi> which is misery enough.</p>
                     <p>They stick, and they <hi>stick fast; altè infixae;</hi> every syllable aggravates our misery.<note place="margin">Alrè Infixae.</note> Now
for the most part, experimentally, we know not whether they stick fast or no, for we
never goe about to pull them out: these arrows, these tentations, come, and welcome:
we are so far from offering to pull them out, that we fix them faster and faster in us; we
assist our tentations: yea, we take preparatives and fomentations, we supple our selves by
<hi>provocations,</hi> lest our flesh should be of proof against these arrows, that death may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the surer, and the deeper into us by them. And he that does in some measure, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
and religiously, goe about to draw out these arrows, yet never consummates, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perfects his own work; He pulls back the arrow a little way, and he sees <hi>blood,</hi> and
he feels <hi>spirit</hi> to goe out with it, and he lets it alone: He forbears his sinfull companions,
a little while, and he feels a <hi>melancholy</hi> take hold of him, the spirit and life of his life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays,
and he falls to those companions again. Perchance he rushes out the arrow with
a sudden, and a resolved vehemence, and he leaves the head in his body: He forces a
divorce from that sinne, he removes himself out of distance of that tentation; and yet
he surfets upon cold meat, upon the sinfull remembrance of former sins, which is a
dangerous rumination, and an unwholesome chawing of the cud; It is not an ill deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of repentance, that <hi>poenitere</hi> is <hi>poenam tenere;</hi> that's true repentance, when we
continue in those means, which may advance our repentance. When <hi>Ioash</hi> the King
of <hi>Israel</hi> came to visit <hi>Elisha</hi> upon his sick bed,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 13. 17.</note> and to consult with him about his
war, <hi>Elisha</hi> bids the King smite the ground, and he smites it thrice, and ceases: Then
the man of God was angry, and said, <hi>Thou shouldst have smitten five or sixe times, and
so thou shouldst have smitten thine enemies, till thou hadst consumed them.</hi> Now, how
much hast thou to doe, that hast not pull'd at this arrow at all yet? Thou must
pull thrice and more, before thou get it out; Thou must <hi>doe,</hi> and <hi>leave undone</hi>
many things, before thou deliver thy selfe of that arrow, that sinne that transports
thee. One of these arrows was shot into Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, and it stuck,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7.</note> and
stuck fast; whether an arrow of <hi>tentation,</hi> or an arrow of <hi>tribulation,</hi> the Fathers
cannot tell; And therefore, wee doe now, (not inconveniently) all our way, in this
exercise, mingle these two considerations, of tentation, and tribulation. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pull'd thrice at this arrow, and could not get it out; <hi>I besought the
Lord thrice,</hi> says he, <hi>that it might depart from mee.</hi> But yet, <hi>Ioash</hi> his thrice striking
of the ground, brought him some victory; Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> thrice praying, brought him
in that provision of <hi>Grace,</hi> which God cals <hi>sufficient for him.</hi> Once pulling at these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
a slight consideration of thy sins will doe no good. Do it <hi>thrice;</hi> testifie some true
desire by such a diligence; Doe it now as thou sitt'st, doe it again at the <hi>Table,</hi> doe it
again in thy <hi>bed;</hi> Doe it <hi>thrice,</hi> doe it in thy <hi>purpose,</hi> do it in thine <hi>actions,</hi> doe it in
thy <hi>constancy;</hi> Doe it thrice, within the wals of thy <hi>flesh,</hi> in thy self, within the wals
of thy <hi>house</hi> in thy family, and in a holy and <hi>exemplar conversation</hi> abroad, and God
will accomplish <hi>thy work,</hi> which is <hi>his work</hi> in thee; And though the arrow be not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
pull'd out, yet it shall not fester, it shall not <hi>gangrene;</hi> Thou shalt not be cut off
from the body of Christ, in his Church here, nor in the Triumphant Church hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
how fast soever these arrows did stick upon thee before. God did not refuse <hi>Israel</hi>
for her wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores, though from the sole of the foot,<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 6.</note>
to the crown of the head, but because those wounds were not closed, nor bound up,
nor suppled with ointments, therefore he refused her. God shall not refuse any soul,
because it hath been shot with these arrows; Alas, God himself hath set us up <hi>for a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93359:86"/>
mark,</hi> says <hi>Iob,</hi> and so says <hi>Ieremy, against these arrows.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 12.</note> But that soul that can pour
out flouds of tears, for the losse, or for the absence, or for the unkindnes, or imagination
of an unkindness of a friend, mis-beloved, beloved a wrong way, and not afford one
drop, one tear, to wash the wounds of these arrows, that soul that can squeaze the
wound of Christ Jesus, and spit out his bloud in these blasphemous execrations, &amp; shed
no drop of this bloud upon the wounds of these arrows, that soul, and only that soul,
that refuses a cure, does God refuse; not because they fell upon it, and stook, and stook
fast, and stook long, but because they never, never went about to pull them out; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
resisted a tentation, never lamented a transgression, never repented a recidivation.</p>
                     <p>Now this is more put home to us in the next addition, <hi>Infixae mihi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mihi.</note> they stick, and
stick fast, <hi>in mee,</hi> that is, <hi>in all mee.</hi> That that sin must be sav'd or damn'd; That's not
the soul alone, nor body alone, but <hi>all,</hi> the whole man. God is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
as he is the God of the living; Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is alive; And <hi>Abraham</hi> is not alive,
if his body be not alive; Alive <hi>actually</hi> in the person of <hi>Christ;</hi> alive in an <hi>infallible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi>
of a particular resurrection. Whatsoever belongs to <hi>thee,</hi> belongs to thy <hi>body</hi>
and <hi>soul;</hi> and these arrows stick fast <hi>in thee;</hi> In <hi>both.</hi> Consider it in both; in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the body and to the soul; We need clothing; Baptisme is Gods Wardrobe;
there <hi>Induimur Christo;</hi> In Baptisme we put on Christ; there we are invested, apparell'd
in Christ; And there comes an arrow, that cuts off <hi>half</hi> our garment,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 4.</note> (as <hi>Hammon</hi> did
<hi>Davids</hi> servants) A tentation that makes us think, it is enough to be <hi>baptized,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the name of Christ; for <hi>Papist,</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> it is but the <hi>train</hi> of the garment, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>civility,</hi> and <hi>policy,</hi> and <hi>government,</hi> and may be cut off, and the garment remain
still. So we need <hi>meat, sustenance,</hi> and then an arrow comes, a tentation meets us, <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
&amp; bibite, Eat and drink, tomorrow you shall die;</hi> That there is no life, but this life, no
blessednesse but in worldly abundances. If we need <hi>physick,</hi> and God offer us his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
medicinall corrections, there flies an arrow, a tentation, <hi>Medice cura teipsum,</hi> that
hee whom wee make our Physician, died himselfe, of an infamous disease, that
Christ Jesus from whom we attend our salvation, could not save himself. In our clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
in our diet, in our physick, things which carry our consideration upon the
<hi>body,</hi> these arrowes stick fast in us, in that part of us. So in the more spirituall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our souls too. In our <hi>alms</hi> there are <hi>trumpets</hi> blowne, there's an arrow of
<hi>vaine-glory;</hi> In our <hi>fastings,</hi> there <hi>are disfigurings,</hi> there's an arrow of <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi>
In our <hi>purity,</hi> there is contempt of others; there's an arrow of <hi>pride;</hi> In our <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
to Church, there is <hi>custome</hi> and <hi>formality;</hi> In <hi>hearing Sermons,</hi> there is <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
to the parts of the Preacher. In our sinfull actions these arrows abound; In
our best actions they lie hid; And as thy soul is in every part of thy body, so these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
are in every part of thee, body, and soul; they stick, and stick fast, in thee, in
all thee.</p>
                     <p>And yet there is another weight upon us, in the Text,<note place="margin">Manus.</note> there is still a <hi>Hand</hi> that
follows the blow, and presse it, <hi>Thy hand presses me sore;</hi> so the Vulgat read it, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmasti
super me manum tuam, Thy hand is settled upon mee;</hi> and the Chalde
paraphrase carries it farther then to <hi>man, Sit super me vulnus manus tua;</hi> Thy hand
hath wounded mee, and that hand keeps the wound open. And in this sense the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
says, <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31.</note> But as
God leaves not his children without <hi>correction,</hi> so he leaves them not without <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
and therefore it behoves us to consider his hand upon these arrows, more then
one way.</p>
                     <p>First, because his hand is upon the arrow, it shall certainly hit the mark;<note place="margin">Tua ut affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio.</note> Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
cannot be disappointed. If men, and such men, <hi>left-handed men,</hi> and so many 700
left-handed men, and so many of <hi>one Tribe, 700 Benjamites,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iud. 20. 16.</note> could sling stones at a
hairs breadth, and not fail, God is a better <hi>Mark-man</hi> then the left-handed Benjamites;
his arrows alwayes hit as he intends them. Take them then for <hi>tribulation,</hi> his hand
is upon them; Though they come from the <hi>malice</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> his hand is upon them.
S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes, that in afflictions, Gods hand, and the Devils are but one hand.
<hi>Stretch out thy hand,</hi> says Satan to God, concerning <hi>Iob;</hi> And, <hi>all that he hath is in
thy hand,</hi> says God to Satan. <hi>Stretch out thy hand, and touch his bones,</hi> says Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to God; And again, God to Satan, <hi>He is in thy hand, but touch not his life.</hi> A diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
may be, that when Gods purpose is but to punish, as he did <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93359:86"/>
verall premonitory plagues, there it is <hi>Digitus Dei;</hi> It was but a <hi>finger,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 8. 19.</note> and Gods fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
When <hi>Balshazzar</hi> was absolutely to be destroyed, there were <hi>Digiti,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 5. 5.</note> and <hi>Manus
hominis,</hi> mens fingers, and upon a mans hand. The arrows of men are ordinary, more
venimous, and more piercing, then the arrows of God.<note place="margin">2 Reg. 13. 17.</note> But as it is in that story of
<hi>Elisha,</hi> and <hi>Ioash,</hi> The Prophet bade the King shoot, but <hi>Elisha</hi> laid his hand upon the
Kings hand; So from what instrument of Satan soever, thy affliction come, Gods hand
is upon <hi>their hand</hi> that shoot it, and though it may <hi>hit</hi> the mark according to <hi>their</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet it hath the <hi>effect,</hi> and it <hi>works</hi> according to <hi>his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, let this arrow be considered as a <hi>tentation,</hi> yet <hi>his</hi> hand is upon it;<note place="margin">Tua ut Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum.</note> at least
God <hi>sees</hi> the shooting of it, and yet <hi>lets</hi> it flie. Either hee <hi>tries</hi> us by these arrows,
what proof we are; Or he <hi>punishes</hi> us by those arrows of new sins, for our former sins;
and so, when he hath lost one arrow, he shoots another. He shoots a <hi>sermon,</hi> and that
arrow is lost; He shoots a <hi>sicknesse,</hi> and that arrow is lost; He shoots a <hi>sin;</hi> not that
<hi>he</hi> is <hi>authour</hi> of any sin, as <hi>sin;</hi> but as <hi>sin is a punishment</hi> of sin, he <hi>concurs</hi> with it. And
so he shoots arrow after arrow, permits sin after sin, that at last some sin, that draws
affliction with it, might bring us to understanding; for that word, in which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
here expresses this sticking, and this fast sticking of these arrows, which is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chath,</hi>
is here, (as the Grammarians in that language call it) in <hi>Niphal, figere factae,</hi>
they were made to stick; Gods hand is upon them, the <hi>work</hi> is his, the <hi>arrows</hi> are his,
and the <hi>sticking</hi> of them is his, whatsoever, and whosesoever they be.</p>
                     <p>His hand shoots the arrow, as it is a <hi>tribulation,</hi> he <hi>limits</hi> it, whosoever inflict it.<note place="margin">Tua ut Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamenta.</note> His
hand shoots it, as it is a <hi>tentation;</hi> He <hi>permits</hi> it, &amp; he orders it, whosoever offer it. But
it is especially from his hand, as it hath a <hi>medicinall nature</hi> in it; for in every <hi>tentation,</hi>

they lie in the body of the Scriptures, so the applications of those judgements, by Gods

                     <p>To end all, and to dismisse you with such a re-collection, as you may carry away
with you; literally, primarily, this text concerns <hi>David:</hi> He by <hi>tentations</hi> to sin,<note place="margin">Christus.</note> by
<hi>tribulations</hi> for sin, by <hi>comminations,</hi> and <hi>increpations</hi> upon sin, was bodily, and
ghostly become a quiver of arrows of all sorts; they <hi>stook,</hi> and stook <hi>fast,</hi> and stook
<hi>full</hi> in him, in <hi>all</hi> him. The Psalm hath a <hi>retrospect</hi> too, it looks back to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular man in his loines, and so, <hi>Davids</hi> case is our case, and all these arrowes
stick in all us. But the Psalm and the text hath also a <hi>prospect,</hi> and hath a <hi>propheticall</hi>
relation from <hi>David</hi> to our Saviour Christ Jesus. And of him, and of the multiplicity
of these arrows upon him in the exinanition, and evacuation of himself, in this world
for us, have many of the <hi>Ancients</hi> interpreted these words literally, and as in their first
and primary signification; Turne we therefore to <hi>him,</hi> before we goe, and he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home with us. How our first part of this text is applyable to <hi>him,</hi> that our prayers
to God, for ease in afflictions, may be grounded upon reasons, out of the sense of those
afflictions, Saint <hi>Basil</hi> tels us, that Christ therefore prays to his Father now in heaven,
to spare mankinde, because man had suffered so much, and drunk so deep of the bitter
cup of his anger, in his person and passion before: It is an avoidable plea, from
Christ in heaven, for us, <hi>Spare them O Lord in themselves, since thou didst not spare them
in me.</hi> And how far he was from sparing thee, we see in all those severall weights which
have aggravated his hand, and these arrowes upon us: If they be heavy upon us, much
more was their weight upon <hi>thee,</hi> every <hi>dram</hi> upon us was a <hi>Talent</hi> upon thee, <hi>Non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>thee,</hi> and lighted upon thee. Lord, though we be not capable of sustaining that part,
this <hi>passion for</hi> others, give us <hi>that,</hi> which we may receive, <hi>Compassion with</hi> others. They

be infinitely more that occasioned those torments, then those corrections that thou
layst upon us. Thine arrows <hi>stook</hi> and <hi>stook fast in thee;</hi> the weight of thy torments,

may improve and make better our Resurrection. These arrows were in <hi>thee,</hi> in <hi>all thee:</hi>

is this good use, That the book of Psalms is a <hi>mysterious</hi> book; and,
if we had not a lock, every man would thrust in, and if we had not a

for, for the rectifying of the <hi>will,</hi> the <hi>understanding</hi> must be rectified; and that
implies great difficulty: But the <hi>memory</hi> is so familiar, and so present, and so ready a
faculty, as will always answer, if we will but speak to it, and aske it, <hi>what God hath
done for us, or for others.</hi> The art of <hi>salvation,</hi> is but the art of <hi>memory.</hi> When God

                        <note place="margin">Exod 20.</note> Remember but
that. And when we expresse Gods mercy to us, we attribute but that faculty to God,

                        <note place="margin">Ps. 8. 6.</note> And when

                        <note place="margin">111. 4.</note>
it is as great a mercy, as the very doing of those wonderfull works was before. It was
a <hi>seal</hi> upon a <hi>seal,</hi> a seal of <hi>confirmation,</hi> it was a <hi>sacrament</hi> upon a <hi>sacrament,</hi> when in

                        <hi>Doe this in
remembrance of me. Memorare novissima,</hi> remember the <hi>last</hi> things, and <hi>fear</hi> will keep
thee from sinning; <hi>Memorare praeterita,</hi> remember the <hi>first</hi> things, what God hath done
for thee, and <hi>love,</hi> (love, which, mis-placed, hath transported thee upon many sins)
love will keep thee from sinning. <hi>Plato</hi> plac'd <hi>all learning</hi> in the memory; wee may
place <hi>all Religion</hi> in the memory too: All knowledge, that seems new to day, sayes
<hi>Plato,</hi> is but a remembring of <hi>that,</hi> which your soul knew before. All instruction,
which we can give you to day, is but the remembring you of the mercies of God, which
have been <hi>new every morning.</hi> Nay, he that hears no Sermons, he that reads no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
hath the Bible without book; He hath a <hi>Genesis</hi> in his <hi>memory;</hi> he cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his <hi>Creation;</hi> he hath an <hi>Exodus</hi> in his memory; he cannot forget that God hath
delivered him, from some kind of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from some oppression; He hath a <hi>Leviticus</hi>
in his memory; hee cannot forget, that God hath proposed to him some Law, some
rules to be observed. He hath <hi>all</hi> in his memory, even to the <hi>Revelation;</hi> God hath
<hi>revealed</hi> to him, <hi>even at midnight alone,</hi> what shall be his portion, in the next world;
And if he dare but remember that nights communication between God and him, he
is well-near learned enough. There may be enough in <hi>remembring our selves;</hi> but
sometimes, that's the hardest of all; many times we are farthest off from our selves;
most forgetfull of our selves. It was a narrow enlargement, it was an addition that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish'd the sense, when our former Translators added that word, <hi>themselves;<note place="margin">Ps. 22. 27.</note> All
the world shall remember themselves;</hi> there is no such particularity, as <hi>themselves,</hi> in
that text; But it is onely, as our later Translators have left it, <hi>All the world shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi>
and no more; Let them remember what they will, what they can, let them
but remember thoroughly, and then as it follows there, <hi>They shall turn unto the Lord,
and all the kindreds of the Nations shall worship him.</hi> Therefore <hi>David</hi> makes <hi>that</hi> the
key into this Psalme; <hi>Psalmus ad Recordationem,</hi> A <hi>Psalm for Remembrance.</hi> Being
lock'd up in a close prison, of multiplied calamities, this turns the key, this opens the
door, this restores him to liberty, if he can <hi>remember. Non est sanitas, there is no sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
no health in my flesh;</hi> Doest thou wondet at <hi>that?</hi> Remember thy selfe, and thou
wilt see, that thy case is worse then so; <hi>That there is no rest in thy bones.</hi> That's true
too; But doest thou wonder at <hi>that?</hi> Remember thy self, and thou wilt see the cause
of all that, <hi>The Lord is angry with thee;</hi> Find'st thou <hi>that</hi> true, and wondrest <hi>why</hi> the
Lord should be angry with thee? Remember thy self well, and thou wilt see, it is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of thy sins, There is no soundnesse in my flesh, because of thine anger, neither is
there any rest in my bones, because of my sinne.</hi> So have I let you in, into the whole
Psalm, by this key, by awaking your memory, that it is a <hi>Psalm for Remembrance:</hi>
And <hi>that</hi> that you are to remember, is, that all calamities, that fall upon you, fall not
from the malice or power of man, but from the anger of God; And then, that Gods
anger fals not upon you, from his <hi>Hate,</hi> or his <hi>Decree,</hi> but from <hi>your sins, There is no
soundnesse in my flesh, because of thine anger, neither is there any rest in my bones, because
of my sinne.</hi>

and literally to be understood of <hi>David;</hi> And secondly, in their <hi>retrospect,</hi> as
they look back upon the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and so concern <hi>Mankind collectively,</hi> and so <hi>you,</hi> and
<hi>I,</hi> and all have our portion in these calamities; And thirdly, we shall consider them in
their <hi>prospect,</hi> in their future relation to the <hi>second Adam,</hi> in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> in whom also
all mankinde was collected, and the calamities of all men had their <hi>Ocean</hi> and their
confluence, and the cause of them, the anger of God was more declared, and the cause
of that anger, that is sin, did more abound; for the sins of all the world were <hi>his,</hi> by
imputation, for this Psalm, some of our Expositors take to be a <hi>historicall,</hi> and <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
Psalm, determin'd in <hi>David;</hi> some, a <hi>Catholique,</hi> and <hi>universall</hi> Psalm, extended
to the whole condition of <hi>man,</hi> and some a <hi>Propheticall,</hi> and <hi>Evangelicall</hi> Psalm, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
upon <hi>Christ.</hi> None of them inconveniently; for we receive help and health, from
every one of these acceptations; first, <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Patient,</hi> and so, his promise, the

and there, his <hi>Example</hi> is our <hi>physick;</hi> And lastly, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Patient,</hi>
and so, his <hi>blood</hi> is our physick. In <hi>Adam</hi> we shall finde the <hi>Scriptum est,</hi> the medicine
is in our books, an assurance of a Messiah there is; In <hi>David</hi> we shall find the <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

Thus you may take this physick, thus you may apply it to your selves. In every accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

sicknesse; <hi>No soundnesse in the flesh:</hi> And more then that, <hi>trouble,</hi> and an <hi>universall
trouble; No peace, no rest, not in the bones.</hi> And then in a second branch, we shall see, that
those calamities proceed from the <hi>anger of God;</hi> we cannot discharge them, upon <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>

God, from that anger of God that hath a <hi>face,</hi> that looks upon <hi>something in us,</hi> and
growes not out of a <hi>hate</hi> in God, or <hi>decree</hi> of God against us. And then lastly, this
that Gods anger lookes upon is <hi>sin;</hi> God is not angry till he see sin; nor with <hi>me,</hi>

                        <hi>David</hi> durst not presume, that God could not, or would not bee angry. Anger is

David</hi> himself came to a high exaltation in this passion of <hi>anger.</hi> He was ordinarily so

He cast stones at him and at all his servants; He charges him with murder; and, that
which is heaviest of all, he cals <hi>Absolons rebellion, a judgement of God;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
it so, and says, <hi>The Lord hath bidden him to curse David.</hi> And yet this exemplar
mild man, <hi>David</hi> himself, upon a scorn offered to him by <hi>Hanun</hi> in the abuse of his
Ambassadours, goes himself in person, into a dangerous war, against the Ammonites,
assisted with 32000 chariots of their neighbours the Aramites,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.</note> and there he destroys
those great numbers, which are mentioned in that story: and after this defeat,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 19.</note> in cold
blood, he goes out against them, that had assisted them; He takes the City <hi>Rabbah,</hi>
and the people he cuts with Saws, and with Harrows of iron, and with Axes; <hi>David</hi>
saw that a mild man can grow angry, and that a fire that is long kindling, burns most
vehemently. That which is an Adage, and Proverb now, was ever true in substance,
<hi>Ab inimico flegmatico libera me Domine;</hi> from him that is long before hee be angry,
for he is long before hee be reconciled again. Gods goodnesse hath that disposition,
to bee long suffering; mans ilnesse and abuse of that, is able to inflame God. So <hi>Davids</hi>
sin had inflamed him; and the fire of Gods anger produced the calamities of this text
upon him: which our Expositors ordinarily take to have been historically this, that
when <hi>David</hi> had provoked God, with that sinfull confidence in <hi>numbring his people,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 17.</note>
when Gods anger was executed in that <hi>devouring plague,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> saw the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

he fell into that dampe, and dead cold, that howsoever they covered him,<note place="margin">1 Reg. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never get heat in him: And this was the sin, say our Expositors, and this was the <hi>anger,</hi>
and this was the <hi>manifestation,</hi> and this was the <hi>disease</hi> that <hi>David</hi> complains of here.
And be this enough of the personall acceptation of these words; <hi>There is no soundness
in my flesh, because of thine anger, neither is there rest in my bones, because of my sinne;</hi> for
in their second acceptation as they are referred to the miserable condition of all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde</hi>
by sinne, the particulars which we laid down before, will fall into more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
consideration.</p>
                     <p>In this second part, first we contemplate <hi>man,</hi> as the Receptacle,<note place="margin">2. Part. <hi>Miseria.</hi>
                        </note> the Ocean of all
misery. Fire and Aire, Water and Earth, are not the Elements of man; Inward decay,
and outward violence, bodily pain, and sorrow of heart may be rather styled his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
And though he be destroyed by these, yet he consists of nothing but these.
As the good qualities of all creatures are not for their own use, (for the <hi>Sun</hi> sees not
his own glory, nor the <hi>Rose</hi> smells not her own breath: but all their good is for <hi>man</hi>)
so the ill conditions of the creature, are not directed upon themselves, (the Toad poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
not it selfe, nor does the Viper bite it self) but all their ill powrs down upon <hi>man.</hi>
As though man could be a <hi>Microcosm,</hi> a world in himself, no other way, except all the
misery of the world fell upon him. <hi>Adam</hi> was able to decypher the nature of every
Creature in the <hi>name</hi> thereof, and the Holy Ghost hath decyphered his in his <hi>name</hi>
too; In all those names that the Holy Ghost hath given man, he hath declared him
miserable, for, <hi>Adam,</hi> (by which name God calls him,<note place="margin">Gem. 5. 2.</note> and <hi>Eve</hi> too) signifies but <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
but a <hi>Blushing:</hi> and whether we consider their low materials, as it was but <hi>earth,</hi>
or the <hi>redness</hi> of that earth, as they stained it with their own blood, and the blood of all
their posterity, and as they drew another more precious blood, the blood of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias
upon it, every way <hi>both</hi> may be <hi>Adam,</hi> both may <hi>blush.</hi> So God called that pair,
our first Parents, man in that root, <hi>Adam:</hi> But the first name, by which God called
man in generall, <hi>mankinde,</hi> is <hi>Ish, Therefore shall a man leave his Father, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ish,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 24.</note>
is but <hi>à sonitu, à rugitu:</hi> Man hath his name from <hi>crying,</hi> and the occasion of <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
misery,</hi> testified in his entrance into the world, for he is <hi>born crying;</hi> and our very
Laws presume, that if he be alive, he will cry, and if he be not heard cry, conclude
him to be born dead. And where man is called <hi>Gheber,</hi> (as he is often) which is derived
from <hi>Greatness,</hi> man is but great so, as that word signifies; It signifies a Giant, an
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93359:89"/>
                        <hi>oppressour,</hi> Great in power, and in a delight to doe great mischiefs upon others, or <hi>Great,</hi>
as he is a <hi>Great mark,</hi> and easily hit by others. But man hath a fourth name too in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Enosh,</hi> and that signifies nothing but <hi>misery.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>Put them in
fear O Lord, that the Nations may know they are but men;</hi> there's that name <hi>Enosh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 20.</note> that
they are but miserable things. <hi>Adam</hi> is <hi>Blushing, Ish is lamenting, Geber</hi> is <hi>oppressing,

rule all Creatures,</hi> yet there is no soundnesse in our flesh, for, all these Creatures are
corrupted, and become worse then they were, (to us) by the sinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> Bring
<hi>flesh</hi> to a nearer signification, to our <hi>own,</hi> there was <hi>Caro juxta naturam,</hi> and there is
<hi>Caro juxta culpam.</hi> That flesh which was naturall, to man,<note place="margin">Gregor.</note> that which God gave man
at first, that had health and soundnesse in it; but yet not such a degree of soundnesse,
as that it needed no more, then it then had. That had been naturally enough, (if that
had been preserved to carry that flesh it selfe to heaven, but even <hi>that flesh</hi> if it had
not sinned, though it had an <hi>Immortality</hi> in it self, yet must have received a <hi>glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in heaven; as well, (though in another measure) as those bodies, which shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
at the last day, and shall be but changed, and not dissolved in the dust, must receive
a glorification there, besides that preservation from dissolution. Now this <hi>Caro juxta
culpam,</hi> sinfull flesh, is farther from that Glorification; Our naturall flesh, when
it was at best, had some thing to put on; but our sinfull flesh hath also something to
put off, before it can receive glory. So then, for flesh in generall, the body of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
though that flesh be our flesh, because all Creatures are ours, in <hi>that</hi> flesh there is
no soundnesse, because they are become worse; for <hi>that</hi> flesh, which we call naturall
<hi>Adams first flesh,</hi> besides that it was never capable of glory in <hi>it selfe,</hi> but must have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
that, by receiving the light of Gods presence, there is none of that flesh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
now; now <hi>universa caro,</hi> all flesh is corrupted; and that curse is gone upon

Dissolution and putrefaction is gone over thee alive; Thou hast over liv'd
thine own death, and art become thine own ghost, and thine own hell; <hi>No soundnesse in

man, and the highest of humane miseries, sicknesse, and sicknesse over all the

called workes of the <hi>flesh;</hi> howsoever men thinke themselves wittie, and subtile,
and spirituall in these wranglings, yet they have carnall respects, they are of the
flesh, and there is no soundnes in them. But beyond this carnality in matters of Opinions,
in points of a higher nature, this diseased man in our Text, comes to trouble in his Bones,
S. <hi>Basils spirituall bones:</hi> Hee shall suspect his Religion, suspect his Repentance, suspect
the Comforts of the Minister, suspect the efficacy of the Sacrament, suspect the
mercy of God himselfe. Every fit of an Ague is an Earth-quake that swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
him, every fainting of the knee, is a step to Hell; every lying down at night
is a funerall; &amp; every quaking is a rising to judgment; every bell that distinguishes times,
is a passing-bell, and every passing-bell, his own; every singing in the ear, is an Angels
Trumpet; at every dimnesse of the candle, he heares that voice, <hi>Fool, this night they
will fetch away thy soul;</hi> and in every judgement denounced against sin, he hears an <hi>lto
maledicte</hi> upon himselfe, <hi>Goe thou accursed into hell fire.</hi> And whereas such
meditations as these, might sustaine a rectified soule, as Bones in this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>despaire</hi> shall have suck'd out all the marrow of these Bones, and so there
shall bee no <hi>soundnesse in his flesh, no rest in his bones.</hi> And so have you this
sicke sinner dissected and anatomized; Hee hath not onely his portion in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
that lies upon all mankinde, which was our first branch, but in the heavyest of all,
sicknesse, which was a second, and then a third sicknesse spread over all, <hi>no soundnesse,</hi>
nor rest in that sicknesse, which was a fourth consideration, <hi>No soundnesse in his flesh,</hi>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:93359:91"/>
in his weaker faculties and operations, <hi>No rest in his bones,</hi> no acquiescence in his
best actions, with which we end this first part. In which, wee consider sinfull man,
in <hi>himself,</hi> and so all is desperate; But in the second, where we find him upon the
consideration of the cause of all these distresses, That it is from the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the anger of God, <hi>There is no soundnesse in my flesh, because of thine
Anger,</hi> there wee shall finde a way offered to him, that may, if hee pursue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
bring him to a Reparation, to a Redintegration; for, if hee look upon the
Anger of God in a right line, it will shew him, that as that Anger is the cause
of his Calamities, so his sinnes are the cause of that Anger.</p>
                     <p>May wee not piously apply that Proverbiall speech, <hi>Corruptio optimi pessima,</hi>
(that when good things take in another nature then their own,<note place="margin">Ira Dei.</note> they take it in the
highest exaltation) thus, that when God, who is all mercy, growes angry, he becomes
all anger? The Holy Ghost himselfe seemes to have given us leave to make that
application, when expressing God in the height of his anger, hee calls God then,
in that anger, a <hi>Dove;</hi> wee read it the <hi>fiercenesse of an oppressour,</hi> but Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
reads it, <hi>The anger of a Dove.</hi> And truly there is no other word then that,<note place="margin">Ier. 25. ult.</note> in that
tongue, (the word is <hi>Ionah,</hi>) that signifies a <hi>Dove,</hi> and that word does signifie a <hi>Dove,</hi>
in many other places of Scripture; And that Prophet which made his flight from
God, when hee sent him to Nineveh, is called by that name, <hi>Ionah,</hi> a <hi>Dove;</hi>
And the Fathers of the Latine Church, have read, and interpreted it so, of a
<hi>Dove.</hi> Some of them take <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to be this angry <hi>Dove,</hi> because hee left
his owne <hi>Dove-coat</hi> to feed abroad, to prey upon them; and some, because the <hi>Dove</hi>
was the Armes and Ensigne of the Assyrians from the time of <hi>Semiramis;</hi> But
the rest take this Dove to bee God himselfe, and that the sinnes of men had
put a <hi>Gall into a Dove,</hi> Anger into God. And then, to what height that anger
growes, is expressed in the Prophet <hi>Hosea; I will meet them,</hi> says God, (when
hee is pleased, he says, <hi>hee will wait for them)</hi> as a <hi>Bear,</hi>

why hee is angry. Hee opens his face to thee in his Law, he manifests himself to thee in
the Conditions, by which he hath made thy <hi>salvation possible,</hi> and till he see thee,
in the transgression of them, he is not angry. And when he is angry so, be glad he shews
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93359:91"/>
it in his face, in his outward <hi>declarations;</hi> that fire smothered, would consume all Gods
anger reserved till the last day, will last as long as that day, as that undeterminable
day, for ever. When should we goe about to quench that fire, that never bursts out,
or to seek reconciliation, before a hostility be declared? Therefore Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> begs
this anger at Gods hands, <hi>Irascaris mihi Domine,</hi> O Lord, be angry with me; And
therefore <hi>David</hi> thanks God, in the behalf of that people, for his anger,<note place="margin">Psalm 99. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou forgavest
them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.</hi> The fires of hell, in their place,
in hell, have no light; But any degrees of the fires of Hell, that can break out in this
life, have, in Gods own purpose, so much light, as that through the darkest smother of
obduration; or desperation, God would have us see him. Therefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
makes this milder use of this phrase, that God shewes <hi>faciem irae,</hi> but <hi>non iram,</hi> that
his face of anger is rather a telling us, that hee will bee angry, then that hee is angry
yet; the corrections that God inflicts to reduce us, if wee profit not by them,
were anger <hi>Ab initio,</hi> wee shall suffer for the sinnes, from which those correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should have reduced us, and for that particular sinne, of not being reduced
by them; but if they have their effect, there was not a drop of gall, there was
not a dramme of anger in the anger. Now that that God intends in them is,
that as wee apprehend our calamities to proceed from Gods anger, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
Destiny, and Fortune, so wee apprehend that anger to proceed from
our own sinnes, and so discharge <hi>God</hi> himselfe; <hi>There is no rest in my bones because
of my sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As we are the sons of <hi>Dust,</hi> (worse, the sonnes of <hi>Death)</hi> we must say <hi>to Corruption,</hi>

                        <hi>Thou art my Father, and to the worm, Thou art my Mother,</hi> so we may say to the <hi>anger</hi> of
God, it is our <hi>grandfather,</hi> that begot these miseries, but wee must say too, to our
sinne, Thou art my <hi>great-grandfather,</hi> that begot Gods anger upon us: and here is
our wofull <hi>pedegree,</hi> howsoever wee be otherwise descended. 'Tis true, there is no
soundnesse, there is misery enough upon thee; and true, that God is angry,<note place="margin">Gregor.</note> vehemently
angry; But, <hi>Expone juststiam irae Dei,</hi> deal clearly with the world, and clear God, and
confesse it is because of thy sinne. When <hi>Cain</hi> says, <hi>My sin is greater then can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note>
that word <hi>Gnavon</hi> is ambiguous, it may bee sinne, it may bee punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and wee know not whether his impatience grew out of the horrour
of his sinne, or the weight of his punishment. But here wee are directed by
a word that hath no ambiguity; <hi>Kata</hi> signifies sin, and nothing but sinne; Here the
holy Ghost hath fixed thee upon a word, that will not suffer thee to consider the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
nor <hi>the cause of the punishment,</hi> the anger, but <hi>the cause of that anger,</hi> and all,
the sin. Wee see that the bodily sicknesse, and the death of many is attributed to
one kind of sinne, to the negligent receiving of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>For this cause many
are weak and sick amongst you, and many sleep. Imaginem judicii ostenderat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> God had
given a representation of the day of Judgement in that proceeding of his, for then
we shall see many men condemned for sinnes, for which we never suspected them:
so wee thinke men dye of <hi>Fevers,</hi> whom we met lately at the Sacrament, and God
hath cut them off perhaps for that sin of their unworthy receiving the Sacrament.
My miseries are the <hi>fruits</hi> of this Tree; Gods anger is the arms that spreads it; but the
root is sin. My <hi>sin,</hi> which is another consideration.</p>
                     <p>We say of a Possession, <hi>Transit cum onere,</hi> It passes to me,<note place="margin">Meum.</note> with the burthen that
my Father laid upon it; his debt is my debt: so does it, with the sin too; his sin, by
which he got that possession, <hi>is my sin,</hi> if I know it: and, perchance, the punishment
mine, though I know not the sin. <hi>Adams</hi> sin, 6000 years agoe, is my sin; and their sin,
that shall sinne by occasion of any wanton <hi>writings</hi> of mine, will be my sin, though
they come after. Wofull riddle; sin is but a privation, and yet there is not such another
positive possession: sin is nothing, and yet there is nothing else; I sinned in the first
man that ever <hi>was;</hi> and, but for the mercy of God, in something that I have said or
done, might sin, that is, occasion sin, in the last man that ever <hi>shall be.</hi> But that sin that
is called <hi>my sinne</hi> in this text, is that that is become mine by an <hi>habituall practise,</hi> or
mine by a <hi>wilfull relapse</hi> into it. And so <hi>my sin</hi> may kindle the anger of God, though
it bee but a <hi>single sinne, One sinne,</hi> as it is delivered here in the singular, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

we make a body of sinne; as the Apostle says of the Naturall body,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 20.</note>

hee had sinn'd vehemently, in the rage of lust, and violently, in the effusion of bloud,
and permanently in a long, and senslesse security. They are all contracted in this <hi>Text,</hi>
into two kinds, which will be our two parts, in handling these words; first, the <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressa

the succession, and so the continuation of his sin: and then, the <hi>Gravatae super,
My sins are as a heavy burden, too heavy for me,</hi> there's the greatnesse, the weight, the
insupportablenesse of his sin. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> cals these two distinctions, or considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

that he was overflowed, surrounded, <hi>his iniquities were gone over his head,</hi> and in that

then he notes <hi>Difficultatem,</hi> the hardnesse of recovering, because he that is under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
hath no aire to see by, no aire to hear by, he hath nothing to reach to, he touches
not ground, to push him up, he feels no bough to pull him up, and therein that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notes <hi>Difficultatem,</hi> the hardnesse of recovering. Now <hi>Moses</hi> expresses these two
miseries together, in the destruction of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in his song, after <hi>Israels</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> submersion, <hi>The Depths have covered them,</hi> (there's the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergressa

their heads) And then, <hi>They sank into the bottome as a stone</hi> (says <hi>Moses)</hi> there's the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vata

them, and there they must lie.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> had, <hi>David</hi> had, we have too many sins, to swim above water, and
too great sins to get above water again, when we are sunk; The number of sins then,
and the greatnesse of sin, will be our two parts; the dangers are equall, to multiply
many lesser sins, or to commit a few, more hainous: except the danger be greater,
(as indeed it may justly seem to be) in the multiplication, and custome, and habit of
lesser sins; but how great is the danger then, how desperate is our state, when our sins
are great in themselves, and multiplied too?</p>
                     <p>In his <hi>many</hi> sins, we shall touch thus many circumstances: First,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> they were <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But these, are his punishments, personall calamities, and the sins are <hi>his own</hi> sins; And
then, (which is a third circumstance) they are sins in the <hi>plurall,</hi> God is not thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
for <hi>one</hi> sin; And again, they are such sins, as have been long in going, and are now
got over, <hi>supergressae sunt,</hi> they are gone, gone over; And then lastly, for that first
part, <hi>supergressae Caput,</hi> they are gone my head. In which exaltation, is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all this; first, <hi>sicut tectum, sicut fornix,</hi> they are over his head, as a roofe, as a
cieling, as an Arch, they have made a wall of separation, betwixt God and us, so they
are above our head; And then <hi>sicut clamor,</hi> they are ascended as a noise, they are got
up to heaven, and cry to God for vengeance, so they are above our head; And again
<hi>sicut aquae,</hi> they are risen and swollen as waters, they compass us, they smother us, they
blinde us, they stupefie us, so they are above our head; But lastly and principally, <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut
Dominus,</hi> they are got above us, as a Tyran, and an usurper, for so they are above
our head too: And in these we shall determine our first part. When from thence we
come to our second part, in which, (as in this we shall have done their <hi>number</hi>) we shall
consider their <hi>greatnesse,</hi> we finde them first <hi>heavy</hi> sinne is no light matter; And then,
they are <hi>too heavy,</hi> a little weight would but ballast us, this sinkes us; Too heavy
for <hi>me,</hi> even for a man equall to <hi>David;</hi> and where is he? when is that man? for,
says our text, they are as heavy, <hi>Burden;</hi> And the nature, and incovenience
of a Burden is, first to <hi>Crooken,</hi> and bend us downward from our naturall posture,
which is erect, for this incurvation implies a declination in the inordinate love of the
Creature, <hi>Incurvat.</hi> And then the nature of a burden is, to <hi>Tyre</hi> us; our very sinne
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93359:94"/>
becomes fulsome, and wearisome to us, <hi>fatigat;</hi> and it hath this inconvenience too, <hi>ut
retardet,</hi> it slackens our pace, in our right course though we be not tried, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
goe so fast, as we should in any way towards godliness; and lastly, this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of a burden too, <hi>ut praecipitet,</hi> it makes us still apt and ready to stumble,
and to fall under it: It crookens us, it deprives us of our <hi>rectitude;</hi> it tires us, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
our alacrity; It slackens us, enfeebles and intepidates our zeale; It occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
our stumbling, opens and submits us, to every emergent tentation. And these be
the dangers, and the mischievous inconveniences, notified to us, in those two Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the holy Ghost, the <hi>supergressae,</hi> the multiplicity of sinnes, <hi>They are gone over my
head,</hi> and the <hi>gravatae, They are a heavy burden, too heavy for me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First then, all these things are <hi>literally</hi> spoken of <hi>David;</hi> By <hi>application,</hi> of us;<note place="margin">David.</note>
and by <hi>figure,</hi> of Christ. <hi>Historically, David; morally,</hi> we; <hi>Typically,</hi> Christ is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this text. In <hi>Davids</hi> person, we shal insist no longer upon them, but onely to look
upon the two generall parts, the <hi>multiplicity</hi> of his sinne, and the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>greatnesse</hi>
thereof: And that onely in the <hi>matter of Vriah,</hi> as the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Reg. 15. 5.</note> (without reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>adultery</hi> or the murder, after <hi>Davids</hi> repentance) vouchsafes to mollifie his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold,
and his hainous sinne. First, he did wrong to a loyall and a faithfull servant;
and who can hope to be well served, that does so? He corrupted that woman, who for
ought appearing to the contrary, had otherwise preserved her honour,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 18.</note> and her Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
entire; It is a sinne, <hi>To runne with a theife when thou seest him, or to have thy p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with them that are adulterers already;</hi> to accompany them in their sinne, who
have an inclination to that sinne before, is a sinne; but to solicite them, who have no
such inclination, nor, but for thy solicitation, would have had, is much more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable.
In <hi>Davids</hi> sinne, there was thus much more, he defrauded some, to whom his
love was due, in dividing himselfe with a strange woman. To steale from another man,
though it be to give to the poor, and to such poor, as would otherwise sterve, if that
had not been stollen, is injustice, is a sinne. To divide that heart, which is intirely given
to a wife, in mariage, with another woman, is a sinne, though she, to whom it is so
given, pretend, or might truly suffer much torment and anguish if it were not done.
<hi>Davids</hi> sinne flew up to a higher spheare; He drew the enemy to blaspheme the name of
<hi>God,</hi> in the victory over <hi>Israel,</hi> where <hi>Vriah</hi> was slaine: God hates nothing more in
great persons, then that prevarication, to pretend to assist his cause, and promove his
Religion, and yet underhand give the enemies of that Religion, way to grow greater.
His sinnes, indeed, were too many to be numbred; too great too, to be weighed in
comparison with others. <hi>Vriah</hi> was innocent towards him, and faithfull in his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and, at that time, in an actuall, and in a dangerous service, for his person, for
the State, for the Church. Him <hi>David</hi> betrays in his letter to <hi>Ioab;</hi> Him <hi>David</hi>
makes the instrument of his own death, by carrying those letters, the warrants of his
own execution; And he makes <hi>Ioab,</hi> a man of honour, his instrument for a murder
to cover an adultery. Thus many sinnes, and these heavy degrees of sin, were in this
one; and how many, and how weighty, were in that, of <hi>numbring of his people,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

know not. We know, that <hi>Satan</hi> provoked him to doe it; and we know, that <hi>Ioab,</hi>
who seconded and accomplished his desire in the murder of <hi>Vriah,</hi> did yet disswade,
and dis-counsell this numbring of the people, and not out of <hi>reason of State,</hi> but as an
expresse sin. Put all together, and lesse then all, we are sure <hi>David</hi> belied not himself,<note place="margin">ver. 3.</note>
                        <hi>His iniquities were gone over his head, and as a heavy burden, they were too heavy for
him;</hi> Though this will be a good rule, for the most part, in all <hi>Davids</hi> confessions
and lamentations, that though that be always literally true of himself, for the <hi>sinne,</hi>
or for the <hi>punishment,</hi> which he says, <hi>personally David</hi> did suffer, that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> in a great measure, yet <hi>David</hi> speaks <hi>prophetically,</hi> as well as
<hi>personally,</hi> and to us, who exceed him in his sins, the exaltation of those miseries, which
we finde so often in this book, are especially intended; That which <hi>David</hi> relates to
have been his own case, he foresees will be ours too, in a higher degree. And that's
our second, and our principall object of all those circumstances, in the <hi>multiplicity,</hi>
and in the <hi>hainousnesse</hi> of sin; And therefore, to that second part, these considerations
in our selves, we make thus much hast.</p>
                     <p>First then, they were <hi>peccata, sins, iniquities.</hi> And we must not think to ease our
selves in that subtilty of the School, <hi>Peccatum nihil;</hi> That sin is nothing, because sinne

him, let us finde, and lament all these <hi>numbers,</hi> and all these <hi>weights</hi> of sin. Here we
are all born to a patrimony, to an inheritance; an inheritance, a patrimony of sin;
and we are all good husbands, and thrive too fast upon that stock, upon the encrease
of sin, even to the treasuring up of sin, and the wrath of God for sin. How naked so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we came out of our mothers wombe, otherwise, thus we came all apparell'd, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell'd
and invested in sin; And we multiply this wardrobe, with new <hi>habits,</hi> habits
of customary sins, every day. Every man hath an answer to that question of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>What hast thou, that thou hast not received from God?</hi> Every man must say, I
have pride in my heart, wantonnesse in mine eyes, oppression in my hands; and that I
never receiv'd from God. Our sins are our <hi>own;</hi> and we have a covetousnesse of
more; a way, to make other mens sins ours too, by drawing them to a fellowship
in our sins. I must be beholden to the loyalty and honesty of my <hi>wife,</hi> whether my
children be mine own, or no; for, he whose eye waiteth for the evening, the adulterer,
may rob me of that propriety. I must be beholden to the protection of the <hi>Law,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my goods shall be mine, or no; A potent adversary, a corrupt Judge may rob

many things concerning <hi>Originall</hi> sin, of which he is utterly ignorant, yet of this he
would have no man ignorant, that to the guiltinesse of originall sin, our own wills con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
as well as to any actuall sin: An involuntary act, cannot be a sinfull act; and
though our will work not now, in the admitting of originall sin, which enters with our

which therefore lies upon every man now: So that that debt, <hi>Originall</hi> sin, is as much

generative, so multiplying, as debts are, especially spirituall debts, sins) for <hi>actuall sins,</hi>
they are thine, out of thine own choice; Thou mightest have left them undone, and
wouldest needs doe them; for God never induces any man into a perplexity, that is,
into a necessity of doing any particular sin. Thou couldest have disswaded a Son, or
a friend, or a servant, from that sin, which thou hast embraced thy selfe: Thou hast
been so farre from having been <hi>forced</hi> to those sins, which thou hast done, as that thou
hast been sorry, thou couldest not doe them, in a greater measure. They are thine,
thine own, so, as that thou canst not discharge thy selfe upon the <hi>Devill;</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is the propriety of thy sin; The next is the <hi>Plurality,</hi> the <hi>multiplicity, iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates;</hi>
Not onely the committing of one sin <hi>often;</hi> and yet,<note place="margin">Plural.</note> he deceives himselfe in his
account dangerously, that reckons but upon <hi>one</hi> sin, because he is guilty but of <hi>one
kinde</hi> of sin. Would a man say he had but one wound, if he were shot seven times in
the same place? Could the <hi>Iews</hi> deny, that they flead Christ, with their second or
third or twentieth blow, because they had torne skin, and flesh, with their former
scourges, and had left nothing but bones to wound? But it is not onely that, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of the same sin often, but it is the multiplicity of <hi>divers kinds</hi> of sins, that is
here lamented in all our behalfes. It is not when the conscience is tender, and afraid
of every sin,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 5.</note> and every appearance of sin. When <hi>Naaman</hi> desired pardon of God by
the Prophet, for sustaining the King upon his knees, in the house of <hi>Rimmon,</hi> the Idol,
and the Prophet bad him <hi>goe in peace,</hi> it is not that he allows him any peace under the
conscience, and guiltinesse of a sin; That was indispensable. Neither is their any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
in <hi>Naamans</hi> case, but onely a rectifying of a tender and timoruos conscience,
that thought <hi>that</hi> to be a sin, which was not, if it went no further, but to the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a <hi>Civill duty</hi> to his Master, in what place soever, Religious, or prophane, that
service of kneeling were to be done. <hi>Naamans</hi> service was truely no sin; but it had
been a sin in him to have done it, when <hi>he thought</hi> it to be a sin. And therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

                        </gap> for all that,
that thou requirest, may be done without sin. Now that tendernesse of conscience is not
in our case in the Text. He that proceeds so, to examine all his actions, may meet scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
all the way, that may give him some anxiety and vexation, but he shall never come
to that overflowing of sin, intended in this <hi>plurality,</hi> and <hi>multiplicity</hi> here. For, this
plurality, this multiplicity of sin, hath found first a spunginesse in the soul, an aptnesse
to receive any liquor, to embrace any sin, that is offered to it, and after a while, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst in the soul, to hunt, and pant and draw after a tentation, and not to be
able to endure any <hi>vacuum,</hi> any discontinuance, or intermission of sinne: and hee will
come to think it a melancholique thing, still to stand in fear of Hell; a sordid, a <hi>yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly</hi>
thing, still to be plowing, and weeding, and worming a conscience; mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
thing, still to be removing logs, or filing iron, still to be busied in removing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of tentation, or filing and clearing particular actions: and, at last he will come
to that case, which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> out of an abundant ingenuity, and tendernesse, and
compunction, confesses of himself, <hi>Ne vituperarer; vitiosior fiebam,</hi> I was fain to sin,
left I should lose my credit, and be under-valued; <hi>Et ubi non suberat, quo admisso,
aquarer perditis,</hi> when I had no means to doe some sins, whereby I might be equall
to my fellow, <hi>Fingebam me fecisse quod non feceram, ne viderer abjectior, quo innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior,</hi>
I would bely my self, and say I had done that, which I never did, lest I should
be under-valued for not having done it. <hi>Audiebam eos exaltantes flagitia,</hi> sayes that
tender blessed Father, I saw it was thought wit, to make Sonnets of their own sinnes,
<hi>Et libebat facere, non libidine facti, sed libidine laudis,</hi> I sinn'd, not for the pleasure I had
in the sin, but for the pride that I had to write feelingly of it. O what a <hi>Leviathan</hi> is
sin, how vast, how immense a body! And then, what a spawner, how numerous! Between
these two, the <hi>denying</hi> of sins, which we have done, and the <hi>bragging</hi> of sins, which we
have not done, what a space, what a compasse is there, for millions of millions of sins!
And so have you the <hi>nature</hi> of sin, which was our first; The <hi>propriety of sin,</hi> which was
our second; and the <hi>plurality,</hi> the multiplicity of sin, which was our third branch; And
follows next, the <hi>exaltation</hi> thereof; <hi>supergressae sunt, My sins are gone over my head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are, that is, they are <hi>already</hi> got above us;<note place="margin">Supergressae sunt.</note> for in that case we consider this
plurall, this manifold sinner, that he hath slipt his time of preventing, or resisting
his sins; His habits of sins are got, already got above him.<note place="margin">1 Reg. 18. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>Elisha</hi> bids his man look
towards the Sea, and he saw nothing; He bids him look again, and again to a seventh
time, and he saw nothing. After all, he sees but a little cloud, like a mans hand;
and yet, upon that little appearance, the Prophet warns the King, to get him into
his Chariot, and make good hast away, lest the rain stopp'd his passage, for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
the heaven was black, with clouds, and rain. The sinner will see nothing, till
he can see nothing; and, when he sees any thing, (as to the blindest conscience some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will appear) he thinks it but a little cloud, but a melancholique fit, and, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
(for 7 years make but an instant to that man, that thinks of himself, but once in
7 years) <hi>Supergresae sunt,</hi> his sins are got above him, and his way out is stopp'd. The
Sun is got over us now, though we saw none of his motions, and so are our sins, though
we saw not their steps. You know how confident our adversaries are in that argument,
<hi>Why doe ye oppugne our doctrine of prayer for the dead,</hi> or <hi>of Invocation of Saints,</hi> or <hi>of the
fire of Purgatory,</hi> since you cannot assigne us a time, when these doctrines came into the
Church, or that they were opposed or contradicted, when they entred? When a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
comes to that inquisition, to an <hi>iniquitates supergressae,</hi> to consider that our sins are
gone over our head, in any of those ways, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have spoken of if we offer to awaken
that conscience farther, it startles, &amp; it answers us drowsily, or frowardly, like a new wak'd
man, Can you remember when you sin'd this sin first, or did you resist it then, or since?
whence comes this troublesome singularity now? pray let me sleep still, says this start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
conscience. Beloved, if we fear not the wetting of our foot in sin, it will be too late,
when we are over head and ears. Gods deliverance of his children, was <hi>sicco pede,</hi> hee
made the sea dry land, and <hi>they wet not their foot.</hi> At first, in the creation,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>subjecit omnia
sub pedibus,</hi> God put all things under their feet; In mans wayes, in this world, his
Angels beare us up in their hands; why? <hi>Ne impingamus pedem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 8. 7.</note> that we should not
hurt our foot against a stone, but have a care of every step we make. If thou have
defiled thy feet, (strayed into any unclean ways) wash them again, and stop there, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93359:97"/>
that will bring thee to the consideration of the Spouse, <hi>I have washed my feet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>how shall I
then defile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again?</hi> I have found mercy for my former sins, how shal I dare to provoke
God w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> more? stil God appoints us a permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t means to tread sin under our feet here,
in this life; The woman, that is, the Church, hath the Moon, that is, all transitory things,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note>
(&amp; so, all tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) under her feet; As Christ himself expressed his care of <hi>Peter,</hi> to consist
in that, <hi>That if his feet were washed, all was clean;</hi> And as in his own person he admitted
nails in his feet, as wel as in his hands, so crucifie thy hands, abstain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unjust actions but
crucifie thy feet too, make not one step towards the way of Idolaters, or other sinners.
If we watch not the <hi>ingressus sum,</hi> we shall be insensible of the <hi>supergressae sunt;</hi> If we look
not to a sin, when it comes towards us, we shal not be able to look towards it, when it is
got over us: for, if a man come to walk in the counsel of the ungodly, he wil come to fit
in the seat of the scornful; for, that's the sinners progress, in the first warning that <hi>David</hi>
gives in the beginning of his 1<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> If he give himself leave to enter into sinful ways, he
wil sit &amp; sin at ease, &amp; make a jest of sin; &amp; he that loveth danger, shal perish therein. So
have you then the nature of sin; it was sin; it was sin that oppressed him; and the propriety of sin,
it was his sin, actuall sin; and the plurality of sin, habituall, customary sin and the victory
of sin, they had been long climing, and were now got up to a height; and this height &amp;
exaltation of theirs, is expressed thus, <hi>super caput, Mine iniquities are got above my head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> (who truly had either never true copy of the Bible,<note place="margin">Super caput.</note> or else cited some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
as the words were in his memory, and not as they were in the Text) he reads not
these words so, <hi>supergressae super caput,</hi> but thus, <hi>sustulerunt caput;</hi> And so he interprets
the words, not that his sins had got over his head, and depressed his head, subdued and
subjugated his head, but that they had extoll'd his head, made him life his head high,
and say, <hi>Who is the Lord? Sursum tellitur,</hi> says he upon this place <hi>cui erigitur caput contra
Deum,</hi> his head is exalted, who is set against God. And certainly, that's a desperate state
in sin, when a man thinks himself the wiser, or the better, or the more powerfull for his
sin; That he can the better stand upon his own legs, or the lesse needs the assistance of
God, because he hath prosper'd in the world, by the ways of sin. S. <hi>August</hi> is an useful
mistaking, but it is a mistaking. But to pursue the right word, and the true meaning of
this metaphoricall expressing, <hi>supergressae caput,</hi> My sins are got above my head, sin may
be got to our foot, &amp; yet not to the eye. A man may stray into company of tentations,
&amp; yet not be tempted; A man <hi>may make a covenant with his eye, that he will not see a maid.<note place="margin">Iob.</note>
                        </hi>
Sin may come to the eye, &amp; yet the hand be above water; we may look, &amp; lust, &amp; yet, by
Gods watchfull goodnes, &amp; studious mercy, escape action. But if it be above our head,
then the brain is drown'd that is, our reason, and <hi>understanding,</hi> which should dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and make us asham'd of it, or afraid of it; And our <hi>memory</hi> is drown'd, we have
forgot that there belongs a repentance to our sins, perchance forgot that there is such a
sin in us; forgot that those actions are sins, forgot that we have done those actions;
and forgot that there is a law, even in our own hearts, by which we might try, whether
our actions were sins, or no. If they be above our heads, they are so, in many dangerous
acceptations. Of which, the first is, that they cover our heads <hi>sicut tectum, sicut fornix,</hi>
as a roof, as an arch, as a separation between God and us.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>iniquities have separated between you and your God,</hi> says the Prophet.<note place="margin">Tectum. Esa. 59. 2.</note> A wall
of separation between man and man, even in the service of God, there was always; a
wall of Gods making; that is, the <hi>Ceremoniall Law,</hi> by which God enclos'd the <hi>Iews</hi>
from the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But this was but a side wall, and Christ threw it down; <hi>He is our peace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14.</note>
says the Apostle, and hath made <hi>of both one, and hath broken the stop of the partition wall;</hi>
This he did when he opened the <hi>Gentiles</hi> a way into his religion. This wall was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between the <hi>Iew,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentile,</hi> when the <hi>Iew</hi> call'd the ignominiously <hi>Incircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisos,</hi>
uncircumcised, and they call'd the <hi>Iews,</hi> with as much scorn, <hi>Recutitos,</hi> &amp; <hi>Apellas;</hi>
when the <hi>Iew</hi> wondred at the <hi>Gentises</hi> eating of unclean things, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to hear them call things, of as good nourishment, as their clean meats, uncleane;
when the <hi>Iew</hi> placed his holinesse in singularity, and ceremonies of distinction, and
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> call'd that but a pride in them, and a scornefull detestation of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
And truly it is a lamentable thing, when ceremoniall things in matter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
or problematicall things in matter of doctrine, come so farre, as to separate
us from one another, in giving ill names to one another. <hi>Zeal</hi> is directed upon God, and
charity upon our brethren, but God will not be seen, but by that spectacle; not accept
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93359:97"/>
any thing for an act of zeal to himself, that violates charity towards our brethren, by
the way. Neither should we call any man <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or <hi>Calvinist,</hi> or by any other name,
ignominiously, but for such things, as had been condemned in <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> and
condemned by such, as are competent Judges between them, and us; that is, by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall,
or by our own Church. This wall then, between the <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> (as it
was the ceremony it self, and not the abuse of it) God built, and Christ threw downe.
There are outward things, Ceremoniall things, in the worship of God, that are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
and they did serve God that brought them in, and they doe serve God also, that
have driven them out of the Church, because their undeniable abuse had clog'd them
with an impossibility of being restor'd to that good use, which they were at first ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for; of which, the brazen serpent is evidence enough. God set up a wall, which
God himself meant should be demolish'd again. Such another wal, (as well as the Devil
can imitate Gods workmanship) the Devil hath built now in the Christian Church; and
hath morter'd it in the brains &amp; bloud of men, in the sharp and virulent contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risen,
and fomented in matters of Religion. But yet, says the Spouse,<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 9.</note>

For all this separation, Christ Jesus is amongst us all, and in his time, will break downe
this wall too, these differences amongst Christians, &amp; make us all glad of that name,
the name of Christians, without affecting in our selves, or inflicting upon others, other
names of envy, and subdivision. But besides this wall of Gods making, the <hi>Ceremoniall
law,</hi> &amp; this wall of the Devils making, <hi>dissention</hi> in Christian Churches, there is a wall
of our own making, a roof, an arch above our heads, by which our continuall sins have
separated God and us. God had covered himself with a cloud, so that <hi>prayer</hi> could not
passe thorough; That was the misery of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But in the acts and habits of sin,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 44.</note> we
cover our selves, with a roof, with an arch, which nothing can shake, nor remove, but
Thunder, and Earthquakes, that is, the execution of Gods fiercest judgments; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that fall of the roof, that is, in the weight of Gods judgments upon us, the stones
shall not brain us, overwhelm and smother, and bury us, God only knows. How his
Thunders, and his Earthquakes, when we put him to that, will work upon us, he onely
knows, whether to our amendment, or to our destruction. But whil'st we are in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this arch, this roof of separation, between God and us, by sin, there may be
use in imparting to you, an observation, a passage of mine own. Lying at <hi>Ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> at <hi>Aquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grane,</hi>
a well known Town in <hi>Germany,</hi> and fixing there some time, for the benefit of
those <hi>Baths,</hi> I found my self in a house, which was divided into many families, &amp; indeed
so large as it might have been a little Parish, or, at least, a great lim of a great one; But it
was of no Parish: for when I ask'd who lay over my head, they told me a family of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists;</hi>
And who over theirs? Another family of <hi>Anabaptists;</hi> and another family of
<hi>Anabaptists</hi> over theirs; and the whole house, was a nest of these boxes; severall artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
all <hi>Anabaptists;</hi> I ask'd in what room they met, for the exercise of their Religion; I
was told they never met: for, though they were all <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> yet for some collaterall
differences, they detested one another, and, though many of them, were near in bloud &amp;
alliance to one another yet the son would excommunicate the father, in the room above
him, and the Nephew the Uncle. As S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is said to have quitted that <hi>Bath,</hi> into
which <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretique came, so did I this house; I remembred that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in
his sicknesse, turn'd himself in his bed, to pray <hi>towards that wall;</hi> that look'd to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
And that <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he pray'd in his chamber, opened those windows
that look'd <hi>towards Ierusalem;</hi> for, in the first dedication of the Temple, at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
there is a promise annext to the prayers made <hi>towards the Temple:</hi> And I began to think,
how many roofs, how many floores of separation, were made between God and my
prayers in that house. And such is this multiplicity of sins, which we consider to be
got over us, as a roof, as an arch, many arches, many roofs: for, though these habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
sins, be so of kin, as that they grow from one another, and yet for all this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
excommunicate one another, (for covetousnesse will not be in the same roome
with prodigality) yet it is but going up another stair, and there's the tother <hi>Anabaptist;</hi>
it is but living a few years, and then the prodigall becomes covetous. All the way,
they separate us from God, as a roof, as an arch, &amp; then, an arch will bear any weight;
An habituall sin got over our head as an arch will stand under any sicknesse, any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
any judgement of God, and never sink towards any humiliation.</p>

                        <hi>but I
am carnall, sold under sin,</hi> says the Apostle, even of himselfe. But when does the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
say this? in what state was hee, when he accuses himselfe of this mancipation,
and sale under sin? Says he this onely with relation to his former times, when he was
a <hi>Iew,</hi> and under the Law? Or, but then when he was newly come to the light of the
Gospel, and not to a clear sight of it? It is true, that most of the <hi>Eastern Fathers,</hi>
and it is true, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe was of that opinion, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>that he was sold under sin,</hi> respecting himself before his regeneration. <hi>Non qui
vult esse sapiens, statim fit sapiens,</hi> says <hi>Origen;</hi> A man is not presently learned, because
he hath a good desire to be learned; nor hath he that hath begun a conversion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
accomplished his regeneration; nor is he discharged of his bargain of being sold
under sin, as soon as hee sees that he hath made an ill bargain. But when he growes
up in grace, (say they) as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had done, when hee said this, then he is discharged.
But, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ingenuously retracts that opinion, which, (as he says) he had held,<note place="margin">Retract. 1. c. 23.</note>
when he was a <hi>young Priest</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> so is there nothing clearer, by the whole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Apostle in that place, then that he in his best state, was still sold under
sin. As <hi>David</hi> speaks of himself being then regenerated, <hi>In thy sight shall no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
be justified.</hi> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of himself in his best state, still he <hi>was sold under
sin,</hi> because still, that <hi>concupiscence,</hi> under which he was sold in <hi>Adam,</hi> remains in him.

it is <hi>poena peccati,</hi> says that Father, <hi>Quia reddita est meritis inobedientis;</hi> Because it is
laid upon us for that disobedience, it hath also the nature of a punishment of sin, as
well as so sin it self; And then it is <hi>Causa peccati</hi> too, <hi>Defectione consentientis,</hi> because
man is so enfeebled by this inherence, and invisceration of Originall sin, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is exposed to every emergent tentation, to any actuall sin. So, <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> is
called by many of the Ancients, the cause of sin, and the effect of sin, but not so, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively,</hi>
as that it is not sin, really sin in it self too. Now, as Originall sin causes
Actuall, in that consideration (as we sell our selves over again in our acts of recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in ratifying our first sale, by our manifold sins here) so is <hi>sin gone over our heads,</hi>
by this dominion, as a Tyran, as an usurper. <hi>Hoc lex posuit, Non concupisces;</hi>

is the Law, Thou shalt not covet: <hi>Non quod sic valcamus, sed ad quod persiciendo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus;</hi>
Not that we can perform that Law, but that that Law might be a rule to
direct our endevours: <hi>Multum boni facit, qui facit quod scriptum est, Post concupiscentias

<hi>Thou shalt not walk in the concupiscences of thine own heart; sed non perficit, quia

yet we were <hi>sold under sin,</hi> that is, sold by <hi>Adam;</hi> but because we doe not, but consent
to that first sale, in our sinfull acts, and habits, wee have <hi>sold our selves</hi> too, and so
sin is gone over our heads; in a dominion, and in a tyrannicall exercise of that dominion.
If we would goe about to expresse, by what customes of sin this dominion is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
we should be put to a necessity of entring into every profession, and every consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

man could see <hi>sin,</hi> he would <hi>hate</hi> it. But as the <hi>eye</hi> sees every thing but <hi>it

not it selfe, not the sinfull coveting and compassing of all these. To
make, though not sin, yet the <hi>sinner</hi> to see himselfe, for the explication,
and application of these words, we brought you these two lights; first, the <hi>Multiplicity</hi>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:93359:99"/>
of sin, in that elegancy of the holy Ghost, <hi>supergressae sunt, Mine iniquities are gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

burden they are too heavy for me;</hi> In the first, how <hi>numerous,</hi> how manifold they are, in
the other, how grievous, how insupportable; first, how many hands, then how
fast hold sinne lays upon me. The first of these two, was our exercise the last day,
when we proposed and proceeded in these words, in which we presented to you, the
dangerous multiplicity of sinne, in those pieces, which constituted that part. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
as men, how many soever, make but a Multitude, or a Throng, and not an
Army, if they be unarmed, so sin, how manifold, and multiform so ever, might seem a
passable thing, if it might be easily shaked off, we come now to imprint in you a sense
of the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>oppression</hi> thereof, <hi>As a heavy burthen, they are too heavy for mee;</hi> The
particular degrees whereof, we laid down the last day, in our generall division of the
whole Text, and shall now pursue them, according to our order proposed then.</p>
                     <p>First then, sinne is <hi>heavy.</hi> Does not the sinner finde it so? No marvail,<note place="margin">Gravatae.</note> nothing
is heavy in his proper place, in his own Sphear, in his own Center, when it is where
it would be, nothing is heavy. He that lies under water finds no burthen of all that
water that lies upon him; but if he were out of it, how heavy would a small quantity of
that water seem to him, if he were to carry it in a vessell? An <hi>habituall sinner</hi> is the
naturall place, the Center of sinne, and he feels no weight in it, but if the grace of
God raise him out of it, that he come to walke, and walke in the ways of godlinesse,
not onely his watery Tympanies, and his dropsies, those waters which by actuall and
habituall sinnes he hath contracted, but that water, of which he is properly made, the
water that is in him naturally, infused from his parents, <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> will be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to him, and oppresse him. Scarce any man considers the weight of Originall
sinne; And yet, as the strongest tentations fall upon us when wee are weakest, in
our <hi>death-bed,</hi> so the heavyest sinne seises us, when wee are weakest; as soon as wee
are any thing, we are sinners, and there, where there can be no more tentations mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to us, then was to the Angels that fell in heaven, that is, in <hi>our mothers womb,</hi>
when no world, nor flesh, nor Devill could present a provocation to sinne to us, when
no faculty of ours is able to embrace, or second a provocation to sin, yet there, in
that weaknesse, we are under the weight of Originall sin. And truly, if at this time,
God would vouchsafe mee my choice, whether hee should pardon me all those actuall
and habituall sins, which I have committed in my life, or extinguish Originall sinne in
me, I should chuse to be delivered from Originall sin, because, though I be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>imputation</hi> thereof, by <hi>Baptism,</hi> so that I shall not fall under a condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Originall sin onely, yet it still remains in me, and practises upon me, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
all the other sins, that I commit: now, for all my actuall and habituall sins, I
know God hath instituted meanes in his Church, the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> for
my reparation; But with what a holy alacrity, with what a heavenly joy, with what a
cheerfull peace, should I come to the participation of these meanes and seals of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and pardon of all my sins, if I knew my selfe to be delivered from Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sinne, from that snake in my bosome, from that poyson in my blood, from that
leaven and tartar in all my actions, that casts me into Relapses of those sins which I
have repented? And what a cloud upon the best serenity of my conscience, what an
interruption, what a dis-continuance from the sincerity and integrity of that joy, which
belongs to a man truly reconciled to God, in the pardon of his former sins, must it
needs be still to know, and to know by lamentable experiences, that though I wash my
selfe with Soap, and Nit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, and Snow water, mine own cloathes will defile me again,
though I have washed my selfe in the tears of Repentance, and in the blood of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
though I have no guiltinesse of any former sin upon me at that present, yet I
have a sense of a <hi>root</hi> of sin, that is not grub'd up, of <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> that will cast me
back again. Scarce any man considers the weight, the oppression of Originall sinne.
No man can say, that an Akorn weighs as much as an Oak; yet in truth, there is an
Oak in that Akorn: no man considers that Originall sinne weighs as much as Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
or Habituall, yet in truth, all our Actuall and Habituall sins are in Originall.
Therefore Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> vehement, and frequent prayer to God, to that purpose, could
not deliver him from Originall sin, and that <hi>stimulus carnis,</hi> that provocation of
the flesh, that <hi>Messenger of Satan,</hi> which rises out of that, God would give him <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93359:100"/>
grace,</hi> it should not worke to his destruction, but yet he should have it: Nay,
the infinite merit of Christ Jesus himself, that works so upon all actuall and habituall
sins, as that after that merit is applyed to them, those sins are no sins, works not so
upon Originall sin, but that, though I be eased in the <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Imputation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet the same Originall sin is in me still; and though God doe deliver me from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death, due to mine actuall and habituall sins, yet from the temporall death, due
to Originall sin, he delivers not his dearest Saints.</p>
                     <p>Thus sin is heavy in the <hi>seed,</hi> in the <hi>grain,</hi> in the <hi>akorn,</hi> how much more when it is
a <hi>field</hi> of Corn, a <hi>barn</hi> of grain, a <hi>forest</hi> of Oaks, in the multiplication, and complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sin in sin? And yet wee consider the weight of sin another way too, for as
Christ feels all the afflictions of his children, so his children will feel all the wounds
that are inflicted upon him; even the sins of other men; as <hi>Lots</hi> righteous soule was
grieved with sins of others. If others sin by my example &amp; provocation, or by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence
and permission, when I have authority, their sin lies heavyer upon me, then
upon themselves; for they have but the <hi>weight of their own sinne;</hi> and I have <hi>mine,</hi> and
<hi>theirs</hi> upon me; and though, I cannot have <hi>two souls</hi> to suffer, and though there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be two <hi>everlastingnesses</hi> in the torments of hell, yet I shall have two measures of
those unmeasurable torments upon my soul. But if I have no interest in the sins of other
men, by any occasion ministred by me, yet I cannot chuse but feel a weight, a burthen
of a holy anguish, and compassion and indignation, because every one of these sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
a new wound upon my Saviour, when my Saviour says to him, that does but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
me, <hi>Why persecutest thou me,</hi> and feels the blow upon himselfe, shall not I say to
him that wounds my Saviour, <hi>Why woundest thou me,</hi> and groane under the weight of
my brothers sin, and my Fathers, my Makers, my Saviours wound? If a man of my
blood, or allyance, doe a shamefull act, I am affected with it; If a man of my calling,
or <hi>profession,</hi> doe a scandalous act, I feel my self concerned in his fault; God hath
made all <hi>mankinde</hi> of <hi>one blood,</hi> and all <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>one calling,</hi> and the sins of every
man concern every man, both in that respect, that <hi>I,</hi> that is, <hi>This nature,</hi> is in that man
that sins that sin; and <hi>I,</hi> that is, <hi>This nature,</hi> is in that Christ, who is wounded by that
sin. The weight of sin, were it but Originall sin, were it but the sins of other men, is an
insupportable weight.</p>
                     <p>But if a sinner will take a true balance, and try the right weight of sin, let him goe
about to leave his sin, and then he shall see how close, and how heavily it stook to him.
Then one sin will lay the weight of <hi>seelinesse,</hi> of <hi>falshood,</hi> of <hi>inconstancy,</hi> of <hi>dishonour,</hi>
of ill <hi>nature,</hi> if you goe about to leave it: and another sin will lay the weight of <hi>poverty,</hi>
of <hi>disestimation</hi> upon you, if you goe about to leave it. One sin will lay your <hi>pleasures</hi>
upon you, another your <hi>profit,</hi> another your <hi>Honour,</hi> another your <hi>Duty</hi> to wife and
children, and weigh you down with these. Goe but out of the water, goe but about to
leave a sin, and you will finde the weight of it, and the hardnesse to cast it off. <hi>Grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae
sunt, Mine iniquities are heavy,</hi> (that was our first) and <hi>gravatae nimis,</hi> they are <hi>too
heavy,</hi> which is a second circumstance.</p>
                     <p>Some weight, some <hi>balast</hi> is necessary to make a ship goe steady;<note place="margin">Nimis.</note> we are not without
advantage, in having <hi>some sinne;</hi> some <hi>concupiscence,</hi> some <hi>tentation</hi> is not too heavy
for us. The greatest sins that ever were committed, were committed by them, who
had <hi>no former sinne,</hi> to push them on to that sin: The first <hi>Angels</hi> sin, and the sin <hi>of
Adam</hi> are noted to be the most desperate and the most irrecoverable sins, and they
were committed, when they had no former sin in them. The <hi>Angels</hi> punishment
is pardoned in <hi>no part; Adams</hi> punishment is pardoned in <hi>no man,</hi> in this world. Now
such sins as those, that is, sins that are never pardoned, no man commits now; not
now, when he hath the weight of former sins to push him on. Though there be a
heavy guiltinesse in <hi>Originall sin,</hi> yet I have an argument, a plea for mercy out of that,
<hi>Lord, my strength is not the strength of stones, nor my flesh brasse; Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 6. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>no man can bring
a clean thing out of uncleannesse; Lord, no man can say after, I have cleansed my heart, I
am free from sinne,</hi> I could not be borne cleane, I could not cleanse my selfe since. It
magnifies Gods glory, it amplifies mans happinesse, that he is subject to tentation.
If man had been made <hi>impeccable,</hi> that he could not have sinned, he had not been so
happy; for then, he could onely have enjoyed that state, in which he was created, and
not have risen to any <hi>better;</hi> because that better estate, is a reward of our willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93359:100"/>
to God, in such things, as we might have disobeyed him in. Therefore when
the Apostle was in danger, of growing too light, <hi>lest he should be exalted out of measure,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note>
                        <hi>through the abundance of revelation,</hi> (says that Scripture) he had a weight hung upon
him; There was something <hi>given him,</hi> therefore it was a benefit, <hi>a gift;</hi> And it was
<hi>Angelus, an Angel,</hi> that was given him; But it was not a good Angel, a Tutelar, a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Angel, to present <hi>good motions</hi> unto him, but it was <hi>Angelus Satane, a messenger of
Satan, sent,</hi> as he says, <hi>to buffet him;</hi> and yet this hostile Angel, this <hi>messenger of Satan</hi>
was a benefit, a <hi>gift,</hi> and a fore-runner, and some kind of <hi>Inducer</hi> of that <hi>Grace,</hi> which
was <hi>sufficient for him;</hi> and it would not have appeared to us, no nor to himselfe, that
he had had so much of that grace, if he had not had this tentation. God is as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
upon us when he delivers us <hi>from</hi> tentation, that it doe not overtake us; but not
so apparent, so evident, so manifest, as when he delivers us <hi>in</hi> a tentation, that it doe
not overcome us: some weight does but <hi>ballast</hi> us, as some enemies never doe us
more harme, but occasion us, to arme and to stand upon our gard. Therefore, this
weight that is complained of here, is not <hi>In carne,</hi> in our naturall flesh; (though in
<hi>that</hi> be no <hi>goodnesse)</hi> it is nothing that God from the beginning hath imprinted in our
nature, not that <hi>peceability,</hi> and <hi>possibility</hi> of sinning; nor it is not <hi>in stimule carnis,</hi> in
these accessary tentations, and provocations which awaken, and provoke the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this flesh, and put a sting into it; we doe not consider this heavy weight to be the

whet that sting, when we labour to breake hedges, and to steale wood, and gather up
a stick out of one sin, and stick out of another, and to make a fagot to load us, in this
life, and burne us in the next, in multiplying sins, and aggravating circumstances, so it is
<hi>Heavy,</hi> so it is <hi>too heavy, It is too heavy for me,</hi> (for that's also another circumstance)

he shall sink. But in this personall respect in our text we consider onely with what
weights <hi>David</hi> weighed his sins, when hee found here that they were too heavy for
him. He weighed his sin with his punishment, and in his punishment hee saw the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and <hi>indignation of God,</hi> and when we see sin through that spectacle, through an
<hi>angry God,</hi> it appears great, and red, and fearefull unto us; when <hi>David</hi> came to
see himselfe in his infirmity, in his deformity, when his body could not hear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
here in this world, he considered how insupportable a weight the sin, and the
anger of God upon that sin, would be in the world to come. For <hi>me</hi> that rise to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

for <hi>me,</hi> my sins are too heavy. Till I come to hear that voice,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Come unto me all you
that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you,</hi> till I come to consider my sin in
the mercy of God, and not onely in his justice, in his punishments, my sins will be too

is not a good <hi>end;</hi> I must <hi>stop,</hi> but not <hi>stay</hi> at it, I must consider my sin in his justice,
how <hi>powerfull</hi> a God I have provoked; but I must passe through his justice to his
mercy; his justice is my <hi>way,</hi> but his mercy is my <hi>ledging;</hi> for wee cannot tell
by the construction and origination of the words, whether <hi>Cain</hi> said, <hi>My sin is

But it needes not bee disputed; for it is all one; He that considers <hi>onely</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God in the <hi>punishment,</hi> will thinke his sin unpardonable, <hi>his sinne will be
see heavy for him.</hi> But as a <hi>feaver</hi> is well spent, when the patient is fit to take physick,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93359:101"/>
so if God give me physick, if I take his corrections as <hi>medicines,</hi> and not as <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
then my disease is well spent, my danger is well overcome; If I have buryed
my sins in the wounds of my Saviour, they cannot be too heavy for me, for they are
not upon me at all; But if I take them out again, by relapsing into them, or imagine
them to rise again, by a suspicion and jealousie in God, that he hath not forgiven
them, because his hand lies still upon me, in some afflictions, so, in such a relapse, so,
in such a jealous <hi>mis-interpretation</hi> of Gods proceeding with me, <hi>my sins are too heavy
for me;</hi> for <hi>me,</hi> because I do not sustain my self by those helps that God puts into my
hands.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>heavy, too heavy, too heavy for me,</hi> says <hi>David;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Onus.</note> if you consider the <hi>elect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
their election will not beare them out in their sins. But here we consider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportablenesse,
in that, wherein the holy Ghost hath presented it, <hi>Quia onus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it lies upon me, in the nature and quality of a <hi>Burden, Mine iniquities are as a
burden, too heavy for me.</hi> When all this is packed up upon me, that I am first under a
<hi>Calamity, a sicknesse, a scorne,</hi> an <hi>imprisonment,</hi> a <hi>penury,</hi> and then upon that calamity,
there is laid the <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>indignation of God,</hi> and then upon that, the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>mine
own sinnes;</hi> this is too much to settle me, it is enough to sinke me, it is a burden, in
which the danger arises from the last addition, in that, which is last laid on: for, as the
<hi>sceptique Philosopher</hi> pleases himselfe in that argumentation, that either a penny makes
a man rich, or he can never be rich, for says he, if he be not rich yet, the addition of a
penny more would make him rich: or if not that penny, yet another, or another, so
that at last it is the <hi>addition of a penny</hi> that makes him rich; so without any such fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or facetious circumvention in our case, it is the last addition, that that we look on
last, that makes our burden insupportable, when upon our calamity we see the anger of
God piled up, and upon that, <hi>our sin,</hi> when I come to see my sin, in that glasse, in that
glasse, not in a Saviour bleeding for me, but in a Judge frowning upon mee; when
my sins are so far off from me, as that they are the <hi>last thing</hi> that I see; for, if I would
look upon my sins, first, with a remorsefull, a tearfull, a repentant eye, either I should see
no anger, no calamity; or it would not seem strange to me, that God should bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
nor strange, that I should suffer calamities, when God is angry; Therefore is sin
heavy as a burden, because it is the last thing that I lay upon my selfe, and feel not
that till a heavy load of calamity and anger be upon me before. But then, as when we
come to be unloaded of a burden, that that was las<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> laid on, is first taken off, so when
we come, by any meanes, though by the sense of a calamity, or of the anger of God, to
a sense of our sin, before the calamity it selfe be taken off, the sin is forgiven. When
the Prophet found <hi>David</hi> in this state, the first act that the Prophet came to was the
<hi>Transtulit peccatum, God hath taken away thy sinne,</hi> but the calamity was not yet taken
away. The <hi>child</hi> begot in sin <hi>shall surely die,</hi> though the sin be pardoned. The <hi>fruit</hi>
of the tree may be preserved and kept, after the tree it selfe is cut down and burnt;
The fruit, and off spring of our sin, calamity, may continue upon us, after God hath
removed the guiltinesse of the sin from us. In the course of civility, our parents goe
out before us, in the course of Mortality, our parents die before us; In the course
of Gods mercy, it is so too; The sin that begot the calamity, is dead, and gone, the
calamity, the child, and off spring of that sin, is alive and powerfull upon us. But
for the most part, as if I would lift <hi>an iron chain</hi> from the ground, if I take but the
first linke, and draw up that, the whole chain follows, so if by my repentance, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the uppermost weight of my load, <hi>my sin,</hi> all the rest, the declaration of the
anger of God, and the calamities that I suffer, will follow my sin, and depart from me.
But still our first care must be to take off the last weight, the last that comes to our
sense, <hi>The sin.</hi>

                     <p>You have met, I am sure, in old <hi>Apophtbegms,</hi> an answer of a Philosopher celebrated,

An old Tyran;</hi> For a Tyran, at first, dares not proceed so severely; but when he

become <hi>Laws.</hi> As sin is a <hi>Tyran,</hi> so he is got <hi>over our head, in Dominie,</hi> as we shewed

and then <hi>not fall,</hi> but <hi>be cast out,</hi> out of the presence of God, and <hi>cast down,</hi> down into
an impossibility of rising, for ever, for ever, for ever. There is a lively expressing of
this deadly weight, this burden in the Prophet <hi>Zechary.</hi> First, there was a certaine ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,

first translation) <hi>This is the resemblance through all the earth,</hi> (says our second.) That
is, to this measure, and to that that is figured in it, every man must look, this every
man must take into his consideration; what is it? In this measure sate <hi>a woman whose
name was Wickednesse;</hi> At first, this woman, this wickednesse, <hi>sate up</hi> in this vessell,
she had not filled the measure, she was not laid securely in it, she was not prostrate, not
groveling, but her nobler part, <hi>her head,</hi> was yet out of danger, <hi>she sate up in it.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Vision departs, she is plunged wholly into that measure; (into <hi>darknesse,</hi> into
<hi>blindnesse)</hi> and not for a time; for, then, <hi>there was a cover,</hi> (says the text) and <hi>agreat
cover,</hi> and <hi>a great cover of Lead put upon that vessell;</hi> and so, a perpetuall imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no hope to get out; and <hi>heavy fetters,</hi> no ease to be had within; Hard ground
to tread upon, and heavy burdens to carry; first a <hi>cover,</hi> that is, an <hi>excuse; a great cover,</hi>
that is, a <hi>defence,</hi> and a <hi>glory;</hi> at last, <hi>of Lead;</hi> all determines in <hi>Desperation.</hi> This is
when the multiplicity and indifferencie to lesser sins, and the habituall custome of some
particular sin, meet in the aggravating of the burden: for then,<note place="margin">Iob 6. 3.</note> they are <hi>heavyer then
the sand of the Sea,</hi> says the holy Ghost: where he expresses the greatest weight by the
least thing; Nothing lesse then a graine of <hi>sand,</hi> nothing <hi>heavyer then the sands of
the Sea,</hi> nothing easier to resist then a <hi>first tentation,</hi> or a <hi>single sinne</hi> in it selfe, nothing
heavyer, nor harder to devest, then <hi>sinnes complicated</hi> in one another, or then <hi>an old
Tyran,</hi> and <hi>custome</hi> in any one sin. And therefore it was evermore a familiar phrase
with the <hi>Prophets,</hi> when they were to declare the sins, or to denounce the punishments
of those sins upon the people, to call it by this word, <hi>Onus visionis, Onus Babylonis,
Onus Ninives, O the burden of Babylon, the burden of Niniveh.</hi> And because some of
those <hi>woes,</hi> those <hi>Iudgements,</hi> those <hi>burdens,</hi> did not always fall upon that people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
they came to mock the Prophets, and say to them, <hi>New, what is the burden of

unto them, says God to the Prophet there; <hi>This is the Burden of the Lord,

added, <hi>Every mans word shall be his burden;</hi> That which he <hi>says,</hi> shall be that that

and of the denouncing of his Judgements in that Ordinance shall be their
burden, that is, aggravate those Judgements upon them, Nay, there is a heavyer
weight then that, added; <hi>Ye shall say no more</hi> (says God to the Prophet) <hi>the burden of the
Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">ver. 38.</note> that is, you shall not bestow so much care upon this people, as to tell them, that
the Lord threatens them. Gods presence in anger, and in punishments, is a heavy, but
Gods absence, and dereliction, a much heavyer burden; As (if extremes will admit
comparison) the everlasting losse of the fight of God in hell, is a greater torment,
then any lakes of inextinguishable Brimstone, then any gnawing of the incessant worme,

leades us, most probably, to thinke) he made Paradise, and placed man in Paradise
that day. For the variety of opinions amongst our Expositors, about the time when
God made Paradise, arises from one errour, an errour in the <hi>Vulgat Edition,</hi> in the
translation of the Roman Church, that reads it <hi>Plantaver at, God had planted a garden,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 8.</note>
as though God had <hi>done it before.</hi> Therefore some state it before the Creation, which

(an active man in the <hi>Councell of Trent)</hi> hath done over the <hi>Book of Psalms,</hi> in which
one Booke he hath confessed 6000 places, in which their translation differs from the

in that day, <hi>He walked in the garden in the cool of the Evening.</hi> The noblest
part of our work, in handling this Text falls upon the conclusion, reserved for this

day; which is, the application of these words to <hi>Christ.</hi> But for that, I shall be short,
and rather leave you to <hi>walke with God in the cool of the Evening,</hi> to meditate of the
sufferings of Christ, when you are gone, then pretend to expresse them here. The <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>

be upwards, to <hi>honour</hi> that he affects, yet it is still down-ward, in respect of him, whom
he was made by, and should direct himselfe to. Every inordinate love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a descent from the dignity of our Creation, and a disavowing', a disclaiming
of that Charter, <hi>Subjicite &amp; dominamini, subdue, and govern the Creature. Est quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

world, which it is a sin for man to love, <hi>Quia infra illam ordinantur,</hi> because though
they <hi>be good,</hi> they are not <hi>so good</hi> as man; And man may not decline, and every thing,
except God himself, is inferiour to man, and so, it is a <hi>declination,</hi> a <hi>stooping</hi> in man,
to apply himselfe to any Creature, till he meet that Creature in God; for there, it is
above him; And so, as <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> are beames that issue from
God, and glasses that represent God to us, and idea's that return us into him, in our
glorifying of him, by these helpes, so we may apply our selves to them; for, in this
consideration, as they assist us in our way to God, they are above us, otherwise, to
love them for themselves, is a <hi>declination, a stooping</hi> under a <hi>burden;</hi> And this <hi>decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
this incurvation, this descent of man, in the <hi>inordinate love of the Creature,</hi> may
very justly seem to be forbidden in that Commandement, that forbids <hi>Idolatry, Thou

is, the love of money, is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> says the Apostle; and so is all other inordinate love
of any, Idolatry. And then, as we have seen some grow crooked, by a long sitting,
a lying in one posture, so, by an easie resting in these descents and declination of the
soule, it comes to bee a fashion to stoop, and it seemes a comely thing to be crooked;

yet wee proceed in it. How often men goe to <hi>Westminster,</hi> how often to the

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93359:103"/>
                        <hi>We have wearied our selves in the ways of wickednesse; Plus miles in uno

a soldier suffers more in one expedition, then a Monk does, in ten years, says he, and
perchance he says true, and yet no commendation to his Monke neither; for that
soldier may doe even the cause of God, more good, in that one expedition, then
that Monke in ten years: But it is true as <hi>Holkot</hi> intended it, (though perchance
his example doe not much strengthen it) vicious men are put to more pains, and
to doe more things against their own mindes, then the Saints of God are in the
ways of holinesse. <hi>We have wearied our selves in the ways of wickednesse,</hi> says he, that
is, in doing as other wicked men have done, in ways which have been beaten out

we have done; we are wearied with our sins, and have no satisfaction in them; we goe

little does he consider to <hi>morrow?</hi> He that forgets what he hath <hi>done,</hi> foresees not what
he shall suffer: so sin is a burden, it crookens us, it wearies us; And those are the
two first inconveniences.</p>
                     <p>And then a third is <hi>Retardat.</hi> Though a man can stand under a burden, that he doe
not sink, but be able to make some steps, yet his burden slackens his pace, and he goes
not so fast, as without that burden he could have gone. So it is an <hi>habituall sinnes;</hi>
though we doe not sinke into <hi>desperation,</hi> and <hi>stupefaction,</hi> though we doe come to
the participation of outward means, and have some sense, some feeling thereof, yet,<note place="margin">Retardat.</note> as
long as any one beloved and habituall sin hangs upon us, it slackens our pace in all the
ways of godlinesse. And we come not to such an appropriation of the promises of the
Gospel, in <hi>hearing Sermons,</hi> nor to such a <hi>re-incarnation,</hi> and invisceration of Christ
and his merits into our selves, in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> as if wee were altogether devested of
that sin, and not onely at that time, we should doe. <hi>Quis ascendes,</hi> says <hi>David;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 24. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>who
shall ascend unto the hill of the Lord?</hi> It is a painfull clambring; up a hill. And Saint
<hi>August.</hi> makes use of the answer, <hi>Innocens manibus, He that hath clean hands;</hi> first, he
must have <hi>hands,</hi> as well as <hi>feet;</hi> He must <hi>doe</hi> something for himself; And then, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
hands; such as doe no harme to others, such as hold, and carry no hurtfull
thing to himself; Either he must have the first Innocence, <hi>Abstinence</hi> from ill get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or the second Innocence, <hi>Restitution</hi> of that which was ill gotten, or he shall
never get up that hill; for, it is a steep hill, and there is no walking up, but he must
crawle, <hi>hand and foot.</hi> Therefore, says the Apostle, <hi>Deponamus pondus, Let us lay aside
every weight;</hi> He does not say, sin in <hi>generall,</hi> but <hi>every weight, every circumstance</hi> that
may aggravate our sin, every conversation that may occasion our sin; And, (as hee
addes, particularly and emphatically) <hi>The sin, that does so easily beset us; Easily,</hi> because
<hi>customarily,</hi> habitually; And then, says that Apostle, in that place, <hi>Let us run;</hi> when
we have laid down <hi>the sin, that does so easily beset us,</hi> our beloved and habituall sinne,
and laid down <hi>every weight,</hi> every circumstance that aggravates that sin, then we may
be able to run, to proceed with a holy chearfulnesse and proficiency in the wayes of
<hi>sanctification;</hi> but till that we cannot, how due observers soever we be of all outward
means; for, sin is a burden, in <hi>perverting</hi> us, in <hi>tyring</hi> us, in <hi>retarding</hi> us.</p>
                     <p>And last of all, it is a burden, <hi>quaetenus praecipitat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Praecipitat.</note> as it gives him ever new occasion

of <hi>stumbling;</hi> He that hath not been accustomed to a sin, but exercised in resisting it,
will finde many <hi>tentations,</hi> but as a <hi>wash way</hi> that he can <hi>trot</hi> thorough, and goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     </p>

received that commendation, that no man went ever out of his presence disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
so our gracious God never admits us to his presence in this his Ordinance, but
with a purpose to dismisse us in heart, and in comfort; for, his Almoner, he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributeth
his mercies to Congregations, is the <hi>God of comfort, of all comfort,</hi> the holy
Ghost himself. Nay, they whom he admits to his presence here, goe not out of his
presence, when they goe from hence; He is with them, whilst they stay here, and hee
goes home with them, when they goe home. Princes out of their Royall care call
<hi>Parliaments,</hi> and graciously deliver themselves over to that Representative Body;
God out of his Fatherly love calls <hi>Congregations,</hi> and does not onely deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
over, in his <hi>ordinance,</hi> to that Representative Body, the whole <hi>Church</hi> there, but
when every man is become a private man again, when the Congregation is dissolv'd,
and every man restored to his own house, God, in his Spirit, is within the doores,
within the bosomes of every man that receiv'd him here. Therefore we have reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for the conclusion of all, the application of this Text to our <hi>blessed Saviour;</hi> for
so our most ancient Expositors direct our meditations, first, <hi>historically,</hi> and <hi>literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
upon <hi>David,</hi> and that we did at first; Then <hi>morally,</hi> and by just application to
our selves, and that we have most particularly insisted upon; And lastly, upon our
Saviour <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> himself; and that remains for our conclusion and consolation; for,
even from him, groaning under our burden, we may hear these words, <hi>Mine iniquities
are gone over my head, and, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 4.</note> and they mistook

to put him to grief;</hi> And the Lord proceeds not thus, where he sees no sin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle carries it to a very high expression, <hi>God made him to be sin for our sakes;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note>
not onely <hi>sinfull,</hi> but <hi>sin</hi> it self. And as one cruell Emperour wished all mankinde in
one man, that hee might have beheaded mankinde at one blow, so God gathered the
whole nature of sinne into one Christ, that by one <hi>action,</hi> one <hi>passion, sin,</hi> all <hi>sin,</hi> the
whole nature of sinne might bee overcome. It was sin that was upon Christ, else
God could not have been angry with him, nor pleased with us.</p>
                     <p>It was sin, and <hi>his own sin; Mine iniquities,</hi> says Christ, in his <hi>Type,</hi> and <hi>figure,<note place="margin">Sua.</note> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
and in his <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>Church;</hi> and, (we may be bold to adde) in his <hi>very person;

Mine iniquities.</hi> Many Heretiques denied his body, to be <hi>his Body,</hi> they said it was
but an <hi>airy,</hi> an <hi>imaginary,</hi> an <hi>illusory Body;</hi> and denied <hi>his Soul</hi> to be <hi>his Soul,</hi> they
said he had no <hi>humane soul,</hi> but that his divine nature supplied that, and wrought all
the operations of the soul. But we that have learnt Christ better, know, that hee
could not have redeemed <hi>man,</hi> by that way that was contracted betweene him and
his Father, that is, by way of <hi>satisfaction,</hi> except he had taken the very body, and the
very soul of man: And as verily as his <hi>humane nature,</hi> his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> were <hi>his, his
sins</hi> were <hi>his</hi> too. As my mortality, and my hunger, and thirst, and wearinesse, and all
my <hi>naturall infirmities</hi> are his, so <hi>my sins</hi> are his sins. And now when my sins are by
him thus made <hi>his</hi> sins, no Hell-Devill, not <hi>Satan,</hi> no Earth-Devill, no <hi>Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
can any more make those sins <hi>my</hi> sins, then he can make <hi>his divinity, mine.</hi> As

I am no sinner in the sight of God, no sinner so, as that man or the Devill can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

so manifold, so plurall, so numerous, as my sins; And my Saviour had <hi>all</hi> those. But if
every other man have not so many sins, <hi>as I,</hi> he owes that to <hi>Gods grace,</hi> and not
to the Devils forbearance, for the Devill saw no such parts, nor no such power
in me to advance or hinder his kingdome, no such <hi>birth,</hi> no such <hi>education,</hi> no such
<hi>place</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> as that he should be gladder of me, then of other men.
He ministers tentations to <hi>all;</hi> and all are overcome by his tentations; And all these
sins, in all men, were upon Christ at once. All <hi>twice over;</hi> In the <hi>root,</hi> and in the

and in <hi>Actuall sin.</hi> And, howsoever the sins of <hi>former ages,</hi> the sins of all men for
4000 years before, which were all upon him, when he was upon the Crosse, might
possibly be numbred, (as things that are <hi>past,</hi> may easilier fall within a possibility of
such an imagination) yet all those sinnes, which were to come after, he himself
could not number; for, hee, <hi>as the Sonne of man,</hi> though hee know how long the
world <hi>hath lasted,</hi> knowes not how long this sinfull world <hi>shall last,</hi> and when
the day of Judgement shall be; And all those <hi>future sins,</hi> were his sins before they
were committed; They were <hi>his</hi> before they were <hi>theirs</hi> that doe them. And lest
<hi>this world</hi> should not afford him sins enow, he took upon him the sins of <hi>heaven</hi> it
self; not <hi>their</hi> sins, who were <hi>fallen</hi> from heaven, and fallen into an absolute incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of reconciliation, but their sins, which <hi>remained</hi> in heaven; Those sins, which

but this inundation of all the sins of all places, and times, and persons, was upon

                     <p>And,<note place="margin">Caput.</note> in that consideration, <hi>supergressae caput,</hi> they were <hi>gone over his head.</hi> Let
his <hi>head</hi> bee his <hi>Divine nature,</hi> yet they were gone over his <hi>head:</hi> for, though
there bee nothing more <hi>voluntary,</hi> then the <hi>love of God</hi> to man, (for, he loves us, not
onely for <hi>his own</hi> sake, or for <hi>his own glories</hi> sake, but he loves us <hi>for his loves sake,</hi>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:93359:104"/>
he loves us, and <hi>loves his love of us,</hi> and had rather want some of his glory, then
<hi>wee</hi> should not have, nay, then <hi>he</hi> should not have so much love towards us) though
this love of <hi>his</hi> be an act simply voluntary, yet in that act of expressing this love,
in the sending a <hi>Saviour,</hi> there was a kinde of necessity contracted on Christs part;
such a contract had passed between him and his Father, that as himself says, there
was an <hi>oportuit pati,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luc. 24.</note> a necessity that he should <hi>suffer</hi> all that he suffered, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into glory, when he was come; so there was an <hi>oportuit venire</hi> a necessity, (a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
induced by that contract) that he should <hi>come</hi> in that humiliation, and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and suppresse the glory of the divine nature, under a cloud of humane, of
passible, of inglorious flesh.</p>
                     <p>So,<note place="margin">Tectum.</note> be his <hi>divine</hi> nature this head, his sins, all our sins made <hi>his,</hi> were gone <hi>above his

tectum, sicut fornix,</hi> as a <hi>roof,</hi> as an <hi>arch,</hi> that had separated between God, and <hi>him,</hi> in
that he <hi>prayed,</hi> and was not <hi>heard;</hi> when in that <hi>Transeat Calix, Father, if it be possible,
let this cup passe from me,</hi> the Cup was not onely not taken out of his hands, but filled
up again as fast, as he, in obedience to his Father, dranke of it, more and worse mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
succeeding, and exceeding those which hee had born before. They were above
him <hi>in clamore,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Clamor.</note> in that voice, in that clamour which was got up to heaven, and in
possession of his Fathers ears, before his prayer came, <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi> for
they are not forgiven <hi>that</hi> sinne of crucifying the Lord of life, <hi>yet.</hi> They were
above his head,<note place="margin">Aquae.</note> 
                        <hi>tanquam aquae,</hi> as an inundation of waters, then when he <hi>swet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and bloud,</hi> in the Agony, when hee, who had formerly passed his <hi>Israel</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> as though that had not been <hi>love</hi> large enough, was now him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
overflowed with a <hi>Red Sea</hi> of his owne bloud, for his <hi>Israel</hi> again. And they
were over his head <hi>in Dominio,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dominium,</note> in a Lordship, in a Tyranny, then when those
marks of soveraign honour, a <hi>robe,</hi> and a <hi>scepter,</hi> and a <hi>Crown of thorns</hi> were added
to his other afflictions. And so is our first part of this Text, the <hi>supergressae sunt,</hi> the
<hi>multiplicity</hi> of sin, appliable to Christ, as well as to his Type, to <hi>David,</hi> and to
us, the members of his body.</p>
                     <p>And so is the last part,<note place="margin">Graves.</note> that which we handled to day, too, the <hi>gravata sunt,</hi>
the weight and insupportablenesse of sin. They were heavy, they weighed him down
from his Fathers bosome, they made <hi>God Man.</hi> That <hi>one</hi> sin could make an <hi>Angel</hi> a
<hi>Devill,</hi> is a strange consideration; but that all the sins of the world, could make
<hi>God Man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nimis.</note> is stranger. Yet sinne was so heavy; <hi>Too heavy,</hi> sayes the Text. It did
not onely make <hi>God Man;</hi> in investing our nature by his <hi>birth,</hi> but it made him <hi>no
Man,</hi> by devesting that body, by <hi>death;</hi> and, (but for the vertue, and benefit of a
former <hi>Decree)</hi> submitting that body, to the corruption, and putrefaction of the
grave; But this was the peculiar, the miraculous glory of Christ Jesus. He had
<hi>sin, all</hi> our sin, and yet never felt <hi>worme of conscience;</hi> He lay dead in the grave,
and yet never felt <hi>worm of corruption.</hi> Sin was <hi>heavy;</hi> It made <hi>God Man;</hi> Too <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;</hi>
It made <hi>Man</hi> no <hi>Man;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mihi.</note> Too heavy <hi>for him,</hi> even <hi>for him,</hi> who was God and
Man together; for, even that person, so composed, had certain <hi>velleitates,</hi> (as wee
say in the <hi>School)</hi> certain motions arising sometimes in him, which required a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtamen,</hi>
a review, a re-consideration, <hi>Not my will, O Father, but thine be done;</hi>
and such, as in us, who are pushed on by <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> and drawn on by sinfull
concupiscences in our selves, would become sins, though in Christ they were farre
from it. Sin was heavy, even upon <hi>him,</hi> in all those inconveniences, which wee
noted in a burden;<note place="margin">Onus.</note> 
                        <hi>Incurvando,</hi> when he was bowed down, and gave his back to
their scourges; <hi>Fatigando,</hi> when <hi>his soul was heavy unto death; Retardando,</hi> when
they brought him to think it long, <hi>Viquid dereliquisti, Why hast thou forsaken mee?</hi>
And then, <hi>praecipitando,</hi> to make that haste to the <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> to the fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing

as though he were better able to stand without the support of some of those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
then stand under the debt, which so many, so great benefits laid upon him:
Truly he that considers seriously, what his sins have put the Son of God to, cannot but
say, <hi>Lord lay some of my sinnes upon me, rather then thy Sonne should beare all this;</hi> that
devotion, that says after, <hi>Spare thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

that must be shed to redeeme us. And rather then Christ should truely, <hi>really</hi> beare
the torments of <hi>hell,</hi> in his <hi>soule,</hi> (which torments cannot be severed from <hi>obduration,</hi>
nor from <hi>everlastingness)</hi> I would, I should desire, that my sins might return to me, and
those punishments for those sins; I should be ashamed to be so farre exceeded in zeal,
by <hi>Moses,</hi> who would have been <hi>blotted out of the book of life,</hi> or by <hi>Paul,</hi> who would
have been <hi>separated from Christ for his brethren,</hi> as that I would not undertake as much,
<hi>to redeem my redeemer,</hi> and suffer the torments of Hell my selfe, rather then <hi>hee</hi> should;
But it is an insupportable burden of <hi>debt,</hi> that he hath laid upon me, by suffering
that which he suffered,<note place="margin">Idem.</note> without the torments of Hell. Those words, <hi>Vis sanus

were of this race, <hi>Esay</hi> was of a higher, for he was of the extraction of their
Kings, of the bloud royall. But the extraordinary greatnesse of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
depth, and mysteriousnesse, for this is one of those parts of Scripture, (as
the beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the Canticles of <hi>Solomon,</hi> also are) which are forbid to
be read amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> till they come to be <hi>thirty</hi> years old, which was the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall</hi>
age to be made Priests; In so much, that Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> says, when he comes
to expound any part of this Prophet, <hi>Noctunum iter ago,</hi> that he travelled by night,
and did but ghesse at his way. But, besides that many of the obscure places of the
Prophets are more open to <hi>us,</hi> then they were to the <hi>ancients,</hi> because many of those
prophecies are now fulfilled, and so that which was <hi>Prophecy</hi> to them, is <hi>History</hi> to us,
in this place, which we have now undertaken, there never was darknesse, not difficulty,
neither in the first emanation of the light thereof, nor in the reflection; neither in the
<hi>Literall,</hi> nor in the <hi>Figurative</hi> sense thereof; for the literall sense is plainly that, that
amongst the manifold oppressions, under which the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> languished in
<hi>Babylon,</hi> this was the heaviest, that their own <hi>Priests</hi> joyned with the <hi>State</hi> against them,
and infused pestilent doctrines into them, that so themselves might enjoy the favour
of the State, and the people committed to their charge, might slacken their obedience
to <hi>God,</hi> and surrender themselves to <hi>all</hi> commandements of <hi>all men;</hi> This was their
oppression, the <hi>Church</hi> joyned with the <hi>Court,</hi> to oppresse them; Their own <hi>Priests
gave these sheep grasse which they had troden with their feet, (doctrines,</hi> not as <hi>God</hi> gave
them to them, but as <hi>they</hi> had tampered, and tempered them, and accommodated
them to serve <hi>turnes,</hi> and fit their <hi>ends;</hi> whose servants they had made themselves,
more then <hi>Gods)</hi> And they gave them <hi>water</hi> to <hi>drink which they had troubled with
their feet,</hi> that is, doctrines mudded with other <hi>ends</hi> then the glory of <hi>God;</hi> And that
therefore <hi>God</hi> would take his sheep into his own care, and reduce them from that
double oppression of that <hi>Court,</hi> and that <hi>Church,</hi> those Tyrannous <hi>officers,</hi> and those
over-obsequious <hi>Priests.</hi> This is the <hi>literall</hi> sense of our text, and context, evident
enough in the letter thereof. And then the <hi>figurative</hi> and <hi>Mysticall</hi> sense is of the same
oppressions, and the same deliverance over againe in the times of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the
<hi>Christian Church;</hi> for that's more then figurative, fully literall, soon after the Text,

Gods deliverance of his <hi>Israel,</hi> from the persecutions in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> insist
we now, upon the severall metaphors of the Text, as the holy Ghost continues them
to the <hi>whole</hi> reigne of Christ, and so to the <hi>Reformation.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Ier. 12. 20.</note> as that they <hi>ploughed iniquity, and sowed wickednesse, and reaped
the same;</hi> and (as <hi>God</hi> himselfe complaines) <hi>trod his portion under foot;</hi> That is, first,
neglected his <hi>people,</hi> (for Gods people are his <hi>portion</hi>) And then whatsoever pious
men had given to the Church, is his <hi>portion</hi> too, and that portion they had troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot; not neglected it, not despised it, for they collected it, and audited it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
enough, but they trod it under foot, when that which was given for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation
of the Priest, they turned upon their own splendour, and glory, and surfet:
Christ will be fed in the poor that are hungry, and hee will be cloathed in the poore
that are naked, so he would be enriched in those poor Ministers that serve at his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
when Christ would be so fed, he desires not feasts and banquets; when he would
be so cloathed, hee desires not soft rayment fit for <hi>Kings houses,</hi> nor embroyderies,
nor perfumes; when he would be enriched in the poor <hi>Church-man,</hi> he desires not
that he should be a spunge, to drinke up the sweat of others, and live idly; but yet,
as he would not be starved in the hungry, nor submitted to cold and unwholesome
ayre in the naked, so neither would he be made contemptible, nor beggerly in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of his Church. Nor, was there in the world, (take in Turky, and all the heathen)
(for they also have their <hi>Clergy)</hi> a more contemtible &amp; more beggerly <hi>Clergy</hi> then that
of Rome; I speak of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in the most proper sense, that is, they that minister, they
that officiate, they that execute, they that personally &amp; laboriously do the service of
the Church. The <hi>prelacies,</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> of the Church, were multiplyed in the hands
of them, who under pretext of <hi>Government,</hi> took their ease, and they that labored, were
attenuated &amp; macerated, with lean, &amp; penurious <hi>pensions.</hi> In the best governed Churches
there are such <hi>Dignities,</hi> &amp; supplies without <hi>Cure of soules,</hi> or personall service; but they
are intended <hi>for recompence of former labours,</hi> and sustentation of their age, of whose
youth, and stronger days, the Church had received benefit. But in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
these preferments are given almost in the wombe; and children have them not onely
before they can merit them, but before they can <hi>speake</hi> for them; and they have some
Church-names, Dean, or Bishop, or Abbat, as soon almost as they have any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
names.</hi> Yea, we know many Church dignities, entailed to noble families, and, if
it fall void, whilest the child is so incapable, it must be held <hi>for</hi> him, by some that must
resigne it, when it may, by any extent of dispensation, be asked for him. So then the
<hi>Church</hi> joyned with the <hi>State,</hi> to defraud the people; The Priest was poorly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so the people poorely instructed. And this is the first conformity between the
<hi>two Babylons,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean</hi> and the <hi>Italian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pursue we then the <hi>holy Ghosts</hi> purpose and manner of implying,<note place="margin">Gramen.</note> and expressing it
the food ordained for sheep, <hi>Grasse.</hi> In which make we onely these two stops, that the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93359:106"/>
sheep are to eate their grasse <hi>super terram,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Super ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</note> upon the ground; And they are to eate it
<hi>sinerore,</hi> when the dew is off. First, upon <hi>the ground;</hi> that is, where the hand of <hi>God</hi>
hath set it; which for spirituall food is the <hi>Church.</hi> In hard winters we give sheep hay,
but in open times open grasse. In <hi>persecutions</hi> of Tyrans, in <hi>Interdicts</hi> of Antichristian
Bishops, who sometimes out of passion, or some secular respect shut up Church dores
and forbid service, and Sacraments, to whole Cities, to whole nations, sheep must
live by <hi>hay,</hi> Gods Children must relieve themselves at home, <hi>by books</hi> of pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
meditation; But when <hi>God</hi> affords abundant pastures, and free entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
Gods sheep are to take their grasse upon the <hi>ground,</hi> Gods grace at the Church.
<hi>Impossibile est eum corrigere, qui omnia scit, Chrysost:</hi> It is an impossible thing to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
him, that thinks he knows all things already. As long as he will admit counsaile
from another, he acknowledges the other, to know more then he; but if he thinks, he
knows all before, he hath no room for farther instruction, nor love to the place where
it is to be had. We read in the <hi>Eastern Histories,</hi> of a navigable River, that afforded
all the inhabitants exportation, and importation, and all commerce. But when every
particular man, to serve his own curiosity, for the offices of his house, for the pleasures
of his gardens, and for the sumptuousnesse of Grots and aqueducts, and such water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
drew severall channells, infinite channells our of this great River, this exhausted
the maine channell, and brought it to such a shallownesse, as would beare no boats,
and so, took from them the great and common commodities that it had afforded
them. So if every man think to provide himselfe <hi>Divinity</hi> enough <hi>at home,</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and his family, and out of laziness and singularity, or state, or disaffection to the
preacher leave the <hi>Church</hi> unfrequented, he frustrates the Ordinance of God, which
is, that his sheep should come to his pastures, and take his grasse upon his ground, his
instructions at his house at <hi>Church.</hi> And this we could not doe in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
where all our prayers, and all Gods service of that kinde, were in a language, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not understood by him that <hi>heard</hi> it, but for the most part, not by him that <hi>spoke</hi> it,
It is not of their manifold, and scornfull, and ridiculous and histrionicall <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
in their service, nor of the dangerous poysons, the direct <hi>Idolatries</hi> (in the practise of the
people) in their service, that we complain of now, but of this, that though it had
been never so wholesome grasse, it was not so to those sheep, they could not know it
to be their proper aliment, for certainly they aske without <hi>faith,</hi> that aske without
<hi>understanding;</hi> nor can I beleeve or hope that God will give me that I aske, if I know
not <hi>what</hi> I asked. And what a miserable supply had they for this in their <hi>Legends;</hi> for
many of those Legends were in vulgar tongues and understood by them.<note place="margin">B. Virgo femora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia. B. Tho. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuar, veparavit. Cantiprat. l. 2. c. 29.</note> In which Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends,
the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was every good mans wife, and every good womans mid-wife,
by a neighborly, and familiar, and ordinary assistant in all houshold offices, as we see
in those Legends, and revelations. In which Legends, they did not onely <hi>faine actions,</hi>
which those persons never did, but they <hi>fained persons</hi> which never were; and they
did not onely <hi>mis-canonize</hi> men, made Devils Saints, but they <hi>mis-christened</hi> men,
put names to persons, and persons to names that never were. And these <hi>legends</hi> being
transferred into the Church, the sheep lacke their grasse upon the ground, that is, the
knowledge of Gods will, in his house, at Church. And this is another conformity
between the <hi>two Babylons,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and the <hi>Italian Babylon,</hi> that the sheep lacked
<hi>due food</hi> in the <hi>due place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So is it also,<note place="margin">Ros super gramen.</note> that the sheep eat their grasse, whilest the <hi>Dew</hi> was upon <hi>it,</hi> which
is found by experience to be unwholesome. The word of God is our grasse, which
should be delivered purely, simply, sincerely, and in the naturall verdure thereof. The
<hi>Dews</hi> which we intend, are <hi>Revelations, Apparitions, Inspirations, Motions,</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations</hi>
of the <hi>private spirit.</hi> Now, though we may see the naturall dew to descend
from heaven, yet it did first ascend from the earth, and retains still some such earthly
<hi>parts,</hi> as sheep cannot digest. So howsoever these Revelations and Inspirations seem
to fall upon us from heaven, they arise from the earth, from our selves, from our own
<hi>melancholy,</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> or our too much <hi>homelinesse</hi> and familiarity in our accesses, and
conversation with God, or a <hi>facility</hi> in beleeving, or an often <hi>dreaming</hi> the same thing.
And with these Dews of Apparitions and Revelations, did the <hi>Romane Church</hi> make
our fathers drunk and giddy; And against these does S. <hi>Augustine</hi> devoutly pray,
and praise God, that he had delivered him from the curiosity of sipping these dews, of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93359:107"/>
hearkning after these apparitions and revelations. But so ordinary were these appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>then,</hi> as that any son, or nephew, or friend, could discern his fathers, or uncles,
or companions soul, ascending out of <hi>Purgatory</hi> into heaven, and know them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
as if they kept the same haire, and beard, and bodily lineaments, as they had
upon earth. And as a ship which hath struck Sail, will yet goe on with the winde
it had before, for a while, so now, when themselves are come to acknowledge, That
it was the unanime opinion of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Maldon.</note> that the souls of the dead did not appeare
after death, but that it was still the <hi>Devil,</hi> howsoever sometimes that that he proposed
were holy &amp; religious,<note place="margin">Coccius.</note> yet we see a great Author of theirs attribute so much to these
apparitions, and revelations, that when he pretends to prove all controversies by the
<hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church, he every where intermingles that reverend <hi>Book,</hi> of <hi>Brigids
Revelations,</hi> that they might also have some <hi>Mothers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> too; which is
not disproportionall in <hi>that</hi> Church; if they have had a <hi>woman Pope,</hi> to have Mothers
of the Church too. I speak not this, as though God might not, or did not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
his will by <hi>women;</hi> The great mystery of the Resurrection of Christ was revealed
to women before men; and to the sinfullest woman of company, first. But I speak
of that bold injury done to the mysteries of the Christian Religion, by pouring out
that dew upon the grasse, the <hi>Revelations</hi> of S. <hi>Brigid,</hi> upon the controversies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
A book of so much blasphemy, and impertinency, and incredibility, that if
a Heathen were to be converted, he would sooner be brought to beleeve <hi>Ovids Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoses,</hi>
then <hi>Brigids Revelations,</hi> to conduce to Religion. And this is also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conformity between the two <hi>Babylons,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and the <hi>Italian Babylon,</hi> that
we could not receive our grasse pure, but infected, and <hi>dewed</hi> with these frivolous, nay
pernicious <hi>apparitions,</hi> and <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But press we a little closer to the very steps,<note place="margin">Gramen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcatum.</note> &amp; metaphor of the holy Ghost, who here
lays the corrupting of the sheeps grasse in this, <hi>That the shepheards had troden it down.</hi>
And this <hi>treading</hi> down will be pertinently considered two ways. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his
Book <hi>De habitu muliebri,</hi> notes two excesses in womens dressing; One he cals <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
the other <hi>cultum;</hi> One <hi>mundum muliebrem,</hi> the other, (according to the liberty
that he takes in making words) <hi>Immundum muliebrem;</hi> the first is a <hi>superfluous dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
in their dressing, but the other an <hi>unnaturall addition</hi> to their complexion; the
first he pronounces to be always <hi>ad ambitionem,</hi> for <hi>pride,</hi> but the other, <hi>ad prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi>
for a worse, for the worst purpose. These two sorts of Excesses doe note
these two kindes of treading down the grasse, which we intend; of which one is, the
mingling of too much <hi>humane ornament,</hi> and secular <hi>learning</hi> in <hi>preaching,</hi> in presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the word of God, which word is our grasse; The other is of mingling <hi>humane
Traditions,</hi> as of things of equall value, and obligation, with the Commandements of
God. For the first, <hi>humane ornament,</hi> if in those pastures, which are ordain'd for
sheep, you either plant rare and curious flowers, delightfull onely to the eye, or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
and odoriferous hearbs delightfull onely to the smell, nay, be they medicinall
hearbs, usefull, and behovefull for the preservation, and restitution of the health of
man, yet if these specious and glorious flowers, and fragrant, and medicinall hearbs,
be not proper nourishment for sheep, this is a <hi>treading down</hi> of the grasse, a peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and a suppressing of that which appertained to them. So if in your spirituall
food, our preaching of the Word, you exact of us more secular ornament, then may
serve, as <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> says, <hi>Ad ancillationem,</hi> to convey, and usher the true word of
life into your <hi>understandings,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> (for both those must necessarily be
wrought upon) more then may serve <hi>ad vehiculum,</hi> for a chariot for the word of God
to enter, and triumph in you, this is <hi>a treading down of the grasse,</hi> a filling of that
ground which was ordained for sheep, with things improper, and impertinent to them.
If you furnish a <hi>Gallery</hi> with stuffe proper for a Gallery, with <hi>Hangings</hi> and <hi>Chairs,</hi> and
<hi>Couches,</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> it gives you all the conveniencies of a Gallery, walks and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and ease; but if you pester it with improper and impertinent furniture, with
<hi>Beds,</hi> and <hi>Tables,</hi> you lose the use, and the name of a <hi>Gallery,</hi> and you have made it
a <hi>Wardrobe;</hi> so if your curiosity extort more then convenient ornament, in delivery
of the word of God, you may have a good <hi>Oration,</hi> a good <hi>Panegyrique,</hi> a good <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miastique,</hi>
but not so good a <hi>Sermon.</hi> It is true that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applies sentences of
secular Authors, even in matters of greatest importance; but then it is to persons that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93359:107"/>
were accustomed to those authors, and affected with them, and not conversant, not
acquainted at all, with the phrase and language of Scripture amongst us now, almost
every man (God be blessed for it) is so accustomed to the text of Scripture, as that
he is more affected with the name of <hi>David,</hi> or Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> then with any <hi>Seneca</hi> or
<hi>Plutarch.</hi> I am far from forbidding secular ornament in divine <hi>exercises,</hi> especially in
some <hi>Auditories,</hi> acquainted with such learnings. I have heard men preach against witty
preaching; and doe it with as much wit, as they have; and against learned preaching,
with as much learning, as they could compasse. If you should place that <hi>beast,</hi> which
makes the <hi>Bezoar stone,</hi> in a pasture of pure, but onely grasse, it is likely, that out of
his naturall faculty, he would petrifie the juyce of that grasse, and make it a stone, but
not such a medicinall stone, as he makes out of those herbes which he feeds upon. Let
all things concur in the name of God, to the advancing of his purpose, in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which is, to make his will <hi>acceptable</hi> to you, by his word; onely avoid excesse
in the manner of doing it. Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> is an excellent rule, when after in his book
<hi>De Doctrina Christiana,</hi> he had taught a use of all Arts in Divinity, he allows them onely
thus far, <hi>ut cum ingenia his reddantur exercitatiora, cavendum ne reddantur maligniora,</hi>
that when a man by these helps is the more ful, and the more ready &amp; the more able for
Church service, he be not also thereby made the more bold and the more confident; <hi>Nec
ament decipere verisimili sermone,</hi> lest because he is able to make any thing seem probable
and likely to the people, by his eloquence, he come to infuse paradoxicall opinions, or
schismaticall, or (which may be beleeved either way) problematicall opinions, for certain
and constant truths, and so be the lesse conversant, and the lesse diligent in advancing
plaine, and simple, and fundamentall doctrines and catechisticall, which are truely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation, as though such plaine, and ordinary, and catechisticall doctrines
were not worthy of his gifts and his great parts. In a word, in <hi>sheep-pastures</hi> you may
plant fruit trees in the <hi>hedge-rowes;</hi> but if you plant them all over, it is an <hi>Orchard;</hi> we
may transfer flowers of secular learning, into these exercises; but if they consist of
those, they are but <hi>Themes,</hi> and <hi>Essays.</hi> But why insist we upon this? Was there any
such conformity between the two <hi>Babylons</hi> as that the <hi>Italian Babylon</hi> can be said to
have troden down the grasse in that kinde, with overcharging their Sermons with <hi>too
much learning.</hi> Truly it was far, very very far from it; for when they had prevailed
in that Axiome, and Aphorisme of theirs, that it was best to keep the <hi>people</hi> in <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
they might justly keep <hi>the Priest</hi> in ignorance too; for when the people needed
<hi>no learned instruction,</hi> what needed the Church a <hi>learned instructer?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I laid hold of this consideration, the treading down of grass, by oppressing
it with secular learning, there by to bring to your remembrance, the extreme ignorance
that damp'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, at that time; where <hi>Aristotles Metaphysicks</hi> were
condemned for Heresie,<note place="margin">Hosius.</note> and ignorance in generall made not onely pardonable, but
meritorious. Of which times, if at any time, you read the Sermons, which were then
preached, and after published, you will excuse them of this treading down the grass,
by oppressing their auditories with <hi>over-much learning,</hi> for they are such Sermons as
will not suffer us to pity them, but we must necessarily scorne, and contemne, and
deride them; Sermons, at which the gravest, and saddest man could not choose but
laugh; not at the Sermon, God forbid; nor at the plainness, and homeliness of it;
God forbid; but at the Soloecismes, the barbarismes, the servilities, the stupid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of those things which fall within the knowledge of boys of the first forme in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
School. This was their treading down of grass, not with over-much learning, but
with a cloud, a dampe, an earth of ignorance. After an <hi>Oxe</hi> that oppresseth the grass,
after a <hi>Horse</hi> that devours the grass, sheep will feed; but after a <hi>Goose</hi> that stanches the
grass, they will not; no more can Gods sheep receive nourishment from him that puts
a scorne upon his function, by his ignorance.</p>
                     <p>But in the other way of treading down grass,<note place="margin">Conculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum per tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones.</note> (that is, the word of God) by the
Additions and Traditions of men, the <hi>Italian Babylon Rome</hi> abounded, superaboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
overflowed, surrounded all. And this is much more dangerous then the other;
for this mingling of humane additions, and traditions, upon equall necessity, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
obligation as the word of God it selfe, is a kneading, an incorporating of <hi>grasse
and earth</hi> together, so, as that it is impossible for the weake sheep, to avoid eating the
meat of the <hi>Serpent,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Dust shalt thou eate all the days of thy life.</hi> Now man upon his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93359:108"/>
transgression, was not accursed, nor woman; The sheep were not accursed; But the
earth was, and the Serpent was; and now this kneading, this incorporating of earth
with grasse, traditions with the word, makes the sheep to eate the cursed meat of the
cursed Serpent, <hi>Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, in this treading down this grasse, this way, this suppressing it by traditions,
be pleased to consider these <hi>two applications;</hi> some traditions doe destroy the word
of God,<note place="margin">Scicut Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</note> extirpate it, annihilate it, as when a <hi>Hog</hi> doth root up the grass; In which
case, not onely that turfe withers, and is presently useless, and unprofitable to the
sheep, but if you dig never so low after, down to the Center of the earth, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
ever to finde any more grass under it: so some traditions doe utterly oppose the
word of God, without having under them, any mysterious signification, or any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or provocation of our devotion, which is the ordinary pretext of traditions, and
<hi>Ceremoniall additions</hi> in their Church. And of this sort was that amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi>
of which our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> reproches them,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> that whereas by the law, children were
to relieve decayed parents, they had brought in a tradition, of <hi>Commutation,</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,</hi>
that if those children gave a <hi>gift</hi> to the <hi>Priest,</hi> or compounded with the Priest,
they were discharged of the former obligation. And of this sort are many traditions
in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> where, not onely the doctrines of <hi>men</hi> but the doctrine of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills,</hi>
(as the Apostle calls the forbidding of <hi>Mariage,</hi> and of <hi>meats)</hi> did not onely
tread down,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> but root up the true grass.</p>
                     <p>The other sort of Traditions,<note place="margin">Sicut Talpa.</note> and Ceremonies, doe not as the Hog, root up the
grass, but as a <hi>Mole,</hi> cast a slack, and thin earth upon the face of the grass. Now, if
the shepheard, or husbandman be present to scatter this earth againe, the sheep receive
no great harme, but may safely feed upon the wholesome grass, that is under; but if
the sheep, who are not able to scatter this earth, nor to finde the grass that lies under, be
left to their own weakness, they may as easily starve in this case, as in the other; the
<hi>Mole</hi> may damnifie them as much as the <hi>Hog.</hi> And of this sort, are those traditions,
which induce <hi>Ceremonies</hi> into the Church, in <hi>vestures,</hi> in <hi>postures</hi> of the body, <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
things, and words, and actions, in Baptisme or Mariage, or any other thing to
be transacted in the Church. These ceremonies are not the institutions of <hi>God</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
but they are a kind of light earth, that hath <hi>under it</hi> good and usefull signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which when they be understood conduce much to the encrease and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our devotion, and of the glory of God. And this is the iniquity that we
complaine of in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that when we accuse them of multiplying imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
and insupportable ceremonies, they tell us, of some mysterious and pious signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
in the institution thereof at first; They tell us this, and it is sometimes true;
But neither in Preaching nor practise, doe they scatter this earth to their own sheep, or
shew them the grass that lies under, but suffer the people, to inhere, and arrest their
thoughts, upon the ceremony it selfe, or that to which that ceremony mis-leads them;
as in particular, (for the time will not admit many examples) when they <hi>kneel at the
Sacrament,</hi> they are not told, that they kneel because they are then in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an inestimable benefit at the hands of God, (which was the first reason of kneeling
then) And because the <hi>Priest</hi> is then in the act of <hi>prayer</hi> in their behalfe, that that may
preserve them, in body and soule, unto eternall life. But they are suffered to go one, in
kneeling in adoration of that <hi>bread,</hi> which they take to be God. We deny not that there
are <hi>Traditions,</hi> nor that there must be <hi>ceremonies,</hi> but that matters of <hi>faith</hi> should depend
of these, or be made of these, that we deny; and that they should be made equall to
<hi>Scriptures;</hi> for with that especially doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> reproch the Heretiques, that being
pressed with Scriptures, they fled to Traditions, as things equall or superiour to the
word of God. I am loth to depart from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> both because he is every where a
Patheticall expresser of himselfe, and in this point above himselfe. <hi>Nobis curiositate
opus non est, post Iesum Christum, nec Inquisitione, post Evangelium.</hi> Have we seen that
face of Christ Jesus here upon earth, which Angels desired to see, and would we see
a better face? Traditions perfecter then the word? Have we read the four <hi>Evangelists,</hi>
and would we have a better Library? Traditions fuller then the word? <hi>Cum credimus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
nihil desideramus ultra credere;</hi> when I beleeve God in Christ, dead, and risen againe
according to the Scriptures, I have nothing else to beleeve; <hi>Hoc enim prius credimus,
non esse quod ultra credere debeamus;</hi> This is the first Article of my Faith, that I am
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93359:108"/>
bound to beleeve nothing but articles of faith in an equall necessity to them. Will we be
content to be well, and thank God, when we are well? <hi>Hilary</hi> tells us, when we are
well; <hi>Bene habet quod iis, quae scripta sunt, contentus sis;</hi> then thou art well, when thou
satisfiest thy self with those things, which God hath vouchsafed to manifest in the
<hi>Scriptures. Si aliquis aliis verbis, quàm quibus à Deo dictum est, demonstrare velit,</hi> if any
man will speake a new language, otherwise then God hath spoken, and present new
Scriptures, (as he does that makes traditions equall to them) <hi>Aut ipse non intelligit,
aut legentibus non intelligendum relinquit,</hi> either he understands not himself, or I may
very well be content not to understand him, if I understand God without him. The
<hi>Fathers</hi> abound in this opposing of Traditions, when out of those traditions, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
argue an insufficiency in the Scriptures. <hi>Solus Christus audiendus,</hi> says Saint
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> we hearken to none but Christ; <hi>nec debemus attendere quid aliquis ante nos
faciendum putarit,</hi> neither are we to consider what any man <hi>before us</hi> thought fit to be
done, <hi>sed quid qui ante emnes est, fecerit;</hi> but what he, who is <hi>before all</hi> them, did; <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> who were not onely the primitive but the <hi>pre-primitive Church,</hi>
did and appointed to be done. In this treading down of our grasse then in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, first by their supine <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and barbarisme, and then by <hi>traditions,</hi> of
which, some are pestilently iufectious and <hi>destroy</hi> good words, some <hi>cover</hi> it so, as
that not being declared to the people in their signification, they are uselesse to
them, no <hi>Babylon</hi> could exceed the <hi>Italian Babylon, Rome,</hi> in treading down their
grasse.</p>
                     <p>Their oppression was as great in the other,<note place="margin">Aqua. Psal. 23. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>In troubling their water, My sheep drink that
which you have troubled.</hi> When the Lord is our shepherd, he leadeth us <hi>ad aquas qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudinum,</hi>
to the waters of rest, of quietnesse; of these, in the <hi>plurall, quietudinum,</hi>
quietness of <hi>body,</hi> and quietness of <hi>Conscience</hi> too. The endowments of heaven are <hi>Ioy,</hi>
and <hi>Glory;</hi> joy, and glory are the two Elements, the two Hemispheres of Heaven;
And of this Joy, and this Glory of heaven, we have the best <hi>earnest</hi> that this world can
give, if we have <hi>rest;</hi> satisfaction and acquiescence in our religion, for our beleefe, and
for our life and actions, peace of Conscience. And where the Lord is our shepherd
he leads us, and <hi>ad aquas quietudinum,</hi> to the waters of rest, multiplyed rest; all kind
of rest. But the shepherds, in our text, <hi>troubled</hi> the waters; and more then so; for we
have just cause to note the <hi>double</hi> signification of this word, which we translate <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and to transfer the two significations to the two Sacraments, as they are exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the <hi>Roman Babylon;</hi> The word is <hi>Mirpas;</hi> and it denotes not onely <hi>Contur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationem,</hi>
a troubling, a mudding, but <hi>Obturationem</hi> too, an interception, a stopping,
as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> translates it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 35. and in these two significations of the word,
a <hi>troubling,</hi> and a <hi>stopping</hi> of the waters, hath the <hi>Roman</hi> Church exercised her tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and her malignity, in the <hi>two Sacraments. For,</hi> in the Sacrament of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> they
had <hi>troubled</hi> the water, with <hi>additions</hi> of Oile, and salt, and spittle, and exorcismes;
But in the <hi>other</hi> Sacrament of they came <hi>Ad obturationem,</hi> to a stopping, to an intercisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to an interruption of the water, the water of life, <hi>Aquae quietudinum,</hi> the water of
rest to our souls, and peace to our consciences, in <hi>withholding the Cup</hi> of salvation, the
bloud of Christ Jesus from us.<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 12.</note> So that if thou come to <hi>Davids</hi> holy expostulation,
<hi>Quid retribuam, what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me;</hi> And
pursue it to <hi>Davids</hi> holy resolution, <hi>Accipiam Calicem,</hi> I will take the <hi>Cup</hi> of salvation,
you shall be told, Sir you must take <hi>Orders</hi> first, or you cannot take that Cup. But
water is as common as Aire; And as that Element Aire, in our spirituall food, that
is preaching, (which is <hi>Spiritus Domini,</hi> the breath of God) is common to all, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Sacrament, common to all, <hi>Bibite ex eo omnes, Drink yee all of this;</hi> and thereby
doe the names of <hi>Communion,</hi> and participation accrew to it, because all have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in it. This is that bloud, of which Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> says, <hi>Hic sanguis facit, ut
Imago Dei in nobis floreat;</hi> That we have the Image of God in our souls, we have by
the benefit of the same nature, by which we have our souls; There cannot be a humane
soule without the Image of God in it. But, <hi>ut floreat,</hi> that this Image <hi>appear to us,</hi>
and be continually <hi>refreshed</hi> in us, <hi>ut non Languescat animae nobilitas,</hi> that this holy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of the soule doe not languish not degenerate in us, we have by the benefit of
this bloud of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the seale of our absolution in that blessed and glorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93359:109"/>
And that bloud they deny us. This is that bloud of which they can
make as much as they will, with a thought, with an intention; so, as they pretend a
power, of changing a whole vintage at once, all the wine of all the nations in the
world, into the bloud of Christ, if the Priest have an <hi>intention</hi> to doe so, in the time of
his Consecration; And yet, as easily as they come by it, they will givesus none. They
have told us, that we had it <hi>per Concomitantiam,</hi> by a necessary concomitancy; That
because we had the body in the bread, and that body could not be without the bloud,
that therefore we had the bloud also. But if the bread alone be enough, if the Cup be
impertinent, why did Christ give it? If we have no losse in their detaining it from us,
what gain have they in retaining it to themselves, let all have it, or none? It is true
that they can performe all the <hi>ill,</hi> that they would doe, by the <hi>bread</hi> alone. They can
worke the spirituall ill, of inducing <hi>adoration</hi> to a Creature, by the bread alone; And
they could work the temporall ill, of <hi>poysoning an Emperour</hi> in the Sacrament, by the
bread alone. They can come to all their purposes, to all <hi>their ill,</hi> by the bread alone,
but we have not all <hi>our good,</hi> because we have not Christs intire Institution. And so
in this troubling, and in this stopping of these waters, in these confusions, we challenge
any <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the behalfe of this <hi>Italian Babylon, Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All these oppressions are aggravated by the last,<note place="margin">Pedes.</note> and (as weightiest things sink to
the bottome) so is this in the bottome the heaviest pressure, that they did this with
<hi>their feet,</hi> they corrupted the grasse with their <hi>feet,</hi> and troubled the waters with their
<hi>feet.</hi> Now in the Scriptures, when this word, <hi>feet,</hi> doth not signifie that part of
mans body which is ordinarily so called, but is transferred to a <hi>Metaphoricall significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
(as in our text it is) it does most commonly signifie <hi>Affections,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 9.</note> or <hi>Power.</hi> So the
<hi>Lord will keep the feet</hi> of his Saints; that is, direct their <hi>desires,</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> in the
ways of holinesse. And then for <hi>Power,</hi> (which is the more frequent acceptation of the
word) he will not suffer <hi>thy foot</hi> to be moved, that is, thy <hi>power</hi> to be shaked; And
all such places, <hi>qui festinus,</hi> he hath hasteth with <hi>his feet</hi> sinneth, our interpreters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of a hasty abuse of <hi>Power;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 121. 3.</note> And those, they have not refrained <hi>their feet,</hi> and
then,<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>thy feet</hi> are sunk in the mire, are still interpreted of <hi>Power,</hi> of a wonton abuse of
Power,<note place="margin">Ier. 14. 10. 38. 22.</note> or of a withdrawing this Power from man, <hi>by God; feet</hi> signifies Affections,
and them corrupted and depraved, and power, and that abused. <hi>David</hi> seems to have
joyned them, (as when they are joyned, they must necessarily be the most heavy) in
that prayer,<note place="margin">Psal. 36. 11.</note> Let not <hi>the foot of pride</hi> come against me. The <hi>hand</hi> of pride, nay the <hi>sword</hi>
of pride, affects not a tender soule so much, as the <hi>foot</hi> of pride; to be oppressed, and
that with <hi>scorne;</hi> not so much in an <hi>anger,</hi> as in a <hi>wantonnesse. Rehoboams people</hi> were
more confounded, with that scornfull answer of his to them, when they were come,
<hi>(My little finger shall be thicker then my Fathers loynes; my father chastised you with

                        <note place="margin">1 King. 12. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>but I will chastise you with Scorpions)</hi> then they were with the grievances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for which they came; when the King would not onely be <hi>cruelly</hi> sharp, but
<hi>wittily</hi> sharp upon them, this cut on every side, and pierced deep. And so doe the
<hi>Rabbins,</hi> the Jewish expositors expound this text, literally, that in the captivity of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
the great men of their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> compounded with the State, and for certain
tributes, had commissions, by which they governed their people at their pleasure, and so
milked them to the last drop, the last drop of bloud, and sheared them to the naked skin,
&amp; then flead off that, &amp; al this while <hi>laughed</hi> at them, contemned them, because they had
no where, to appeal, nor relieve themselves: And this we complain to have been the
proceeding in the <hi>Italian Babylon, Rome,</hi> with our Fathers, <hi>They</hi> oppressed them, with
their <hi>feet,</hi> that is, with <hi>Power,</hi> and with <hi>scorne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">Pes-potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> for their illimited and enormous <hi>Power,</hi> they had so slumbred, so intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Princes of the Earth, the weaker by intimidations, the stronger by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the spoile, and suffering those Princes to take some fleeces, from some of the
sheep in their dominions, as there was no reliefe any way. They record, nay they boast,
gloriously, triumphantly, of <hi>three score thousand of the Waldenses, slain by them in a day,</hi>
in the beginning of the Reformation; and <hi>Possevine</hi> the Jesuit will not lose the glory
of recording the <hi>five hundred thousand,</hi> slain in a very few years, onely in <hi>France,</hi> and
the <hi>low Countrey,</hi> for some declarations of their desire of a Reformation. Let all those
innumerable numbers of wretches, (but now victorious Saints in the Triumphant
Church) who have breathed out their souls in the <hi>Inquisition</hi> (where even the solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93359:109"/>
of Kings, and that for their own sons, have not prevailed) confess the power, the
immensness of that power, then, when as under some of the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> it was
treason to weep, treason to sigh, treason to look pale, treason to fall sicke, and all these
were made arguments of discontent, and ill affection, to the present government: so in
<hi>Rome,</hi> there were Hereticall sighes, Hereticall teares, palenesse, and Hereticall
sicknesse; every things was interpreted to be an accusation of the present times, and an
anhelation after a Reformation, and that was formall heresie, three pil'd, deep-died
heresie: so that a man durst scarce have prayed for the enlarging of Gods blessings
to the Church, because to with it better, seemed a kind of accusing of it, that it was
not well already; and it was heresie to thinke so. Let those <hi>Israelites,</hi> which found no
way from this <hi>Egypt,</hi> but by <hi>the red sea,</hi> no way out of Idolatry, but by <hi>Martyrdome,</hi>
as they have testified for Christ, so testifie against Antichrist, how heavy his feet, as
feet signifie Power, trod upon the necks of Princes and people.</p>
                     <p>But that that affected and afflicted most,<note place="margin">Pessuperbiae.</note> was the <hi>scorne</hi> and the <hi>contempt,</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
their oppressions. To bring Kings to <hi>Kisse his feet,</hi> was a scorne; but that
scorne determined in man; but it was a scorne to <hi>God</hi> himselfe, to say that he had said,
it should be so, to apply Scripture to the justification thereof, <hi>Kings and Queens shall
bow down to thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay. 49. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>their faces towards the Earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet.</hi> But limit we
all considerations of their scorne in one; In this, that they did these wrongs professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without any disguise. Great men will oppress and ruine others, a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will be content to be seen and known to doe it. There is such a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
not onely to <hi>Law,</hi> but even <hi>to honour,</hi> and <hi>opinion,</hi> as that men are lothe to
<hi>publish</hi> their evill actions; To sinne as <hi>Sodome</hi> did, and not to <hi>hide</hi> it, is an evidence,
of neglecting, and scorning of all the world. And therefore the <hi>Roman Historiographers</hi>
would not forbeare to note the insolency of that young gallant, who knowing what
any man whom he strook could recover by action against him, would strike every poor
soul or inferiour person, whom he met in the street and then bid his man give him so
much money, as the Law would for damages. And this oppressing with scorne, this
proceeding without any respect of fame, we note (for hast) but in two things, in the
<hi>Italian Babylon Rome;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Taxa ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merae.</note> first, in that <hi>Book,</hi> their <hi>Taxa Camerae,</hi> and then in that doctrine,
their <hi>Reservatio Casuum,</hi> that they durst compose, and divulge such a book, as their,
<hi>Taxa Camerae,</hi> which is an <hi>Index,</hi> a Repertory for all sinnes, and in which every man
may see beforehand, how much money, an Adultery, an Incest, a Murder, a Parricide,
or any other sinne, whose name he would never have thought of, but by that Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer,
that book will cost him, that so, he may sinne, and not undoe himself, sinne
according to his means, and within his compasse, that they durst let the world see such
a book, was argument enough that they were fear'd up, and scorned all that all men
could think, or say, or doe in opposition.</p>
                     <p>So also is their Reservation of Cases; that though all Priests have an equall power
of remitting all sins,<note place="margin">Reservatio casuuim.</note> yet are some sinnes reserved onely to <hi>Prelates,</hi> some onely to the
Popes <hi>Legats,</hi> some onely to the Pope <hi>himselfe.</hi> Is not this a scornfull spurning and
kicking of the world, a plain telling them that all is done for money, and shall be so,
say all the world what it can. They have a nationall custome in civill curtesies in that
place in <hi>Italy,</hi> to offer entertainments and lendings of money, and the like, but it must
not be accepted. It is a discurtesie, to take their courteous offers in earnest.
Will they play so with the great Seale of heaven, the remission and absolution of sins,
and send out their Priests with that commission, <hi>whose sinnes yee forgive, are forgiven,</hi>
but see you forgive none upon which we have set a higher price, and reserved to our
selves. They had such a fashion in old <hi>Rome,</hi> whilest the Republique stood; He that
was admitted to Triumph must <hi>invite</hi> the Consuls to the feast, and the Consuls must
<hi>promise</hi> to come, but they must forbeare, lest their presence should diminish the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Triumpher. So the Priest must professe that he hath (as he hath indeed)
power to remit all sinnes, but there are a great many, that he must not meddle withall.
They practise this reservation upon higher persons then their ordinary Priests, upon
<hi>Cardinals.</hi> A Cardinall is created, and by that creation he hath a voice in all the great
affairs of the world, but at his creation <hi>Os clauditur à Papa,</hi> he that made him, makes
him dumbe, and he that out of the nature of his place is duly to be heard over all the
world, must not be heard in the Consistory, the Pope gives him an universall voice,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93359:110"/>
and then shuts his mouth; He makes him first a <hi>Giant,</hi> and then a <hi>dwarfe</hi> in an houre;
He makes him thunder, and speechlesse, all at once; fearfull to the Kings of the
earth, if he might speak, but he must not. They were not content to make <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize</hi>
of our souls, but they make <hi>plays, jests, scornes,</hi> of matter of salvation, and play
fast and loose with that soveraign <hi>Balsamum</hi> of our souls, the absolution and remission
of sins. Though, no doubt, many of them confess in their own bosomes, that which one
of them professes ingenuously,<note place="margin">Tapperus.</note> and publiquely, <hi>Diffiteri non possumus abusum Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum,</hi>
                        <hi>&amp; stragem animarum in iis;</hi> we cannot deny the abuse of reservations, even to
the butchery of those poor souls, who, by reason of these reservations, want their abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<hi>Dolendum, deflendum, pecuniâ numeratâ, omnia dispensare;</hi> This deserves all
our teares, all our sighs, that for money, and not without it, all sinnes are dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
withall; but there are <hi>fixed seasons for salvation,</hi> (some remissions and pardons
are reserved to certain times of the year) and there are <hi>fixt shops of salvation,</hi> (some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
and pardons are appropriated to certain Fairs and Markets, and cannot be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
(that is sold) at any other time, or place. And farther we cannot (we need not)
extend this accommodation of the words of our text, literally intended of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods Children in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but pregnantly appliable to the condition of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the <hi>Italian Babylon, Rome.</hi> But having at this time seen the oppressions that
those shepheards inflicted there, for the rest which are many and important conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as first that they staid, that they eate that grasse, that yet they remained Gods
sheep, and remained his flock, his Church, though a Church under a greater Church;
And then the behaviour of the sheep, whilst they staid there, their obedience to Gods
call in comming from them when he called them, and made them way; And lastly
the little ground that our Separatists can have, for their departing from us either by
<hi>Israels</hi> departing from <hi>Babylon,</hi> or our Fathers departing from <hi>Rome,</hi> must be the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of your devotion another day.</p>

now in this exercise are we to consider, the <hi>behaviour of the sheep,</hi> their

steps to goe; All these; first, <hi>Manebant,</hi> that for all this ill usage there they did stay,
they did not breake out, not scatter themselves, <hi>manebant;</hi> And then <hi>Edebant,</hi> though
their grasse were troden, and their water troubled, yet they did <hi>eat</hi> that grasse, and they

which <hi>bad</hi> been mine, when they eat fresh grasse, and drunke pure water, but then,
when they eat troden grasse, and drunke troubled water, they were Gods sheep; And
more then that, they were <hi>Grex Dei, Gods flock;</hi> for those whom our former translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
calls my <hi>sheep,</hi> the latter calls my <hi>flock;</hi> God hath <hi>single sheep</hi> in many corners of
the <hi>heathen,</hi> but these, though thus fed, were his <hi>flock,</hi> his <hi>Church.</hi> But then, though
they staid Gods leasure, and lived long upon this ill diet, yet when God was pleased to
call them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> out of <hi>Babylon</hi> they went, when God was pleased to lead
our <hi>Fathers</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> they left it. And justly, howsoever our Adversaries load us
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93359:110"/>
with contumelious names for that departure; in which branch, we shall see the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their criminations, and imputations to us for that secession from them. And
then lastly, by way of condoling and of instructing, we shall make it appear to our
weak brethren, that our departing from Rome, can be no example, no justification
of their departing from us. Our branches then, from whence we are to gather our
fruit, being thus many, it is time to lay hold upon the first, which is <hi>Manebant,</hi>
Though these sheep were thus ill fed, yet they did stay.</p>

turned from the Reformed to the Roman religion, being asked, halfe in jest; Sir,
which is the best religion, you must needs know, that have been of both? answered,
Certainely, the religion I left, the <hi>reformed religion,</hi> must needs be the best religion,

Neither truely doth any thing more loosen a mans footing, nor slacken his hold
upon that Church in which he was baptized, nor open him more to an undervalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all Churches, then when he gives himselfe leave, to thinke irreverently,
slightly, negligently of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as of things, at best, <hi>indifferent,</hi> and, many

heare the Sonne of my friend, who brought me to that place, to minister the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and <hi>ceremoniall</hi> assistances of devotion, which the wisdome, and the piety of the
Church hath induced, but even the <hi>Sacraments themselves,</hi> of Christs owne
immediate institution, and are alwaies open to solicitations to passe to another
Church, upon their own surmises of errours in their own. Whereas there belongs
much consideration, and a well grounded assurance, of fundamentall errours in one
Church, and that those errours are repayred, and no other, as great as those, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
in the other Church, before, upon any collaterall pretences, we abandon
that Church, in which God hath sealed us to himselfe in Baptisme. Our Fathers

well or no, alasse how should they devest and overcome that scruple? To whom
durst they communicate that doubt? They were under an invincible ignorance, and
sometimes under an indevestible scruple. They had heard that Christ commanded

upon every occasion, he reiterate that name, though he aggravate that name
with other names of equall reproach, <hi>Fools, blinde guides, painted tombes,</hi> and the
like, yet he commands to obey them; and, which is most remarkable, this is sayd,
not onely to the common sort, but even to <hi>his own disciples</hi> too; Christ had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne
his work of establishing a Church, which should empty their Synagogues;
but because that worke was not yet perfected, he would not withdraw the people
from their Synagogues; for there <hi>wrought Gods Ordinance,</hi> (though corrupted by
the workmen) which Ordinance was, that the law should be publiquely expounded
to the people; and so it was there; There God was present; And though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
(by their corruption) were there too, yet, the Devill came in at the <hi>window,</hi>
God at the dore; the Devill by stealth, God by his declared Ordinance, and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
And this was the case of our Fathers in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> They must
know that all that hath passed between God and man hath passed <hi>Ex pacto,</hi> by
way of contact and covenant.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>best</hi> works of the <hi>best</hi> man have no proportion with the kingdome of
heaven,<note place="margin">The best.</note> for I give God but his own: But I have it <hi>Ex pacto,</hi> God hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
so, <hi>Fac, hoc &amp; vives, Doe this and thou shalt live;</hi> and at the last
judgement, Christ shall ground his <hi>Venite benedicti,</hi> Come ye blessed, and his
<hi>Ite maledicti,</hi> Goe ye accursed, upon the <hi>Quia,</hi> and upon the <hi>Quia non,</hi> Because
you have, and Because you have not done this and this. <hi>Faith,</hi> that is of infinite value
above works, hath yet no proportion to the kingdome of heaven; <hi>Faith</hi> saves mee,
as my <hi>hand</hi> feeds mee; It reaches the food, but it is not the food; but faith saves
<hi>Ex pacto,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 36.</note> by vertue of that Covenant; which Christ hath made, <hi>Tantummodo crede,</hi>
Onely beleeve. To carry it to the highest, the <hi>merit of Christ Iesus</hi> himselfe,
though it bee infinite so, as that it might have redeemed infinite worlds,
yet the working thereof is safeliest considered in the School to be <hi>Ex pacto,</hi>
by vertue of that contract which had passed between the Father and him, that all
things should thus and thus be transacted by Christ, and so man should be saved;
for, if we shall place it meerely, onely in the infinitenesse of the merit, Christs
death would not have needed; for his first drops of bloud in his <hi>Circumcision,</hi> nay
his very <hi>Incarnation</hi> (that God was made man) and every act of his humiliation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
being taken singly, yet, <hi>in that person,</hi> God and man, were of infinite merit; and
also, if it wrought meerly by the infinitnesse of the merit, it must have wrought, not
onely upon all men, but to <hi>the salvation of the Devill;</hi> for, certainely there is more
merit in Christ then there is sinne in the Devill. But the proceeding was <hi>Ex pacto,</hi>
according to the contract made, and to the conditions given; <hi>Ipse conteret caput tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
That the Messias should bruise the Serpents head for us, included our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
That the Serpents head should be bruised, excluded the Serpent himselfe.
This contract, then between God and man, as it was able to put the nature of a great
fault, in a small offence, if we consider onely the eating of an apple, and so to make
even a Trespass High-Treason, (because it was so contracted) so does this contract, the
Ordinance of God, infuse a great vertue &amp; efficacie, in the instruments of our reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
how mean in gifts, or how corrupt in manners soever they be. <hi>Circumcision</hi> in it self
a low thing, yea obscene, &amp; subject to mis-interpretation, yet by reason of the covenant,
<hi>He that is not circumcised,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>that person shall be cut off from my people.</hi> So also <hi>Baptism,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in it selfe,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3.</note> a vulgar, and a familiar thing; yet, <hi>except a man be born of water,
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> The <hi>Sacrament of the
body and blood of Christ,</hi> a domestique, a dayly thing; if we consider onely the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the bread and participation of the Cup, but if we ascend up to the contract
in the institution, it is to every worthy receiver, the seale, and the Conduit
of all the merits of Christ,<note place="margin">Ios. 6. 4.</note> to his soule. God threw down the walls of Jericho,
with the sound of <hi>Horns,</hi> not of <hi>Trumpets.</hi> A homely sound; yet it did the worke;
so neither is the weaknesse, no, nor the corruptnesse of the instruments always to be
considered in the Church of God. Our Fathers knew there had passed a contract
between God and man, A Church there should be <hi>Ad consummationem,</hi> to the
end of the world, therefore they might safely make their recourse thither; and
<hi>Porta Inferi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> the gates of hell should not prevaile against it, therefore they might
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93359:112"/>
confidently dwell there;<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 17.</note> They knew there was a <hi>Dic Ecclesiae</hi> a bill to be exhibited
to the Church, upon any disorder, and a <hi>Si noluerit,</hi> an excommunication upon
disobedience, <hi>If he neglect to heare the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man,
and as a Publican.</hi> This Church they saw, and Gods contract upon them sealed in
<hi>Baptism,</hi> they knew, God had <hi>revealed</hi> no <hi>other</hi> Church, nor contract to them.
And therefore, though they did not eat their troden grasse, with that ridiculous
tentation, as the Fryar is boasted to have eaten a Toad which was set upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because he had read,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>whatsoever is set before you eat;</hi> Nor, as their <hi>Dorotheus,</hi>
who when his man had reachd him <hi>rats-bane,</hi> in stead of <hi>honey,</hi> which he called for,
refused it not, because sayd he, <hi>If Gods will had been,</hi> that <hi>I should have had honey,
he would have directed thy hand to the honey,</hi> but being under an invi ciblenignorance,
and indevestible scruples, and having this contract, and this Church, to give them
some satisfaction and acquiescence, they were partakers of that blessing, That though
<hi>Serpents</hi> and <hi>Scorpions</hi> lurked in their grasse,<note place="margin">Luke 10. 19.</note> they had power to tread <hi>on scorpions and
on serpents,</hi> and nothing could hurt them, and <hi>That if they drinke any deadly thing,
it shall doe them no harme.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 18.</note> And so our Fathers with a good conscience, <hi>Manebant,</hi>
stayd there, and <hi>Edebant,</hi> they eat troden grasse, and drunke troubled water, and
yet <hi>Manebantoves,</hi> they continued sheep still.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sheep,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Oves.</note> that is, without <hi>Barking,</hi> or <hi>biting.</hi> Some faint and humble <hi>bleatings</hi>
there were alwaies in the daies of our Fathers; In every age there arose some men,
who did modestly, and devoutly, but yet couragiously and confidently appear, and
complaine against those treadings, and those troublings. Every age, every nation
had some such <hi>bleatings,</hi> some men who by <hi>writing</hi> or <hi>preaching</hi> against those abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
interrupted the tyrannicall prescriptions of that Church, and made their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
claime,</hi> to their Christian liberty; But still they continued sheep, without
denying either their <hi>fleece</hi> or their <hi>throats</hi> to those Pastors. We read in <hi>Naturall
story</hi> of divers pastures, and divers waters, which will change the colour of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
or sheep, but none that changes the <hi>forme,</hi> and makes them no such cattell,
or no sheep. Some waters change sheep of any colour to <hi>white.</hi> And these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
waters, <hi>temporall or spirituall afflictions,</hi> may bring Gods children to a faint and
leane,<note place="margin">1. 15.</note> and languishing palenesse. If it doe, as <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows, appeared fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and fatter in flesh, with their pults and water, which they desired rather then the
Kings polluted delicates, then others that sed voluptuously: so the hearts of Gods
children shall be filled,<note place="margin">Psalm 63. 5.</note> as <hi>with marrow and with fatnesse,</hi> when others shall have all
their hearts desire, but leannesse in their soules. There are waters that change
all coloured sheep to <hi>black.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioel 2. 6.</note> So may these troubled waters, <hi>afflictions,</hi> effect that
upon Gods children, The enemy shall come, and before him all faces shall gather
<hi>blacknesse;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lam. 4. 8.</note> as Jerusalem complains, That their faces were <hi>blacker</hi> then <hi>coals.</hi> If it
doe, yet as long as they stay, and continue sheep, members of the body, as long as
they partake of the body, they shall partake of the complexion of the Church, who
saies of her selfe, <hi>I am black, O daughters of Ierusalem, but comely,</hi> (acceptable in
the sight of my Christ) and that shall be verifyed in them,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 5.</note> which <hi>Salomon</hi> says, <hi>By the
sadnesse of the countenance, the heart is made better;</hi> that is, by the occasion of the
sadnesse, Gods correction. But the strangest change is, that some waters change
sheep into red, the most unlikely, most extraordinary, most unproper colour for
sheep, of any other. Yet there is one <hi>rednesse</hi> naturall to our sheep in the Text,
the rednesse of <hi>blushing,</hi> and modesty, and selfe-accusing; And there is another
rednesse, which is not improper, the rednesse of zeale and godly anger. The worst
rednesse that can befall them, is the rednesse of sinne, and yet, lest that should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
them,<note place="margin">Esai. 1. 18.</note> God proceeds familiarly with them, <hi>Come now, and let us reason together,
Though your sinnes be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow,</hi> though they be red like
<hi>Crimson,</hi> they shall be as <hi>wooll.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 20.</note> Yea, to shew, that where sinne abounds, grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
may abound, to shew that that whitenesse of Gods mercy doth pursue and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this rednesse of sinne, it pleases the Holy Ghost to use such a phrase as expresses
a rednesse in whitenesse it self; He says, that the religious men of the Jewes before
that time,<note place="margin">Lam. 4. 7.</note> were whiter then milke, and redder then pearle: <hi>Mippeninim</hi> is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
word, which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> translate pearle; And the Vulgate Edition hath it,
<hi>Rubicundiores ebore antiquo,</hi> redder then the oldest yvory, which is the whitest
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93359:112"/>
thing, that can be presented. Perchance to intimate thus much, that there is neither
in the <hi>holiest actions,</hi> of the holiest man, any such degree of whitenesse, but that it is
always accompanied with some rednes, some tincture, some aspersion of sin, nor any such
deep rednesse in sin, any sin so often, and deeply died in grain, but that it is capable of
whitenesse, in the application of the candor, and purenesse, and innocency of Christ
Jesus: Therefore may the Holy Ghost have wrapped up this whitenesse in rednesse,
redder then Pearl. Our Fathers were not discouraged, when they were discolored;
what palenesse, what blacknesse, what rednesse soever, these troubled waters induced
upon them, still they were sheep; They become not <hi>Foxes,</hi> to delude the State with
<hi>equivocations;</hi> nor <hi>Wolves,</hi> to join with the State to the oppression of the rest; nor
<hi>Horses,</hi> to suffer themselves to be ridden by others, and so made instruments of their
passions; no nor <hi>Vnicorns,</hi> to think to purge and purifie the waters for all the forest,
to think to reforme all abuses in State, and Church at once; but they continued
sheep; opened not their mouthes in biting, nor barking, in murmuring, or reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the present government. So our Fathers staid, <hi>Manebant,</hi> so they eat that grasse,
so they continued sheep, and, as it followes next, <hi>Oves Dei,</hi> Gods sheep, <hi>my sheep</hi> have
eaten, <hi>my sheep</hi> have drunken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gods sheep;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Oves Dei.</note> for <hi>nature</hi> hath her sheep; some men by naturall constitution, are lazy,
drowsie, frivolous, unactive, sheepish men. And <hi>States</hi> have their sheep; timorous
men, following men, speechlesse men, men, who because they abound in a plentifull
State, are loth to stire. Nay the <hi>Devill</hi> hath his sheep too; Men whom he possesses
so entirely, that, as the Law says, <hi>Domintum est potestas, tum utendi, tum abutendi,</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he is truly Lord of any thing, who may doe what he will with it, he does what he
will with those men, even to their own ruine. And from these folds and flocks did
the <hi>Devill</hi> always serve his shambles, in his <hi>false Martyrdomes</hi> in the Primitive Church;
when (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> notes) envying the honour which the Orthodox Christians had in
their thousands of Martyrs, the Heretiques studied ways of equalling them in that.
And though within <hi>four hundred</hi> years after Christ, the Church, (who could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
take knowledge of all) was come to celebrate, by name, <hi>five thousand</hi> Martyrs
(as some books have the account) for every day in the year, yet the Heretiques went
so far towards equalling them, as that they had some whole sects, (particularly the
<hi>Euphemitae)</hi> which called themselves <hi>Martyrians,</hi> men exposed to the slaughter. One
limbe of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> the <hi>Circumcelliones,</hi> might have furnished their shambles; They
would provoke others to kill them; and if they fail'd in that, they would kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And this was, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> says, <hi>Ludus quotidianus,</hi> their daily sport, they
plaid at no other game. And left all these meanes should not have provided Martyrs
enow, <hi>Petilian,</hi> against whom Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> writes, invented a new way of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
when he taught, that if a man were guilty in his Conscience of any great offence
to God, and onely to punish that fault, did kill himselfe, he was by that act of Justice
a Martyr. The Devill had his sheep then; He hath so still; Those <hi>Emissarii papae,</hi>
those whom the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> sends hither into this kingdome; whom <hi>Baronius</hi>
calls <hi>Candidates Martyrii,</hi> pretenders to Martyrdome, suters for Martyrdome; Men,
who (as he adds there) do <hi>sacramento spondere sanguinem,</hi> take an oath at <hi>Rome</hi> that
they will be hanged in <hi>England;</hi> and, in whose behalfe he complaines <hi>de sterilitate
Martyrii,</hi> that there is such a dearth of Martyrdome, that they finde it hard to be
hanged; and therefore, (perchance) they finde it necessary to enter into <hi>Powder plots,</hi>
and actuall <hi>Treasons,</hi> because they see that for <hi>Religion</hi> meerly, this State would never
draw drop of bloud, <hi>&amp; sacramento sanguinem,</hi> they have taken an oath to be hanged,
and are loth to be forsworne. But the sheep of our text, were not <hi>Natures sheep,</hi> men
naturally lazy, and unactive, nor <hi>State sheep,</hi> men loth to adventure, by stirring, nor
the <hi>Devills sheep,</hi> men headlong to their own ruine, even by way of provocation;
But they were <hi>Gods sheep,</hi> men, who, out of a rectified conscience, would not preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate,
not betray nor forsake <hi>God,</hi> if his glory required the expense of their lives, and
yet would not exasperate nor provoke their superiours, how corrupt soever, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable,
and unprofitable complaints: so our Fathers staied in <hi>Rome,</hi> so they eat
troden grasse, and drunke troubled waters, so they continued harmlesse <hi>sheep</hi> towards
others, and the sheep <hi>of God,</hi> such as though they staid there and fed upon an ill diet,
God had distinguished from Goats, and reserved for his right hand, at the day of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93359:113"/>
separation. And they were more then so; they were not onely <hi>his sheep,</hi> but <hi>his flock;</hi>
for so, this translation reads it, <hi>my flock</hi> hath eaten, <hi>my flock</hi> hath drunk.</p>
                     <p>God had single sheep in many nations;<note place="margin">Grex.</note> 
                        <hi>Iobs,</hi> and <hi>Naamans,</hi> and such; servants,
and yet not in the Covenants, sheep, and yet not brought into his flock. For though
God have revealed no other way of salvation <hi>to us,</hi> but by breeding us in his Church,
yet we must be so far, from straitning salvation, to any <hi>particular Christian Church,</hi>
of any subdivided name, <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> as that we may not straiten it to the whole
<hi>Christian Church,</hi> as though God <hi>could</hi> not, in the largenesse of his power, or <hi>did</hi> not,
in the largenesse of his mercy, afford salvation to some, whom he never gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Christian Church. But these sheep in our text, were his flock, that is, his
Church. Though they durst not communicate their sense of their miseries, and their
desires to one another, yet they were a flock. When <hi>Elias</hi> complained, <hi>I, even I onely
am left,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 14.</note> and God told him, that he had <hi>seven thousand</hi> besides him, perchance <hi>Elias</hi>
knew none of this <hi>seven thousand,</hi> perchance none of this <hi>seven thousand and</hi> knew one
another, and yet, they were his flock, though they never met. That timber that is
in the forest, that stone that is in the quarry, that Iron, that Lead that is in the mine,
though distant miles, Counties, Nations, from one another, meet in the building of
a materiall Church; So doth God bring together, living stones, men that had no
relation, no correspondence, no intelligence together, to the making of his Mysticall
body, his visible Church. Who ever would have thought, that we of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and they of the <hi>Eastern,</hi> or <hi>Western Indies,</hi> should have met to the making of Christ a
Church? And yet, before we knew, on either side, that there was such a <hi>people, God</hi>
knew there was such a Church. He that lies buried, in the consecrated dust under
your feet, knowes not who lies next him; but one Trumpet at last shall raise them
both together, and show them to one another, and joyn them, (by Gods grace)
in the Triumphant Church. These that knew not one another, that knew not <hi>of</hi> one
another, were yet Gods flock, the Church in his eye; for there, (and onely there)
the Church is always visible. So were our Fathers in <hi>Rome,</hi> though they durst not
meet, and communicate their sorrows, nor fold themselves so in the fold of Christ
Jesus, that is in open, and free <hi>Confessions.</hi> They therefore that aske now, <hi>Where was
your Church before Luther,</hi> would then have asked of the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Where was
your Church before <hi>Esdras;</hi> that was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ours was in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now,<note place="margin">Secessio.</note> beloved, when our Adversaries cannot deny us this truth, that our Church
was enwrapped, (though smothered) in theirs, that as that <hi>Balsamum naturale,</hi> which
<hi>Paracelsus</hi> speaks of, that naturall <hi>Balme</hi> which is in every body, and would cure any
wound, if that wound were kept clean, and recover any body, if that body were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
as that naturall balme is in that body, how diseased soever that body be, so was
our Church in theirs, they vexe us now, with that question, Why, if the case stood so,
if your Fathers, when they eat our troden grasse, and drunk our troubled waters, were
sound and in health, and continued sheep, and Gods sheep, and Gods flock, his
Church with us, why went they from us? They ought us their residence, because
they had received their Baptisme from us. And truly, it is not an impertinent, a frivolous
reason, that of Baptisme, where there is nothing but conveniency, and no necessity in
the case. But, if I be content to stay with my friend in an aguish aire, will he take it
ill, if I go when the plague comes? Or if I stay in town till 20 die of the plague, shall it be
lookd that I should stay when there die 1000? The infection grew hotter and hotter in
<hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; their <hi>may,</hi> came to a <hi>must,</hi> those things which were done before <hi>de facto,</hi> came at
last to be articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>de jure,</hi> must be beleeved and practised upon salvation.
They chide us for going away, and they drove us away; If we abstained from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with their poysons, (being now growen to that height) they excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
us; They gave us no room amongst them but the fire, and they were so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to burne Heretiques, that they called it heresie, not to stay to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>Yet we went not upon their driving,<note place="margin">Vox Dei.</note> but upon <hi>Gods calling.</hi> As the whole prophecy
of the deliverance of <hi>Israel,</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> belongs to the Christian Church, both to
the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, at first, and to the <hi>Reformed</hi> since, so doth that voice, spoken
to them, reach unto us, <hi>Egredimini de Babylone, Goe ye out of Babylon with a voice of

                     <p>They reproach to us our going from them,<note place="margin">Curia.</note> when they drove us, and God drew us,
and they discharge themselves for all, by this one evasion; That all that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, is the fault of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not of the <hi>Church;</hi> of the extortion
in the practise of their <hi>Officers,</hi> not of error in the doctrine of their <hi>Teachers.</hi> Let that
be true, (as in a great part it is) for, almost all their errors proceed from their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
and love of money) this is that that we complain most of, and in this especially
lies the conformity of the <hi>Iewish Priests</hi> in the <hi>Chaldean Babylon,</hi> and these Prelates
in the Roman <hi>Babylon,</hi> that the Court, and the Church, joined in the oppression. But
since the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are united in one head, I see no
use of this distinction, <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi> If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be above the Court, the
Church is able to amend these corruptions in the Court. If the Court be got above
the Church, the Church hath lost, or sold away, her supremacy.</p>
                     <p>To oppresse us,<note place="margin">Miracula.</note> and ease themselves, now, when we are gone from them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>Miracles</hi> at out hands; when indeed it was miracle enough, how we got from them.
But,<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> 
                        <hi>magnum charitatis argumentum, credere absque pignoribus miraculorum,</hi> He loves
God but a little that will not beleeve him without a miracle. Miracles are for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
of new religions; All the miracles of, and from Christ and his Apostles, are
<hi>ours,</hi> because their Religion is ours. Indeed it behooves our adversaries to provide
new miracles every day, because they make new articles of Faith every day. As <hi>Esop</hi>
therefore answered in the Market, when he that sold him was asked what he could
do, <hi>that he could do nothing,</hi> because his fellow had said, <hi>that he could do all,</hi> so we say,
we can do no miracles, because they do all; all ordinary cures of Agues, and tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach
being done by miracle amongst them. We confesse that we have no such tye upon
the Triumphant Church, to make the <hi>Saints</hi> there do those anniversary miracles,
which they do by their reliques here, upon their own <hi>holy days,</hi> ten days sooner every
year, then they did before the <hi>new computation.</hi> We pretend not to raise the dead, but
to cure the sick; and that but by the ordinary Physique, the Word, and Sacraments,
and therefore need no miracles.<note place="margin">Ios. Acosta.</note> And we remember them of their own authors, who
do not onely say, that themselves do no miracles, in these latter times, but assigne
diligently strong reasons, why it is that they doe none. If all this will not serve, we
must tell them, that we have a greater miracle, then any that they produce; that is,
that in so few years, they that forsook <hi>Rome,</hi> were become equall, <hi>even in number,</hi> to
them that adhered to her. We say, with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> That if we had no other
miracle, <hi>hoc unum stupendum &amp; potentissimum miraculum esse,</hi> that this alone were
the most powerfull, and most a mazing miracle, <hi>ad hanc religionem, totius orbis ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem,

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93359:114"/>
any persons amongst us, as between the greatest amongst them; The succeeding <hi>Pope</hi>
mangling the body of his predecessor, casting them into the river for buriall, disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling
all their decrees, and ordinations; their <hi>Ordinations;</hi> so that no man could
be sure who was a Priest, nor whether he had truely received any Sacrament, or no.
Howsoever, as in the narrowest way there is most justling, the <hi>Roman Church</hi> going
that broad way, to beleeve as the Church beleeves, may scape some particular diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
which we that goe the narrower way, to try every thing by the exact word of
God,<note place="margin">De doctri. Christia.</note> may fall into. <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> tells us of a City in <hi>Mauritania Caesarea,</hi> in which
they had a custome, that in one day in the year, not onely Citizens of other parishes,
but even neighbours, yea brethren, yea Fathers, did fling stones dangerously, and
furiously at one another in the streets, and this they so solemnized, as a custome received
from their ancestors; which was a licentious kind of <hi>Carnavall.</hi> If any amongst us
have fallen into that disease, to cast stones, or dirt at his friends, it is an infection
from his own distemper,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 16.</note> not from our doctrine; for, <hi>if any man list to be contentious,
we have no such custome, neither the Church of God.</hi> We departed not from them then,
till it was come to a hot plague, in a necessity of professing old opinions to be new
articles of Faith; not till we were driven by them, and drawn by the voice of God,
in the learnedest men of all nations; when they could not discharge themselves by
the distinction of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> because, if the abuses
had been but in the Court, it was the greatest abuse of all, for that Church, which is
so much above that Court, not to mend it. Nor can they require <hi>Miracles</hi> at our
hands, who doe none themselves, and yet need them, because they induce new articles
of Religion; neither can they reproach to us our <hi>Dissentions</hi> amongst our selves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are neither in so fundamentall points, nor pursued with so much uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
as theirs. So we justifie our secession <hi>from them;</hi> but all this justifies in no
part, the secession of those distempered men, who have separated themselves <hi>from us,</hi>
which is our next, and our last consideration.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Apostle</hi> says,<note place="margin">Separatistae.</note> 
                        <hi>study</hi> to be <hi>quiet,</hi> (1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 11. me thinks he intimates
something towards this, that the lesse we <hi>study</hi> for our Sermons, the more danger is
there to disquiet the auditory; extemporall, unpremeditated Sermons, that serve the
popular care, vent, for the most part, doctrines that disquiet the Church. <hi>Study</hi> for
them, and they <hi>will be quiet;</hi> consider ancient and fundamentall doctrines, and this
will quiet and settle the understanding, and the Conscience. Many of these extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men have gone away from us, and vainly said, that they have as good cause to
separate from us, as we from <hi>Rome.</hi> But can they call our Church, <hi>a Babylon;</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
disorder? All that offends them, is, that we have <hi>too much order,</hi> too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
too much binding to the orderly, and uniforme service of God in Church.
It affects all the body,<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> when any member is cut off; <hi>Cum dolore amputatur, etiam quae

                        <hi>gravius est quàm si gladio feriretur, flammis absumeretur, feris subigeretur,</hi>
it is a heavier sentence, then to be beheaded, to be burnt, or devoured with wild
beasts; and yet these men, before any such sentence pronounced by us, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
themselves. Of all distempers, <hi>Calvin</hi> falls oftenest upon the reproof of that
which he calls <hi>Morositatem,</hi> a certain peevish frowardnesse, which, as he calls in one
place, <hi>deterrimam pestem,</hi> the most infectious pestilence, that can fall upon a man, so,
in another, he gives the reason, why it is so, <hi>semper nimia morositas est ambitiosa,</hi>
that this peevish frowardnesse, is always accompanied with a <hi>pride,</hi> and a <hi>singularity,</hi>
and an ambition to have his opinions preferred before all other men, and to condemn
all that differ from him. A civill man will depart with his opinion at a <hi>Table,</hi> at a
Councell table, rather then hold up an argument to the vexation of the Company;
so will a peaceable man doe, in the Church, in questions that are not fundamentall.
That reverend man whom we mentioned before, who did so much in the establishing
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> professes, that it was his own opinion, that the Sacrament might be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
in prisons, and in private houses; but because he found the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi>
of another opinion, and another practise before he came, he applied himself to them
and departed, (<hi>in practise)</hi> from his own opinion, even in so important a point, as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93359:114"/>
the ministration of the Sacrament. Which I present to consideration the rather,
both because thereby it appears, that greater matters then are now thought <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi>
were then thought but indifferent, and <hi>arbitrary,</hi> (for, surely, if <hi>Calvin</hi> had
thought this a fundamentall thing, he would never have suffered any custome to have
prevailed against his conscience) and also, because divers of those men, who trouble
the Church now, about things of lesse importance, and this of private Sacraments in
particular) will needs make themselves beleeve, that they are <hi>his Disciples,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
conclude that whatsoever is practised at <hi>Geneva</hi> was <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion. Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith excellently,<note place="margin">Ep. 209. Feliciae virgini.</note> and appliably, to a holy Virgin, who was ready to leave
the Church, for the ill life of Church-men, <hi>Christus nobis imperavit Congregationem,

recommended to us the Congregation; as for the separation, he hath reserved
it to <hi>himself,</hi> to declare at the last day, who are Sheep and who are Goats. And hee
wrought that separation which our Fathers made from Rome, by his expresse writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                     <p>In this discovery from this Red <hi>Sea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Divisio.</note> to this <hi>dead Sea;</hi> from the mercy of God, in
the blood of his Son, to the malediction of God, in the blood of the sinner, be pleased
to make these the points of your Compasse, and your Land-marks by the way, in those,
the two parts of this exercise. First, in the first, consider the <hi>precedencie,</hi> and <hi>primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture</hi>
of <hi>Mercy;</hi> God begins at <hi>Mercy,</hi> and not at <hi>Iudgement:</hi> God's method here, is
not, <hi>The sinner shall be accursed,</hi> but <hi>The childe shall have long life:</hi> but first, the blessing,
and then the malediction. And then <hi>secondly,</hi> we shall see, in what form the particular
blessing is given here; In <hi>long life;</hi> The <hi>childe shall die a hundred years old.</hi> And then
also, because we find it in the company of Mercies, in the region of Mercies, in this
first part of the Text, which is the <hi>Sphear of Mercy;</hi> we shall look also how this very
<hi>dying</hi> is a Mercy too: The mercy is especially plac'd in the long life: <hi>The childe shall
live a hundred yeares;</hi> but the Holy Ghost would not leave out that, that he should
<hi>die;</hi> The childe shall <hi>die</hi> a hundred yeares old. And in these three, first the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and primogeniture of God's mercy, and then the specification of that mercy in
long life, and lastly, the association of mercy, that death as well as life is a blessing to
the Righteous; we shall determine that first part. And in the second, <hi>But the sinner
being a hundred years old, shall be accursed,</hi> we shall see first, that the malediction of God
hath no object but a <hi>sinner:</hi> God antidates no malediction: Till there be a sinner, there
is no malediction; nay not till there be an <hi>inveterate</hi> sinner; <hi>A sinner of a hundred yeares,</hi>
at least, such a sinner, as would be so, if God would spare him a hundred yeares here.
And upon such a sinner, God thunders out this Prosternation, this Consternation, in
this one word of our Text, which involves and inwraps all kinds of miseries, feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in body, infatuation in mind, evacuation of power, dishonour in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

favour, ruine in fortune, dejection in spirit, <hi>He shall be accursed.</hi> Where, because in
this second part we are in the Region and Sphear of maledictions, we cannot consider
this future, <hi>He shall be,</hi> as a future of favour, a prorogation, a deferring of the maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
<hi>He shall be,</hi> is not, he shall be hereafter, but not yet: but it is <hi>a future of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation;
He shall be accursed,</hi> that is, he shall be so <hi>for ever.</hi> And so have you the frame,

the Superlative is called so; <hi>The first-born.</hi> And in such a sense; if we could think of
more degrees of goodnesse in God, of an exaltation of God himself in God, of more
God in God, of a Superlative in God, we must necessarily turn upon his mercy, for
that <hi>Mercie</hi> must be the <hi>Superlative:</hi> So is it too, if we consider Gods first action, or
God's first thought towards Man; Mercy was the first-born by every Mother; by
that Understanding, by that Will, by that Power, which we conceive in God; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was the first-born, and first-mover in all. We consider a <hi>preventing Grace</hi> in God;
and that preventing Grace is before all; for that prevents us so, as to <hi>Visite us when we
sit in darknesse.</hi> And we consider an <hi>Antecedent-Will</hi> in God, and that <hi>Antecedent
Will</hi> is before all; for by that Will, God would have <hi>all</hi> men <hi>saved.</hi> And when we
call Gods Grace by other names then Preventing, whether <hi>Assisting</hi> Grace, that it
stand by us and sustain us, or <hi>Concomitant</hi> Grace, that it work with us, and inanimate
our action, when it is doing, or his <hi>Subsequent</hi> Grace, that rectifies or corrects an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when it is done; when all is done, still it is the <hi>Preventing Power,</hi> and quality of
that Grace, that did all that in me: If I stand by his Assisting Grace, if I work with his
Concomitant Grace, if I rectifie my errour by his Subsequent Grace, that that moves
upon me in all these, is still the preventing power of that Grace. For as all my <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
actions of life are done by the power of that <hi>Soul,</hi> which was in me before, so all
the <hi>Supernaturall</hi> actions <hi>of that Soul,</hi> are done by that power of that Grace, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
and preinanimates that action; and all my co-operation is but a post-operation,
a working by the Power of that All-preventing Grace. I moved not at first by the
<hi>Tide,</hi> by the strength of naturall faculties, nor do I move after by that <hi>wind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> which
had formerly fill'd my sails: I proceed not now by the strength of that Grace which
God gave me heretofore. But as God infuseth a <hi>Soul</hi> into every man, and that Soul
elicites a new <hi>Act</hi> in it self, before that man produce any action; so God infuses <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Grace</hi> into every good work of mine, and so prevents me, before I co-operate
with him. For as Nature in her highest exaltation, in the best Morall man that is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
flow into Grace, Nature cannot become Grace; so neither doth former Grace
flow into future Grace, but I need a distinct influence of God, a particular Grace, for
<hi>every</hi> good work I do, for every good word I speak, for every good thought I conceive.</p>

To be pretermitted there, there to be left out, wraps them up, at least leaves them

in a book of Death, as in the Book of Life. As the aftertimes made a Book

such expunctions, and such redintegrations: but Gods first Book, his <hi>Book of

as that there is nothing in it, but Mercy. In Gods other Book, his Book

mercies, still the Tide sets that way, still the Biass leads on that hand, still his method
directs us <hi>ad Primogenitum,</hi> to his first-born, to his Mercy. So he began in that Book:

That if he eat the forbidden fruit,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> if he will not forbear that, that one Tree, <hi>He shall
die.</hi> But God begins not there: before that, he had said, of every tree in the Garden
thou maist freely eat; neither is there more vehemency in the punishment, then in the
libertie. For as in the punishment there is an ingemination, <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> Dying thou
shalt die; that is, thou shalt surely die; so in the liberty, there was an ingemination too,

to them in the correction; all which are higher and higher degrees of Mercy: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is a spark of anger, a tincture of judgement mingled in it, God remembers
his first-born,<note place="margin">verse 33.</note> his Mercy, and returns where he begun: <hi>Neverthelesse my Covenant will
I not break, nor alter the things that is gone out of my lips; once have I sworn by my Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that I will not lie unto David.</hi> There are elder pictures in the world of Water, then
there are any of oyl; but those of oyl have got above them, and shall outlive them.
<hi>Water</hi> is a frequent embleme of <hi>Affliction,</hi> in the Scriptures; and so is <hi>oyl</hi> of <hi>Mercy;</hi> If
at any time in any place of Scripture, God seemed to begin with water, with a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet the oyl will get to the top: in that very judgement, you may see that God
had first a mercifull purpose in inflicting that medicinall judgement; for his mercy is
his first-born. <hi>His Mercy is new every morning,</hi> saith the Prophet; not onely <hi>every day,</hi>
but <hi>as soon as it is day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Trace God <hi>in thy self,</hi> and thou shalt find it so. If thou beest drowzie now, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive,
curious or contentious, or quarrelsome now, now God leaves thee in that
indisposition, and that is a judgement: But it was his Mercy that brought thee hither
before. In every sinne thou hast some remorse, some <hi>reluctation,</hi> before thou do that
sinne; and that <hi>pre-reluctation,</hi> and <hi>pre-remorse</hi> was Mercy. If thou hadst no such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
in thy last sinne, before the sinne, and hast it now, this is the effect of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
mercy, and former good purpose upon thee, to let thee see that thou needest the
assistance of his Minister, and of his Ordinance, to enable thee to lay hold on Mercy
when it is offered thee. Can any calamity fall upon thee, in which thou shalt not be
bound to say, I have had blessings in a greater measure then this? If thou have had
losses, yet thou hast more, out of which God took that. If all be lost, perchance thou
art but where thou begunst at first, at nothing. If thou begunst upon a good heighth,
and beest fallen from that, and fallen low, yet as God prepared a <hi>Whale</hi> to transport
<hi>Ionas,</hi> before <hi>Ionas</hi> was cast into the Sea, God prepared thee a holy <hi>Patience,</hi> before
he reduced thee to the exercise of that Patience. <hi>If thou</hi> couldest apprehend nothing
done for thy self, yet all the mercies that God hath exhibited to <hi>others,</hi> are former
mercies to thee, in the <hi>Pattern,</hi> and in the <hi>Seal,</hi> and in the <hi>Argument</hi> thereof: They
have had them, therefore thou shalt. All Gods <hi>Prophecies,</hi> are thy <hi>Histories:</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he hath promised others, he hath done in his purpose for thee: And all Gods <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:93359:120"/>
are thy <hi>Prophesies;</hi> all that he hath done for others, he owes thee. Hast thou a
<hi>hardnesse</hi> of heart? knowest thou not that Christ hath wept before to entender that
hardnesse? hast thou a <hi>palenesse</hi> of soul, in the apparition of God in fire, and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
knowest thou not, that Christ hath <hi>bled</hi> before, to give a vigour, and a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and a verdure to that palenesse? is thy sinne <hi>Actuall</hi> sinne? knowest thou not,
that there is a Lamb bleeding before upon the Altar, to expiate that? Is thy terrour
from thy inherence, and encombrance of <hi>Originall</hi> sinne? knowest thou not, that the
effect of <hi>Baptism</hi> hath blunted the sting of that sinne before? art thou full of sores,
putrid and ulcerous sores? full of wounds, through and through piercing
wounds? full of diseases, namelesse and complicate diseases? knowest thou not
that there is a holy Charm, a blessed Incantation, by which thou art, though not
invulnerable, yet invulnerable <hi>unto death,</hi> wrapt up in the eternall Decree of thine <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi>
that's thy pillar, the <hi>assurance of thine Election:</hi> If thou shake that, if thou
cast down that Pillar, if thou distrust thine Election, with <hi>Samson,</hi> who pulled down
pillars in his blindnesse, in thy blindnesse thou destroyest thy self. Begin where thou
wilt at any Act in thy self, at any act in God, yet there was mercy before that, for his
mercy is eternall, eternall even towards thee. <hi>I could</hi> easily think that that, that past
between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> in their long conversation; that that, that past between <hi>Christ</hi>
and <hi>Moses</hi> in his trans-figuration; that that, that past between Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Court
of Heaven</hi> in his extasie was instruction and manifestation on one part, and admiration
and application on the other part of the mercy of God. Earth cannot receive, Heaven
cannot give such another universall soul to all: all persons, all actions, as Mercy. And
were I <hi>the childe of this Text,</hi> that were to live <hi>a hundred years,</hi> I would ask no other
marrow to my bones, no other wine to my heart, no other light to mine eyes, no
other art to my understanding, no other eloquence to my tongue, then the power of
apprehending for my self, and the power of deriving and conveying upon others by my
Ministery, the Mercy, the early Mercy, the everlasting Mercy of yours, and my God.
But we must passe to the consideration of this immense <hi>Light,</hi> in that one <hi>Beam,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is exhibited here, that is, long life: <hi>The childe shall die a hundred years old.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Long life is a blessing,<note place="margin">Vita longa.</note> as it is an image of eternity: as Kings are blessings, because they
are Images of God. And as to speak properly, a King that possest the whole earth, hath
no proportion at all to God, (he is not a dramme, not a grain, not an atome to God)
so neither if a thousand <hi>Methusalems</hi> were put in one life, had that long life any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to eternity; for <hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Infinite</hi> have no proportion to one another. But yet
when we say so, That the King is <hi>nothing</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> we speak then between God and the
King; and we say that; onely to assist the Kings Religious humiliation of himself in the
presence of God. But when we speak between the King and our selves his Subjects,
there we raise our selves to a just reverence of him, by taking knowledge that he is the
Image of God to us. So though <hi>long life</hi> be nothing to eternity, yet because we need
such <hi>Glasses</hi> and such <hi>Images,</hi> as God shews us himself in the King, so he shewes us his
eternitie in a long life. <hi>In this,</hi> that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> complain every where of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of life,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 9.</note> and neernesse of death; <hi>(Iacob</hi> at <hi>a hundred and thirtie yeares</hi> tells <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
that his dayes were <hi>few,</hi>) In this, that God threatens the shortnesse of life for a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>Eli,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 32.</note> God saies, <hi>There shall not be an old man in thy house for ever:</hi> In this, that

                        <note place="margin">Psal. 91. 16.</note> and shew <hi>him my salvation,</hi>) That God would give him
long life, and make that long life a Type of Eternity; In this, that God continues that
promise into performance, and brings it to execution, in some of his chosen servants;
at a hundred and twenty <hi>Moses his eyes were not dim,</hi>

                     <p>When <hi>Paradise</hi> should have extended,<note place="margin">Morietur.</note> as man should have multiplied, and every
holy family, every religious Colony have constituted a new Paradise, that as it was
said of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when it abounded with Hermitages in the Primitive persecutions, That
<hi>Egypt</hi> was a continuall <hi>City of Hermitages;</hi> so all the world should have been a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
Garden of Paradises, when all affections should have been subjects, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
servants, and all wives helpers, then life was a sincere blessing. But, but a mixt
blessing now, when all these are so much vitiated; onely a possible blessing; a dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
a conditionable, a circumstantiall blessing now. If there were any other way to
be saved and to get to Heaven, then by being born into this life, I would not wish to
have come into this world. And now that God hath made this life a <hi>Bridge</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
it is but a giddy, and a vertiginous thing, to stand long gazing upon so narrow a
bridge, and over so deep and roaring waters, and desperate whirlpools, as this world
abounds with:<note place="margin">Psal. 90. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>So teach us to number our dayes,</hi> saith <hi>David, that we may apply our
hearts unto wisedome:</hi> Not to number them so, as that we place our happinesse, in
the increase of their number.<note place="margin">Psal. 21. 14.</note> What is this <hi>wisedome?</hi> he tells us there; <hi>He asked life
of thee, and thou gavest it him:</hi> But was that this life? It was <hi>Length of dayes for ever
and ever,</hi> the dayes of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As houses</hi> that stand <hi>in two Shires,</hi> trouble the execution of Justice, the house of death
that stands in two worlds, may trouble a good mans resolution. As death is a sordid
<hi>Postern,</hi> by which I must be thrown out of this world, I would decline it: But as death
is the gate, by which I must enter into Heaven, would I never come to it? certainly
now, now that <hi>Sinne</hi> hath made life so miserable, if God should deny us death, he
multiplied our misery. We are in this Text, upon blessings appropriated to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, and so to these times. And in <hi>theseTimes,</hi> we have not so long life, as
the Patriarchs had before. They were to multiply children for replenishing the world,
and to that purpose had long life. We multiply sinnes, and the children and off-spring
of sinnes, miseries, and therefore may be glad to get from this generation of Vipers.
God gave his Children <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Quails,</hi> in the Wildernesse, where nothing else
was to be had; but when they came to the Land of Promise, that Provision ceas'd: God
gave them long life in the times of <hi>Nature,</hi> and long, (though shorter then before) in
the times of the <hi>Law;</hi> because in nature especially, but in the Law also, it was hard to
discern, hard to attain the wayes to Heaven. But the wayes to Heaven are made so
manifest to us in the Gospel, as that for that use, we need not long life; and that is all
the use of our life here. He that is ready for Heaven, hath lived to a blessed age; and
to such an intendment, a childe newly baptized may be elder then his Grandfather.
Therefore we receive long life for a blessing, when God is pleased to give it; though
<hi>Christ</hi> entered it into no <hi>Petition of his Prayer,</hi> that God would give it: and so though
we enter it into no Petition, nor Prayer, we receive it as a blessing too, when God will
afford us a deliverance, a manumission, an emancipation from the miseries of this life.
Truely I would not change that joy and consolation, which I proposed to my hopes,
upon my <hi>Death-bed,</hi> at my passage out of this world, for all the joy that I have had in
this world over again. And so very a part of the Joy of Heaven is a joyfull transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from hence, as that if there were no more reward, no more recompence, but that
I would put my self to all that belongs to the duty of an honest Christian in the world,
onely for a joyfull, a cheerfull passage out of it. And farther we shall not exercise
your patience, or your devotion, upon these three pieces which constitute our first
part: The Primogeniture of Gods Mercy, which is first in all; The specification of
Gods Mercy, long Life, as it is a figure of, and a way to eternity; and then the associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of Gods Mercy; that Death, as well as Life, is a blessing to the Righteous.</p>
                     <p>So then we have brought our Sunne to his <hi>Meridianall height,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Part. 2.</note> to a full Noon, in
which all shadows are removed: for even the <hi>shadow of death,</hi> death it self is a blessing,
and in the number of his Mercies. But the <hi>Afternoon shadows</hi> break out upon us, in our
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93359:121"/>
second part of the Text. And as afternoon shadowes do, these in our Text do also;
they grow greater and greater upon us, till they end in night, in everlasting night, <hi>The
sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</hi> Now of shadowes it is appliably said,
<hi>Vmbrae non sunt tenebrae sed densior lux,</hi> shadowes are not utter darknesse, but a thicker
light; shadowes are thus much nearer to the nature of light then darknesse is, that
shadowes presume light, which darknesse doth not; shadowes could not be, except
there were light. The first shadowes in this dark part of our Text, have thus much
light in them, that it is but the <hi>sinner,</hi> onely the sinner that is accursed. The Object
of Gods malediction, is not <hi>man,</hi> but <hi>sinfull man.</hi> If God make a man sinne, God
curses the man;<note place="margin">August.</note> but if sinne make God curse, God curses but the sinne. <hi>Non talem De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
tuum putes, qualis nec tu debes esse,</hi> Never propose to thy self such a God, as thou
wert not bound to imitate: Thou mistakest God, if thou make him to be any such
thing, or make him to do any such thing, as thou in thy proportion shouldst not be,
or shouldst not do. And shouldst thou curse any man that had never offended, never
transgrest, never trespast thee? Can God have done so? Imagine God, as the Poet
saith, <hi>Ludere in humanis,</hi> to play but a <hi>game at Chesse</hi> with this world; to sport himself
with making little things great, and great things nothing: Imagine God to be but at
play with us, but a gamester, yet will a gamester <hi>curse,</hi> before he be in danger of losing
any thing?<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 13.</note> Will God curse man, before man have sinned? In the Law there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiations
of <hi>curses</hi> enjoyned and multiplied: There is <hi>maledictus</hi> upon <hi>maledictus;</hi>
but it is <hi>maledictus homo,</hi> cursed be the man; He was not curst by God, <hi>before</hi> he was
a man; nor curst by God, <hi>because</hi> he was a man; but if that man commit <hi>Idolatry, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Incest, Beastiality, Bribery, Calumny,</hi> (as the sinnes are reckoned there) there he
meets a particular <hi>curse,</hi> upon his particular sinne. The book of Life is but names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Heaven; all the Book of Death, that is, is but that in the Prophet, when <hi>names
are written in the Earth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 13.</note> But whose names are written in the Earth there? <hi>They that
depart from thee, shall be written in the Earth:</hi> They shall be, when they depart from
thee. For saith he, <hi>They have forsaken the Lord, the Fountain of Living water;</hi> They
did not that, because their names were written in the Earth, but they were written
there, because they did that. <hi>Our Saviour Christ</hi> came hither to do all his Fathers will;
and he returned cheerfully to his Father again, as though he had done all, when he had
taken away the sinnes of the world by dying for all sinnes, and all sinners. But if there
were an <hi>Hospitall</hi> of miserable men, that lay under the <hi>reprobation</hi> and malediction of
<hi>Gods decree,</hi> and not for sinne; the blood of that Lamb is not sprinkled upon the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stills
of that doore. Forgive me <hi>O Lord, O Lord</hi> forgive me my sinnes, the sinnes of
my youth, and my present sinnes, the sinne that my Parents cast upon me, Originall
sinne, and the sinnes that I cast upon my children, in an ill example; Actuall sinnes,
sinnes which are manifest to all the world, and sinnes which I have so laboured to hide
from the world, as that now they are hid from mine own conscience, and mine own
memory; Forgive me my crying sins, and my whispering sins, sins of uncharitable hate,
and sinnes of unchaste love, sinnes against <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> against thy Power O Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

and Inferiours; and sinnes against <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>Me,</hi> against mine own soul, and against my

sinnes, all my sinnes, and I will put <hi>Christ</hi> to no more cost, nor thee to more trouble,
for any reprobation or malediction that lay upon me, otherwise then as a sinner. I ask
but an application, not an extention of that Benediction, <hi>Blessed are they whose sinnes are

thou saw'st me as a sinner; For the object of malediction is but a <hi>sinner,</hi> (which

God. But this is not said of one, first, wry step; but it is a <hi>walking,</hi> which implies
a long, and a considerate continuance. And if man come to sinne so, and will not walk
with <hi>God, God</hi> will walk with that man in his own pace, and overthrow him in his
own wayes. Nay, it is not onely in that place, <hi>If you walk contrary to me, In occursu,</hi> as

if God neglect you, forget, pretermit you, it is a miserable annihilation, a fearfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction.
But God begins not before sinne, nor at the first sinne. God did not curse
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> for their sinne; it was there first, and God foresaw they would not be

who had sinned in Gods Court, in Heaven, before, and being banished from thence,
fell into this <hi>transmarine treason,</hi> in <hi>another land,</hi> to seduce Gods other Subjects there,
him God accurs'd. Who amongst us can say, that he had <hi>a Fever</hi> upon his <hi>first excesse,</hi>

an everlasting sinner, God comes not to curse him.</p>
                     <p>But then <hi>Quamvis centum annorum,</hi> though he have lived a hundred yeares, though
God have multiplied upon him Evidences, and Seals, and Witnesses, and Possessions,
and Continuances, and prescriptions of his favour, all this hath not so riveted God to
that man, as that God must not depart from him. God was crucified for him, but will
not be crucified to him; still to hang upon this Crosse, this perversnesse of this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
sinner, and never save himself and come down, never deliver his own Honour, by
delivering that sinner to malediction. It is true, that we can have no better Title to
<hi>Gods future Blessings,</hi> then his Blessings formerly exhibited to us; God former bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
are but his <hi>marks</hi> set up there, that he may know that place, and that man the
better against another time, when he shall be pleased to come thither again with a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of more Blessings: God gives not Blessings as <hi>payments,</hi> but as <hi>obligations;</hi> and
becomes a debtor by giving. If I can produce that, <hi>Remember thy mercies of old,</hi> I need
ask no new; for even that is a <hi>Specialty</hi> by which God hath bound himself to me for
more. But yet not so, if I abuse his former Blessings, and make them occasions of
sinne. <hi>How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathers her chickens,</hi> saith <hi>Christ,</hi> I
know not how often; surely very often; for <hi>many hundreds of yeares:</hi> But yet, how
often soever, God left them open to the <hi>Eagle, the Romane Eagle</hi> at last. God gives
thee a <hi>recovery</hi> from sicknesse, that doth not make thee Immortall. God gives thee a
good interpretation of thine actions from a gracious Prince, this doth not make thee
impeccable in thy self. God gives thee titles of Honour upon thy self, this doth not
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93359:122"/>
alwayes give thee honour,<note place="margin">Psalm. 113. 7.</note> and respect from others. For as it is God that <hi>Raiseth up
the poore out of the dust,</hi> and <hi>lifteth the needy out of the dunghill, that he may set him with
Princes;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 86. 12.</note> so it is God that <hi>Cuts off the spirit of Princes,</hi> and is <hi>terrible to the Kings of the
Earth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psalm. 33. 10.</note> It is God that <hi>maketh the devices of the People of none effect,</hi> and it is God <hi>that
destroyes the Counsels of Egypt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay 19. 3.</note> It is God that <hi>maketh their Nobles like Oreb,</hi> and <hi>like
Zeb,</hi> and <hi>like them that perisht at Endor,</hi> and <hi>became as dung for the Earth;</hi> that is, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
onely in their ruine, and conculcation. And so with the same unwillingnesse,
that God comes to the execution, we come to the denunciation of this malediction.
They, They, these inveterate, incorrigible sinners, <hi>Quamvis centum annorum,</hi> though
God have spared them so long, yet <hi>Quia centum annorum,</hi> because they have imployed
all that time in sinne, <hi>They shall be accursed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Accursing</hi> is <hi>malediction,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Maledictus.</note> 
                        <hi>malediction</hi> is literally but <hi>maledicence;</hi> and that is but
<hi>evill speaking.</hi> Now all kinds of evill speaking do not inwrap a man within the curse
of this Text; For, though it be a shrewd degree of this curse of God, to be generally
ill spoken of by sad, sober, and discreet, and dis-passioned, and dis-interessed <hi>Men,</hi> yet
we are fallen into times, when men will speak ill of men, in things which they do not
know, nor should not know, and out of credulity and easie beleeving of men, whom
they should not beleeve; men distempered and transported with passion: So men speak
evill out of passion, and out of compassion; out of humour, and out of rumour. But
malediction in our Text, is an Imprecation of evil, by such men as would justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
it if they could, and because they cannot, they pray to God that he would, and
he doth: When God seconds the Imprecations of good men, that is this curse. <hi>The</hi>
Person that is curst here is <hi>Peccator centum annorum;</hi> an habituall, an incorrigible sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
If you put me to assigne, <hi>in what rank of men,</hi> Magistrates or Subjects, rich or
poore, Judges or prisoners, <hi>All.</hi> If you put me to assigne, for <hi>what</hi> sinnes, sins of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion</hi>
and constitution, sinnes of societie and <hi>conversation,</hi> sinnes of our <hi>profession,</hi>
and <hi>calling,</hi> sinnes of the particular <hi>place,</hi> or of the whole <hi>times,</hi> that we live in, sins of
<hi>profit,</hi> or sins of <hi>pleasure,</hi> or sins of <hi>glory;</hi> (for we all do some sins which are sins <hi>merely</hi>
of <hi>glory;</hi> sins that we make no profit by, nor take much pleasure in, but do them onely
out of a mis-imagined necessity, left we should go too much lesse, and sink in the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the World, if we did them not;) if I must say which of these sinnes put us
under this curse, <hi>All;</hi> If he be <hi>centum annorum,</hi> Inveterate, Incorrigible, <hi>He is accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
But then who curses him? God put an extraordinary spirit, and produc'd extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
effects from <hi>curses,</hi> in the mouths of his Prophets which have been since the
World began.<note place="margin">2 Reg. 2.</note> So <hi>Elizeus</hi> curses, and two Bears destroy fourty two persons. These
curses are deposited by God, in the Scriptures, and then inflicted by the <hi>Church,</hi> in her
ordinary jurisdiction, by <hi>excommunications,</hi> and other censures. But this may be but
matter of <hi>form</hi> in the Church, or matter of indignation in the Prophet. Not so, but as
God saith,<note place="margin">Esay.</note> 
                        <hi>That the rod in Ashurs hand is his rod,</hi> and the <hi>sword in Babylons hand his
sword,</hi> so the curse deposited in the Scripture, and denounced by the Church, is his
<hi>curse.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Amos.</note> For as the Prophet saith, <hi>Non est malum,</hi> all the evill (that is, all the <hi>penall</hi> ill,
all plagues, all warre, all famine,) that is <hi>done</hi> in the World, God doth; so all the evill
that is spoken, all the curses deposited in the Scriptures, and denounced by the Church,
God speaks. But be all this so; <hi>there is</hi> a curse deposited, denounced, seconded by
God; yet, all this is but malediction, but <hi>a speaking,</hi> here is no <hi>execution</hi> spoken of:
yes, there is, for as the sight of God is Heaven, and to be banisht from the sight of
God, is Hell in the World to come, so the blessing of God, is Heaven, and the curse
of God is Hell and damnation, even in this Life. The <hi>Hieroglyphique</hi> of silence, is the
hand upon the mouth; If the hand of God be gone from the mouth, it is gone to
strike.<note place="margin">Esay.</note> If it be come to an <hi>Os Domini locutum,</hi> that the mouth of the Lord have spoken
it, it will come presently to an <hi>Immittam manum,</hi> That God will lay his hand upon us,
in which one Phrase,<note place="margin">Exod. 7. 4.</note> all the plagues of Egypt are denounced. <hi>Solomon</hi> puts both <hi>hand</hi>
and <hi>tongue</hi> together;<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>In manibus linguae,</hi> saith he, <hi>Death and Life are in the hand of the
tongue: Gods Tongue</hi> hath a <hi>hand;</hi> where his Sentence goeth before, the execution fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
Nay, in the execution of the last sentence, we shall feel the Hand, before we
heare the Tongue, the execution is before the sentence; It is, <hi>Ite maledicti,</hi> go ye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed:
First, you must <hi>Go, go out of the presence of God;</hi> and by that being gone, you
shall know, that you are accursed; Whereas in other proceedings, the sentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93359:122"/>
nounces the execution, here the execution denounces the sentence. But be all this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be thus; There is a malediction deposited in the Scriptures, denounced by
the Church, ratified by God, brought into execution, yet it may be born, men doe
bear it. How men do bear it, we know not; what passes between God and those men,
upon whom the curse of God lieth, in their dark <hi>horrours at midnight,</hi> they would not
have us know, because it is part of their curse, to envy God that glory. But we may
consider in some part the insupportablenesse of that weight, if we proceed but so farre,
as to accommodate to God, that which is ordinarily said of naturall things. <hi>Corruptio
optimi pessima;</hi> when the best things change their nature, they become worst. When
God, who is all sweetnesse, shall have learned frowardnesse from us, as <hi>David</hi> speaks;
and being all rectitude, shall have learned perversenesse and crookednesse from us, as
<hi>Moses</hi> speaks; and being all providence, shall have learned negligence from us: when
God who is all Blessing, hath learned to curse of us, and being of himself spread as an
universall Hony-combe over All, takes in an impression, a tincture, an infusion of gall
from us, what extraction of Wormwood can be so bitter, what exaltation of fire can
be so raging, what multiplying of talents can be so heavy, what stifnesse of destiny can
be so inevitable, what confection of gnawing worms, of gnashing teeth, of howling
cries, of scalding brimstone, of palpable darknesse, can be so, so insupportable, so inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible,
so in-imaginable, as the curse and malediction of God? <hi>And therefore</hi> let
not us by our works provoke,<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 9.</note> nor by our words teach God to curse. Lest if <hi>with the
same tongue that we blesse God, we curse Men;</hi> that is, seem to be in Charity in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
here, and carry a ranckerous heart, and venemous tongue home with us God come

<hi>clothed himself with cursing,</hi> as <hi>with a garment, so let it be as a girdle, wherewith he is
girded continually:</hi> When a man curses out of <hi>Levity,</hi> and makes a loose habit of that
sinne, God shall so gird it to him, as he shall never devest it. The Devils grammar is
<hi>Applicare Activa Passivis,</hi> to apply Actives to Passives; where he sees an inclination,
to subminister a temptation; where he seeth a froward choler, to blow in a curse. And
Gods grammar is to <hi>change</hi> Actives into Passives: where a man delights in cursing,
to make that man accursed. And if God do this to them who do but curse men, will
he do lesse to them, who blaspheme himself? where man wears out <hi>Aeternum suum,</hi>
(as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh) his own eternity, his own hundred yeares; that is, his whole
life, in cursing and blaspheming, God shall also extend his curse, <hi>In aeterno suo,</hi> in his
eternity, that is, for <hi>ever.</hi> Which is that, that falls to the bottome, as the heaviest of
all, and is our last consideration; that all the rest, that there is a curse deposited in the
Scriptures, denounced by the Church, avowed by God, reduced to execution, and
that insupportable in this life, is infinitely aggravated by this, that he shall be <hi>accursed
for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>Anathema Maran-atha,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aeternum.</note> accursed <hi>till the Lord come;</hi> and when the Lord
cometh, he cometh not to reverse, nor to alleviate, but to ratifie and aggravate that
curse. As soon as Christ curst the <hi>fig-tree,</hi> it withered, and it never recovered: for

Ghost</hi> hath put here a number of yeares, a hundred yeares: We sinne long, as long
as we can, but yet sinne hath an end. But in this curse of God in the Text, there is
no number; it is an <hi>indefinite</hi> future; <hi>He shall be accursed:</hi> A mile of cyphers or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
added to the former hundred, would not make up a minute of this eternity.
Men have calculated how many particular graines of sand, would fill up all the vast
space butween the Earth and the Firmament: and we find, that a few lines of cyphers
will designe and expresse that number. But if every grain of sand were that number,
and multiplied again by that number, yet all that, all that inexpressible, inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number, made not up one minute of this eternity; neither would this curse, be a
minute the shorter for having been indured so many Generations, as there were grains
of sand in that number. Our <hi>Esse,</hi> our <hi>Being,</hi> is from Gods saying, <hi>Dixit</hi> &amp; <hi>facti,</hi> God
spoke, and we were made: our <hi>Bene esse,</hi> our <hi>well-being,</hi> is from Gods saying too;
<hi>Bene-dicit</hi> God blesses us, in speaking gratiously to us. Even our <hi>ill-being,</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
is from Gods saying also: for <hi>Malediction</hi> is <hi>Damnation.</hi> So far God hath
gone with us that way, as that our Being, our well-being, our ill-being is from his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But God shall never come to a <hi>Non esse,</hi> God shall never say to us, <hi>Be nothing,</hi>
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:93359:123"/>
God shall never succour us with an <hi>annihilation,</hi> nor give us the ease of resolving into
nothing, for this curse flowes on into an <hi>everlasting</hi> future, <hi>He shall be accurst,</hi> he shall
be so for <hi>ever.</hi> In a true sense we may say, that Gods <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> growes lesse and
lesse every day; for his fore-knowledge is of <hi>future</hi> things, and many things which
were future heretofore are past, or present now; and therefore cannot fall under his
fore-knowledge: His fore-knowledge in that sense, growes lesse, and decaieth. But
his eternity decayeth in no sense; and as long as his eternity lasts, as long as God is
God, God shall never see that soul, whom he hath accurst, delivered from that curse,
or eased in it.</p>
                     <p>But we are now in the work of an houre, and no more. If there be a minute of sand
left, (There is not) If there be a minute of patience left, heare me say, This minute that
is left, is that eternitie which we speake of; upon this minute dependeth that eternity:
And this minute, God is in this Congregation, and puts his eare to every one of your
hearts, and hearkens what you will bid him say to your selves: whether he shall blesse
you for your acceptation, or curse you for your refusall of him this minute: for this
minute makes up your <hi>Century,</hi> your hundred yeares, your eternity, because it may be
your last minute. We need not call that a <hi>Fable,</hi> but a <hi>Parable,</hi> where we heare, That
a Mother to still her froward childe told him, she would cast him to the Wolf, the
Wolf should have him; and the Wolf which was at the doore, and within hearing,
waited, and hoped he should have the childe indeed: but the childe being still'd, and
the Mother pleased, then she saith, so shall we kill the Wolf, the Wolf shall have none
of my childe, and then the Wolf stole away. No metaphor, no comparison is too
high, none too low, too triviall, to imprint in you a sense of Gods everlasting good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
towards you. God bids your Mother the Church, and us her Servants for your
Souls, to denounce his judgements upon your sinnes, and we do it; and the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
<hi>Satan,</hi> beleeves us, before you beleeve us, and is ready on his part. Be you also
ready on your part, to lay hold upon those conditions, which are annext to all Gods
maledictions, Repentance of former, <hi>preclusion</hi> against <hi>future sinnes,</hi> and we shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ready, on our part to assist you with the <hi>Power</hi> of our <hi>Intercession,</hi> to deliver you
with the <hi>Keies</hi> of our <hi>Absolution,</hi> and to establish you with the <hi>seales</hi> of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi>
and so disappoint that <hi>Wolf,</hi> that roaring <hi>Lion,</hi> that seeks whom he may devour: Go in
Peace, and be this your Peace, to know this, <hi>Maledictus qui pendet in Cruce,</hi> God hath
laid the whole curse belonging to us upon him, that hangs upon the Crosse; But <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus
qui pendet in pendentem;</hi> To all them that hang upon him, that hangeth there,
God offereth now, all those blessings, which he that hangeth there hath purchased with
the inestimable price of his Incorruptible blood; And to this glorious <hi>Sonne</hi> of God,
who hath suffered all this, and to the most Almighty <hi>Father,</hi> who hath <hi>done</hi> all this,
and to the <hi>blessed Spirit of God,</hi> who offereth now to <hi>apply</hi> all this, be ascribed by us,
and by the whole Church, All power, praise, might, majesty, glory, and dominion,

two sticks as she told the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> to do that work. Every man that cometh to
heare here, every man that cometh to speak here, cometh not to build Churches, nor
to build Common-wealths; to speak onely of the duties of Kings, and of Prelates,
and of Magistrates; but that poore soul that gathers a stick or two, for the baking of

hath performed the commandment of this Text, <hi>Take heed what ye heare.</hi> He that is

man, (be that man dignified with Gods Character, the <hi>Character of Orders,</hi>) and lay hold
upon the meanest part of his speach, (be that speach dignified with Gods Ordinance,
be it a <hi>Sermon</hi>) even I, and any thing that I say here, and say thus, (spoken by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

what you heard; <hi>Take heed what you heare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These words were spoken by <hi>Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Divisio.</note> to his <hi>Apostles</hi> upon this occasion. He had told
them before, That since there was a candle lighted in the world, it must not be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a <hi>bushell,</hi> nor under a <hi>bed,</hi> verse 21. That all that is hid, should be made manifest;
That all that was kept secret, should come abroad, verse 22. That if any man had ears
to heare, he might heare, verse 23. That is, that the Mystery of salvation, which had
been hid from the world till now, was now to be published to the world, by their
Preaching, their Ministery, their Apostleship: And that therefore, since he was now
giving them their Commission, and their instructions; since all that they had in charge
for the salvation of the whole world, was onely that, that he delivered unto them, that
which they heard from him, they should take heed what they heard; <hi>Take heed what
you heare.</hi> In which he layeth a double obligation upon them: First, <hi>All</hi> that you hear
from me, you are to preach to the world; and therefore <hi>Take heed what you heare; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi>
none of that; And then, you are to preach no more then you heare from me; and
therefore <hi>Take heed what you heare;</hi> adde nothing to that. Be not over-timorous so to
prevaricate and forbear to preach that, which you have truely heard from me; But be
not over-venturous neither, to pretend a Commission when you have none, and to
preach that for my word, which is your own passion, or their purpose that set you up.
And when we shall have considered these words in this their first acceptation, as they
were spoken literally, and personally to the Apostles, we shall see also, that by reflexion
they are spoken to us, the Ministers of the Gospell; and not onely to us, of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
but to our Adversaries of the <hi>Romane perswasion</hi> too; and therefore, in that
part, we shall institute a short comparison, whether they or we do best observe this
commandment, <hi>Take heed what you heare;</hi> Preach all that, preach nothing but that,
which you have received from me. And having passed through these words, in both
those acceptations, literally to the Apostles, and by reflexion to all the Ministers of the
Gospell, the Apostles being at this time, when these words were spoken, but <hi>Hearers,</hi>
they are also by a fair accommodation appliable to you that are Hearers now, <hi>Take
heed what you heare:</hi> And since God hath extended upon you that glorification, that
beatification, as that he hath made you <hi>regale Sacerdotium,</hi> a royall Priesthood, since

legally; Publication before Judgement. God shall condemn no man, for not
beleeving in Christ, to whom Christ was never manifested. <hi>'Tis true,</hi> that God is said

will but whisper for my people, and gather them so. So Christ tells us things in <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
And so Christ speakes to us in our <hi>Ear;</hi> And these low voices, and holy whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings,
and halfe-silences, denote to us, the inspirations of his Spirit, <hi>as his Spirit
beares witnesse with our spirit;</hi> as the Holy Ghost insinuates himselfe into our soules,
and works upon us so, by his <hi>private motions.</hi> But this is not Gods ordinary way, to
be whispering of secrets. The first thing that God made, was <hi>light;</hi> The last thing,
that he hath reserved to doe; is the manifestation of the light of his Essence in our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.
And for Publication of himselfe here, by the way, he hath constituted a
<hi>Church,</hi> in a Visibility, in an eminency, <hi>as a City upon a hill;</hi> And in this Church, his
Ordinance is Ordinance indeed; his Ordinance of preaching batters the soule, and by
that breach, the Spirit enters; His Ministers are an <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> and shake an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
soule; They are the <hi>sonnes of thunder,</hi> and scatter a cloudy conscience; They are
as the fall of waters, and carry with them whole Congregations; 3000 at a Sermon,
5000 at a Sermon, a whole City, such a City as Niniveh at a Sermon; and they are
as the roaring of a Lion, where the Lion of the tribe of Juda, cries down the Lion
that seekes whom he may devour; that is, Orthodoxall and fundamentall truths, are
established against clamorous, and vociferant innovations. Therefore what Christ tels
us in the darke, he bids us speake in the light; and what he saies in our eare, he bids us
preach on the house top. Nothing is Gospell, not <hi>Evangelium,</hi> good message, if it
be not put into a Messengers mouth, and delivered by him; nothing is conducible to
his end, nor available to our salvation, except it be avowable doctrine, doctrine that
may be spoke alowd, though it awake them, that sleep in their sinne, and make them
the more froward, for being so awaked.</p>
                     <p>God hath made all things in a <hi>Roundnesse,</hi> from the round superficies of this earth,
which we tread here, to the round convexity of those heavens, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> (as long as they shal
have any beeing) shall be our footstool, when we come to heaven, God hath wrapped
up all things in Circles, and then a Circle hath no <hi>Angles;</hi> there are no <hi>Corners</hi> in a
Circle. Corner Divinity, clandestine Divinity are incompatible termes; If it be Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
it is avowable. <hi>The heathens</hi> served their Gods in Temples, <hi>sub dio,</hi> without roofs or
coverings, in a free opennesse; and, where they could, in Temples made of <hi>Specular
stone,</hi> that was transparent as glasse, or crystall, so as they which walked without in
the streets, might see all that was done within. And even nature it self taught the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man, to make that one argument of a man truly religious, <hi>Aperto vivere voto,</hi>
That he durst pray aloud, and let the world heare, what he asked at Gods hand; which
duty is best performed, when we joyne with the Congregation in publique prayer.
<hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> hath made that note upon the <hi>Donatists,</hi> That they were <hi>Clancularii,</hi>
clandestine Divines, Divines in Corners. And in <hi>Photius,</hi> we have such a note almost
upon all Heretiques; as the <hi>Nestorian</hi> was called <hi>Coluber,</hi> a snake, because though he
kept in the garden, or in the meadow, in the Church, yet he lurked and lay hid, to doe
mischief. And the <hi>Valentinian</hi> was called a Grashopper, because he leaped and skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from place to place; and that creature, the Grashopper, you may hear as you passe,
but you shall hardly find him at his singing; you may hear a Conventicle Schismatick,
heare him in his Pamphlets, heare him in his Disciples, but hardly surprize him at his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93359:124"/>
exercise. Publication is a fair argument of truth. That tasts of <hi>Luthers</hi> holy animosity,
and zealous vehemency, when he says, <hi>Audemus gloriari Christum à nobis primo vulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
other men had made some attempts at a Reformation, and had felt the pulse of
some persons, and some Courts, and some Churches, how they would relish a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
But <hi>Luther</hi> rejoyces with a holy exultation, That he first published it, that
he first put the world to it. So the Apostles proceeded; when they came in their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination,
to a new State, to a new Court, to Rome it selfe, they did not enquire,
how stands the Emperour affected to Christ, and to the preaching of his Gospel; Is
there not a <hi>Sister,</hi> or a <hi>Wife</hi> that might be wrought upon to further the preaching of
Christ? Are there not some persons, great in power and place, that might be content
to hold a party together, by admitting the preaching of Christ? This was not their
way; They only considered who sent them; Christ Jesus: And what they brough; <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to every soul that embraced Christ Jesus. That they preached; and still begunne
with a <hi>Vae si non;</hi> Never tell us of displeasure, or disgrace, or detriment, or death, for
preaching of Christ. For, <hi>woe be unto us,</hi> if we preach him not: And still they ended
with a <hi>Qui non crediderit, Damnabitur,</hi> Never deceive your own souls, He, to whom
Christ hath been preached, and beleeves not, shall be damned. All Divinity that is
bespoken, and not ready made, fitted to certaine turnes, and not to generall ends; And
all Divines that have their <hi>soules</hi> and <hi>consciences,</hi> so disposed, <hi>as their Libraries may bee,</hi>
(At that end stand Papists, and at that end Protestants, and he comes in in the middle,
as neare one as the other) all these have a brackish taste; as a River hath that comes
near the Sea, so have they, in comming so neare the Sea of Rome. In this the Prophet
exalts our Consolation,<note place="margin">Esai. 30. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Though the Lord give us the bread of Adversity, and the water of
Affliction, yes shall not our Teachers be removed into corners;</hi> (They shall not be silenced
by others, they shall not affect of themselves Corner Divinity. But (saies he there) our
<hi>eyes shall see our Teachers, and our eares shall hear a word, saying, This is the way, walke
in it.</hi> For so they shall declare, that they have taken to heart this Commandement of
him that sent them, Christ Jesus. <hi>All</hi> that you receive from me, you must deliver
to my people; therefore, Take heed what you hear; forget none of it. But
then you must deliver <hi>no more</hi> then that; and therefore in that respect also, Take heed
what you hear; adde nothing to that, and that is the other obligation which Christ
laies here upon his Apostles.</p>
                     <p>That reading of those words of <hi>Saint Iohn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Oblig. 2. 1 Ioh. 4. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Omnis spiritus qui solvit Iesum,</hi> Every
spirit that <hi>dissolves</hi> Jesus, that takes him asunder, in pieces, and beleeves not all, is a very
ancient reading of that place. And upon that Ancient reading, the Ancients infer well,
That not onely that spirit that denies that Christ being God, assumed our flesh, not
onely he that denies that Christ consists of two natures, God and Mam, but he also
that affirmes this Christ, thus consisting of two natures, to consist also of two persons,
<hi>this man dissolves Iesus,</hi> takes him asunder, in pieces, and slackens the band of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith, which faith is, That Christ consisting of two natures, in one person, suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the salvation of man. So then, not onely to <hi>take from</hi> Jesus, one of his natures,
God or man, but <hi>to adde to him,</hi> another person, this addition is a Diminution, a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
an annihilation of Jesus. So also to adde to the Gospel, to adde to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
to adde to the articles of faith, this addition is a Diminution, a Dissolution, an
Annihilation of those Scriptures, that Gospel, that faith, and the Author, and finisher
thereof. <hi>Iesus grew in stature,</hi> says the Gospel; But he grew not to his lifes end; we
know to, how many feet he grew. So the <hi>Scriptures</hi> grew to; the number of the books
grew; But they grow not to the worlds end, we know to how many bookes they
grew. The body of man and the vessels thereof, have a certain, and a limited capacity,
what nourishment they can receive and digest, and so a certaine, measure and stature to
extend to. The soul, and soul of the soul, <hi>Faith,</hi> and her faculties, hath a certain capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
too, and certain proportions of spirituall nourishments exhibited to it, in certaine
vessels, certaine measures, so many, these Bookes of Scriptures. And therefore as
Christ saies,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>Which of you can adde one Cubit to your stature?</hi> (how plentifully, and how
delicately soever you feed, how discreetly, and how providently soever you exercise, you
cannot doe that) so may he say to them who pretend the greatest power in the Church,
Which of you can adde another booke to the Scriptures, <hi>A Codicill</hi> to either of my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments?<note place="margin">22. 18.</note>
                        <hi>The curse</hi> in the Revelation fals as heavy upon them that <hi>adde</hi> to the booke
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93359:125"/>
of God, as upon them that take from it: Nay, it is easie to observe, that in all those
places of Scripture which forbid the taking away, or the adding to the Book of God,
still the commandment that they shall not, and still the malediction if they do, is <hi>first</hi>
placed upon the adding, and after upon the taking away. So it is in that former place,
Plagues upon him,<note place="margin">4. 2.</note> that takes away: but <hi>first,</hi> Plagues upon him, that addes: so in <hi>Deut.</hi>
you shall not diminish,<note place="margin">12. 32.</note> but first, you shall not adde: So again in that Book, whatsoever
I command you observe to do it: Thou shalt not diminish from it; but <hi>first,</hi> Thou
shalt not adde to it. And when the same commandment seems to be given in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">30. 6.</note> there is nothing at all said of taking away, but onely of adding, as though the
danger to Gods Church consisted especially in that; Every word of God, is pure, saith
<hi>Solomon</hi> there: Adde thou not unto his word, lest thou be reproved and found a lyer.
For, though heretofore some Heretiques have offered at that way, to clip Gods coin in
taking away some book of Scripture, yet for many blessed Ages, the Church hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
her peace in that point: None of the Books are denied by any church, there is
no substraction offered; But for addition of Apocryphal Books to Canonicall, the
Church of God is still in her Militant state, and cannot triumph: and though she have
victory, in all the Reasons, the cannot have peace. You see Christs way, to them that

Scripture. Our Sermons are Text and Discourse; Christ Sermons were all Text:
Christ was the <hi>Word;</hi> not onely the Essentiall Word, which was alwayes with God,
but the very written word too; Christ was the Scripture, and therefore, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
them to himselfe, he refers them to the Scriptures, for though here he seem onely,
to call upon them, to hearken to that which he spoke, yet it is in a word, of a deeper
impression; for it is <hi>Videte; See</hi> what you hear. Before you preach any thing for my
word, <hi>see it, see it written,</hi> see it in the body of the Scriptures. Here then lies the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obligation upon the Apostles, The salvation of the whole world lies upon your
preaching of that, of <hi>All</hi> That, of <hi>onely</hi> That, which you hear from me now, And
therefore, <hi>take heed what you hear.</hi> And farther we carry not your consideration, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this first acceptation of the words as they are spoken personally to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but
passe to the second, as by reflexion, they are spoken <hi>to us,</hi> the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
                     <p>In this consideration,<note place="margin">Part. 2.</note> we take in also our <hi>Adversaries;</hi> for we all pretend to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
of the Apostles; though not we, as they, in the Apostolicall, yet they as well as
we in the Evangelicall, and Ministeriall function: for, as that which Christ said to Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> he said in him, to all the Apostles, <hi>Vpon this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> so in this
which he saith to all the Apostles, he saith to all us also, <hi>Take heed what you heare.</hi> Be
this then the issue between them of the Roman distemper, and us; whether they or we,
do best perform this commandment, <hi>Take heed what you heare,</hi> conceal nothing of that
which you have heard, obtrude nothing but that which you have heard: Whether they
or we do best apply our practise to this rule, Preach all the Truth, preach nothing but
the Truth, be this <hi>lis contestata,</hi> the issue joyned between us, and it will require no long
pleading for matter of evidence;<note place="margin">An omnem. Matth. 4. 4. Deut. 8. 3.</note> first, our Saviour saith, Man liveth <hi>by every word,</hi> that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God. And this Christ saith from <hi>Moses</hi> also: so that
in the mouth of two unreproachable witnesses, <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> the Law, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
we have this established, Mans life is the Word of God, the Word is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And then our Saviour saith further, The Holy Ghost shall teach you <hi>all things,</hi>
and bring <hi>all things</hi> to your remembrance:<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 26.</note> and here is the Latitude, the Totality,
the Integrality of the meanes of salvation; you shall have Scriptures delivered to you,
by them the Holy Ghost shall teach you all things; and then you shall be remembred of
all, by the explication and application of those Scriptures, at Church, where lies the
principall operation of the Holy Ghost. Now, is this done in the Roman Church?
Are the Scriptures delivered, and explicated to them? To much of the Scriptures as
is read to them, in their Lessons and Epistles, and Gospels, is not understood when
it is read, for it is in an unknown language; so that, that way, the Holy Ghost teaches
them nothing. Neither are all the Scriptures distributed into these Lessons and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93359:125"/>
and Gospels which are read: so that if they did understand all they heard, yet
they did not heare all they were bound to understand. And for <hi>remembring</hi> them by
the way of preaching, though it be true, that the Reformation (by way of example,
though not by Doctrine) have so much prevailed upon them, as that they have now
twenty Sermons in that Church, for one that they had before <hi>Luther,</hi> yet if a man could
heare six Sermons a day, all the days of his life, he might die without having heard all
the Scriptures explicated in Sermons: But when men have a Christian liberty affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them to read the Scriptures at home, and then are remembred of those things at
Church, and there taught to use that liberty modestly, to establish their faith upon
places of Scripture that are plain, and to suspend their judgment upon obscurer pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
till they may, by due meanes, preaching or conference, receive farther satisfaction
therein, from them, who are thereunto authorized by God in his Church, there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is this Rule of our Saviours, <hi>Take heed what you hear,</hi> preach <hi>all</hi> that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from me, likelyer to be observed then there, where the body of the conveyance,
the Scripture it self is locked up from us; and the soule of the conveyance, the sense,
and interpretation of the Scriptures, is locked into one mans brest; and the <hi>Great Seal</hi> of
that conveyance, the Sacrament of our Reconciliation, is broken, and mutilated, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us but by halfe.</p>
                     <p>But they do not onely stray on that hand,<note place="margin">An solam.</note> in not giving <hi>all</hi> that the Scripture gives;
(They doe not give the liberty of <hi>meates,</hi> nor the liberty of <hi>mariage,</hi> which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
gives; Nay, they doe not give the liberty of <hi>trying,</hi> whether the Scripture give
it or no; for they doe not give the liberty of <hi>reading</hi> the Scriptures) But on the other
hand, they stray too, and further, That they deliver <hi>more</hi> then the Scriptures doe, and
make other Rules and Canons equall to Scriptures. In which excesse, they doe not
onely make the <hi>Apocryphall</hi> Books, (Books that have alwaies had a favourable aspect,
and benigne countenance from the Church of God) equall to Canonicall Scriptures,
But they make their decretall Epistles of their Popes and of their <hi>Extravagants,</hi> (as
they call them) and their occasionall <hi>Bulls,</hi> nay their <hi>Bull-baitings,</hi> their Buls fighting,
and crossing and contradicting one another, equall to Canonicall Scripture. So that
these men have put the salvation of the world, upon another science, upon another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
It is not the <hi>Divine,</hi> that is the Minister of salvation, but the <hi>Canonist.</hi> I must
not determine my beleef in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Creed, nor in <hi>Athanasius,</hi> nor in that of the
<hi>Nicen</hi> Fathers; not onely not the Scriptures, but not the Councels, nor Fathers must
give the Materials, and Elements of my faith, but the <hi>Canon law;</hi> for so they rule it:
<hi>Gratian</hi> that hath collected the sentences of Fathers and Councels, and digested them
into heads of Divinity, he is no rule of our beleef, because, say they, he is no part of
the body of the Canon law; But they that first compiled the <hi>Decretals,</hi> and the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagants,</hi>
and they who have since recompiled more <hi>Decretals,</hi> and more <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants,</hi>
the <hi>Clementins,</hi> and the <hi>Sextins,</hi> and of late yeares the <hi>Septims,</hi> with those of
<hi>Iohn the</hi> 22. these make up the body of the Canon law, and these must be our Rule;
what to beleeve. How long? Till they fall out with some State, with whom they are
friends yet, or grown friends with some State, that they are fallen out with now; and
then upon a new <hi>Decretall,</hi> a new <hi>Extravagant,</hi> I must contract a new, or enlarge, or
restrain my old beleef. Certainly, as in naturall things, the assiduity takes off the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
(The rising, and the setting of the sunne, would be a miracle to him, that should
see it but once) and as in civill things, the profusenesse, and the communication, and
the indifferency takes off the Dignity, (for, as gold is gold still, the heaviest metall of
all, yet if it be beat into leaf gold, I can blow it away; so Honour is honour still, the
worthyest object of the worthyest spirits, and the noblest reward of the greatest Princes,
yet the more have it, the lesse every one hath of it) So in the Roman Church, they
have not found a better way to justify their blasphemy of the insufficiency of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
then by making contemptible writings, as sufficient as Scriptures, equall to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
If they could make me beleeve, the Scriptures were no more sufficient then their
<hi>Decretals,</hi> and <hi>Extravagants,</hi> I should easily confesse there were no Scriptures suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for salvation. And farther we presse not this evidence, how farre they depart from
this rule, <hi>Take heed what you heare,</hi> How much <hi>lesse,</hi> and how much <hi>more</hi> then Christ
gave, they give, but passe to the third acceptation of these words, as, in a fair accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
they are spoken to <hi>you,</hi> who are now as the <hi>Apostles</hi> were then, <hi>Hearers, Take
heed what you heare.</hi>

                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:93359:126"/>And into this part I enter with such a protestation,<note place="margin">3 Part.</note> as perchance may not become
me: That this is the first time in all my life, <hi>(I date my life from my Ministery;</hi> for <hi>I received
mercy,</hi> as I received the ministery, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks) this is the first time, that in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of my Ministery, I wished the King away; That ever I had any kinde of loathnesse
that the King should hear all that I sayd. Here, for a little while, it will be a little other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
because in this branch, I am led, to speak of some particular duties of subjects;
and in my poor way, I have thought it somewhat an Eccentrique motion, and off of the
naturall Poles, to speake of the Duties of subjects before the King, or of the duties of
Kings, in publike and popular Congregations. As every man is <hi>a world</hi> in himself, so
every man hath <hi>a Church</hi> in himself; and as Christ referred the Church for hearing
to the Scriptures, so every man hath Scriptures in his own heart, to hearken to. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Superiours, and charity to others, are <hi>In-nate Scriptures;</hi> Obedience and
Charity, are the Naturall mans, the Civill mans, the Morall mans Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
Take heed, that is, observe what you heare from them, and they will direct
you well. And first, <hi>Take heed what you heare,</hi> is, take heed <hi>that</hi> you hear; That you
do hearken to them,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 47.</note> whom you should hear. Our Saviour saith, <hi>He that is of God, heareth
his words;</hi> ye therefore hear them not, because you are not his. Transferre this to a
civill application; to obedience to Superiors. Christ makes account that he hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
safely so; If you heare him not, you are none of his. If you heare him not in his
<hi>Lawes,</hi> heare him not in his <hi>Proclamations,</hi> heare him not in the <hi>Declarations</hi> of his
wants and necessities, you are none of his, that is, you had rather you were none of his:
There is a <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare</hi> smothered in our breasts, if we will not hear, and
we had rather we might devest our Allegeance, rather we might be no subjects. <hi>By the

word <hi>Charmer,</hi> signifies an eloquent, a persuasive man, a powerfull speaker; this Viper
will not hear such. And for the sinnes of a Nation, when those sinnes come to the
height,<note place="margin">8. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>God</hi> will first inflict that punishment in the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, I will send Serpents,
Cockatrices amongst you, which will not be charmed,</hi> that is, venimous, and mutinous, and
seditious spirits, upon whom, no language, no reason, no counsell, no perswasion can
prevail;<note place="margin">3. 1.</note> And then, he will second, and aggravate that punishment, with that in <hi>Esay,
The Lord shall take from Ierusalem, the man of warre, and the Iudge, and the Prophet, and
the honourable man, and the Counseller, and the eloquent Oratour.</hi> As when they will not
embrace religious duties, God shall take away their Preachers, so when they will not
believe their Civill dangers, God shall take from them the spirit of persuasibility, and
the power of perswasivenesse towards them, from them who should work upon them;
and leave them a miserable example of that fearefull rule, <hi>whom God will destroy, he
will infatuate first;</hi> from that Nation from whom God will depart, as he is the <hi>Lord of
hosts,</hi> and not fight their battels, he will depart first, as he is the <hi>Angel of the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi>
and not enlighten their understandings, that they might see their dangers. <hi>The
Potion</hi> of jealousie,<note place="margin">Num. 5. 12.</note> was a bitter potion, and a putrefying potion, where it was to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred;
and it was to be ministred to them, who gave the occasion of the jealousie.
Now not to have brought <hi>Saul presents,</hi> not to have contributed to his present wars,
and his present wants,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. ult.</note> this occasioned the jealousie; for so, says the text, <hi>They despised
Saul, and brought him no presents;</hi> This was evidence enough of their contempt, That
they brought him no presents. And where <hi>jealousies</hi> are so occasioned, much bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
may follow; many bitter potions may be administred; many bitter pilles may be
swallowed. And therefore, take heed <hi>that</hi> you heare, and hear so, as may in one act
testify your obedience to Superiours, and charity towards others, who are already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped in the same miseries, that may reach you; for obedience and charity are an
Old, and a New Testament.</p>
                     <p>Take heed that you heare them whom God hath appointed to speake to you; But,
when you come abroad, take heed <hi>what</hi> you hear; for, certainely, the Devill doth
not cast in more snares at the eye of man, then at the eare. Our Saviour Christ propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it as some remedy against a mischief,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 8.</note> That if <hi>the eye</hi> offend thee, thou mayst pull it
out, and if thy <hi>hand or foot offend thee,</hi> thou mayst <hi>cut it off,</hi> and thou art safe from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93359:126"/>
that offence. But he does not name nor mention the <hi>ear:</hi> for, if the ear betray thee,
though thou doe cut it off, yet thou art open to that way of treason still, still thou canst
heare. Where one man libels with the tongue, or hand, a hundred libel with the ear;
One man speakes, or writes, but a hundred applaud and countenance a calumny.
Therefore <hi>sepi aures tuas spinis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ecclus. 28. 28.</note> as the Vulgate reads that place, hedge thine eares with
thornes; that he that would whisper a calumny in thine ear, against another man, may
be pricked with those thornes, that is, may discern from thee, that he is not welcome to
thee, and so forbear; or if he will presse upon thee, those thorns may prick thee, and
warne thee that there is an uncharitable office done which thou shouldest not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p>Neither onely may thy charity towards another, be violated by such a whisperer,
but thine own safety endangered; And therefore, <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi> There are
two dangerous sorts of men, whom we call <hi>Auricularios, Earwigs</hi> transformed into men.
And certainely there is no Lycanthropie so dangerous, not when men are changed into
devouring wolfes, as when these Earwigs are metamorphos'd into men. The first sort
is of those, who take us into their eares; the other, that put themselves into ours. <hi>The
first</hi> are they, that receive <hi>Auricular confessions;</hi> in which a man will propose to his
Confessar, treasonable and bloody purposes; and if he allow them, then it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a confession, but a consultation, and he may disclose it to any, whom he may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
draw in; But if his Confessar disallow it, then it retaines the nature of a confession
still, and being delivered under that Seale, it may not be revealed, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
cost Christendome, or, (as they expresse it) all the souls, that Christ hath dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for. And of these <hi>Earwigs,</hi> of these Auricular men, we had shrewd experience in
the carriage of that treason, the <hi>Emphaticall Treason,</hi> in respect of which, all other
Treasons are but Trespasses, all Rebellions but Ryots, all Battayls but Frays. <hi>But
then,</hi> the more frequent, and the more dangerous <hi>Earwig</hi> is he, that upon pretence of
trusting thee with a secret, betrays thee, and therefore <hi>Take heed what you hear. Barte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
that great Lawyer, had delivered it for law, that whosoever hears treason, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
it not, is a Traitour. And though <hi>Baldus,</hi> a great Lawyer, and one between
whom, and <hi>Bartolus,</hi> the scales are even, say, That <hi>Bartolus</hi> his soule, and all their
soules that follow him in that opinion, burne in hell for that uncharitablenesse, yet, to
verify that, that the most doe goe to hell, the most doe follow <hi>Bartolus,</hi> and so thy
danger, that huntest after the knowledge of great secrets, is the greater, and therefore,
<hi>Take heed what you heare. Arridet tibi homo, &amp; instar privati sermones occupat,</hi> says the
little great <hi>Epictetus,</hi> or <hi>Arrian</hi> upon him, a man will put himself into thy company,
and speake in the confidence of a deare friend, and then, <hi>De Principe inclementer loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
he comes to speake boldly and irreverently of the greatest persons; and thou
thinkest thou hast found <hi>Exemplum &amp; monumentum fidei,</hi> a rare, a noble, an ingenuous,
a free, and confident Spirit, <hi>Et pertexis, quod prior inceperat;</hi> Thou doest but say on
that which he was saying, and make up his sentence, or doest but believe him, or doest
but not say, that thou doest not believe him, and thy few words, thy no words, may
cost thee thy life. <hi>Per ornamenta ferit,</hi> says the Patriarch, and Oracle of Morall men,
<hi>Seneca;</hi> This whisperer wounds thee, and with a stilletta of gold, he strangles thee with
scarfes of silk, he smothers thee with the down of Phoenixes, he stifles thee with a
perfume of Ambar, he destroys thee by praising thee, overthrows thee by exalting thee,
and undoes thee by trusting thee; By trusting thee with those secrets that bring thee
into a desperate perplexity, <hi>Aut alium accusare in subsidium tui,</hi> (as the Patriarch, and
Oracle of States-men, <hi>Tacitus,</hi> says) Either to betray another, that pretends to have
trusted thee, or to perish thy selfe, for the saving of another, that plotted to betray
thee. And therefore, if you can heare a good Organ at Church, and have the musique
of a domestique peace at home, peace in thy walls, peace in thy bosome, never hearken
after the musique of sphears, never hunt after the knowledge of higher secrets, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
to thee; But since Christ hath made you <hi>Regale Sacerdotium,</hi> Kings and Priests,
in your proportion, <hi>Take heed what you hear,</hi> in derogation of either the State, or the
Church.</p>
                     <p>In declaring ill affections towards others,<note place="margin">Regnum. Exod. 21. 17.</note> the Holy Ghost hath imprinted these steps.
First, he begins at home, in Nature, <hi>He that curseth Father or Mother shall surely be put
to death;</hi> and then, as families grow out into Cities, the Holy Ghost goes out of the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93359:127"/>
house,<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 28.</note> into the consideration of the State, and says, <hi>Thou shalt not curse the Ruler of
the people, no Magistrate.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 21.</note> And from thence he comes to the highest upon earth, for in
<hi>Samuel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 24. 15.</note> it comes to a cursing of the <hi>Lords Anointed;</hi> and from thence to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in heaven, Whosoever <hi>curseth his God,</hi> shall bear his sinne; and as though both those
grew out of one another, The cursing of the King, and the cursing of God, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Esai</hi> hath joyned them together,<note place="margin">8. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>They shall be hungry,</hi> says he, (indigent, poor,
penurious) <hi>and they shall fret,</hi> (be transported with ungodly passion) <hi>and they shall curse
their King and their God:</hi> If they doe one, they will doe the other. The Devil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
from what height he is fallen, and therefore still clambers upward, and still
directs all our sinnes, in his end, upon God: Our end, in a sin, may be pleasure, or
profit, or satisfaction of affections, or passions; but the Devils end in all is, that
God may be violated and dishonoured in that sinne: And therefore by casting in ill
conceptions and distasts, first, against Parents and Masters at home, and then against
subordinate Magistrates abroad, and so against the Supreme upon earth, He brings us
to ill conceptions and distasts against God himself; first, to thinke it liberty to bee
under no Governour, and then, liberty to be under no God; when as, onely those
two services, of a gracious God, and of a good King, are <hi>perfect freedome.</hi> Therefore
the wise King <hi>Solomon</hi> meets with this distemper in the root, at first ebullition, in the
heart;<note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Curse not the King, no not in thy thought;</hi> for, that Thought hath a tongue, and
hath spoken, and sayd Amen in the eares of God; That which thy heart hath said,
though the Law have not, though the Jury have not, though the Peers have not,
God hath heard thee say. The word which <hi>Solomon</hi> uses there, is <hi>Iadung;</hi> and that
our Translators have in the margin called <hi>Conscience;</hi> Curse not the King, no not in
thy conscience; Doe not thou pronounce, that whatsoever thou dislikest, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with a good conscience; never make thy private conscience the rule of publique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
for to constitute a Rectitude, or an Obliquity in any publique action, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                           </gap>ng,</hi> signifies properly all waies of acquiring knowledge, and
Hearing is one of them, and therefore, <hi>Take heed what you heare:</hi> Come not so neare

A man may have a good breath in himself, and yet be deadly infected, if he stand in
an ill ayre; a man may stand in a cloud, in a mist, in a fogge of blasphemers, till, in the
sight of God, himself shall be dissolved into a blasphemous wretch, and in that cloud,
in that mist, God shall not know him, that endured the hearing, from him, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
the speaking of those blasphemies. The ear, in such cases, is as the clift in the
wall, that receives the voice, and then the Echo is below, in the heart; for the most
part, the heart affords a returne, and an inclination to those things that are willingly
received at the ear; The Echo returnes the last syllables; The heart concludes with
his conclusions, whom we have been willing to hearken unto. We make <hi>Satyrs;</hi> and
we looke that the world should call that <hi>wit;</hi> when God knowes, that that is in a great
part, self-guiltinesse, and we doe but reprehend those things, which we our selves have
done, we cry out upon the illnesse of the times, and we make the times ill: so the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator
whispers those things, which are true, no where, but in himselfe. But thy
greater danger, is that mischievous purpose, (which we spake of before) to endanger
thee by hearing, and to entangle thee in that Dilemma, of which, an ingenuous man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
one part, as much as a conscientious man does the other, That thou must be a
Delinquent, or an Accuser, a Traitour or an Informour: God hath imprinted in thee
characters of a better office, and of more dignity, of a Royall Priesthood; as you have
sparks of Royaltie in your soules, Take heed what you hear of State-government;
as you have sparks of holy fire, and Priesthood in your soules, Take heed what you
heare of Church-government, which is the other consideration.</p>
                     <p>The Church is the spouse of Christ: Noble husbands do not easily admit defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their wives.<note place="margin">Ecclesia.</note> Very religious Kings may have had wives, that may have retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
some tincture, some impressions of errour, which they may have sucked in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
from another Church, and yet would be loth, those wives should be publikely
traduced to be Heretiques, or passionately proclaimed to be Idolaters for all that. A
Church may lacke something of exact perfection, and yet that Church should not be
said to be a supporter of Antichrist, or a limme of the beast, or a thirster after the cup of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93359:127"/>
                        <hi>Babylon,</hi> for all that. From extream to extream, from east to west, the <hi>Angels</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot come, but by passing the middle way between; from that extream im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,
in which Antichrist had damped the Church of God, to that intemerate purity,
in which Christ had constituted his Church, the most Angelicall Reformers cannot
come, but by touching, yea, and stepping upon some things, in the way. He that is
come to any end, remembers when he was not at the middle way; he was not there as
soon as he set out. It is the posture reserved for heaven, to sit down, at the right hand
of God; Here our consolation is, that God reaches out his hand to the receiving of
those who come towards him; And nearer to him, and to the institutions of his Christ,
can no Church, no not of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> be said to have come, then ours does. It is
an ill nature in any man, to be rather apt to conceive jealousies, and to suspect his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
honour, or his sisters chastity, then a strange womans. It is an irreverent unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
to think worse of that Church, which hath bred us, and fed us, and led us
thus far towards God, then of a forein Church, though <hi>Reformed</hi> too, and in a good
degree. How often have I heard our <hi>Church</hi> condemned abroad, for opinions, which
our Church never held? And how often have I heard forein Churches exalted and
magnified at home, for some things in the observation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which, indeed, those Churches doe not hold, nor practise?
<hi>Take heed what you heare;</hi> And that ill, which you heare of your own Church, at
home, by Gods abundant goodnesse to it, is not true; And, I would all that good,
which you heare of Churches abroad, were true; but I must but wish, that it were so,
and pray that it may be so, and praise God, for those good degrees towards it, which
they have attained; But no Church in the world, gives us occasion of emulation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, or of undervaluing Gods blessings upon ours. And therefore, as to us,
who pretend an ambassage from him, if we make our selves unworthy of that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
God shall say,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for, in them, there is both a <hi>Videte,</hi> and a <hi>Cavete,</hi> first see that you doe heare them, and
then take heed what you heare from them. Men will speake; and they will speake of
you: Men will discourse, and you must be their subject; Men will declame, and
you must be their Theme. And truely you should desire to be so: As onely man can
speake, so onely man can desire to be spoken of. If gold could speake, if gold could
wish, gold would not be content to lie in the darke, in the mine, but would desire to
come abroad, to entertain Armies, or to erect, or endow Civill, or Ecclesiasticall
buildings. He that desires to <hi>Print</hi> a book, should much more desire, <hi>to be</hi> a book; to
do some such exemplar things, as men might read, and relate, and profit by. He that
hath done nothing worth the speaking of, hath not kept the world in reparations, for
his Tenement and his Terme. <hi>Videte,</hi> see that you doe hear, That you doe give occasion
to be spoken of, that you doe deserve the praise, the thankes, the testimony, the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation

mistrust Christ, doe not disable Christ, from doing a miracle, in thy behalfe, by not
beleeving; as, in one place, where he came, it is said that Christ <hi>could</hi> not doe much,
by reason of their unbeleefe. Heare God there, where God speaks to thee, and then
thou shalt heare, that, that he speakes to thee. Above, in heaven, in his decrees, he
speakes to himselfe, to the Trinity: In the Church, and in the execution of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
he speakes to thee. Climbe not up, to the search of unsearchable things,
to the finding out of investigable things, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speakes; but look to that
which is neare thee; not so much to those Decrees which have no conditions, as to be
able to plead conditions performed, or, at least, a holy sorrow, that thou hast not
performed them. <hi>Videte, Cavete;</hi> see that you doe heare God, else every rumor will

absolute.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, since <hi>Satan</hi> will be speaking too, <hi>Videte,</hi> be sure you doe heare him, be
sure you discerne it to be his voice, and know <hi>what leads you into tentation.</hi> For, you
may hear a voice that shall say, youth must have pleasures, and greatnesse must have
State, and charge must have support. And this voice may bring a young man to
transfer all his wantonesse upon his years, when it is the effect of high dyet, or licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
discourse, or wanton Images admitted, and cherished in his fancy; and this voice
may bring great officers, to transfer their inaccessiblenesse, upon necessary State, when
it is an effect of their own lazinesse, or indulgence to their pleasures; and this voice
may bring rich landlords to transfer all their oppression of tenants, to the necessity of
supporting the charge of wives and children, when it is an effect of their profusenesse
and prodigality. Nay you may heare a voice, that may call you to this place, and yet
be his voice; which is that, which <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> confesses and laments, that even to
these places persons come to look upon one another, that can meet no where else.

that puts upon any man, a necessity of sinning, out of his years and constitution, out of
his calling and profession, out of his place, and station, out of the age, and times
that he lives in, out of the pleasure of them, that he lives upon, or out of the charge
of them, that live upon him. But then, <hi>Cavete,</hi> take heed what you heare from him
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93359:128"/>
too, especially then, when he speakes to thee upon thy death-bed, at thy last transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
then when thine eares shall be deafe, with the cryes of a distressed, and a distracted
family, and with the found, and the change of the found of thy last bell; then when thou
shalt heare a hollow voice in thy selfe, upbraiding thee, that thou hast violated all thy
Makers laws, worn out all thy Saviours merits, frustrated all the endeavours of his
blessed Spirit upon thee, evacuated all thine own Repentances, with relapses; then when
thou shalt see, or seem to see his hand turning the streame of thy Saviours bloud into
another channell, and telling thee, here's enough for <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Turke,</hi> but not a drop for
<hi>thee;</hi> then when in that multiplying glasse of <hi>Despaire,</hi> which he shall present, every
sinfull <hi>thought</hi> shall have the proportion of an Act, and every <hi>Act,</hi> of a <hi>Habite,</hi> when
every <hi>Circumstance</hi> of every sin, shall enter into the nature of the sin it selfe, and vary the
sinne, and constitute a particular sinne; and every particular sinne, shall be a sinne
against the holy Ghost; Take heed what you heare; and be but able to say to Satan
then, as Christ said to <hi>Peter,</hi> in his name, <hi>Vade retro Satan, come after me Satan,</hi> come
after me <hi>tomorrow;</hi> come a minute after my soule is departed from this body, come to
me, where I shall be then, and when thou seest me washed in the bloud of my Saviour,
clothed in the righteousnesse of my Saviour, lodged in the bosome of my Saviour,
crowned with the merits of my Saviour, confesse, that upon my death-bed, thou wast
a lyer, and wouldest have been a murderer, and the Lord shall, and I, in him, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
thee. <hi>See that yee refuse not him, that speaketh,</hi> says the Apostle;<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 25.</note> not any that
speakes in his name; but especially not him, whom he names there, <hi>that speakes better
things, then the bloud of Abel;</hi> for, the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> speakes but by way of example,
and imitation; the bloud of Christ Jesus, by way of Ransome, and satisfaction.
Heare what that bloud says for you, in the eares of the Father, and then no singing
of the flatterer, no lisping of the tempter, no roaring of the accuser, no thunder of the
destroyer shall shake thy holy constancy. Take heed what you heare, remember what
you have heard; and the God of heaven, for his Sonne Christ Jesus sake, by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his blessed Spirit, prosper and emprove both endeavours in you. Amen.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ever such a frame, so soon set up, as this, in this Chapter. For, for
the thing it selfe, there is no other thing to compare it with. For it
is All, it is the whole world. And for the time, there was no other
time to compare it with, for this was the beginning of time, <hi>In the
beginning God created Heaven and Earth.</hi> That Earth, which in some
thousands of years, men could not look over, nor discern what form
it had: (for neither <hi>Lactantius,</hi> almost three hundred years after Christ, nor Saint
<hi>Augustine,</hi> more then one hundred years after him, would beleeve the earth to be
round) that earth, which no man, in his person, is ever said to have compassed, till
our age; That earth which is too much for man yet, (for, as yet, a very great part of
the earth is unpeopled) that earth, which, if we will cast it all but into a Mappe, costs
many Months labour to grave it, nay, if we will cast but a peece of an acre of it, into a
garden, costs many years labour to fashion, and furnish it: All that earth, and then,
that heaven, which spreads so farre, as that subtile men have, with some appearance of
probability, imagined, that in that heaven, in those manifold Sphears of the Planets,
and the Starres, there are many earths, many worlds, as big as this, which we inhabite;
That earth and that heaven, which spent God himselfe, Almighty God, six days in
furnishing; <hi>Moses</hi> sets up in a few syllables, in one line, <hi>In principio,</hi> in the beginning
God created heaven and earth. If a <hi>Livy</hi> or a <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> or such extensive and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93359:129"/>
authors, had had this story in hand; God must have made another world,
to have made them a Library to hold their Books, of the making of this world. Into
what Wire would they have drawn out this earth? Into what leafe-gold would they
have beate out these heavens? It may assist our conjecture herein to consider, that
amongst those men, who proceed with a sober modesty, and limitation in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and make a conscience not to clogge the world with unnecessary books; yet the
volumes which are written by them, upon this beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi> are scarce lesse
then infinite, God did no more but say, let this and this be done; And <hi>Moses</hi> does no more
but say, that upon Gods saying it was done. God required not nature to help him to do
it: <hi>Moses</hi> required not reason to help him to be beleeved. The holy Ghost hovered upon
the waters, and so God wrought: The holy Ghost hovered upon <hi>Moses</hi> too, and so he
wrote. And we beleeve these things to be so, by the same Spirit in <hi>Moses</hi> mouth, by
which they were made so, in Gods hand. Onely, beloved, remember, that a frame
may be thrown down in much lesse time, then it was set up. A child, an Ape can give
fire to a Canon: And a vapour can shake the earth: And these fires, and these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
can throw down cities in minutes. When Christ said, Throw down this Temple,
and in three days I will raise it; they never stopped upon the consideration of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it down; they knew, that might be soon done; but they wondred at the speedy
raising of it. Now, if all this earth were made in that minute, may not all come to
the generall dissolution in this minute? Or may not thy acres, thy miles, thy Shires
shrinke into feet, and so few feet, as shall but make up thy grave? When he who was
a great Lord, must be but a Cottager; and not so well; for a Cottager must have so
many acres to his Cottage; but in this case, a little peece of an acre, five foot, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the house it selfe; The house, and the land; the grave is all: lower then that; the
grave is the Land, and the Tenement, and the Tenant too: He that lies in it, becomes
the same earth, that he lies in. They all make but one earth, and but a little of it. But
then raise thy selfe to a higher hope againe. God hath made better land, the land of
promise; a stronger city, the new <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and, inhabitants for that everlasting
city, <hi>Vs;</hi> whom he made, not by saying, let there be men, but by consultation, by
deliberation, God said, <hi>Let us make Man in our Image, after our likenesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We shall pursue our great examples;<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> God in doing, <hi>Moses</hi> in saying; and so make
hast in applying the parts. But first receive them. And since we have the whole
world in contemplation, consider in these words, the foure quarters of the world, by
application, by fair, and just accommodation of the words. First, in the first word,
that God speaks here, <hi>Faciamus,</hi> Let us, us in the plurall, (a denotation of divers
Persons in one Godhead) we consider our East where we must beginne, at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and confession of the Trinity. For, though in the way to heaven, we be travelled
beyond the Gentiles, when we come to confess but one God, (The Gentiles could not do
that) yet we are still among the <hi>Iews,</hi> if we thinke that one God to be but one Person.
Christs name is <hi>Oriens</hi> the East, if we will be named by him, (called Christians) we
must look to this East,<note place="margin">Zech. 6. 12.</note> the confession of the Trinity. There's then our East, in the <hi>Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus;</hi>
Let us, us make man: And then our West is in the next word, <hi>Faciamus Hominem.</hi>
Though we be thus made, made by the counsell, made by the concurrence, made by the
hand of the whole Trinity; yet we are made but men: And man, but in the appellation,
in this text: and man there, is but <hi>Adam:</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> is but earth, but red earth, earth dyed
red in bloud, in Soul-bloud, the bloud of our own soules. To that west we must all
come,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 19.</note> to the earth. <hi>The Sunne knoweth his going down:</hi> Even the Sun for all his glory,
and heighth, hath a going down, and he knowes it. The highest cannot devest mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,<note place="margin">Luac. 22. 54.</note>
nor the discomfort of mortality. When you see a cloud rise out of the west,
straightway you say there commeth a storme, says Christ. When out of the region
of your west, that is, your later days, there comes a cloud, a sicknesse, you feele a
storme, even the best morall constancy is shaked. But this cloud, and this storme, and
this west there must be; And that's our second consideration. But then the next
words designe a North, a strong, and powerfull North, to scatter, and dissipate these
clouds: <hi>Ad imaginem, &amp; similitudinem;</hi> That we are made according to a pattern,
to an image, to a likenesse, which God proposed to himselfe for the making of man.
This consideration, that God did not rest, in that praeexistent matter, out of which he
made all other creatures, and produced their formes, out of their matter, for the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93359:129"/>
making of man; but took a forme, a patterne, a modell for that work, this is the
North winde,<note place="margin">Cant. 4. 16. 37. 22.</note> that is called upon to carry out of the perfumes of the garden, to spread
the goodnesse of God abroad. This is that which is intended in <hi>Iob;</hi> faire weather
commeth out of the North. Our West, our declination is in this, that we are but earth,
our North, our dissipation of that darknesse, is in this, that we are not all earth;
Though we be of that matter, we have another forme, another image, another likenesse.
And then, whose image and likenesse it is, is our Meridionall height, our noon, our
south point, our highest elevation. <hi>In Imagine nostra, Let us make man in our Image.</hi>
Though our Sun set at noon, as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> speakes;<note place="margin">8. 8.</note> though we die in our
youth, or fall in our height: yet even in that Sunset, we shall have a Noon. For this
Image of God shall never depart from our soule; no, not when that soule departs
from our body. And that's our South, our Meridionall height and glory. And when
we have thus seen this East, in the <hi>faciamus,</hi> That I am the workmanship and care of
the whole Trinity; And this West in the <hi>Hominem,</hi> That for all that, my matter, my
substance, is but earth: But then a North, a power of overcomming that low and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
state, <hi>In Imagine;</hi> That though in my matter, the earth, I must die; yet in my
forme, in that Image which I am made by, I cannot die: and after all a South, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
That this Image is not the Image of Angels, to whom we shall be like, but it is
by the same life, by which those Angels themselves were made; the Image of God
himselfe: When I am gone over this east, and west, and north, and south, here in this
world; I should be as sorry as <hi>Alexander</hi> was, if there were no more worlds. But
there is another world, which these considerations will discover, and lead us to, in
which our joy, and our glory shall be, to see that God essentially, and face to face, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whose Image, and likenesse we were made before. But as that Pilot which had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor'd
his ship so farre within land, as that he must have change of Winds, in all the points
of the Compasse, to bring her out, cannot hope to bring her our in one day: So being
to transport you, by occasion of these words, from this world to the next; and in this
world, through all the Compasse, all the foure quarters thereof; I cannot hope to
make all this voyage to day. To day we shall consider onely our longitude, our
East, and West; and our North and South at another tyde, and another
gale.</p>
                     <p>First then we looke towards our East, the fountaine of light, and of life. There this
world beganne;<note place="margin">1 Part. Oriens.</note> the Creation was in the east. And there our next world beganne too.
There the gates of heaven opened to us; and opened to us in the gates of death; for,
our heaven is the death of our Saviour, and there he lived, and dyed there, and there he
looked into our west, from the east, from his Terasse, from his Pinacle, from his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
(as himselfe calls it) the Crosse. The light which arises to us, in this east, the
knowledge which we receive in this first word of our text, <hi>Faciamus, Let us,</hi> (where
God speaking of himselfe, speakes in the Plurall) is the manifestation of the Trinity;
the Trinity, which is the first letter in his Alphabet, that ever thinks to read his name
in the book of life; The first note in his Gammut, that ever thinks to sing his part,
in the Quire of the Triumphant Church. Let him him have done as much, as all the
Worthies; and suffered as much as all Natures Martyrs, the penurious Philosophers;
let him have known as much, as they that pretend to know, <hi>Omne scibile,</hi> all that can
be known nay, and <hi>in-intelligibilia, In-investigabilia,</hi> (as <hi>Turtullian</hi> speakes) un-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandable
things, unrevealed decrees of God; Let him have writ as much, as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> writ, or as is written upon <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which is, multiplication enough: yet he
hath not learnt to spel, that hath not learnt the Trinity; not learnt to pronounce the first
word that cannot bring three Persons into one God. The subject of naturall philosophy,
are the foure elements, which God made, the Subject of supernaturall philosophy,
Divinity, are the three elements, which God is; and (if we may so speake) which
make God, that is, constitute God, notifie God to us, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost.
The naturall man, that hearkens to his owne heart, and the law written there; may
produce Actions that are good, good in the nature and matter, and substance of the
worke. He may relieve the poore, he may defend the oppressed. But yet, he is but
as an open field; and though he be not absolutely barren, he bears but grasse. The
godly man; he that hath taken in the knowledge of a great, and a powerfull God, and
enclosed, and hedged in himselfe with the feare of God, may produce actions better
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93359:130"/>
then the meere naturall man, because he referres his actions to the glory of his imagined
God. But yet this man, though he be more fruitfull, then the former, more then a
grassy field; yet he is but a ploughed field, and he bears but corne, and corne, God
knowes, choaked with weeds. But that man, who hath taken hold of God, by those
handles, by which God hath delivered, and manifested himselfe in the notions of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sonne, and holy Ghost; he is no field, but a garden, a Garden of Gods planting,
a Paradise in which grow all things good to eate, and good to see, (spirituall resection,
and spirituall recreation too) and all things good to cure. He hath his beeing, and his
diet, and his physique, there, in the knowledge of the Trinity; his beeing in the mercy
of the Father; his physique in the merits of the Sonne; his diet, his daily bread, in
the daily visitations of the holy Ghost. God is not pleased, not satisfied, with our
bare knowledge,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> that there is a God. For, it is impossible to please God, without faith:
and there is no such exercise of faith, in the knowledge of a God, but that reason, and
nature will bring a man to it. When we professe God, in the Creed, by way of beleefe,
<hi>Credo in Deum,</hi> I beleeve in God, in the same article we professe him to be a Father too,
I beleeve in God the father Almighty: And that notion, the Father, necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
a second Person, a Sonne: And then we professe him to be maker of heaven, and
earth: And in the Creation, the holy Ghost, the Spirit of God, is expresly named.
So that we doe but exercise reason, and nature, in directing our selves upon God. We
exercise not faith, (and without faith it is impossible to please God) till we come to
that, which is above nature, till we apprehend a Trinity. We know God, we beleeve
in the Trinity. The Gentiles multiplyed Gods. There were almost as many Gods
as men, that beleeved in them. And I am got out of that thrust, and out of that
noise, when I am come into the knowledge of one God: But I am got above staires,
got in the Bedchamber, when I am come to see the Trinity, and to apprehend not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that I am in the care of a great, and a powerfull God, but that there is a Father,
that made me, a Sonne that Redeemed me, a holy Ghost, that applies this good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the Father, and Sonne, upon me, to me. The root of all is God. But it is
not the way to receive fruits, to dig to the root, but to reach to the boughs. I reach
for my Creation to the Father, for my Redemption to the Sonne, for my sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the holy Ghost: and so I make the knowledge of God, a Tree of life unto me;
and not otherwise. Truly it is a sad Contemplation, to see Christians scratch and
wound &amp; teare one another, with the ignominious invectives, and uncharitable names of
of Heretique, and Schismatique, about Ceremoniall, and Problematicall, and indeed but
Criticall, verball controversies: and in the meane time, the foundation of all, the
Trinity, undermined by those numerous, those multitudinous Anthills of <hi>Socinians,</hi>
that overflow some parts of the Christian world, and multiply every where. And
therefore the Adversaries of the Reformation, were wise in their generation, when to
supplant the credit of both those great assistants of the Reformation, <hi>Luther,</hi> and
<hi>Calvin,</hi> they impute to <hi>Calvin</hi> fundamentall error, in the Divinity of the second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Trinity, the Sonne; And they impute to <hi>Luther,</hi> a detestation of the very
word Trinity, and an expunction thereof, in all places of the Liturgy, where the
Church had received that word. They knew well, if that slander could prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those persons, nothing that they could say, could prevaile upon any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
But though in our doctrine, we keep up the Trinity aright; yet, God knowes,
in our practice we doe not. I hope it cannot be said of any of us, that he beleeves not
the Trinity, but who amongst us thinkes of the Trinity, considers the Trinity? Father,
and Sonne doe naturally imply, and induce one another; and therefore they fall oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
into our consideration. But for the holy Ghost, who feels him, when he feels
him? Who takes knowledge of his working, when he works? Indeed our Fathers
provided not well enough, for the worship of the whole Trinity, nor of the holy
Ghost in particular, in the endowments of the Church, and Consecrations of Churches,
and possessions in their names. What a spirituall dominion, in the prayers, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the people, what a temporall dominion in the possessions of the world had the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen of heaven, and Queen of earth too? She was made joint purchaser
of the Church with her Sonne, and had as much of the worship thereof as he, though
she paid her fine in milke, and he in bloud. And, till a new Sect came in her Sonnes
name; and in his name, the name of Jesus, tooke the regency so farre out of that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93359:130"/>
Queen Mothers hands, and sued out her Sonnes Livery so farre, as that though her
name be used, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is but a feoffee in trust, for them; all was hers. And
if God oppose not these new usurpers of the world, posterity will soon see Saint <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
worth all the Trinity in possessions and endowments, as that sumptuous, and
splendid foundation of his first Temple at <hi>Rome,</hi> may well create a conjecture, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion.
Travaile no farther; Survay but this City; And of their not one hundred
Churches, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> hath a dozen; The Trinity hath but one; Christ hath but
one; The holy Ghost hath none. But not to goe into the City, nor out of our selves;
which of us doth truly, and considerately ascribe the comforts, that he receives in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
or in distresses, to that God of all comfort, the comforter, the holy Ghost?
We know who procured us, our Presentation, and our dispensation: you know
who procured you, your offices, and your honours. Shall I ever forget who gave me
my comfort in sicknesse? Who gave me my comfort, in the troubles, and perplexities,
and diffidencies of my conscience? The holy Ghost brought you hither. The holy
Ghost opens your eares, and your hearts here. Till in all your distresses, you can say,
<hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> come holy Ghost, and that you feel a comfort in his comming:
you can never say <hi>Veni Domine Iesu,</hi> come Lord Jesus, come to Judgement. Never
to consider the day of Judgement, is a fearfull thing. But to consider the day of
Judgement, without the comfort of the holy Ghost, is a thousand times more
fearfull.</p>
                     <p>This Seale then, this impression, this notion of the Trinity being set upon us,<note place="margin">Trinitarii.</note> in the
first Creation, in this first plurall word of our text, <hi>Faciamus;</hi> Let us, (for Father,

not this our forme, this soule of our Religion denominate us? why are we not called
<hi>Trinitarians,</hi> a name that would embrace the profession of all the Persons, but onely
Christians, which limits, and determines us upon one? The first Christians, amongst
whose manifold Persecutions, scorne, and contempt, was not the least, in contempt
and scorne, were called <hi>Nazarai, Nazarites</hi> in the mouth of the Vulgar; and <hi>Galil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>i,
Galilaeans</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Iulian;</hi> and <hi>Iudaei, Iews</hi> in the mouth of <hi>Nero,</hi> when he
imputed the burning of <hi>Rome</hi> (his owne act) to them; and <hi>Christiani;</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
says) that they could accuse Christians of nothing, but the name of Christians; and
yet they could not call them by their right name, but <hi>Chrestians,</hi> (which was gentle,
quiet, easie patient men, made to be troden upon) They gave them divers names in
scorne, yet never called them <hi>Trinitarians.</hi> Christians themselves amongst themselves
were called by divers names in the Primitive Church, for distinction; <hi>Fideles,</hi> the
faithfull, and <hi>Fratres,</hi> the Brethren, and <hi>Discipuli,</hi> Disciples; And, after, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
custome at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Christians. And after that, (they say) by a councell which
the Apostles held,<note place="margin">Act. 11. 26.</note> at the same city, at <hi>Antioch,</hi> there passed an expresse Canon of the
Church, that they should be called so, Christians. And before they had this name
at <hi>Antioch,</hi> first by common usage, after by a determinate Canon, to be called
Christians, from Christ, at <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epiph. Heres. 29</note> they were called (most likely from the name
of Jesus) <hi>Iesseans.</hi> And so <hi>Philo Iudaeus,</hi> in that book, which he writes <hi>De Iessenis,</hi>
intends by his <hi>Iessenis,</hi> Christians; and in divers parts of the world, into which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
travell now, they find some elements; some fragments, some reliques of the
Christian Religion, in the practice of some religious Men, whom those Countreys call,
<hi>Iesseans,</hi> doubtlesly derived, and continued from the name of Jesus. So that the
Christians took many names to themselves for distinction, (Brethren, Disciples, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
And they had many names put upon them in scorne, <hi>(Nazarites, Galilaeans, Iews,
Chrestians,)</hi> and yet they were never, never by Custome amongst themselves, never by
commandement from the Church, never in contempt from others, called <hi>Trinitarians,</hi>
the profession of the Trinity being their specifique forme, and distinctive Character;
why so? Beloved, the name of Christ involv'd all: not onely, because it is a name,
that hath a dignity in it, more then the rest; (for Christ is an anointed person, a King,
a Messiah, and so the profession of that Name, conferrs an Unction, a regall and a holy
Unction upon us) (for we are thereby a royall Priesthood) but because in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93359:131"/>
of Christ, the whole Trinity is professed. How often doth the Sonne say, that
the Father sent him? And how often that the Father will, and that he will
send the Holy Ghost? This is life eternall,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 3.</note> says he, to know thee, the onely
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent; And sent, with all power, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and in earth. This must be professed, Father, and Sonne; And then, no man
can professe this; no man can call Jesus the Lord, but by the holy Ghost. So that,
as in the persecutions, in the primitive Church, the Martyrs which were hurried to
tumultuary executions, and could not be heard for noise, in excusing themselves of
Treason, and sedition, and crimes imputed to them, to make their cause odious, did
use in the sight of the people, (who might see a gesture, though they could not heare a
protestation) to signe themselves with the signe of the Crosse, to let them know, for
what profession they died, so that the signe of the Crosse, in that use thereof, in that
time, was an abridgement, and a Catechisme of the whole Christian Religion, so is
the professing of the name of Christ, the professing of the whole Trinity. As he that
confesses one God, is got beyond the meer naturall man; And he that confesses a
Sonne of God, beyond him: So is neither got to the full truth, till he confesse the
holy Ghost too. <hi>The foole sayes in his heart, there is no God.</hi> The foole, says <hi>David,</hi>
The emphaticall foole, in the highest degree of folly. But though he get beyond that
folly, he is a foole still, if he say there is no Christ; For Christ is the wisdome of the
Father: And a foole still, if he deny the holy Ghost: for who shall apply Christ to
him, but the holy Ghost? <hi>Etiam Christiani Nomen superficies est,</hi> is excellently said by
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> the name, and profession of a Christian, is but a superficiall outside, sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon my face in Baptisme, or upon mine outward profession, in actions: if I have
not in my heart, a sense of the holy Ghost, that he applies the mercies of the Father,
and the merits of the Sonne to my soule. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said,
Whilest you are without
Christ, you are without God. It is an Atheisme, with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to be no Christian.
So whilest you are without the holy Ghost, you are without Christ. It is Antichristian,
to deny, or not to confesse the holy Ghost. For as Christ is the manifestation of the
Father, so the holy Ghost is the application of the Sonne. Therein onely are we
Christians, that in the profession of that name of Christ, we professe all the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
In Christ is the whole Trinity; because, as the Father sent him, so he sent the
holy Ghost. And that's our specifique forme, that's our distinctive Character, from
<hi>Iew,</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>But then,<note place="margin">An in textu.</note> is this specifique forme, this distinctive Character, the notion of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
conveied to us, exhibited, imprinted upon us, in our Creation, in this word, this
plurall word, in the mouth of our one God, <hi>Faciamus,</hi> Let us, us. It is here, and here
first. This is an intimation, and the first intimation, of the Trinity, from the mouth of
God, in all the Bible. It is true, that though the same faith, which is necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
now, were always necessary, and so in the old Testament, they were bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in Christ, as well, as in the new, and consequently in the whole Trinity; yet not
so explicitly,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 6.</note> nor so particularly as now. Christ calling upon God, in the name of
Father, says; I have manifested thy name unto the men, thou gavest me out of the
world. They were men appropriated to God, men exempt out of the world; yet they
had not a cleer manifestation of Father, and Sonne, the doctrine of the Trinity, till
Christ manifested it to them. I have manifested thy name, thy name of Father. And
therefore the Jewish Rabbins say that the Septuagint, the first translators of the Bible,
did disguise some places of the Scriptures, in their translation, lest <hi>Ptolomee,</hi> for whom
they translated it, should be scandalized w<hi rend="sup">h</hi> those places, &amp; that this textwasone of those
places, which say they though it be otherwise in the Copies of the Septuagint, which
we have now, they translated <hi>Faciam,</hi> and not <hi>Faciamus,</hi> that God said here, I will
make, in the singular; and not, Let <hi>us</hi> make man, in the plurall, lest that plurall word,
might have misled King <hi>Pt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lomee</hi> to thinke, that the <hi>Iews</hi> had a plurall Religion,
and worshipped divers Gods. So good an evidence doe they confesse this text to
be, for some kinde of plurality in the Godhead.</p>
                     <p>Here then God notified the Trinity; and here first,<note place="margin">Primo hic.</note> for though we accept an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Trinity, in the first line of the Bible, where <hi>Moses</hi> joynes a plurall name,
<hi>Elohim,</hi> with a singular Verbe, <hi>Bara;</hi> and so in construction, it is, <hi>Creavit Dii,</hi> Gods
created heaven, and earth: yet, besides that, that is rather a mysterious collection,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93359:131"/>
then an evident conclusion of a plurality of Persons, though we read that in that first
verse, before this in the twenty sixth, yet <hi>Moses</hi> writ that, which is in the beginning of
this chapter, more then two thousand years after God spake this, that is in our text.
So long was Gods plurall, before <hi>Moses</hi> his plurall; Gods <hi>Faciamus,</hi> before <hi>Moses
Bara Elohim.</hi> So that in this text, beginnes our Catechisme. Here we have, and here
first the saving knowledge of the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>For,<note place="margin">Cui dixit.</note> when God spake here, to whom could God speake but to God? <hi>Non cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Creandis, nox cum re nihili,</hi> says, <hi>Athanasius,</hi> speaking of Gods first speaking, when
he said, of the first creature, Let there be light. God spake not then to future things,
to things that were not. When God spake first, there was no creature at all, to speake
to. When God spake of the making of man, there were creatures. But were there
any creatures able to create, or able to assist him, in the creation of man? Who? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?
Some had thought so in Saint <hi>Basils</hi> time; and to them Saint <hi>Basil</hi> says, <hi>Súntne
Illi?</hi> God says, let us make man to our Image, And could he say so to Angels?
Are Angels and God all one? Or is that that is like an Angell, therefore like God?
It was <hi>Sua Ratio, Suum verbum, Sua sapientia,</hi> says that Father, God spake to his own
word, and wisdome, to his own purpose, and goodnesse. And the Sonne is the word
and wisdome of God: and the holy Ghost is the goodnesse, and the purpose of God;
that is, the administration, the dispensation of his purposes. 'Tis true, that when God
speakes this over againe in his Church, as he does every day, now, this minute then
God speakes it to Angels; to the Angels of the Church, to his Ministers, he says
<hi>Faciamus,</hi> Let us, us both together, you, and we make a man; join mine Ordinance
(your preaching) with my Spirit, (says God to us) and so make man. Preach the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor,
and preach the wanton, and preach the calumniator into another nature. Make
the ravening Wolfe a Man, that licentious Goate a man, that insinuating Serpent a
man, by thy preaching. To day if you will heare his voice, heare us. For here he calls
upon us, to joine with him for the making of man. But for his first <hi>Faciamus,</hi> which is
in our text; it is excellently said,<note place="margin">Rupertus.</note> 
                        <hi>Dictum in senatu, &amp; soliloquio;</hi> It was spoken in a
Senat, and yet in a solitarinesse; spoken in private, and yet publiquely spoken; spoken
where there were divers, and yet but one; one God, and three Persons.</p>
                     <p>If there were no more intended in this plurall expression,<note place="margin">Rex.</note> 
                        <hi>us,</hi> but, (as some have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
that God spake here in the person of a Prince, and Soveraigne Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
spake as Princes doe, in the plurall, We command, and We forbid, yet Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi>
caution would justly fall upon it, <hi>Reverenter pensandum est,</hi> it requires a reverend
consideration, if it be but so. For, God speakes so, like a King, in the plurall, but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but five times, (in my account) in all the Scriptures; and in all five, in cases of
important consequence. In this text first, where God creates man, whom he consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
his Viceroy in the World: here he speakes in his royall plurall. And then in the
next Chapter,<note place="margin">ver. 18.</note> where he extends mans terme in his Vicegerency to the end of the
world, in providing man, meanes of succession; <hi>Faciamus,</hi> Let us, us make him a
helper; There he speakes in his royall plurall. And then also in the third Chapter,<note place="margin">1. 22:</note> in
declaring the hainousnesse of mans fault, and arraigning him, and all us, in him, God
says, <hi>Sicut unus ex nobis,</hi> Man is become as one of us, not content to be our Viceroy,
but our selves; There's his royall plurall too. And againe in that declaration of his
Justice,<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 7.</note> in the confusion of the builders of <hi>Babel, Descendamus, confundamus,</hi> Let us
doe it: And then lastly, in that great worke of mingling mercy with justice, which (if
we may so speake) is Gods master-peece,<note place="margin">Esa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 6. 8.</note> when he says, <hi>Quis ex nobis,</hi> who will goe
for us, and publish this? In these places, and these onely, (and not all these neither,
if we take it exactly according to the originall; for in the Second, the making of
<hi>Eve,</hi> though the Vulgat have it in the plurall, it is indeed but singular in the Hebrew)
God speakes as a King in his royall plurall still. And when it is but so, <hi>Reverenter pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandum
est,</hi> says that Father; it behoves us to hearken reverently to him, for Kings are
Images of God; such Images of God, as have eares, and can heare; and hands and
can strike. But I would aske no more premeditation at your hands, when you come
to speake to God in this place, then if you sued to speake with the King: no more fear
of God here, then if you went to the King, under the conscience of a guiltinesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; and a knowledge that he knew it. And that's your case here; Sinners, and
manifest sinners. For even midnight is noone in the sight of God, and when your
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93359:132"/>
candles are put out,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7.</note> his Sunne shines still. <hi>Nec quid absconditum à calcre ejus,</hi> says
<hi>David,</hi> there is nothing hid from the heate thereof: not onely, no sinne, hid from the
light thereof, from the sight of God; but not from the heate therof, not from the wrath
&amp; indignation of God. If God speak plurally onely in the Majesty of a soveraign Prince,
still <hi>Reverenter pensandum,</hi> that calls for reverence. What reverence? There are nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
differences in outward worships, and reverences. Some worship Princes, and
Parents, and Masters, in one, some in another fashion. Children kneele to aske blessing
of Parents in England, but where else? Servants attend not with the same reverence
upon Masters, in other nations, as with us. Accesses to their Princes are not with the
same difficulty, nor the same solemnity in <hi>France,</hi> as in <hi>Turkey.</hi> But this rule goes
thorough all nations, that in that disposition, and posture, and action of the body which
in that place is esteemed most humble, and reverend, God is to be worshipped. Doe
so then here, God is your Father: aske blessing upon your knees; pray in that posture.
God is your King: worship him with that worship, which is highest in our use, and
estimation. We have no Grandees that stand covered to the King; where there are
such, though they stand covered in the Kings presence, they doe not speake to him, for
matters of Grace; they doe not sue to him: so ancient Canons make differences of
Persons in the presence of God; where, and how, these, and these shall dispose of
themselves in the Church, dignity, and age, and infirmity will induce differences. But
for prayer there is no difference, one humiliation is required of all; As when the King
comes in here; howsoever, they sate diversly before, all returne to one manner of
expressing their acknowledgement of his presence. So at the <hi>Oremus,</hi> Let us pray,
let us all fall down, and worship, and kneel before the Lord our maker.</p>
                     <p>So he speakes in our text; not onely as the Lord our King,<note place="margin">In concilio.</note> intimating his providence,
and administration; but as the Lord our maker, and then a maker so, as that he made
us in a councell, <hi>Faciamus,</hi> Let us; and that that he speakes, as in councell, is another
argument for reverence. For what interest, or freedome soever I have, by his favour,
with any Counseller of State: yet I should surely use another manner of behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, at the Councell Table, then at his owne Table. So does there belong
another manner of consideration to this plurality in God, to this meeting in Councell,
to this intimation of a Trinity, then to those other actions in which God is presented
to us, singly, as one God, for so he is presented to the naturall man, as well, as to us.
And here enters the necessity of this knowledge,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3:</note> 
                        <hi>Oportet denuo nasci;</hi> without a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
birth no salvation; And no second birth without Baptisme; no Baptisme, but
in the name of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost. It was the entertainment of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
his delight, his contemplation, for those infinite millions of generations, when
he was without a world, without Creatures, to joy in one another, in the Trinity, as
<hi>Gregory Nazianz:</hi> (a Poet, as well as a Father, as most of the Fathers were) expresses
it: <hi>ille suae splendorem cernere formae, Gaudebat:</hi> It was the Fathers delight, to looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himselfe in the Sonne; <hi>Numenque suum triplicique parique Luce nitens,</hi> and to see
the whole Godhead, in a threefold, and an equall glory. It was Gods owne delight,
and it must be the delight of every Christian, upon particular occasions to carry his
thoughts upon the severall persons of the Trinity. If I have a bar of Iron, that bar
in that forme will not naile a doore; If a Sow of Lead, that Lead in that forme will
not stop a leake; If a wedge of Gold, that wedge will not buy my bread. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
notion of a mighty God, may lesse fit my particular purposes. But I coine my gold
into currant money, when I apprehend God, in the severall notions of the Trinity.
That if I have been a prodigall Sonne, I have a Father in heaven, and can goe to him,
and say, Father I have sinned, and be received by him. That if I be a decayed Father,
and need the sustentation of mine own children; there is a Sonne in heaven, that will
doe more for me, then mine own, of what good meanes or what good nature so ever
they be, can or will doe. If I be dejected in spirit, there is a holy Spirit in heaven,
which shall beare witnesse to my spirit, that I am the child of God. And if the ghosts
of those sinners, whom I made sinners, haunt me after their deaths, in returning to
my memory, and reproaching to my conscience, the heavy judgements that I have
brought upon them: If after the death of mine own sinne, when my appetite is dead,
to some particular sinne, the memory and sinfull delight of passed sinnes, the ghosts
of those sinnes haunt me againe; yet there is a holy Ghost in heaven, that shall exorcise
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93359:132"/>
these, and shall overshadow me, the God of all Comfort and Consolation. God is the
God of the whole world, in the generall notion, as he is so, God; but he is my God,
most especially, and most applyably, as he receives me in the severall notions of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sonne, and holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>This is our East,<note place="margin">2 Part. Occidens.</note> here we see God, God in all the persons, consulting, concurring
to the making of us. But then my West presents it selfe, that is, an occasion to humble
me in the next words.<note place="margin">Adam.</note> He makes but Man; A man that is but <hi>Adam,</hi> but Earth. I
remember foure names, by which man is often called in the Scriptures: and of those
foure, three doe absolutely carry misery in their significations: Three to one against
any man, that he is miserable. One name of Man is <hi>Ish;</hi> and that they derive <hi>à Sonitu;</hi>
Man is but a voice, but a sound, but a noise, he begins the noise himselfe, when he
comes crying into the world, and when he goes out; perchance friends celebrate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
enemies calumniate him, with a diverse voice, a diverse noise. A melancholique
man, is but a groaning; a sportfull man, but a song; an active man, but a Trumpet;
a mighty man, but a thunderclap. Every man but <hi>Ish,</hi> but a found, but a noyse. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
name is <hi>Enosh.</hi> is meer Calamity, misery, depression. It is indeed most
properly Oblivion. And so the word is most elegantly used by <hi>David, Quid est homo?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 4.</note>
where the name of man, is <hi>Enosh:</hi> And so, that which we translate What is man, that
thou art mindefull of him; is indeed, What is forgetfulnesse, that thou shouldest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it; That thou shouldest thinke of that man, whom all the world hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten?
First, man is but a voice, but a sound. But because fame, and honour may
come within that name of a sound, of a voice; therefore he is overtaken, with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dampe: man is but oblivion: his fame, his name shall be forgotten. One name
man hath, that hath some taste of greatnesse, and power in it, <hi>Gheber.</hi> And yet, I
that am that man,<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 3.</note> says the Prophet, (for there that name of man <hi>Gheber</hi> is used) I am
the man, that hath seen affliction, by the rod of Gods wrath. Man, <hi>Ish,</hi> is so miserable,
as that he afflicts himselfe, cryes, and whines out his own time. And man, <hi>Enosh,</hi> so
miserable, as that others afflict him, and bury him, in ignominious oblivion; And man,
that is <hi>Gheber,</hi> the greatest, and powerfullest of men, is yet, but that man, that may
possibly, nay that may justly see affliction by the rod of Gods wrath, and from <hi>Gheber</hi>
be made <hi>Adam,</hi> which is the fourth name of man, indeed the first name of man, the
name in this text, and the name to which every man must refer himselfe, and call
himselfe by, Earth, and red Earth.</p>
                     <p>Now God did not say of man,<note place="margin">Adam:</note> as of other creatures; Let the earth bring forth
hearbs, and fruits, and trees as upon the third day; nor let the earth bring forth cattell,

Command, but he leads him out, with a familiar, with his own hand. And it is not

vessell. 'Tis true, but when we are upon that consideration, God is the Potter. If
God will be that, I am well content to be this. Let me be any thing, so that that I
am be from my God, I am as well content to be a sheep, as a Lion, so God will be my
Shepheard: and the Lord is my shepheard: To be a Cottage, as a Castle, so God
will be the builder; And the Lord builds, and watches the City, the house, this house
this City, mee, To be Rye, as Wheate, so God will be the husbandman; And the
Lord plants me: and waters, and weeds, and gives the encrease: and to be clothed in

and assures me of clothing, in clothing the Lillies of the field, and is fitting the robe of

here lies; but here was laid. For, so various, so vicissitudinary is all this world, as that even

infirmities, is imprinted in us, by Gods hand. For this rednesse, is but a Conscience, a
guiltinesse of needing a continuall supply, and succession of more, and more grace.
And we are all red, red so, even from the beginning, and in our best state. <hi>Adam</hi> had,
the Angells had thus much of this infirmity, that though they had a great measure of
grace, they needed more. The prodigall child grew poore enough, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his portion: and he may be wicked enough, that trusts upon former, or present
grace, and seeks not more. This rednesse, a blushing, that is, an acknowledgement, that
we could not subsist, with any measure of faith, except we pray for more faith; nor
of grace, except we seek more grace, we have from the hand of God: And another
rednesse from his hand too, the bloud of his Sonne, so that bloud was effused by Christ,
in the value of the ransome for All, and accepted by God, in the value thereof for All:
and this redness, is, in the nature thereof, as extensive, as the redness derived from
<hi>Adam</hi> is; Both reach to all. So we were red earth in the hands of God, as redness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
our generall infirmities, and as redness denotes the bloud of his Sonne, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
all have both. But that redness, which we have contracted from bloud shed by
our selves, the bloud of our own soules by sinne, was not upon us, when we were in
the hands of God. That redness is not his tincture, not his complexion. No decree
of his is writ in any such red inke. Our sinnes are our owne, and our destruction is from
ourselves. We are not as accessaries, and God as principall in this soule-murder.
God forbid, we are not as executioners of Gods sentence, and God the Malefactor, in
this soule-damnation. God forbid. <hi>Cain</hi> came not red in his brothers bloud, out of
Gods hands; nor <hi>David</hi> red with <hi>Vriahs</hi> bloud; nor <hi>Achitophel</hi> with his own; nor
<hi>Iudas</hi> with Christs, or his owne. That that <hi>Pilat</hi> did illusorily, God can doe truely;
wash his hands from the bloud of any of these men. It were a weake Plea to say, I killed
not that man; but 'tis true, I commanded one, who was under my command to kill
him. It is rather a prevarication, then a justification of God to say, God is not the
author of sinne in any man, but tis true, God makes that man sinne, that sinne. God
is Innocency; and the beames that flow from him are of the same nature, and colour.
Christ when he appeared in heaven,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14. 14.</note> was not red but white. His head and haires were
white, as white wooll, and as snow; not head onely, but haires too. He, and that that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93359:133"/>
growes from him; he, and we, as we come from his hands are white too. His Angels
that provoke us to the Imitation of that pattern,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 10.</note> are so; in white. Two men, two
Angels stood by the Apostles in white apparell. The imitation is laid upon us by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
too: At all times let thy garments be white;<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 8.</note> Those actions in which thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearest
to the world, innocent. It is true, that Christ is both.<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 10.</note> My beloved is white
and ruddy, says the Spouse. But the white was his owne: his rednesse is from us. That
which <hi>Zipporah</hi> said to her husband <hi>Moses</hi> in anger; the Church may say to Christ
in thankfulnesse,<note place="margin">Exod 4. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>Verè sponsus Sanguinum,</hi> thou art truly a bloudy husband to me;
<hi>Damim, sanguinum,</hi> of blouds, blouds in the plurall; for all our blouds are upon him.
This was a mercy to the Militant Church, that even the Triumphant Church won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at it.<note place="margin">Esai. 63. 1.</note> They knew not Christ, when he came up to heaven in red. Who is this that
commeth in red garments? Wherefore is thy apparell red, like him that treadeth in
the winepresse? They knew he went down in white, in intire innocency: and they
wondred to see him returne in red. But he satisfies them; <hi>Calcavi,</hi> you thinke I have
troden the winepresse, and you mistake it not: I have troden the winepresse; and
<hi>Calcavi solus,</hi> I have troden it alone, all the redness, all the bloud of the whole world
is upon me. And as he adds <hi>Non vir de gentibus,</hi> of all people there was none with me,
with me so, as to have any part in the Merit; So, of all people there was none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me; without me so, as to be excluded by me, without their own fault, from the
benefit of my merit. This redness he carried up to heaven: for, by the bloud of his
Crosse came peace,<note place="margin">Coles. 1. 20.</note> both to the things in earth, and the things in heaven. For that
peccability, that possibility, of sinning, which is in the Nature of the Angels of heaven,
would breake out into sinne, but for that confirmation, which those Angels have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the bloud of Christ. This rednesse he carried to heaven; and this rednesse he hath
left upon earth, that all we miserable clods of earth, might be tempered with his bloud;
that in his bloud exhibited in his holy and blessed Sacrament,<note place="margin">Apoc. 7. 13.</note> our long robes might be
made white in the bloud of the Lambe: that though our sinnes be robes, habits of
sinne; though long robes, habits of long continuance in sinne: yet through that red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which our sinnes have cast upon him, we might come to participate of that
whitenesse, that righteousnesse, which is his owne. We, that is, all we; for, as to take
us in, who are of low condition, and obscure station, a cloud is made white by his sitting
upon it,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14. 14.</note> He sate upon a
great white cloud, so to let the highest see, that they have no white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 11.</note>
but from him, he makes the Throne white by sitting upon it. He sate upon a
great white Throne. It had not been great, if it had not been white. White is the
colour of dilatation; goodnesse onely enlarges the Throne. It had not been white, if
he had not sate upon it. That goodness onley, which consists in glorifying God, and God
in Christ, and Christ in the sincerity of his truth, is true whitenesse. God hath no red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in himselfe, no anger towards us, till he considers us as sinners. God cast no
rednesse upon us; inflicts no necessity, no constraint of sinning upon us. We have
dyed ourselves in sinnes, as red as Scarlet: we have drowned our selves in such a red
Sea. But as a garment, that were washed in the red Sea, would come out white, (so
wonderfull works hath God done at the red Sea,<note place="margin">Psal. 105. 13.</note> says <hi>David</hi>) so doth his whitenesse
worke through our red,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 17.</note> and makes this <hi>Adam,</hi> this red earth, <hi>Calculum candidum,</hi> that
white stone, that receives a new name, not <hi>Ish,</hi> not <hi>Enosh,</hi> not <hi>Gheber,</hi> no name that

looks white, but perishes: the good works that are done openly to please men have
their reward, says Christ, that is, shall never have reward. To pretend to doe good,
and not meane it; To doe things, good in themselves, but not to good ends; to goe
towards good ends, but not by good ways; to make the deceiving of men, thine end;
or the praise of men, thine end: all this may have a whiteness, a colour of
good: but all this, is a barking of the bough, and an indication of a mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
leprosie. There is no good whiteness, but a reflection from Christ Jesus, in
an humble acknowledgement that wee have none of our own, and in a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
assurance, that in our worst estate we may be made partakers of his. We
are all red earth. In <hi>Adam</hi> we would not, since <hi>Adam</hi> we could not, avoid sinne, and

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y fair occasion from these words, we proposed to you the whole
Compasse of mans voyage, from his lanching forth in this world,
to his Anchoring in the next; from his hoysing sayle here,
to his striking sayle there. In which Compasse we designed to you
his foure quarters; first, his East, where he must beginne, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
knowledge of the Trinity (for, that we found to be the
specification, and distinctive Character of a Christian) where,
though that be so, we shewed you also, why we were not called
Trinitarians, but Christians: and we shewed you, the advantage, that man hath, in
laying hold upon God, in these severall notions; that the Prodigall sonne hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
Father; that the decayed Father hath an abundant Sonne; that the dejected
spirit hath a Spirit of comfort, to fly to in heaven. And, as we shewed you from
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that it was an Atheisme to be no Christian, (without God, says he, as
long as without Christ) so we lamented the slacknesse of Christians, that they did not
seriously, and particularly, consider the persons of the Trinity, and especially the holy
Ghost, in their particular actions. And then we came to that consideration, whether this
doctrine were established, or directly insinuated, in this plurall word of our text, <hi>Facia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
Let us, us make man: and we found that doctrine, to be here, and here first of any
place in the Bible. And finding God to speake in the plurall, we accepted (for a time)
that interpretation, which some had made thereof; that God spake in the Person of a
Soveraigne Prince; and therefore (as they do) in the plurall, We. And thereby
having established reverence to Princes, we claim'd in Gods behalfe the same reverence
to him: That men would demeane themselves, here, when God is spoken to in prayer,
as reverently, as when they speake to the King. But after this, we found God to
speake here, not onely as our King; but as our maker; as God himselfe; and God in
Counsell, <hi>Faciamus:</hi> and we applied thereunto, the difference of our respect to a
Person of that honorable rank, when we came before him at the Counsell Table, and
when we came to him at his own Table: and thereby advanced the seriousnesse of
this consideration, God in the Trinity. And farther we failed not, with that our
Eastern winde. Our West we considered in the next word, <hi>Hominem;</hi> that though
we were made by the whole Trinity, yet the whole Trinity made us but men, and men,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93359:134"/>
in this name of our text, <hi>Adam;</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> is but earth, and that's our West, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
our Sunset. We passed over the foure names, by which man is ordinarily
expressed in the Scriptures; and we found necessary misery in three of them; and
possible, nay likely misery in the fourth, in the best name. We insisted upon the name
of our text, <hi>Adam,</hi> earth; and had some use of these notes; First, that if I were but
earth, God was pleased to be the Potter; If I but a sheep, he a shepheard; If I but a
cottage, he a builder. So he worke upon me, let me be what he will. We noted that
God made us earth, not ayre, not fire: That man hath bodily, and worldly duties to
performe; and is not all Spirit in this life. Devotion, is his soule; but he hath a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of discretion, and usefulnesse to invest in some calling. We noted too, that in being
earth, we are equall. We tryed that equality, first in the root, in <hi>Adam;</hi> There if
any man will be nobler earth then I, he must have more originall sinne then I: for that
was all <hi>Adams</hi> patrimony, all that he could give. And we tryed this equality in another
furnace, in the grave; where there is no meanes to distinguish Royall from Plebeian,
nor Catholique from Hereticall dust. And lastly we noted, that this our earth, was
red earth: and considered in what respect it was red, even in Gods hands, but found
that in the bloud-rednesse of sinne, God had no hand: but sinne, and destruction for
sinne, was wholly from our selves: which consideration, we ended with this, that there
was <hi>Macula alba,</hi> a white spot of leprosie, as well, as a red; and we found the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation
of our own purity, and the uncharitable condemnation of all that differ from
us, to be that white spot. And so far we sayled, with that Western winde. And are
come to our third point in this our Compasse, our North.</p>
                     <p>In this point,<note place="margin">Aquilo.</note> the North, we place our first comfort. The North is not always the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortablest
clime: nor is the North always a type of happines in the Scriptures. Many times
God threatens stormes from the North. But even in those Northern stormes, we
consider that action, that they scatter, they dissipate those clouds, which were gathered,
and so induce a serenity:<note place="margin">Iob. 37. 12.</note> And so, fair weather comes from the North. And that's the
use which we have of the North in this place. The consideration of our West, our
low estate; that we are but earth, but red earth, dyed red by our selves: and that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
white, which appeares so to us, is but a white of leprosie. This West enwraps
us in heavy clouds of murmuring, in this life; that we cannot live so freely as beasts
doe; and in clouds of desperation for the next life; that we cannot dye so absolutely
as beasts doe, we dye all our lives, and yet we live after our deaths. These are our
clouds;<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 23.</note> And then the North shakes these clouds. The North Winde driveth away
the raine, says <hi>Solomon.</hi> There is a North in our text, that drives all those teares from
our eyes.<note place="margin">Cant. 4. 16.</note> Christ calls upon the North, as well as the South, to blow upon his Garden,
and to diffuse the perfumes thereof. Adversity, as well as prosperity, opens the bounty
of God unto us: and oftentimes better. But that's not the benefit of the North in
our present consideration. But this is it, that first our sunne sets in the West. The
Eastern dignity, which we received in our first Creation, as we were the worke of the
whole Trinity, falls under a Western cloud, that that Trinity made us but earth. And
then blowes our North, and scatters this cloud. That this earth hath a nobler forme,
then any other part or limbe of the world. For, we are made by a fairer pattern, by a
nobler Image, by a higher likenesse. <hi>Faciamus;</hi> Though we make but a man, <hi>Let us
make him, in our Image, after our likenesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The variety which the holy Ghost uses here,<note place="margin">Imago simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudo.</note> in the pen of <hi>Moses,</hi> hath given occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to divers, to raise divers observations, upon these words, which seem divers, <hi>Image</hi> and
<hi>likenesse;</hi> as also in the variety of the pharse. For it is thus conceived, and laid, <hi>in our Image</hi>
and then <hi>after our likenesse.</hi> I know it is a good rule, that <hi>Damascen</hi> gives, <hi>Parva, parva non
sunt, ex quibus magna proveniunt:</hi> Nothing is to be neglected as little, from which
great things may arise. If the consequence may be great, the thing must not be thought
little. No Jod in the Scripture shall perish; therefore no Jod is superfluous. If it
were superfluous, it might perish. Words, and lesse particles then words have busied
the whole Church. In the Councell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where Bishops in a great number
excommunicated Bishops in a greater, Bishop, against Bishop, and Patriarch, against
Patriarch; in which case, when both parties had made strong parties in Court, and the
Emperor forbare to declare himselfe, on either side for a time, he was told, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to assent to that, which six thousand Bishops had agreed in: the strife was but for
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93359:135"/>
a word, whether the blessed Virgin might be called <hi>Deipara,</hi> the mother of God, for
<hi>Christipara,</hi> the mother of Christ, (which Christ all agree to be God) <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and
all his party agreed with <hi>Cyrill,</hi> that she might be. In the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the
difference was not so great, as for a word composed of syllables. It was but for a syllable,
whether <hi>Ex,</hi> or <hi>In.</hi> The Heretiques condemned then, confessed Christ, to be <hi>Ex dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
naturis,</hi>
to be composed of two natures, at first; but not to be <hi>in duabus naturis,</hi>
not to consist of two natures after: and for that In, they were thrust out. In the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Nice,</hi> it was not so much as a syllable made of letters. For it was but for one
letter; whether <hi>Homoousion,</hi> or <hi>Homousion,</hi> was the issue. Where the question hath
not been of divers words, nor syllables, nor letters, but onely of the place of words;
what tempestuous differences have risen? How much <hi>Sola fides</hi> and <hi>fides sola,</hi> changes
the case? Nay where there hath been no quarrell for precedency, for transposing of
words, or syllables, or letters; where there hath not been, so much as a letter in
question; how much doth an accent vary a sense? An interrogation, or no interrogation
will make it directly contrary. All Christian expositors read those words of <hi>Cain,</hi> My sin
is greater then can be pardoned, positively; and so they are evident words of despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Jews read them with an interrogation, Are my sinnes greater, then can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned?
And so they are words of compunction, and repentance. The Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi>
says, that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is a small place; the Evangelist Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> says no small
place.<note place="margin">

to that, thou art not. Sounds, voices, words must not be neglected. For,
Christs forerunner <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> qualified himselfe no otherwise: He was but a voice.
And Christ himselfe is <hi>Verbum;</hi> the Word, is the name, even of the Sonne of God.
No doubt but Statesmen and magistrates finde often the danger of having suffered
small abuses to passe uncorrected. We that see State businesse but in the glasse of story,
and cannot be shut out of Chronicles, see there, upon what little objects, the eye, and
the jealousie of the State is oftentimes forced to bend it selfe. We know in whose times
in <hi>Rome</hi> a man might not weep; he might not sigh; he might not looke pale; he might
not be sicke; but it was informed against, as a discontent, as a murmuring against the
present government, and an inclination to change. And truly many times upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascens</hi>
true ground, though not always well applied, <hi>Parva non sunt parva,</hi> nothing
may be thought little, where the consequence may prove great. In our own Spheare,
in the Church, we are sure it is so. Great inconveniencies grew upon small tolerations.
Therefore in that businesse, which occasioned all that trouble, which we mentioned
before, in the Councell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> writ to the Clergy of his Dioces
about it; at first, he says <hi>prastiterat abstinere,</hi> it had been better, these questions had
not been raised. But says he, <hi>Si his nugis nos adoriantur,</hi> if they vex us with these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
these trifles; And yet these which were but trifles at first, came to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Councells; and then to divide Councell, against Councell; and then to force
the Emperour to take away the power of both Councells, and govern in Councell,
by his Vicar generall, a secular Lord, sent from Court. And therefore did some of the
Ancients, (particularly <hi>Philastrius)</hi> cry down some opinions for Heresies, which were
not matters of faith, but of Philosophy; and even in Philosophy truly held by them,
who were condemned for heretiques, and mistaken by their Judges, that condemned
them. Little things were called in question, left great things should passe unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
And some of these upon <hi>Damascens</hi> true ground, (still true in the rule, but not
always in the application) <hi>Parva non sunt parva,</hi> nothing may be thought little, where
the consequence may be great. Descend we from those great Spheares, the State, and the
Church, into a lesser, that is, the Conscience of particular men, and consider the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of exposing those vines to little Foxes;<note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

uncorrected. In that glistring circle in the firmament, which we call the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxy,
the milky way, there is not one Star of any of the six great magnitudes, which
Astronomers proceed upon, belonging to that circle. It is a glorious circle, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
a great part of heaven: and yet is all of so little stars, as have no name, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
taken of them. So certainly are there many Saints in heaven, that shine as stars;
and yet are not of those great magnitudes, to have been Patriarchs, or Prophets, or
Apostles, or Martyrs, or Doctors, or Virgins: but good and blessed soules, that
have religiously performed the duties of inferiour callings, and no more. And, as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93359:135"/>
certainly are there many soules tormented in hell, that never sinned sinne of any of the
great magnitudes, Idolatry, Adultery, Murder, or the like; but inconsiderately have
slid, and insensibly continued in the practise, and habite of lesser sinnes. But <hi>Parva non
sunt parva,</hi> nothing may be thought little, where the consequence may prove great.
When our Saviour said, that we shall give an account of every Idle word,<note place="margin">Mat 12. 36.</note> in the day
of Judgement; what great hills of little sands will oppresse us then? And, if substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of sinne were removed, yet what circumstances of sinne would condemne us? If
idle words have this weight, there can be no word thought idle, in the Scriptures. And
therefore I blame not in any, I decline not in mine own practise, the making use of the
variety, and copiousnesse of the holy Ghost, who is ever abundant, and yet never su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
in expressing his purpose, in change of words. And so no doubt we might
doe now, in observing a difference between these words in our text, <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>likenesse;</hi>
and between these two formes of expressing it, <hi>in our Image,</hi> and <hi>after our likenesse.</hi>
This might be done: but that that must be done, will possesse all our time; that is,
to declare, (taking the two words for this time to be but a farther illustration of one
another, <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>likenesse,</hi> to our present purpose, to be all one) what this <hi>Image,</hi>
and this <hi>likenesse</hi> imparts; and how this North scatters our former cloud, what our
advantage is, that we are made to an Image, to a pattern; and our obligation to set a
pattern before us, in all our actions.</p>
                     <p>God appointed <hi>Moses</hi> to make all that he made according to a pattern. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
made all that he made according to a pattern. God had deposited, and laid up in
himselfe certain formes, patternes, Idea's of every thing that he made. He made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of which he had not preconceived the forme, and predetermined in himselfe, I
will make it thus. And when he had made any thing, he saw it was good; good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it answered the pattern, the Image; good, because it was like to that. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though of other creatures, God pronounced they were good, because they were
presently like their pattern, that is, like that forme, which was in him for them, yet
of man, he forbore to say that he was good because his conformity to his pattern was
to appeare after in his subsequent actions. Now, as God made man after another
pattern, and therefore we have a dignity above all, that we had another manner of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
then the rest: so have we a comfort above all, that we have another manner of
Administration then the rest. God exercises another manner of Providence upon man,
then upon other creatures.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 23.</note> A Sparrow falls not without God, says Christ: yet no
doubt God works otherwise in the fall of eminent persons, then in the fall of Sparrows.
For yee are of more value then many Sparrows, says Christ there of every man; and
some men single, are of more value then many men. God does not thanke the Ant
for her industry, and good-husbandry in providing for her selfe. God does not
reward the Foxes,<note place="margin">Iudg. 15.</note> for concurring with <hi>Sampson</hi> in his revenge. God does not fee the

nor those two she-Beares,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 2. 25.</note> which slew the petulant children, who had
caluminated and reproached <hi>Elisha.</hi> God does not fee them before, nor thanke them
after, not take knowledge of their service. But for those men,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 25.</note> that served Gods exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon the Idolaters of the Goden Calfe, it is pronounced in their behalfe, that
therein they consecrated themselves to God; and for that service God made that tribe,
the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> his portion,<note place="margin">Gen, 22. 16.</note> his Clergy, his consecrated Tribe. So, <hi>Quiae fecisti hoc,</hi>
says God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> by my selfe I have sworn; because thou hast done this thing,
and hast not withheld thy Sonne thine onely sonne: in blessing, I will blesse thee, and
in multiplying, I will multiply thee. So neither is God angry with the dog that
turnes to his vomit,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 22.</note> nor with the sow, that after her washing wallowes in the mire.
But of Man in that case he says; It is impossible for those who were once enlightned,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note>
if they fall away, to renew them againe by repentance. The creatures live under his
law; but a law imposed thus, This they shall doe, this they must doe. Man lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another manner of law; This you shall doe; that is, this you should doe, this I
would have you doe: And <hi>fac hoc,</hi> doe this, and you shall live; disobey, and you shall
die. But yet, the choise is yours: Choose ye this day life, or death. So that this is
Gods administration in the Creature, that he hath imprinted in them an Instinct, and
so he hath something to preserve in them: In man his administration is this, that he
hath imprinted in him a faculty of will, and election; and so hath something to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93359:136"/>
in him. That instinct in the creature God leaves to the naturall working thereof
in it selfe: But the free will of man God visites, and assists with his grace to doe su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
things. When the creature does an extraordinary action above the nature
thereof, (as, when <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse spake) the creature exercises no faculty, no will in it
selfe; but God forced it to that it did. When man does any thing conducing to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall
ends; though the worke be Gods, the will of man is not meerly passive.
The will of man is but Gods agent; but still an agent it is: And an agent in another
manner, then the tongue of the beast. For, the will considered, as a will, (and grace
never destroyes nature, nor, though it make a dead will a live will, or an ill will a good
will, doth it make the will, no will) might refuse or omit that that it does. So that
because we are created by another pattern, we are governed by another law, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
providence.</p>
                     <p>Goe thou then the same way. If God wrought by a pattern, and writ by copy, and
proceeded by a precedent, doe thou so too. Never say, there is no Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
error: therefore I will be bound by none; but frame a Church of mine owne, or
be a Church to my selfe. What greater injustice, then to propose no Image, no pattern
to thy selfe to imitate; and yet propose thy selfe for a pattern, for an Image to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored?
Thou wilt have singular opinions, and singular ways differing from all other
men; and yet all that are not of thy opinion must be heretiques; and all reprobates,
that goe not thy wayes. Propose good patterns to thy selfe; and thereby become a
fit pattern for others. God, we see, was the first, that made Images; and he was the
first, that forbad them. He made them for imitation; he forbad them in danger of
adoration.<note place="margin">Arnob.</note> For, <hi>Qualis dementiae est id colere, quod melius est?</hi> What a drowzinesse,
what a lazinesse, what a cowardlinesse of the soule is it, to worship that, which does but
represent a better thing then it selfe? Worship belongs to the best, know thou thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and thy period, how far to goe, and where to stop. Dishonor not God by an
Image in worshiping it; and yet benefit thy selfe by it, in following it. There is no
more danger out of a picture, then out of a history, if thou intend no more in either,
then example. Though thou have a West, a darke and a sad condition, that thou art but
earth, a man of infirmities, and ill counsailed in thy selfe: yet thou hast herein a North,
that scatters and dispells these clouds that God proposes to thee in his Scriptures, and
otherwise; Images, patterns, of good and holy men to goe by. But beyond this North
this assistance of good examples of men; thou hast a South, a Meridionall heighth, by
which thou seest thine Image, they pattern, to be no copy; no other man, but the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
it selfe, God himselfe: <hi>Faciamus ad nostram, Let us make man in our Image, after
our likenesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we consider first,<note place="margin">4 Part. Meridies. Vbi Imago.</note> where this Image is, and then what it does: first, in what
part of man God hath imprinted this his Image; And then what this Image confers,
and derives upon man; what it works in man. And, as when we seek God in his essence,
we are advised to proceed by negatives, God is not mortall, not passible: so when we
seek the Image of God in man, we beginne with a negative; This Image is not in his
body.<note place="margin">Non in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</note> 
                        <hi>Teriullian</hi> declined to thinke it was; nay <hi>Tertullian</hi> inclined others to thinke
so. For he is the first, that is noted, to have been the author of that opinion, that God
had a body.<note place="margin">Deus non est Corpus.</note> Yet Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> excuses <hi>Tertullian</hi> from heresie: because (says he)
<hi>Tertullian</hi> might meance, that it was so sure, that there is a God; and that that God
was a certaine, though not a finite Essence; that God was so far from being nothing,
as that he had rather a body. Because it was possible to give a good interpretation of
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> that charitable Father Saint <hi>Augastine,</hi> would excuse him of heresie. I
would Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> charity might prevaile with them, that pretend to be <hi>Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianissimi,</hi>
and to adore him so much in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> not to cast the name of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
upon every probleme; nor the name of Heretique, upon every inquirer of Truth.
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> would deliver <hi>Tertullian</hi> from heresie in a point concerning God, and
they will condemne us of heresie, in every point that may be drawne to concerne not
the Church,<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> but the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> not their doctrine, but their profit. <hi>Malo de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordia
Deo rationem reddere, quàm de crudelitate,</hi> I shall better answer God for my
mildenesse, then for my severity. And, though anger towards a brother, or a <hi>Raca,</hi> or
a foole, will beare an action: yet he shall recover lesse against me at that bar, whom I
have called weake, or mislead, (as I must necessary call many in the <hi>Roman Church</hi>)
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93359:136"/>
then he whom I have passionately and peremptorily called heretique. For, I dare call
an opinion heresie for the matter, a great while before I dare call the man that holds
it an heretique. For that consists much in the manner. It must be matter of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the matter be heresie. But there must be pertinacy after convenient instruction,
before that man be an heretique. But how excusable so ever <hi>Tertullian</hi> be herein in
Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> charity: there was a whole sect of heretiques, one hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> the <hi>Audiani,</hi> who over literally taking those places of Scripture, where
God is said to have hands, and feet, and eyes, and eares, beleeved God to have a body
like ours; and accordingly interpreted this text; that in that Image, and that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
a bodily likenesse, consisted this Image of God in man. And yet even these men,
these <hi>Audians, Epiphanius,</hi> who first takes knowledge of them, calls but Schismatiques,
not Heretiques: so loth is charity to say the worst of any. Yet we must remember them
of the <hi>Roman</hi> perswasion, that they come too neare giving God a body in their pictures
of God the Father. And they bring the body of God, that body which God the
Sonne hath assumed, the body of Christ too neare, in their Transubstantiation: not
too near our faith, (for so it cannot be brought too near; so, it is as really there as we are
there) too neare to our sense: not too neare in the <hi>Vbi;</hi> for so it is there: There, that is,
in that place to which the Sacrament extends it selfe. For the Sacrament extends as
well to heaven, from whence it fetches grace, as to the table, from whence it delivers
Bread and Wine: but too neare in <hi>modo.</hi> For it comes not thither that way. We
must necessarily complaine, that they make Religion too bodily a thing. Our Saviour
Christ corrected <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> zeale, where she flew to him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 17.</note> in a personall devotion;
and he said, Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father. Fix your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
upon Christ Jesus so, as he is now at the right hand of his Father in heaven, and
entangle not your selves so with controversies about his body, as to lose reall
charity, for imaginary zeale; nor enlarge your selves so far in the pictures and Images
of his body, as to worship them, more then him. As <hi>Damdscen</hi> says of God, that he is
<hi>Super-principale principium,</hi> a beginning, before any beginning we can conceive; and
<hi>prae-aeterna aeternitas,</hi> an eternity infinitely elder then any eternity we can imagine: so he is
<hi>Super-spiritualis Spiritus,</hi> such a Super-spirit, as that the soule of man, and the substance
of Angels is but a body, compared to this Spirit. God hath no body, though <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
disputed it; though the <hi>Audians</hi> preached it; though the Papists paint it. And
therefore this Image of God is not in the body of man, that way.</p>
                     <p>Nor that way neither,<note place="margin">Non Corpus assumptum.</note> which some others have assigned, that God, who hath no
body as God, yet in the creation did assume that forme, which man hath now, and so
made man in his Image, that is, in that forme, which he had then assumed. Some of
the Ancients thought so; and some other men of great estimation in the <hi>Roman Church</hi>
have thought so too; In particular, <hi>Oleaster,</hi> a great officer in the Inquisition of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
But great inquirers into other men, are easie neglecters of themselves. The Image of
God is not in mans body this way.<note place="margin">Non ut ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus.</note> Nor that third way, which others have imagined;
that is, that when God said, <hi>Let us make man after our likenesse,</hi> God had respect to
that forme, which in the fulnesse of time, his Sonne was to take upon him, upon earth.
Let us make him now, (says God at first) like that which I intend hereafter, my Son
shall be. For, though this were spoken before the fall of man, and so before any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of decreeing the sending of Christ: yet in the Schoole a great part of great men
adhered to that opinion, that God from all eternity had a purpose that his Sonne
should become man in this world, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen: <hi>Non ut Medicus, sed ut Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
ad nobilitandum genus humanum,</hi> say they: though Christ had not come as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
if man had not needed him by sin, but had kept his first state; yet as a Prince that
desired to heap honour upon him whom he loves, to doe man an honour, by his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that nature, Christ, say they, should have come, and to that Image, that forme,
which he was to take then was man made in this text, say these imaginers. But alas,
how much better were wit, and learning bestowed to prove to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> that a
Christ must come; (that they beleeve not) to prove to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the Christ is
come; (that they beleeve not) to prove to our own Consciences, that the same Christ
may come again this minute to Judgment, (we live as though we beleeved not that) then
to have filled the world, and torne the Church, with frivolous disputations, whether
Christ should have come, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen? Wo unto fomentors of frivolous
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93359:137"/>
disputations. None of these ways, not because God hath a body; not because God
assumed a body, not because it was intended, that Christ should be born, before it
was intended, that man should be made, is this Image of God in the body of man. Nor
hath it in any other relation, respect to the body, but as we say in the Schoole, <hi>Argui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> and <hi>Significativè</hi> that because God hath given man a body of a nobler forme,
then any other creature; we inferre, and argue, and conclude from thence, that God
is otherwise represented in man, then in any other creature. So far is this Image of
God in the body, that as you see some Pictures, to which the very tables are Jewells;
some. Watches, to which the very cases are Jewells, and therefore they have outward
cases too; and so the Picture, and the Watch is in that outward case, of what meaner
stuffe soever that be: so is this Image in this body as in an outward case; so, as that
you may not injure, nor enfeeble this body, neither by sinfull intemperance and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
nor by inordinate fastings or other disciplines of imaginary merits, while the
body is alive; (for the Image of God is in it) nor to defraud thy body of decent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
and due solemnities after death; for the Image of God is to returne to it. But
yet the body is but the out-cafe, and God lookes not for the gilding, or enamelling, or
painting of that: but requires the labour, and cost therein to be bestowed upon the
Tablet it selfe, in which this Image is immediately, that is the soule. And that's truly
the <hi>Vbi,</hi> the place where this Image is: And there remaines onely now, the operation
thereof, how this Image of God in the soule of man works.</p>
                     <p>The Sphear then of this intelligence,<note place="margin">In anima.</note> the Gallery for this Picture, the Arch for
this Statue, the Table, and frame and shrine for this Image of God, is properly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
the soule of man. Not immediately so, as that the soule of man is a part of
the Essence of God: For so effentially, Christ onely is the Image of God. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
at first thought so: <hi>Putaham te Deus, Corpus Lucidum, &amp; me frustum de illo Corpore;</hi> I
tooke thee, ô God, (says that Father) to be a Globe of fire, and my soule a sparke of
that fire; thee to be a body of light, and my soule to be a beame of that light. But
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> does not onely retract that in himselfe, but dispute against it, in the
Manichees. But this Image is in our soule, as our soule is the wax, and this Image the
seale. The Comparison is Saint <hi>Cyrills,</hi> and he addes well, that no seale but that, which
printed the wax at first, can fit that wax, and fill that impression after. No Image, but
the Image of God can fit our soule. Every other seale is too narrow, too shallow for
it. The magistrate is sealed with the Lion; The woolfe will not fit that seale: the
Magistrate hath a power in his hands, but not oppression. Princes are sealed with the
Crown; The Miter will not fit that seale. Powerfully, and gratiously they protect the
Church, and are supreame heads of the Church; But they minister not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Church. They give preferments; but they give not the capacity of
preferment. They give order who shall have; but they give not orders, by which they
are enabled to have, that have. Men of inferiour and laborious callings
in the world are sealed with the Crosse; a Rose, or a bunch of Grapes will not answer
that seale. Ease, and plenty in age, must not be looked for without Crosses and labour
and industry in youth. All men, Prince, and People; Clergy, and Magistrate, are
sealed with the Image of God, with the profession of a conformity to him: and
worldly seales will not answer that, nor fill up that seale. We should wonder to ses a
Mother in the midst of many sweet Children passing her time in making babies and
puppets for her own delight. We should wonder to see a man, whose Chambers and
Galleries were full of curious master-peeces, thrust in a Village Fair to looke upon six-penny
pictures, and three farthing prints. We have all the Image of God at home,
and we all make babies, fancies of honour, in our ambitions. The master-peece is our
own, in our own bosome; and we thrust in countrey Fairs, that is, we endure the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of any unseasonable weather, in night-journies, and watchings: we indure the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
and scornes, and triumphs of a rivall, and competitor, that seeks with us,
and shares with us: we indure the guiltinesse, and reproach of having deceived the
trust, which a confident friend reposes in us, and solicit his wife, or daughter: we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the decay of fortune, of body, of soule, of honour, to possesse lower Pictures;
pictures that are not originalls, not made by that hand of God, nature; but Artificiall
beauties. And for that body, we give a soule, and for that drugge, which might have
been bought, where they bought it, for a shilling, we give an estate. The Image of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93359:137"/>
God is more worth then all substances; and we give it, for colours, for dreames, for
shadowes.</p>
                     <p>But the better to prevent the losse,<note place="margin">Tota Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
in omni facultate.</note> let us consider the having of this Image: in what
respect, in what operation, this Image is in our soule. For, whether this Image, bee
in those faculties, which we have in Nature; or in those qualifications, which we may
have in Grace; or in those super-illustrations, which the blessed shall have in Glory;
hath exercised the contemplation of many. Properly this Image is in Nature; in the
naturall reason, and other faculties of the immortall Soule of man. For, thereupon
does Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> say, <hi>Imago Dei uri potest in Gehenna, non exuri:</hi> Till the soule be
burnt to ashes, to nothing, (which cannot be done no not in hell) the Image of God
cannot be burnt out of that soule. For it is radically, primarily, in the very soule it
selfe. And whether that soule be infused into the Elect, or into the Reprobate, that
Image is in that soule, and as far, as he hath a soule by nature, he hath the Image of
God by Nature in it. But then the seale is deeper cut, or harder pressed, or better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in some, then in others; and in some other considerations, then meerly naturall.
Therefore we may consider Man who was made here to the Image of God; and of
God, in three Persons, to have been made so, in Gods intendment, three ways: Man
had this Image in Nature, and does deface it; he hath it also in Grace here, and so
does refresh it; and he shall have it in Glory hereafter, and that shall fix it, establish
it. And in every of these three, in this Trinity in man, Nature, Grace, and Glory,
man hath not onely the Image of God, but the Image of all the Persons of the Trinity,
in every of the three capacities. He hath the Image of the Father, the Image of the
Sonne, the Image of the holy Ghost in Nature; and all these also in Grace; and all
in Glory too. How all these are in all, I cannot hope to handle particularly; not
though I were upon the first graine of our sand, upon the first dram of your patience,
upon the first flash of my strength. But a cleare repeating of these many branches, that
these things are thus, that all the Persons of the heavenly Trinity, are (in their Image)
in every branch of this humane Trinity, in man, may, at least must suffice.</p>
                     <p>In Nature then,<note place="margin">In natura Deus,</note> man, that is, the soule of man hath this Image, of God, of God
considered in his Unity, intirely, altogether, in this, that this soule is made of nothing,
proceeds of nothing. All other creatures are made of that pre-existent matter, which
God had made before, so were our bodies too; But our soules of nothing. Now, not
to be made at all, is to be God himselfe: Onely God himselfe was never made. But
to be made of nothing; to have no other parent but God, no other element but the
breath of God, no other instrument but the purpose of of God, this is to be the
Image of God. For this is nearest to God himselfe, who was never made at all, to be
made of nothing. And then man, (considered in nature) is otherwise the nearest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of God too. For the steppes, which we consider are four; First, <hi>Esse,</hi>
Beeing; for some things have onely a beeing, and no life, as stones: Secondly, <hi>Vivere,</hi>
Living; for some things have life, and no sense; as Plants: and then, thirdly, <hi>Sentire</hi>
Sense; for some things have sense, and no understanding. Which understanding and
reason, man hath with his Beeing, and Life, and Sense; and so is in a nearer station to
God, then any other creature, and a livelier Image of him, who is the root of Beeing,
then all they, because man onely hath all the declarations of Beeings. Nay if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
Gods eternity, the soule of man hath such an Image of that, as that though man
had a beginning, which the originall, the eternall God himselfe had not; yet man
shall no more have an end, then the originall, the eternall God himselfe shall have.
And this Image of eternity, this past Meridian, this after-noone eternity, that is, this
Perpetuity and after everlastingnesse is in man meerly as a Naturall man, without any
consideration of grace. For the Reprobate can no more die, that is, come to nothing,
then the Elect. It is but of the naturall man, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> says, a King built a City,
and erected his statue in the midst of the City; that is, God made man, and imprinted
his Image in his soule. How will this King take it, (says that Father) to have his
statue thrown down? Every man does so, if he doe not exalt his naturall faculties;
If he doe not hearken to the law written in his heart; if he doe not as much as <hi>Plato,</hi> or
as <hi>Socrates</hi> in the wayes of vertuous actions, he throwes down the Statue of this King;
he defaces the Image of God. How would this King take it (says he) if any other
Statue, especially the Statue of his enemy, should be set up in this place? Every man
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93359:138"/>
does so too, that embraces false opinions in matter of doctrine, or false appearances of
happinesse in matter of conversation. For these a naturall man may avoid in many
cases, without that addition of grace, which is offered to us as Christians. That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of other creatures to man,<note place="margin">40. 14.</note> which is intimated in <hi>Ieb,</hi> is intended but of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man. There speaking of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> that is, of the greatest of Creatures, he says,
in our translation, that he is the chiefe of the ways of God: Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> hath it, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium;</hi>
and others before him, <hi>Initium viarum Dei:</hi> That when God went that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
over all the world, in the Creation thereof, he did but beginne, he did but set
out at <hi>Behemoth,</hi> at the best of all such Creatures; he, all they were but <hi>Initium via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
the beginning of the wayes of God. But <hi>Finis viarum,</hi> the end of his journey,
and the Eve, the Vespers of his Sabbath was the making of man, even of the naturall
man. <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and the other creatures were <hi>Vestigia,</hi> (says the Schoole) in them
we may see, where God hath gone, for all beeing is from God, and so every thing that
hath a beeing hath <hi>filiationem vestigii</hi> a testimony of Gods having passed that way, and
called in there. But man hath <hi>filiationem Imaginis,</hi> an expression of his Image; and does
the office of an Image or Picture, to bring him, whom it represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the more lively to our
memory. Gods abridgement of the whole world was man. Reabridge man into his least
volume, <hi>in pura naturalia,</hi> as he is but meer man, &amp; so he hath the Image of God in his soul.</p>
                     <p>He hath it,<note place="margin">Pater in Intellectu.</note> as God is considered in his Unity, (for as God is, so the soule of man
is, indivisibly, impartibly one, intire) and he hath it also, as God is notified to us in a
Trinity. For as there are three Persons in the Essence of God: so there are three facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Soule of man. The Attributes, and some kind of specification of the Persons
of the Trinity are, Power to the Father, Wisedome to the Sonne, and Goodnesse to
the holy Ghost. And the three faculties of the Soule have the Images of these three.
The Understanding is the Image of the Father, that is, Power. For no man can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
power, no man can governe well without understanding the natures and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them whom he governes. And therefore in this consists the power, which man
hath over the creature, that man understands the nature of every creature, For so
<hi>Adam</hi> did, when he named every creature according to the nature thereof. And by
this advantage of our understanding them, and comprehending them, we master them,
and so <hi>obliviscuntur quod nata sunt,</hi> says Saint <hi>Ambrose;</hi> the Lion, the Beare, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
have forgot what they were borne to. <hi>Induuntur quod jubentur;</hi> they invest and
put on such a disposition, and such a nature, as we enjoine them, and appoint to them.
<hi>Serviunt ut famuli;</hi> (as that Father pursues it elegantly) and <hi>verberantur, ut timidi:</hi>
they waite upon us as servants; who, if they understood us as well, as we understand
them, might be our Masters: and they receive correction from us, as though they
were afraid of us; when, if they understood us, they would know, that we were not
able to stand in the teeth of the Lion, in the horne of the Bull, in the heels of the Horse.
And <hi>adjuvantur ut infirmi;</hi> they counterfeit a weakenesse, that they might be beholden
to us for help: and they are content to thanke us, if we afford them any rest, or any
food; who, if they understood us, as well, as we doe them, might teare our meate out
of our throates; nay teare out our throats for their meat.</p>
                     <p>So then in this first naturall faculty of the soule, the Understanding, stands the Image
of the first Person,<note place="margin">Filius in Voluntate.</note> the Father, Power: and in the second faculty which is the Will, is
the Image, the Attribute of the second Person the Sonne, which is Wisdome: for
wisdome is not so much in knowing, in understanding, as in electing, in choosing, in
assenting. No man needs goe out of himselfe, nor beyond his owne legend, and the
history of his owne actions for examples of that, that many times we know better, and
choose ill wayes. Wisdome is in choosing in Assenting. And then,<note place="margin">Spiritus in Memoria.</note> in the third faculty
of the soule, the Memory, is the Image of the third person, the holy Ghost, that is,
Goodnesse. For to remember, to recollect our former understanding, and our former
assenting, so far as to doe them, to Crowne them with action, that's true goodnesse.
The office, that Christ assignes to the holy Ghost, and the goodnesse, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
in his behalfe is this,<note place="margin">Iob. 14. 20.</note> that he shall bring former things to our remembrance. The
wiseman places all goodnesse in this faculty, the memory, properly nothing can fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the memory, but that which is past, and yet he says, Whatsoever thou takest in
hand,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 36.</note> remember the end, and thou shalt never doe amisse. The end cannot be yet
come, and yet we are bid to remember that. <hi>Visus per omnes sensus recurrit,</hi> says
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93359:138"/>
Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi> As all senses are called fight, in the Scriptures, (for there is <hi>Gustate
Dominum,</hi> and <hi>Audite,</hi> and <hi>Palpate;</hi> Taste the Lord, and heare the Lord, and feele the
Lord, and still the <hi>Videte,</hi> is added, taste, and see the Lord) so all goodnesse is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,
all goodnesse, (which is the Image of the holy Ghost) is in bringing our
understanding and our assenting into action. Certainly beloved, if a man were like the
King but in countenance, and in proportion, he himselfe would thinke somewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of himselfe, and others would be the lesse apt to put scornes, or injuries upon him,
then if he had a Vulgar, and course aspect. With those, who have the Image of the
Kings power, (the Magistrate) the Image of his Wisdome, (the Counsell) the Image
of his Goodnesse, (the Clergy) it should be so too. There is a respect due to the
Image of the King in all that have it. Now, in all these respects man, the meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man, hath the Image of the King of Kings. And therefore respect that Image in
thy selfe, and exalt thy naturall faculties. Aemulate those men, and be ashamed to be
outgone by those men, who had no light but nature. Make thine understanding, and
thy will, and thy memory (though but naturall faculties) serviceable to thy God; and
auxiliary and subsidiary for thy salvation. For, though they be not naturally instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of grace; yet naturally they are susceptible of grace, and have so much in their
nature, as that by grace they may be made instruments of grace: which no faculty in
any creature, but man, can be. And doe not thinke that because a naturall man cannot
doe all, therefore he hath nothing to doe for himselfe.</p>
                     <p>This then is the Image of God in man,<note place="margin">In Gratia.</note> the first way, in nature; and most literally
this is the intention of the text. Man was this Image thus; and the roome furnished
with this Image was Paradise. But there is a better roome then that Paradise for the
second Image, (the Image of God in man by grace) that is, the Christian Church. For
though for the most part this text be understood <hi>De naturalibus,</hi> of our naturall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
yet <hi>Origen,</hi> and not onely such Allegoricall Expositors, but Saint <hi>Basill,</hi> and <hi>Nyssen</hi>
and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and others, who are literall enough, assigne this Image of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the gifts of Gods grace, exhibited to us here in the Church. A Christian then
in that second capacity, as a Christian, and not onely as a man, hath this Image of
God; of God first considered intirely. And those expressions of this impression, those
representations of this Image of God, in a Christian by grace, which the Apostles have
exhibited to us; that we are the sonnes of God; the feed of God; the off-spring of
God; and partakers of the divine nature, (which are high and glorious exaltations)
are enlarged, and exalted by <hi>Damascen</hi> to a farther height,<note place="margin">Orat. de Assumpt. Mariae.</note> when he says; <hi>Sicut Deus
homo, it a ego Deus;</hi> As God is man, so I am God, says <hi>Damascen.</hi> I, taken in the
whole mankinde, (for, so <hi>Damascen</hi> takes it out of <hi>Nazianzen;</hi> and he says, <hi>Sicut
verbum caro, ita caro verbum,</hi> as God was made man, man may become God) but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
I; I, as I am wrought upon by grace, in Christ Jesus. So a Christian is made
the Image of God intirely. To which expression Saint <hi>Cyrill</hi> also comes neare, when
he calls a Christian <hi>Deiformem hominem,</hi> man in the forme of God; which is a mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and a blessed metamorphosis, and transfiguration: that, whereas it was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
trespasse,<note place="margin">Esai. 14. 14.</note> of the greatest trespasser in the world, the Devill, to say <hi>Similis ero Altis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo,</hi>
I will be like the Highest: it would be as great a trespasle in me, not to be like the
Highest, not to conforme my selfe to God, by the use of his grace, in the Christian
Church. And whereas the humiliation of my Saviour is in all things to be imitated by
me: yet herein I am bound to depart, from his humiliation; that whereas he being in
the forme of God, tooke the forme of a servant; I being in the forme of a servant,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 5.</note>
may, nay must take upon me the forme of God, in being <hi>Deiformis homo,</hi> a man
made in Christ, the Image of God. So have I the Image of God intirely, in his
unity, because I professe that faith,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 5.</note> which is but one faith; and under the seale of
the Baptisme, which is but one Baptisme. And then, as of this one God; so I have
also the Image of the severall persons of the Trinity, in this capacity, as I am a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
more then in my naturall faculties.</p>
                     <p>The Attributes of the first Person,<note place="margin">Pater.</note> the Father, is Power, and none but a Christian
hath power over those great Tyrants of the world, Sinne, Satan, Death, and Hell. For
thus my Power accrues and growes unto me. First, <hi>Possum Iudicare,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 5.</note> I have a Power
to Judge; a judiciary, a discretive power; a power to discerne between a naturall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and a Judgement of God, and will never call a Judgement, an accident; and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93359:139"/>
between an ordinary occasion of conversation and atentation of Satan, <hi>Possum judicare,</hi>
and then <hi>Possum resistere,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 13.</note> which is another act of power. When I finde it to be a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I am able to resist it: and <hi>Possum stare,</hi> (which is another) I am able, not onley
to withstand,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but to stand out this battell of tentations to the end; And then <hi>Possum
capere,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 12.</note> that which Christ proposes for a tryall of his Disciples, Let him, that is able to
receive it, receive it, I shall have power to receive the gift of continency, against all
tentations of that kinde. Bring it to the highest act of power, that with which Christ
tryed his strongest Apostles,<note place="margin">20. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Possum bibere calicem,</hi> I shall be able to drinke of Christs
Cup; even to drinke his bloud, and be the more innocent for that, and to powre out
my bloud,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> and be the stronger for that. <hi>In Christo omnia possum,</hi> there's the fulnesse of
Power, in Christ I can doe all things, I can want, or I can abound, I can live, or I can die.
And yet there is an extension of Power,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 39.</note> beyond all this, in this <hi>Non possum peccare,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
borne of God in Christ, I cannot sinne. This that seemes to have a name of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Non possum,</hi> I cannot, is the fullest omnipotence of all, I cannot sinne; not sinne
to death; not sinne with a desire to sinne; not sinne, with a delight in sinne; but that
tentation, that overthrowes another, I can resist, or that sinne, which being done, casts
another into desperation, I can repent. And so I have the Image of the first Person,
the Father, in Power.</p>
                     <p>The Image of the second Person,<note place="margin">Filius.</note> whose Attribute is Wisdome, I have in this, that
Wisdome being the knowledge of this world, and the next, I embrace nothing in this
world, but as it leads me to the next. For, thus my wisdome, my knowledge growes.
First,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12,</note> 
                        <hi>Scio cui credidi,</hi> I know whom I have beleeved in:<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 9.</note> I have not mislaid my foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
my foundation is Christ; and then <hi>Scio non moriturum;</hi> my foundation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sinke,<note place="margin">8. 27.</note> I know that Christ being raised from the dead, dies no more; againe <hi>Scio quod
desideret Spiritus,</hi> I know what my spirit, enlightned by the Spirit of God, desires; I
I am not transported with illusions, and singularities of private spirits. And as in the
Attribute of Power, we found an omnipotence in a Christian, so in this, there is an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. S. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Scimus, quia omnem Scientiam habemus;</hi> there's all together; we know that
we have all knowledge, for all Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> universall knowledge was but this, <hi>Iesum
Crucifixum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. 2.</note> I determine not to know any thing, save Jesus Christ, and him Crucified;
and then, the way by which he would proceed, and take degrees in this Wisdome, was
<hi>Sultitia praedicandi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. 21.</note> the way that God had ordained, when the world by Wisedome
knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishnesse of preaching to save them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.
These then are the steps of Christian Wisedome, my foundation is Christ, of
Christ I enquire no more, but fundamentall doctrines, him Crucified, and this I apply
to my selfe, by his ordinace of Preaching. And in this wisdome, I have the Image
of the second Person.</p>
                     <p>And then, of the third also in this, that his Attribute beeing Goodnesse, I as a
true Christian,<note place="margin">Spiritus Sanctus.</note> call nothing good, that conduces not to the glory of God in Christ
Jesus, nor any thing ill, that drawes me not from him. Thus I have an expresse Image
of his Goodnesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> that <hi>Omnia cooperantur in bonum,</hi> all things worke together for my
good, if I love God. I shall thanke my fever, blesse my poverty, praise my oppressor,
nay thanke, and blesse, and praise, even some sinne of mine, which by the consequences
of that sinne, which may be shame, or losse, or weaknesse, may bring me to a happy
sense of all my former sinnes; and shall finde it to have been a good fever, a good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
a good oppression, yea a good sinne. <hi>Vertit in bonum,</hi> says <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his brethren,
you thought evill,<note place="margin">Gen. 50. 20.</note> but God meant it unto good; and I shall have the benefit of my
sinne, according to his transmutation, that is, though I meant ill, in that sinne, I shall
have the good,<note place="margin">Amos 3. 6.</note> that God meant in it. There is no evill in the City, but the Lord does
it; But, if the Lord doe it, it cannot be evill to me. I beleeve that I shall see <hi>Bona Dei,</hi>
the goodnesse of the Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 27. 13.</note> in the land of the living, that's in heaven; but <hi>David</hi>
speakes also of <hi>Signum in bonum,</hi> shew me a token of good, and God will shew me a
present token of future good, an inward infallibility, that this very calamity shall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall,
and advantageous unto me. And so, as in Nature I have the Image of God,
in my whole soule, and of all the three Persons, in the three faculties thereof, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
the Will, and the Memory, so in Grace, in the Christian Church, I have
the same Images, of the Power of the Father, of the Wisedome of the Sonne, of the
Goodnesse of the holy Ghost, in my Christian profession: And all this we shall have
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93359:139"/>
in a better place, then Paradise, where we considered it in nature, and a better place
then the Church, as it is Militant, where we considered it in grace, that is, in the
kingdome of heaven, where we consider this Image in glory; which is our last word.</p>
                     <p>There we shall have this Image of God in perfection; for, if <hi>Origen</hi> could lodge
such a conceit,<note place="margin">In gloria Deus.</note> that in heaven, at last, all things should ebbe backe into God, as all
things flowed from him, at first, and so there should be no other Essence but God, all
should be God, even the Devill himselfe, how much more may we conceive an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
association, (that's too far off) an assimilation, (that's not neare enough) an
identification, (the Schoole would venture to say so) with God in that state of glory.
Where, as the Sunne by shining upon the Moone, makes the Moone a Planet, a Star,
as well, as it selfe, which otherwise would be but the thickest, and darkest part of that
Spheare, so those beames of Glory which shall issue from my God, and fall upon me,
shall make me, (otherwise a clod of earth, and worse, a darke Soule, a Spirit of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
an Angell of Light, a Star of Glory, a something, that I cannot name now, not
imagine now, nor to morrow, nor next yeare, but, even in that particular, I shall be
like God, that as he, that asked a day to give a definition of God, the next day asked a
week, and then a moneth, and then a yeare, so undeterminable would my imaginations
be, if I should goe about to thinke now, what I shall be there: I shall be so like God,
as that the Devill himselfe shall not know me from God, so far, as to finde any more
place, to fasten a tentation upon me, then upon God, nor to conceive any more hope
of my falling from that kingdome, then of Gods being driven out of it; for, though I
shal not be immortall as God, yet I shall be as immortall, as God. And there's my Image
of God; of God considered altogether, and in his unity, in the state of Glory.</p>
                     <p>I shall have also then; the Image of all the three Persons of the Trinity.<note place="margin">Pater.</note> Power is
the Fathers; and a greater Power, then he exercises here, I shall have there: here he
overcomes enemies; but yet here he hath enemies; there, there are none; here they
cannot prevaile, there they shall not be. So Wisedome is the Image of the Sonne;<note place="margin">Filius.</note>
And there I shall have better Wisdome, then spirituall Wisdome it selfe is here: for,
here our best Wisedome is, but to goe towards our end, there it is rest in
our end; here it is to seek to bee Glorified by God, there it is, that God
may be everlastingly glorified by mee. The Image of the holy Ghost is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Spiritus Sanctus.</note>
here our goodnesse is mixt with some ill; faith mixt with scruples and
good workes mixt with a love of praise, and hope of better, mixt with feare
of worse. There I shall have sincere goodnesse, goodnesse impermixt, intemerate, and
indeterminate goodnesse; so good a place, as no ill accident shall annoy it; so good
company, as no impertinent, no importune person shall disorder it; so full a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as no evill of sinne, no evill of punishment for former sinnes, can enter; so good
a God, as shall no more keep us in fear of his anger, nor in need of his mercy, but shall
fill us first, and establish us in that fulnesse in the same instant; and give us a satiety,
that we can with no more, and an infallibility, that we can lose none of that, and both
at once. Where, as the <hi>Cabalists</hi> expresse our nearenesse to God, in that state, in that
note, that the name of man, and the name of God, <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Iehovah;</hi> in their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
letters, are alike, and equall, so I would have leave, to expresse that inexpressible
state, so far, as to say, that if there can be other world imagined besides this that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Moone, and if there could be other Gods imagined of those worlds, besides
this God, to whose Image we are thus made, in Nature, in Grace, in Glory; I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be one of these Saints in this heaven, then of those Gods in those other worlds; I
shall be like the Angels in a glorified Soul, and the Angels shall not be like me in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
body. The holy noblenesse, and the religious ambition, that I would imprint in
you, for attaining of this Glory, makes me medismiss you with this note, for the feare of
missing that Glory; that as we have taken just occasion, to magnifie the goodnesse of
God, towards us, in that he speakes plurally, <hi>Faciamus,</hi> Let us, All us do this, and so
powers out the blessings of the whole Trinity upon us, in this Image of himselfe, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Person of the three, and in all these wayes, which we have considered: so when
the anger of God is justly kindled against us, God collects himselfe, summons himself
assembles himselfe, musters himselfe, and threatens plurally too: for, of those foure
places in Scripture, in which onely (as we noted before) God speakes of himselfe in a
Royall plurall, God speakes in anger, and in a preparation to destruction, in one of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93359:140"/>
those foure, intirely; as intirely, he speakes of mercy, but in one of them, in this text;
here he says, meerly out of mercy, <hi>Faciamus,</hi> Let us, us, all us, make man, and in the
same plurality,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> the same universality, he says after, <hi>Descendamus &amp; confundamus,</hi> Let us,
us, all us, goe downe to them, and confound them, as meerly out of indignation, and
anger, as here out of mercy. And in the other two places where God speakes plurally,
he speakes not meerly in mercy, nor meerly in justice, in neither; but in both he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
both. So that God carries himselfe so equally herein, as that no Soul, no Church,
no State, may any more promise it selfe patience in God, if it provoke him, then
suspect anger in God, if we conforme our selves to him. For, from them, that set
themselves against him, God shall withdraw his Image, in all the Persons, and all the
Attributes; the Father shall withdraw his Power, and we shall be enfeebled in our
forces, the Sonne his Wisdome, and we shall be infatuated in our counsailes, the holy
Ghost his Goodnesse, and we shall be corrupted in our manners, and corrupted in our
Religion, and be a prey to temporall, and spirituall enemies, and change the Image of
God into the Image of the Beast: and as God loves nothing more then the Image of
himselfe, in his Sonne, and then the Image of his Sonne Christ Jesus, in us, so he hates
nothing more, then the Image of Antichrist, in them, in whom he had imprinted his
Sonnes Image, that is, declinations towards Antichrist, or concurrencies with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
in them, who were borne, and baptized, and catechised, and blessed in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his truth. That God who hath hitherto delivered us from all cause, or
colour of jealousies, or suspitions thereof, in them, whom he hath placed over us, to
conforme us to his Image, in a holy life, that sinnes continued, and multiplyed by us
against him, doe not so provoke him against us, that those two great helps, the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity
of Preaching, and the personall, and exemplary piety and constancy in our
Princes, be not by our sinnes made unprofitable to us. For that's the heighth of
Gods malediction upon a Nation, when the assiduity of preaching, and the example of
a Religious Prince, does them no good, but aggravates their fault.</p>

but <hi>as Christ,</hi> which is onely <hi>the second Person,</hi> and when he does not so much notifie
himselfe to the <hi>whole world,</hi> as to the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> then he contracts his name too,
from that spacious and extensive <hi>Qui sum, I am,</hi> which includes all time, to <hi>Alpha and

he styles himselfe: when God speakes to the <hi>whole world,</hi> his name is, <hi>Qui sum,

him; when he speakes to <hi>a Christian,</hi> his name is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, first</hi> and <hi>last,</hi> that
a Christian may, in the very name of God, fixe his thoughts upon his <hi>beginning,</hi> and
upon his <hi>end,</hi> and ever remember, that as a few years since, in his <hi>Cradle,</hi> he had no

God knowes how few days hence, in his <hi>grave,</hi> he shall have no sense, no memory of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93359:140"/>
them. Our whole life is but a <hi>parenthesis,</hi> our <hi>receiving</hi> of our soule, and <hi>delivering</hi>
it back againe, makes up the perfect sentence; Christ is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> and our
<hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> is all we are to consider.</p>
                     <p>Now, for all the <hi>letters</hi> in this <hi>Alphabet</hi> of our life, that is, for all the various accidents
in the course thereof, we cannot study a better booke, then the person of <hi>Iob.</hi> His first

we read over and over againe, How he <hi>had</hi> them, how he <hi>lost</hi> them, and how he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi>
them. By which though it appeare that those temporall things doe also belong
to the care and provision of a godly man, yet it appears too, that neither his first care,
nor his last care appertaines to the things of this world, but that there is a <hi>Primùm quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
something to be sought for before, The <hi>kingdome</hi> of God; And there is a <hi>Memorare

upon the relation of <hi>Iobs</hi> temporall passages, of his <hi>wealth,</hi> and <hi>poverty,</hi> of his <hi>sicknesse,</hi>
and <hi>recovery,</hi> yet, if we consider the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the booke it selfe, the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and the later end thereof, we shall see in both places, a care of the <hi>Holy ghost,</hi>
to shew us first <hi>Iobs righteousnesse,</hi> and then his <hi>riches,</hi> first his <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> and then his
<hi>Goods;</hi> in both places, there is a <hi>Catechisme,</hi> a <hi>Confession</hi> of his <hi>faith</hi> before, and then an
<hi>Inventory,</hi> and <hi>Catalogue</hi> of his <hi>wealth;</hi> for, in the first place, it is sayd, <hi>He was an upright
and just man,</hi> and <hi>feared God,</hi> and <hi>eschewed evill,</hi> and then, his Children, and his substance
follow; And in the last place, it is said, <hi>That Iob was accepted by God, and that he prayed
for those friends, which had vext him,</hi> and then it is, that his <hi>former substance was doubled</hi>
unto him.</p>
                     <p>This world then is but an <hi>Occasionall</hi> world, a world onely to be us'd; and that but
so, <hi>as though we us'd it not:</hi> The next world is the world to be <hi>enjoy'd,</hi> and that so, as
that we may <hi>joy</hi> in nothing by the way, but as it directs and conduces to that end; Nay,
though we have no Joy at al, though God deny us all conveniencies here, <hi>Etiamsi occide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
though he end a weary life, with a painefull death, as there is no other hope, but in
him, so there needs no other, for that alone is both abundant, and infallible in it selfe.</p>
                     <p>Now, as no History is more various, then <hi>Iobs fortune,</hi> so is no
phrase, no style, more
ambiguous, then that in which <hi>Iobs history</hi> is written; very many words so expressed,
very many phrases so conceived, as that they admit a diverse, a <hi>contrary</hi> sense; for
such an ambiguity in a <hi>single word,</hi> there is an example in the beginning, in <hi>Iobs</hi> wife;
we know not (from the word it selfe) whether it be <hi>Benedicas,</hi> or <hi>maledicas,</hi> whether she
sayd <hi>Blesse God, and die</hi> or <hi>Curse God:</hi> And for such an ambiguity, in an <hi>intire sentence,</hi>
the words of this text are a pregnant, and evident example, for they may be directly,
and properly thus rendered out of the Hebrew, <hi>Behold he will kill me, I will not hope;</hi>
and this seemes to differ much from our reading, <hi>Behold, though he kill me, yet will I trust
in him.</hi> And therefore to make up that sense, which our translation hath, (which
is truely the true sense of the place) we must first make this paraphrase, <hi>Behold he will
kill me,</hi> I make account he will kill me, I looke not for life at his hands, his will be done
upon me for that; And then, the rest of the sentence <hi>(I will not hope)</hi> (as we read it in
the <hi>Hebrew,)</hi> must be supplyed, or rectified rather, with an <hi>Interrogation,</hi> which that
language wants, and the translators use to add it, where they see the sense require it: And
so reading it with an <hi>Interrogation,</hi> the Originall, and our translation will constitute one
and the same thing; It will be all one sense to say, with the Originall, <hi>Behold he will kill
me,</hi> (that is, let him kill me) <hi>yet shall not I hope in him?</hi> and to say with our translation, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
though he kill me, yet will I hope in him:</hi> And this sense of the words, both the <hi>Chaldee
paraphrase,</hi> and all translations (<hi>excepting</hi> onely the <hi>Septuagint</hi>) do unanimously establish.</p>
                     <p>So then, the sense of the words being thus fixed, we shall not distract your understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> or load your memories, with more then two parts: Those, for your ease, and to
make the better impression, we will call <hi>propositum,</hi> and <hi>praepositum;</hi> first, the purpose, the
resolution of a godly man, which is, to rely upon God; and then the consideration,
the inducement, the debatement of this beforehand, That no Danger can present it
selfe, which he had not thought of before, He hath carried his thoughts to the last period,
he hath stirred the <hi>potion</hi> to the last scruple of <hi>Rheuharb,</hi> and <hi>Wormewod,</hi> which is in it,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93359:141"/>
he hath digested the worst, he hath considered <hi>Death</hi> it selfe, and therefore his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stands unshak'd, <hi>Etiamsi occiderit, Though he dy for it, yet he will trust in God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the first then,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> The Resolution, the purpose it selfe, we shall consider, <hi>Quem,</hi>
and <hi>Quid;</hi> The <hi>Person,</hi> and the <hi>Affection:</hi> To <hi>whom Iob</hi> will beare so great, and so
reverent a respect;<note place="margin">Quis.</note> and then, <hi>what</hi> this respect is, <hi>I will trust in him.</hi> I would not stay
you, upon the first branch, upon the <hi>person,</hi> as upon a particular consideration (though
even that, The person upon whom, in all cases, we are to rely, be entertainement suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the meditation of our whole life) but that there arises an usefull observation,
out of that <hi>name,</hi> by which <hi>Iob</hi> delivers that person, to us, in this place: <hi>Iob</hi> says, <hi>though
He kill me, yet he will trust in him;</hi> but he tells us not in this verse, <hi>who this He is.</hi> And
though we know, by the frame, and context, that this is <hi>God,</hi> yet we must have recourse
to the <hi>third</hi> verse, to see, in what apprehension, and what notion, in what Character, and
what Contemplation, in what <hi>name,</hi> and what nature, what <hi>Attribute,</hi> and what Capacity,
<hi>Iob</hi> conceived and proposed <hi>God</hi> to himselfe, when he fix'd his resolution so intirely to
rely upon him; for, as <hi>God is a jealous God,</hi> I am sure I have given him occasion of jealousy,
and suspicion,<note place="margin">Ezck. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>I have multiplied my fornications, and yet am not satisfied,</hi> as the prophet
speakes: As God is a <hi>Consuming fire,</hi> I have made my selfe fuell for the fire, and I have
brought the fires of <hi>lust,</hi> and of <hi>ambition,</hi> to kindle that fire: As <hi>God visits the sinnes
of fathers upon Children,</hi> I know not what sinnes my fathers and grandfathers have
layd up in the treasure of Gods indignation: As God comes to my notion, in these
formes, <hi>Horrendum,</hi> it were <hi>a fearefull thing</hi> to flesh and bloud, to deliver ones selfe over
to him, as he is a jealous God, and a Consuming fire; But in that third verse, <hi>Iob</hi> sets
before him, that God, whom he conceives to be <hi>Shaddai,</hi> that is, <hi>Omnipotens, All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
I will speake to the Allmighty, and I desire to dispute with God.</hi> Now, if we propose
God to our selves, in that name, as he is <hi>Shaddai,</hi> we shall find that word in so many
significations in the scriptures, as that no <hi>misery</hi> or <hi>calamity,</hi> no <hi>prosperity</hi> or <hi>happinesse</hi>
can fall upon us, but we shall still see it (of what kinde so ever it be) descend from God,
in this acceptation, as God is <hi>Shaddai.</hi> For, first, this word signifies <hi>Dishoner,</hi> as the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> translate it in the Proverbs,<note place="margin">19. 26.</note>
                        <hi>He that Dishonoreth his parents, is a shamelesse
child;</hi> There's this word; <hi>Shaddai</hi> is the name of <hi>God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">33. 1.</note> and yet <hi>Shaddai</hi> signifies <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi>
In the prophet <hi>Esay</hi> it signifies <hi>Depredation,</hi> a forcible and violent taking away of
our <hi>goods; vae praedanti,</hi> says God in that place, <hi>woe to thee that spoyledst, and wast not
spoyled; Shaddai</hi> is the name of <hi>God,</hi> and yet <hi>Shaddai</hi> is <hi>spoyle,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>
In the prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> the word is carried farther, there it signifies <hi>Destruction,</hi>
and an utter <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vastation; D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vastati sumus,</hi> says he, <hi>we unto us, for we are Destroy'd;</hi> The
word is <hi>Shaddai,</hi> and is <hi>Destruction,</hi> though <hi>Shaddai</hi> be the name of <hi>God:</hi> yea, the word
reaches to a more <hi>spirituall affection,</hi> it extends to the <hi>understanding,</hi> and <hi>error</hi> in that,
and to the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and <hi>sinne</hi> in that; for so the <hi>Septuagint</hi> makes use of this word
in the Proverbs,<note place="margin">Prov. 24. 15. Psal. 91.</note> 
                        <hi>To deceive,</hi> and to ly; and in one place of the Psalmes, they interpret
the word, of the <hi>Devil</hi> himselfe. So that, (recollecting all these heavy significations of
the word) <hi>Dishonor</hi> and <hi>Disreputation, force</hi> and <hi>Depredation, Ruine</hi> and <hi>Devastation,
Error</hi> and <hi>Illusion,</hi> the <hi>Devill</hi> and his <hi>Tentations,</hi> are presented to us, in the same word,
as the name and power of God is, that, when so ever any of these doe fall upon us,
in the same instant when we see and consider the name and quality of this calamity
that falls, we may see and consider the power and the purpose of God which
inflicts that Calamity; I cannot call the calamity by a name, but in that name,
I name <hi>God;</hi> I cannot feel an affliction, but in that very affliction I feel the
hand (and, if I will, the medicinall hand) of my <hi>God.</hi> If therefore our <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>
decay, all honor was a beame of <hi>him,</hi> and if he have sucked that beame into
himselfe, let us follow it home, let us labor to be honorable in him, glorified in him,
and our honor is not extinguished in this world, but growne too glorious for this
world to comprehend. If spoyle and <hi>Depredation</hi> come upon us, that we be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with wrath, and persecuted, slaine and not spared, That those <hi>that fed delicately
perish in the streets, and they that were brought up in scarlet embrace the Dunghill,</hi> and
that the hands of pitifull women have sodden their owne children, as the prophet
complains in the <hi>Lamentations;</hi> if there be such an irreparable <hi>Devastation</hi> upon us, as
that we be <hi>broken as an Earthern vessell, in the breaking whereof there remaines not a sheard
to fetch fire from the hearth, nor water from the pit,</hi> That our <hi>estate</hi> be ruined so, as that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93359:141"/>
there is nothing left, not onely for future <hi>posterity,</hi> but not for the present <hi>family,</hi>
yet still God and the calamity are together; God does not <hi>send</hi> it, but bring it, he is
there as soone as the calamity is there, and calling that calamity by his owne name, <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dai,</hi>
he would make that very calamity a candle to thee, by which thou mightst see
him; that, if thou wert not so puffed up before, as that thou forgotst to say, <hi>Dominus dedit,</hi>
It <hi>was the Lord that gave</hi> all, thou shouldst not be so dejected, so rebellious now, as
not to say <hi>Dominus tulit,</hi> It is the Lord that hath taken, and committed to some
better steward, those treasures of his, which he saw, thou dost employ to thine owne danger.</p>
                     <p>Yea, if those <hi>spirituall afflictions,</hi> which reach to the <hi>understanding,</hi> and are intimated
and involved in this word,<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 19.</note> in this name of God, doe fall upon us, <hi>That we call for our
lovers, and they deceive us</hi> (as we told you, the word did signifie <hi>deceit</hi>) that is, we come
to see how much we mistooke the matter, when we fell in love with wordly things,
(as certainely, <hi>once</hi> in our lives, though it be but upon our <hi>Death beds,</hi> we doe come to
discover that <hi>deceit</hi>) yea, when the deceit is so spirituall, as that it reaches not onely to the
<hi>understanding,</hi> but to the <hi>Conscience,</hi> that that have been deceived either with <hi>security</hi>
at one time, or with <hi>anxieties,</hi> and unnecessary <hi>scruples,</hi> and impertinent <hi>perplexities</hi>
at another; if this spirituall deceit have gone so high, as that wee came to thinke our
selves to be amongst them,<note place="margin">Ier. 4. 10.</note> of whom the prophet sayes, <hi>Ah Lord God, surely thou hast
deceived thy people,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that we come to suspect, that <hi>God</hi> hath misled us in a
<hi>false religion</hi> all this while, and that there is a better then this, if we would looke to it;
if God to punish our negligence,<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 31. Hose. 9. 7.</note> and surfet of his word, should suffer <hi>the prophet to
prophecy lyes, That the prophet should be a foole,</hi> and <hi>the spirituall man mad,</hi> (that is, as
<hi>Saint Hierom</hi> reads that place, <hi>Arreptitius,</hi> possessed, possessed with the spirit of <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>flattery,</hi> and <hi>temporizing,</hi> to preach to their appetites, who governe the times,
and not to his instructions, who sent them to preach) yea, where this word is carried
the highest of all, that this word, which is the name of <hi>God,</hi> is used for the <hi>Devill,</hi>
(as we noted before,<note place="margin">Lam. 2. 2.</note> out of the Psalmes) That <hi>Satan was let loose, and polluted the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the princes thereof, with false worships,</hi> yet to what height to ever, this <hi>violence,</hi>
or this <hi>deceit,</hi> or this <hi>tentation</hi> should come, God comes with it; and, <hi>with God, there
is strength and wisdome,</hi> He discerns our Distresses, and is able to succour us in them;<note place="margin">Iob 12. 16.</note>
And, (as it is added there) <hi>He that is deceived, and he that deceives are his;</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
is his, because <hi>he catcheth the crafty in their owne nets,</hi> and the deceived are his,
that he may rectifie and unbeguile them. So then the children of God, are the <hi>Marble,</hi>
and the <hi>Ivory,</hi> upon which he workes; In them his purpose is, to re-engrave, and restore
his Image; and affliction, and the <hi>malignity of man,</hi> and the <hi>deceits of Heretiques,</hi> and the
<hi>tentations of the Devill</hi> him selfe, are but his instruments, his tools, to make his Image
more discernible, and more dnrable in us. <hi>Iob</hi> will <hi>speake to God,</hi> hee will <hi>dispute with
God,</hi> he will <hi>trust in God,</hi> therefore, because he is <hi>Shaddai,</hi> because neither <hi>dishonor,</hi> nor
<hi>Devastation,</hi> of <hi>fortune,</hi> or <hi>understanding,</hi> or <hi>Conscience,</hi> by <hi>deceit</hi> of treacherous <hi>friends,</hi>
by backsliding of false <hi>teachers,</hi> by illusion of the <hi>Devill</hi> himselfe, can be presented him,
but the name and power of God accompanies that calamity, and he sees that they
came from <hi>God,</hi> and therefore he should be patient in them, and how impatient so ever
he be, he sees he must beare them, because they came from <hi>him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Iob</hi> hath another hold too, another assurance, for his Confidence in God,
from this name <hi>Shaddai;</hi> It is not onely because all <hi>Calamity</hi> comes from him, and
therefore should be borne, or therefore must be borne; but all <hi>Restitution,</hi> all Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of temporall, or spirituall detriment, is included in that name too, for <hi>Shaddai</hi>
is <hi>Omnipotens, Almighty,</hi> He <hi>can do all</hi> things; And the consolation is brought nearer
then so, in one place, it is <hi>Omnia faciens,</hi> That, not onely for the <hi>future he can,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob. 8. 3.</note> but for
<hi>the present, he does</hi> study, and he does accomplish my good; even then, when his hand is
upon me, in a calamity, his hand is under me, to raise me up againe; as he that flings
<hi>a ball</hi> to the ground, or to a wall, intends in that action, that that ball should returne
back, so even now, when God does throw me down, it is the way that he hath chosen
to returne me to himselfe. Since therefore this name <hi>Shaddai</hi> assured <hi>Iob,</hi> that all which
we call <hi>Good;</hi> and all which we call <hi>Evill,</hi> that is, <hi>prosperity,</hi> and <hi>adversity,</hi> proceed
from God; that God (who in the signification of this name) is able to shatter, and
scatter, to devastate and depopulate, not onely our <hi>estate,</hi> but our <hi>Conscience,</hi> in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93359:142"/>
with the horror of his <hi>Iudgements;</hi> and then is able to binde up, and consolidate
all this againe, with his <hi>temporall,</hi> and <hi>spirituall Comforts,</hi> since he can <hi>destroy</hi> in an <hi>instant
that Temple,</hi> which was so long in building, that is, overthrow that <hi>fortune,</hi> which
employed the industry of man, the favor of princes, and the ruine and supplantations
of other men, for many yeares, to the making thereof, and then <hi>can raise this ruin'd
Temple,</hi> this overthrowne man, <hi>in three dayes,</hi> or hours, or minutes, as it pleaseth him,
to measure his owne purposes since <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, peace</hi> and <hi>anguish, life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from him, who is <hi>Shaddai,</hi> the Almighty God, <hi>Iob</hi> had good reasons, <hi>to trust
in him,</hi> in that God, though <hi>hee,</hi> that God, should <hi>kill him;</hi> which Emphaticall, and
applyable significations of the <hi>name,</hi> hath occasion'd me (though it be obvious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to every apprehension, that God is the person, who in this text, is to be relied
upon) to insist upon this, as a particular part of branch; And so we passe to that, which
we proposed for a second branch, from the <hi>person, (God,</hi> and God in this notion, <hi>Shaddai,
Almighty)</hi> to the <hi>respect,</hi> which he promises, <hi>Trust, Though hee kill me, yet will I trust
in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a higher degree of Reverence and Confidence,<note place="margin">Quid.</note> to <hi>trust in one,</hi> then to <hi>trust one.</hi>
we see it so expressed in the Articles of our Creed; <hi>Credimus in Deum,</hi> we beleeve <hi>in
God,</hi> and <hi>in Christ,</hi> and <hi>in the Holy Ghost;</hi> And then <hi>Credimus Ecclesiam Catholicam,</hi> we
beleeve the Catholique Church. We will beleeve a honest man, that he will doe as he
sayes, we beleeve God much more, that he will performe his promises; we will trust
God, that he will doe as he sayes; But then, <hi>Iob</hi> will <hi>trust in God,</hi> That though God
have not spoken to his soule as yet, though he have not interessed him in his promises,
and in his Covenant, (for <hi>Iob</hi> is not conceived to be <hi>within the Covenant</hi> made by God
to his people) yet he will <hi>trust in him,</hi> that in his due time, he will visit him, and will
apply him those mercies, and those means, which no man, that had interest in them,
can doubt, or distrust. And therefore <hi>Iob</hi> professes his trust in God, in that word, which
hath in the use thereof in <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ordinarily three acceptations; The word is <hi>Iakal,</hi>
and <hi>Iakal</hi> signifies <hi>Expectavit Deum,</hi>

                        </note> his eye, his expectation was upon nothing but
God; And then it signifies <hi>speravit,</hi> he <hi>Hoped</hi> for him, As he looked for nothing else,
so he doubted not of him; And then it is <hi>Moratus est,</hi> As he was sure of him, so he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
him not a time, but humbly attended his Ieasure, and received his temporall,
or spirituall blessings thankefully, whensoever it should be his pleasure to afford them.</p>
                     <p>First then,<note place="margin">Expectavit.</note> 
                        <hi>Expectavit,</hi> He <hi>trusted in him,</hi> that is, he trusted in <hi>nothing but him.</hi> For,

of all; It is an ill affection to say, I look for nothing at the worlds hands, nor at
Gods neither. God onely hath all, and God hath made us capable of all his gifts;
and therefore we must neither hope for them, any where else, nor give over our hope
of them, from him, by intermitting our <hi>prayers,</hi> or our <hi>industry</hi> in a lawfull calling;
for we are bound to suck at those breasts which God puts out to us, and to draw at
those springs, which flow from him to us; and <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>industry,</hi> are these <hi>breasts,</hi>
and these <hi>springs;</hi> and whatsoever we have by them, we have from him. <hi>Expectavit,
Iob</hi> trusted not in the <hi>meanes,</hi> as in the <hi>fountaine,</hi> but yet <hi>speravit,</hi> he doubted not,
but God, who is the <hi>fountaine,</hi> would, by those meanes, derive his blessings, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and spirituall, upon him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hee Hoped;</hi> now <hi>Hope</hi> is onely, or principally of invisible things, for <hi>Hope that is
seen,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note> is not hope,</hi> says the Apostle. And therefore, though we may hope for <hi>temporall</hi>
things, for health, wealth, strength, and liberty, and victory where Gods enemies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the Church, and for execution of laws, where Gods enemies undermine the
Church; (for, whatsoever we may <hi>pray</hi> for, we may <hi>hope</hi> for, and all those temporall
blessings are prayed for, by Christs appointment, in that petition, <hi>Give us this day
our daily bread)</hi> yet our <hi>Hope</hi> is principally directed upon the <hi>invisible</hi> part, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
office of those visible and temporall things; which is, that by them, we may be
the better able to performe religious duties to God, and duties of assistance to the
world. When I expect a <hi>friend,</hi> I may go up to a window, and wish I might see a <hi>Coach;</hi>
or up to a Cliffe, and wish I might see a <hi>ship,</hi> but it is because I hope, that that friend
is in that Coach, or that ship: so I wish, and pray, and labour for temporall things<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
because I hope that my soule shall be edified, and my salvation established, and God
glorified by my having them: And therefore every Christian hope being especially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
spirituall things, is properly, and purposely grounded, upon these stones; that it
be <hi>spes veniae,</hi> a hope of <hi>pardon,</hi> for that which is past, and then <hi>spes gratiae,</hi> a hope of
<hi>Grace,</hi> to establish me in that state with God, in which, his pardon hath placed mee,
and lastly <hi>spes gloriae,</hi> a hope that this <hi>pardon,</hi> and this <hi>grace,</hi> shall lead me to that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<hi>glory,</hi> which shall admit no night, no eclipse, no cloud.</p>
                     <p>First, for the first object of this hope, <hi>pardon,</hi> we are to consider sinne, in two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<note place="margin">Spes veniae.</note> two apprehensions; as sinne is an <hi>injury,</hi> a <hi>treason;</hi> yea a wound to <hi>God;</hi> And
then as sinne is a <hi>Calamity,</hi> a misery fallen inevitably upon <hi>man.</hi> Consider it the first way,
and there is no hope of pardon, <hi>Nectalem Deum tuum putes, qualis nec tu debes esse,</hi> is
excellently said by Saint <hi>Augustine:</hi> never imagine any other quality to be in <hi>Christ,</hi>
then such, as thou, as a <hi>Christian,</hi> art bound to have in thy selfe. And, if a Snake have
stung me, must I take up that Snake, and put it into my bosome? If so poore a snake,
so poore a worme as I, have stung my Maker, have crucified my Redeemer, shall he
therefore, therefore take me into his bosome, into his <hi>wounds,</hi> and save me, and glorifie
me? No, if I look upon <hi>sinne,</hi> in that line, in that angle, as it is a wound to God, I shall
come to that of <hi>Cain, Major iniquitas, my sinne is greater, then can be forgiven,</hi> and to
that of <hi>Iudas, Peccavi tradens, I have sinned in betraying the innocent bloud,</hi> that is, in
<hi>Crucifying</hi> him againe, who was crucified for me, in betraying his righteous bloud, as
much, by my unworthy <hi>receiving,</hi> as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, in an unjust <hi>delivering</hi> of it. But if I
look upon sinne, as sinne is now, the misery and calamity of <hi>man,</hi> the greater the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
appears, the more hope of pardon I have; <hi>Abyssus Abyssum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 42. 7.</note> as <hi>David</hi> speakes, <hi>One
Depth calls upon another;</hi> Infinite sinnes call for infinite mercy; and <hi>where sinne did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
grace, and mercy shall much more.</hi> First <hi>David</hi> presents the greatnesse of his sinnes,
and then followes the <hi>Miserere mei, have mercy upon me, according to the greatnesse of thy
mercy.</hi> Is there any <hi>little mercy</hi> in God? Is not all his mercy <hi>infinite,</hi> that pardons a
sinne done against an infinite majesty? yes; but herein the greatnesse appeares to us,
that it delivers us from a great calamity. <hi>Quia infirmus, Because I am weake,</hi> (borne
weake, and subject to continuall infirmities) <hi>Quia oss a conturbata, Because my bones are
troubled,</hi> (my best repentances, and resolutions are shaked) <hi>Quia vexata anima,</hi> because
my soule is in anguish, when after such resolutions, and repentances; and vowes, I
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93359:143"/>
relapse into those sinnes, these miseries of his, were <hi>Davids</hi> inducements why God
should pardon him, because it is thus with me, have mercy upon me. And so God
himselfe seemes to have had a diverse, a two-fold apprehension of our sinnes, when he
says,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> that because <hi>all the imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart, were onely evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
therefore he would spare none,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">8, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>he would destroy all,</hi> and after he says, <hi>that because
the imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart, were evill from his youth, he would no
more smite all things living, as he had done;</hi> for sinne, he would destroy them, and yet
for sinne, he would spare them: when we examine our sinnes, and finde them to be
out of <hi>infirmity,</hi> and not out of <hi>rebellion,</hi> we may conclude Gods corrections, to be by
way of <hi>Medicin,</hi> and not of <hi>poyson,</hi> to be for our amendment, and not for our annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in that case, there is <hi>spes veniae,</hi> just hope of pardon.</p>
                     <p>Another degree of hope is, <hi>spes gratiae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spes Gratiae. Rom. 5. 10.</note> hope of <hi>subsequent grace;</hi> for, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
builds his argument, <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of
his Sonne, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life:</hi> in like manner, every
sinner may build his trust, and hope in God, <hi>He that hath pardoned us, the sinnes we have
done, will much more assist us with his grace, that we may be able to stand in that state with
him, to which he hath brought us.</hi> He that succoured us, when there was nothing in us,
but his enemies, will much more send new supplies, when the town is held for him, and
by his friends. And this hope of <hi>pardon,</hi> for that which is <hi>past,</hi> and of <hi>grace</hi> for the
<hi>present,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spes Gloriae.</note> continues to the hope of <hi>glory</hi> to <hi>come:</hi> of which glory we apprehend strong
and effectuall beames here, by conforming our selves, to that Gospell, which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
calls <hi>the glorious Gospell</hi> of the <hi>blessed God;</hi> and for the consummation of this
glory,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 11.</note> we doe with patience abide for it,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 25.</note> says the Apostle: which is the last of those
three senses, in which we noted, this word, in which <hi>Iob</hi> expresses <hi>his trust in God,</hi> to be
used in the Scriptures, <hi>Iakal, moratus est;</hi> he did <hi>trust in nothing else,</hi> did <hi>trust in him,</hi>
and then, he <hi>staied his leasure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iacob</hi> makes a solemne prayer to God,<note place="margin">Moratus est.</note> in <hi>Genesis, 32. O God of my Fathers, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
and Isaac,</hi> then he remembers God of his <hi>promise, (Thou saydst unto me returne,
and I will doe thee good)</hi> he tells him his <hi>danger, (I feare my brother Esau, will come and
smite me)</hi> he makes his <hi>petition, (Deliver me from the hand of my brother)</hi> And yet, for
all this, though he trusted in God, yet God infuses not that confidence into him, as to
goe on: He sent his present to his brother, but himselfe <hi>tarried there all night,</hi> says the
text. Yea, God was so far, from giving him present meanes of deliverance, that he
made him worse able to deliver himselfe, he wrastled with him, and lam'd him: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, in Gods appointed time, he and his brother were reconciled. If thou pray to
Almighty God, in temporall, in spirituall calamities, if God doe not presently enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thine understanding in every <hi>controversie of Religion,</hi> in every <hi>scruple of Conscience,</hi>
if he doe not rectifie thine <hi>estate,</hi> when it is decayed, thy <hi>reputation,</hi> when thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
yea if he wrastle with thee, and lame thee, that is, bring all to a greater impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and improbability of amendment then before, yet thou hast thy <hi>Rule</hi> from <hi>Iob,</hi>
thou hast thy <hi>example</hi> from <hi>Iacob,</hi> that to <hi>trust in God,</hi> is not onely to trust in <hi>nothing
else,</hi> nor onely to hope particularly, for <hi>pardon,</hi> for <hi>grace,</hi> for <hi>glory</hi> from him, but it is
to <hi>stay</hi> his leasure, for the outward, and inward seales of all his mercies, and his benefits,
which he shall, in his time, bestow upon thee. The <hi>ambitious</hi> man must stay, till he,
whose office he expects, be dead: the <hi>Covetous</hi> man must stay, till the <hi>six moneths</hi> be run,
before his <hi>use</hi> come in. Though thou have a religious ambition, a holy covetousnesse
even at Gods graces,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 131.</note> thou must stay his time. <hi>Os aperui, &amp; attraxi,</hi> says <hi>David, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
my mouth, and panted, because I loved thy Commandements;</hi> He loved them, and
he longed for them, yet he had not presently a full satisfaction. <hi>Domine labia mea aperies,</hi>
says he also first it must be the Lord that must <hi>open our lippes,</hi> in all our petitions; It must
not be the anguish of the calamity onely, nor the desire of that which thou prayest for
onely, that must open thy lippes, but the Lord, that is, the glory of God: when the Lord
hath opened thy lips in a rectified prayer,<note place="margin">Psal: 145. 16.</note> then followes the <hi>Aperuit manus, the eyes of all
things waite upon him, &amp; he gives them their meate in due season; he opens his hand, &amp; filles
every living thing, at his good pleasure:</hi> Here's plentifull opening, and filling, and filling <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
thing, but still <hi>in due season,</hi> &amp; that due season expressed, <hi>At his pleasure:</hi> for, as that
is the <hi>Nature</hi> of every thing, which God hath imprinted in it,<note place="margin">Augustin.</note> so that is the <hi>season</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, which God hath appointed for it. Thou wouldest not pray for <hi>harvest</hi> at <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:93359:143"/>
seek not unseasonable comforts, out of Musique, or Comedies, or Conversation,
or Wine in thy distresses, but seek it at the hand of God, and stay his leasure, for else
thou doest not trust in him.</p>
                     <p>We have now passed over all those branches,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> which constituted our first part, that
which we called <hi>Propositum,</hi> what is the <hi>purpose</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> of a godly man, in <hi>Iob:</hi>
that he would not scatter his thoughts in trusting upon <hi>Creatures,</hi> and yet he would not
suffer his thoughts to vanish and evaporate, he would rest them upon <hi>something,</hi> and
not leave all to <hi>fortune,</hi> he would rest upon <hi>God,</hi> and yet stay his time for the execution
of his gracious purposes. There remaines yet, that which we called <hi>praepositum,</hi> in which
we intended, the foundation, and <hi>ground</hi> of that <hi>purpose</hi> and resolution; which seems in
<hi>Iob,</hi> to have been, a debatement in himselfe, a contemplation of all <hi>dangers,</hi> the worst
was <hi>death,</hi> and yet, <hi>Si occiderit, if I dye for it,</hi> and dye at his hands, <hi>Though he kill me, yes
will I trust in him.</hi> For when the children of God take that resolution, to suffer any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
which God shall lay upon them, patiently, and cheerfully, it must not be a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
a rash, an undebated resolution, but they must consider <hi>why</hi> they undertake it, and
in whose strength, they shall be able to doe it: They must consider what they have <hi>done</hi>
for God, before they promise themselves the glory of suffering for him. When they
which enterprised the building of <hi>Babel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> did no more but say to one another, <hi>Come let us
make bricke, go to, let us build a towre, whose top may reach to heaven,</hi> how quickly they
were <hi>scattered over the earth?</hi> The way is,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 28.</note> if you minde to build, to <hi>sit downe and count
the cost;</hi> if you purpose to <hi>suffer</hi> for Christ, to look to your stock, your strength,
and from whence it comes. The King that intends a war, in that Gospell, takes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
whether he be able with <hi>his tenne thousand</hi> to meet the enemy with <hi>twenty thousand.</hi>
We are too weake for our enemy; the world, the flesh, and the Devill, are mustered
against us; but yet, with our <hi>ten thousand,</hi> we may meet their <hi>twenty thousand,</hi> if we
have <hi>put on Christ,</hi> and be <hi>armed</hi> with him, and his holy <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>constancy;</hi> but
from whom may we derive an assurance, that we shall have that <hi>armor,</hi> that <hi>patience,</hi>
that <hi>constancy?</hi> First, a Christian must purpose to <hi>Doe,</hi> and then in cases of <hi>necessity,</hi> to
<hi>suffer:</hi> And give me leave to make this short note by the way, no man shall <hi>suffer</hi> like a
<hi>Christian,</hi> that hath <hi>done</hi> nothing like a <hi>Christian:</hi> God shall thanke no man, for dying
for him, and his glory, that contributed nothing to his glory, in the actions of his life:
very hardly shall that man be a <hi>Martyr</hi> in a persecution, that did not what he could, to
keep off persecution.</p>
                     <p>Thus then <hi>Iob</hi> comes first, to the <hi>Si occiderit; If he should kill me;</hi> If Gods anger
should proceed so far, as so far, it may proceed. Let no man say in a sicknesse, or in any
temporall calamity, this is the <hi>worst;</hi> for a <hi>worse</hi> thing then that may fall: <hi>five and thirty
years</hi> sicknesse may fall upon thee; and, (as it is in that Gospell) <hi>a worse thing</hi> then that;
<hi>Distraction,</hi> and <hi>desperation</hi> may fall upon thee: let no Church, no State, in any distress
say, this is the worst, for onely God knowes, what is the worst, that God can doe to
us. <hi>Iob</hi> does not deny here, but that this <hi>Si occiderit,</hi> if it come to a matter of <hi>life,</hi> it
were another manner of triall, then either the <hi>si irruerent Sabaei,</hi> if the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> should
come, and drive his Cattell, and slay his servants; more, then the <hi>si ignis caderet;</hi> if the
fire of God should fall from heaven, and devoute all; more, then the <hi>si ventus concute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>
if the winde of the wildernesse, should shake downe his house, and kill and all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
The Devill in his malice saw, that if it came to matter of <hi>life, Iob</hi> was like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be shaked in his faith; <hi>Skin for skin, and all that ever a man hath will he give
for his life.</hi> God foresaw that, in his gracious providence too; and therefore he took
that clause out of <hi>Satans</hi> Commission, and inserted his <hi>veruntamen animam ejus servae,</hi>
medle not with his life. The love of this life, which is <hi>naturall</hi> to us, and imprinted by
God in us, is not <hi>sinfull: Few and evill have the days of my pilgrimage been,</hi> says <hi>lacob</hi> to
<hi>Pharaeoh:</hi> though they had been <hi>evill,</hi> (which makes our days seem long) and though
he were no <hi>young</hi> man, when he said so, yet the days which he had past, he thought <hi>few,</hi>
and desired more. When <hi>Eliah</hi> was fled into the wildernesse, and that in passion, and
vehemence he said to God, <hi>Sufficit Domine, tolle animam meam, It is enough O Lord, now
take away my life,</hi> if he had been heartily, thoroughly weary of his life, he needed not to
have <hi>fled</hi> from <hi>Iesabel,</hi> for he <hi>fled</hi> but to <hi>save his life.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> had a <hi>Cupie dissolvi,</hi> a
desire to be dissolved; but yet a love to his brethren corrected that desire, and made
him finde that it was far better for him to live. Our Saviour himselfe, when it came
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93359:144"/>
to the pinch, and to the agony, had a <hi>Transeat Calix,</hi> a <hi>naturall</hi> declining of death. The
naturall love of our naturall life is not <hi>ill:</hi> It is ill, in many cases, <hi>not to love this life:</hi>
to expose it to unnecessary dangers, is alwayes ill; and there are overtures to as great
sinnes, in <hi>hating</hi> this life, as in loving it; and therefore <hi>Iobs</hi> first consideration is, <hi>si oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideret,</hi>
if <hi>he should kill me,</hi> if I thought he would kill me, this were enough to put me
from trusting in any.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Iobs</hi> consideration went farther, then to the <hi>si occideret, Though he should kill me,</hi>
for it comes to an absolute assurance that God <hi>will</hi> kill him; for so it is in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,
<hi>Ecce occidet, Behold, I see he will kill me;</hi> I have, I can have no hope of life,
at his hands. Tis all our cases; <hi>Adam</hi> might have liv'd, if he would, but <hi>I cannot.</hi> God
hath placed an <hi>Ecce,</hi> a marke of my death, upon every thing living, that I can set mine
eye upon; every thing is a remembrancer, every thing is a Judge upon me, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note>
                        <hi>I must</hi> dye. The whole frame of the world is mortall, <hi>Heaven and Earth passe
away:</hi> and upon us all, there is an irrecoverable Decree past, <hi>statutum est,</hi> It <hi>is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all men, that they shall once dye.</hi> But when? quickly; If thou looke up into the
aire,<note place="margin">Iob 7. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>remember that thy life is but a winde;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iam. 4. 14.</note> If thou see a cloud in the aire, aske <hi>St. Iames</hi>
his question, what is your life? and give St. <hi>Iames</hi> his answer, <hi>It is a vapour that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and vanisheth away.</hi> If thou behold a <hi>Tree,</hi> then <hi>Iob</hi> gives thee a comparison of thy
selfe; A <hi>Tree</hi> is an <hi>embleme</hi> of thy selfe; nay a Tree is the <hi>originall,</hi> thou art but the
<hi>copy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 14. 7.</note> thou art not so good as it: for, <hi>There is hope of a tree</hi> (as you reade there) <hi>if the
roote wax old,</hi> if <hi>the</hi> stock be dead, if it be cut down, yet by <hi>the sent of the waters,</hi> it
will <hi>bud,</hi> but <hi>man is sick,</hi> and <hi>dyeth, and where is he?</hi> he shall not wake againe, till hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
be no more. Looke upon the <hi>water,</hi> and we are as that, and as that spilt upon the
ground: Looke to the <hi>earth,</hi> and we are not like that, but we are earth it self: At our
Tables we feed upon the dead, and in the Temple we tread upon the dead: and when
we meet in a Church, God hath made many <hi>echoes,</hi> many testimonies of our death,
in the walls, and in the windowes, and he onely knowes, whether he will not make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
testimony of our mortality, of the youngest amongst us, before we part, and
make the very <hi>place of our buriall,</hi> our <hi>deathbed. Iobs</hi> contemplation went so far; not
onely to a <hi>Si occideret,</hi> to a possibility that he <hi>might</hi> dye, but to an <hi>Ecce occidet,</hi> to an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that he <hi>must</hi> dye; I know there is an infalliblenesse in the Decree, an inevitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in nature, an inexorablenesse in God, I must dye. And the word beares a third
interpretation beyond this; for <hi>si occiderit,</hi> is not onely, <hi>if he should kill me, as he ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi>
if he <hi>will,</hi> and it may be he will; nor onely, <hi>that I am sure he will kill me,</hi> I know <hi>I must</hi>
dye, but the word may very well be also, <hi>though he have killed me.</hi> So that <hi>Iobs</hi> reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
that he will trust in God, is grounded upon all these considerations, That there
is exercise of our hope in God, <hi>before</hi> death, <hi>in</hi> the agony of death, and <hi>after</hi> death.
First, in our good dayes, and in the time of <hi>health, Memorare novissima,</hi> sayes the wise
man, we must remember our end, our death. But that we cannot forget, every thing
presents that to us; But his counsell there, is, <hi>in omnibus operibus,</hi> In all thine underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
in all thine actions, remember <hi>thine end;</hi> when thou art in any worldly work, for
advancing thy <hi>state,</hi> remember thy <hi>naturall death,</hi> but especially when thou art in a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
worke, for satisfying thy <hi>lusts,</hi> remember thy <hi>spirituall death:</hi> Be afraid of this
death,<note place="margin">Psal. 120. 5.</note> and thou wilt never feare the other: Thou wilt rather sigh with <hi>David, My

may deliver thee from all farther danger of a <hi>spirituall death:</hi> And thou wilt be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of that imputation, which is layd upon worldly men, by <hi>St. Cyprian, Ad nostros

we desire to have the winde against us; we are travelling to the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
yet we are loath to come thither. Here then is the use of our <hi>hope before</hi> death, that
this life shall be a gallery into a better roome, and deliver us over to a better Country:

                        <hi>if in this life onely we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>in the agony of death;</hi> when the Sessions are come, and that as a prisoner
may looke from that Tower, and see the Judge that must condemne him to morrow,
come in to night; so we lye upon our death-bed, and apprehend a present judgement to
be given upon us, when, if we will not <hi>pleade</hi> to the Indictment, if we will stand <hi>mute,</hi>
and have nothing to say to God, we are condemned already, condemned in our silence;
and if we do plead, we have no plea, but <hi>guilty;</hi> nothing to say, but to confesse all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93359:144"/>
against our selves; when the flesh is too weake, as that it can performe no office,
and yet would faine stay here, when the soule is laden with more sins then she can bear,
and yet would faine contract more; in this agony, there is this use of our <hi>hope,</hi> that as
God shall then, when our bodily eares are deaf, whisper to our soules, and say, <hi>Memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
homo, Remember, consider man, that thou art but dust,</hi> and art <hi>now returning into dust,</hi>
so we, in our hearts, when our bodily tongues are speechlesse, may then say to God, as
it is in <hi>Iob,<note place="margin">10.</note> Memento quaeso, Remember thou also, I beseech thee, O God, that it is thou
that hast made me as clay, and that it is thou that bringest me to that state againe;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
come thou, and looke to thine owne worke; come and <hi>let thy servant depart in
peace, in</hi> having <hi>seen his salvation.</hi> My hope <hi>before</hi> death is, that this life is the <hi>way;</hi> my
hope <hi>at</hi> death is, that my death shall be <hi>a doore</hi> into a better state.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the use of our <hi>hope,</hi> is <hi>after</hi> death, that God by his promise, hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
my debter, till he restore my body to me againe, in the resurrection: My body hath
sinned, and he hath not redeemed a sinner, he hath not saved a sinner, except he have
redeemed and saved my body, as well as my soule. To those soules that lye under the
Altar, and solicite God, for the resurrection, in the Revelation, God sayes,<note place="margin">6. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>That they
should rest for a little season, untill their fellow-servants, and their brethren, that should be
killed, even as they were, were fulfilled.</hi> All that while, while that number is fulfilling, is
our hopes exercised after our death. And therefore the bodies of the Saints of God,
which have been Temples of the Holy Ghost, when the soule is gone out of them,
are not to be neglected, as a <hi>sheath</hi> that had lost the <hi>knife,</hi> as a <hi>shell</hi> that had spent the
<hi>kernell;</hi> but as the Godhead did not depart from the dead body of Christ Jesus, then
when that body lay dead in the grave, so the power of God, and the merit of Christ
Jesus, doth not depart from the body of man, but his blood lives in our ashes, and shall
in his appointed time, awaken this body againe, to an everlasting glory.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore <hi>Iob</hi> had, and <hi>we</hi> have this assurance <hi>before</hi> we dye, <hi>when</hi> we dye, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
we are dead, it is upon good reason, that he did, and we do trust in God, <hi>though he
should</hi> kill us, <hi>when he doth</hi> kill us, <hi>after he hath</hi> killed us. Especially since it is <hi>Ille, He</hi>
who is spoken of before,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 39.</note> he <hi>that kills, and gives life,</hi> he that <hi>wounds, and makes whole
againe.</hi> God executes by what way it pleases him; condemned persons cannot chuse
the manner of their death; whether God kill by <hi>sicknesse,</hi> by <hi>age,</hi> by the hand of the
<hi>law,</hi> by the malice of <hi>man, si ille,</hi> as long as we can see that it is he, he that is <hi>Shaddai,
Vastator, &amp; Restaurator,</hi> the <hi>destroyer,</hi> and the <hi>repairer,</hi> howsoever <hi>he kill, yet he gives life
too,</hi> howsoever he <hi>wound,</hi> yet he <hi>heales too,</hi> howsoever he lock us into our graves now,
yet he hath the keys of hell, and death, and shall in his time, extend that voyce to us
all, <hi>Lazare veni for as,</hi> come forth of your putrefaction, to incorruptible glory. Amen.</p>

them; and then the words of those Poets, become the word of <hi>God; Elihu</hi> speakes, a

                     <p>Be pleased to admit,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> and charge your memories with this distribution of the words;
Let the parts be but two, so you will be pleased to stoop, and gather, or at least to open
your hands to receive some more (I must not say flowers, for things of sweetnesse, and
of delight grow not in my ground) but <hi>simples</hi> rather, and <hi>medicinall herbs;</hi> of which
as there enter many into good <hi>cordials,</hi> so in this supreme cordiall, of bringing God
into the eyes of man, that <hi>every man may see it, men may behold it afar off,</hi> there must
necessarily arise many particulars to your consideration. I threaten you but with two
parts; no farther tediousnesse; but I aske roome for divers branches; I can promise
no more shortnesse. The first part is a discovery, a manifestation of God to man;
though that be undeniably true,<note place="margin">Psal. 18. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Posuit tenebra s latibulum, God hath made darknesse his
secret place,</hi> yet it is as true, which proceeds from the same mouth, and the same pen,
<hi>Amictus tanquam pallio,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">104. 2.</note> God covers himselfe <hi>with light as with a garment,</hi> he will be
seene through his <hi>works:</hi> As we shall stand naked to one another, and not be ashamed
of our <hi>scars,</hi> or <hi>morphews,</hi> in the sight of God, so God stands naked to the eyes of man,
and is not ashamed of that humiliation, <hi>Every man may see it, man may behold it afar
off.</hi> This proposition, this discovery, will be the first part; and the other will be a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
answer, to a likely objection, is not God <hi>far off,</hi> and can man see at that distance?
yes, he may. <hi>Man may behold that afar off. Every man may see it, man may behold it
afar off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God is the subject of both parts; <hi>God alone;</hi> one God. But in both parts there is
a <hi>Trinity</hi> too; three branches in each part; for in each, there is an <hi>object,</hi> something to
be apprehended; there is a <hi>meanes</hi> of apprehending it, it is to <hi>be seene;</hi> there is a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
enabled to see it, <hi>Every man may see it, man may behold it afar off.</hi> But these three
are not alike in each part; for in the first, that <hi>object</hi> is determined, limited; it is <hi>illud;</hi>
it; God in his works. In the second, there is no object limited, for it is not <hi>illud,</hi> but
there is more left to be seene; not onely <hi>God</hi> in his works, as here below, but <hi>God</hi> in his
<hi>glory</hi> above; <hi>Man may behold,</hi> but he does not offer to tell us <hi>what;</hi> there is an object,
but another object. In the second there is a difference too, in the <hi>meanes</hi> of apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
It is but <hi>Casah</hi> in the first, it is <hi>Nibbat</hi> in the second; in that, <hi>every man may see,</hi>
in the other, <hi>man may behold.</hi> And in the third, there is also a difference, the man, that
may see God, is <hi>Adam; Adam</hi> is a man, made of <hi>earth,</hi> the weakest man, even in <hi>nature</hi>
may <hi>see</hi> God; but the man that must behold afar off, is <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> is <hi>homo aeger,</hi>
a miserable man, a man that hath tasted affliction, and calamity, for that man lookes
after God in the next world, and as he feeles God with a <hi>rod</hi> in his hand here, so he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
God with a <hi>crown</hi> in his hand there. And of those sticks of sweet wood, of those
drops of sweet gums, shall we make up this present sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>In our first part,<note place="margin">1 Part. <hi>Illud.</hi>
                        </note> the manifestation of God to man, the first branch is the object, the
<hi>limited</hi> object, <hi>illud,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Optus.</note> 
                        <hi>Every man may see it;</hi> what is that? That which was proposed
in the verse immediately before, <hi>Remember that thou magnifie his worke which men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;</hi>
First, it is a <hi>worke,</hi> and therefore it is <hi>made,</hi> it hath an <hi>author,</hi> a <hi>creator;</hi> and then
it is <hi>his worke,</hi> the worke of God, and therefore manifests him. It is a worke, a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
not a casuall matter, this frame, this <hi>world.</hi> It is a <hi>worke,</hi> it was begun, and made
up,<note place="margin">Epipha.</note> not an eternall matter, this frame, this world. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> sayes well, <hi>Omnis error à
caecitate ad vanitatem;</hi> that's the progresse of error; every error begins in <hi>blindnesse,</hi>
and ignorance, but proceeds, and ends, in <hi>absurdity,</hi> in <hi>frivolousnesse.</hi> If men had not
put out the light of <hi>nature,</hi> they might discerne a creation in the world, that that was
made, it is a worke; but when they do put out that light, and deny a <hi>creation,</hi> into
what frivolous opinions they scatter themselves; what contradictory things, men that
seeme constant, say; what childish, what ridiculous things, men that seeme grave, and
sober <hi>fathers in Philosophy,</hi> say of this world? when they have said all, this one thing
will destroy all, if the world be eternall, it is <hi>God;</hi> for whatsoever had no beginning,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93359:145"/>
whatsoever needed nothing to give it a beeing, whatsoever was always of it selfe, is God.
So that to build up their opinions in one part, they destroy it in another; and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
our <hi>Hall,</hi> they build up our <hi>Chappell;</hi> by denying that the world was made, they
imply, they confesse a <hi>God;</hi> for if it had no <hi>Creator,</hi> it is no <hi>Creature,</hi> it is <hi>God;</hi> so that
they lose more then they gaine, and they seek <hi>damnation,</hi> unthriftily, and perish prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally;
they deny the <hi>Creation,</hi> left by the <hi>Creation,</hi> we should prove <hi>God,</hi> and their
very deniall of a Creation, their making of the world <hi>eternall,</hi> constitutes it to be <hi>God.</hi>
They deny <hi>any God,</hi> and then make a worse <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This world then is a <hi>work,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Opus ejus.</note> a limited, a determined, a circumscribed work; and it is
<hi>Opus ejus, his work,</hi> says <hi>Elihu</hi> there. But whose? Will you lay hold upon that? upon
that, that <hi>Elihu</hi> onely says, <hi>Remember his work,</hi> but names none? But two verses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(with which this verse hath connexion) he does name <hi>God.</hi> But let the work be
whose it will, whosoever be this <hi>He,</hi> this <hi>He</hi> must be <hi>God,</hi> whosoever gave the first bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Creatures,</hi> must be the <hi>Creator.</hi> If you will thinke, that <hi>Chance</hi> did it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
then <hi>fortune</hi> must be your <hi>God;</hi> and <hi>destiny</hi> must be your God, if you thinke <hi>desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
did it; and therefore you were as good attribute it to the <hi>right God,</hi> for a <hi>God</hi> it must
have; if it be a <hi>work,</hi> it was <hi>made,</hi> if it be a <hi>Creature,</hi> there is a <hi>Creator;</hi> and if it be <hi>his
work,</hi> that <hi>He,</hi> must be <hi>God,</hi> and there are no more Gods, but <hi>one.</hi> Every man hath a

in the next world, and dye, there <hi>visio</hi> is <hi>beatitudo,</hi> sight is salvation. Yet, <hi>Nulla visio

the <hi>Essence</hi> of God: our mortal eyes do not see bodies here; they see no <hi>substance,</hi> they see
onely <hi>quantities,</hi> and dimensions; our glorified bodily eyes, shall see the <hi>glory</hi> shed out of God,

And can man as a <hi>naturall man,</hi> doe that? See God so, as to know that there is a God?
Can hee doe it? Nay can he chuse but doe it? The question hath divided the School;

and the others deny that. But yet they differ, but thus far, that <hi>Thomas</hi> thinks that it is
so evident, that man cannot chuse but know it, though he resist it; The other thinks, in
it selfe, it is but so evident, as that a man may know it, if he imploy his naturall faculties,
without going any farther;<note place="margin">Viderunt.</note> thus much, indeed, thus little, they differ. Now the holy
Ghost is the God of <hi>Peace,</hi> and doth so far reconcile these two, in this text, as that first
in our reading, it is, <hi>That man may see God;</hi> and that <hi>Scotus</hi> does not deny; but in the
<hi>Originall,</hi> in the Hebrew, it is <hi>Casu,</hi> and <hi>Casu</hi> is, <hi>viderunt:</hi> not, every man <hi>may,</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man <hi>hath</hi> seen God: Though it goe not absolutely, so far, as <hi>Thomas,</hi> every man
<hi>must,</hi> no man can chuse but see God, yet it goes so far further then <hi>Scotus,</hi> (who ends
in every man <hi>may</hi>) as that it says, every man <hi>hath</hi> seen God. So that our labour never
lies in this, to prove to any man, that he <hi>may</hi> see God, but onely to remember him that
he <hi>hath</hi> seen God: not to make him beleeve that there is a God, but to make him see,
that he does beleeve it. <hi>Quid habes, quod non accepisti?</hi> And <hi>hast thou received any
thing</hi> and <hi>not seen,</hi> not known him that gave it? Who hath infused <hi>comfort</hi> into thee, into
thy distresses? Thine own <hi>Morall constancy?</hi> Who infused that? Who hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>terrors</hi> in thee? A dampe in thine owne <hi>heart?</hi> Who imprinted it? Sweare to <hi>me</hi>
now that thou beleevest not in <hi>God,</hi> and before midnight, thou wilt tell <hi>God,</hi> that thou
dost; Miserable distemper! not to see God in the <hi>light,</hi> and see him in the <hi>darke:</hi> not to
see him at <hi>noon,</hi> and see him fearfully at <hi>midnight:</hi> not to see, where we all see him, in
the Congregation, and to see him with terror, in the <hi>Suburbs of despaire,</hi> in the solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

there is no lownesse, no naturall, no spirituall dejection so low, but that that low
man may see God. Let him be <hi>filius terrae,</hi> the sonne of the earth, and of no body else,
let him be <hi>Dominus terrae,</hi> Lord of the earth, busied upon the earth, and nothing else,
let him be <hi>hospes terrae,</hi> a guest, a tenant, an inmate of the earth, halfe of him in the
earth, and the rest no where else, this poore man, this worldly man, this dying man,
may see God. To end this, you can place the spheare in no position, in no station, in
which the earth can eclipse the Sun; you can place this clod of earth, <hi>man,</hi> in no <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
in no <hi>melancholy,</hi> in no <hi>oppression,</hi> in no <hi>sinne,</hi> but that he <hi>may,</hi> but that he <hi>does</hi>
see God. The Marrigold opens to the Sunne, though it have no tongue to say so, the
Atheist does see God, though he have not grace to confesse it.</p>
                     <p>We have past through our first part,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> and the three branches of that; The <hi>object, God</hi>
in his <hi>works,</hi> and the <hi>faculty</hi> that apprehends, <hi>seeing,</hi> that is <hi>knowing,</hi> and the <hi>person</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the faculty, <hi>every man,</hi> even <hi>Adam.</hi> In our second part, which is a tacite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a likely objection, (Is not God in the highest heaven, <hi>afar</hi> off? yes; but <hi>man
may see afar off</hi>) we have the same three branches too, and yet not the same; the same
<hi>object, God,</hi> but in another manifestation, then in his <hi>worke, in glory;</hi> the same <hi>faculty,
seeing,</hi> but with other manner of eyes, glorified eyes; the same <hi>person, man,</hi> but
not <hi>man,</hi> as he is <hi>Adam,</hi> a meere <hi>naturall</hi> and earthly man, but man, as he is <hi>Enosh,</hi> who
by having tasted Gods corrections, or by having considered the miseries of this world,
is prepared for the joy and glory of the next. And in this part we will begin with the
person, <hi>man; Man may behold it afar off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How different are the wayes of God,<note place="margin">Enosh.</note> from the ways of man? the eyes of God from
the eyes of man? and the wayes, and eyes of a godly man, from the eyes, and wayes
of a man of this world? We looke still upon high persons, and after high places, and
from those heights, we thinke, we see far; but he that will see this object, must lye
low; it is best discerned in the dark, in a heavy, and a calamitous fortune. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
way is <hi>upward;</hi> I can better know a man upon the top of a steeple, then if he were
halfe that depth in a well; but yet for higher objects, I can better see the stars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in the bottome of a well, then if I stood upon the highest steeple upon earth. If I
twist a cable of infinite fadomes in length, if there be no ship to ride by it, nor anchor
to hold by it, what use is there of it? If Mannor thrust Mannor, and title flow into
title, and bags powre out into chests, if I have no anchor, <hi>(faith in Christ)</hi> if I have
not a ship to carry to a haven, (a soule to save) what's my long cable to me? If I adde
number to number, a span, a mile long, if at the end of all that long line of numbers,
there be nothing that notes, <hi>pounds,</hi> or <hi>crownes,</hi> or <hi>shillings,</hi> what's that long number,
but so many millions of millions of nothing? If my span of life become a mile of life,
my penny a pound, my pint a gallon, my acre a sheere; yet if there be nothing of the
next world at the end, so much peace of conscience, so much joy, so much glory, still
all is but <hi>nothing</hi> multiplied, and that is still nothing at all. 'Tis the <hi>end</hi> that qualifies
all; and what kinde of man I shall be at my end, upon my <hi>death-bed,</hi> what trembling
hands, and what lost legs, what deafe eares, and what gummy eyes, I shall have then,
I know; and the nearer I come to that disposition, in my life, (the more <hi>mortified</hi> I am)
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93359:147"/>
the better I am disposed to see this object, future glory. God made the Sun, and Moon,
and Stars, glorious lights for man to see by; but mans infirmity requires <hi>spectacles;</hi>
and affliction does that office. Gods meaning was, that by the sun-shine of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and by the beames of honour, and temporall blessings, a man should see farre
into him; but I know not how he is come to need <hi>spectacles;</hi> scarse any man sees much
in this matter, till affliction shew it him. God made the ballance even; riches may
show God, and poverty may show God; let the two Testaments, the old and the
new, be the ballance, and so they are even; the blessednesse of the old Testament runs
all upon temporall blessings, and worldly riches; <hi>Blessed in the city, and in the field;
blessed in the fruit of thy cattell, and of thy wombe;</hi> In the new Testament utterly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
<hi>Blessed are the poore, Blessed are they that mourne, Blessed are they that are persecuted,
and reviled;</hi> but the blessednesse of the old Testament, <hi>temporall blessings,</hi> are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
as the old Testament was; that's expir'd. The blessednesse of the Gospell, is as
the Gospell, everlasting: and therfore the low way is the best way; <hi>adversity</hi> will be
the best way to see God by. I speake not of meere <hi>beggery,</hi> of having nothing; but
of having lesse then we had; the losse of some of that possession, or honour, or wealth,
or health, which we had, conduces more to this sight of God, then the additions of
any of these. Extreme want may put a man out of his way to God, as far as abundance
and superfluity; as we say in civill things, the <hi>midde men</hi> aise the Subsidy, not the <hi>great
men,</hi> nor the <hi>beggers;</hi> so the middle men see farthest into God, and serve him best; not
the abounding,<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 8.</note> not the wanting man. <hi>Solomon</hi> prayes against both; against riches, and
against poverty too; but yet not as though the danger were equall, if the words be
well considered; the danger of his <hi>poverty</hi> is, <hi>lest</hi> he steale, and take the Name of <hi>God
in vaine;</hi> that is, <hi>forsweare</hi> the <hi>theft;</hi> a great fault, two great faults; but these two
amount not to that one, which arises out of abundance, <hi>Lest I be full, and deny thee,
and say,<note place="margin">Hierome.</note> Who is the Lord?</hi> And that Proverb, that <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> cals
not, <hi>paupertatem,</hi> but <hi>mendicitatem;</hi> and that is often indeed, the mother and nurse of
many enormous mischiefs.<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> takes the word, <hi>poverty,</hi> in that place, but he
multiplies it, <hi>Paupertates ne dederis, Give me not, O Lord, a double poverty;</hi> poverty <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
and poverty in <hi>opinion;</hi> poverty, and a murmurning with my poverty; for that also
is the mother,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12.</note>
and nurse of many enormous mischiefs.<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> 
                        <hi>I know how to abound, and how
to want;</hi> It is the harder worke, <hi>ferre abundantiam;</hi> aboundance is a burden, want is
but a weaknesse; and it is a greater torment, to be pressed under a great weight, then
to lye bed-rid. To end this, the person in our Text is <hi>Enosh, man;</hi> but not every man,
as before, <hi>Adam;</hi> but that man upon whom Gods hand hath been in the losse of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that he had before. As the body of man is mellowed in the grave, and made fit
for glory in the resurrection, so the minde of man by suffering is suppled; <hi>Adam</hi> is made
<hi>Enosh;</hi> and he may see.</p>
                     <p>The person is the same,<note place="margin">Intuebitur.</note> and yet changed; <hi>man,</hi> but another kinde of man; The
<hi>means</hi> of apprehending is the same, and yet changed too, <hi>seeing,</hi> but another kinde of
seeing. This man, thus disposed, thus matured, thus mellowed, thus suppled, thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendred
by Gods easie corrections, he whom God hath not left to himself, nor yet put
him beyond himself, not fulfilled all, but yet not frustrated all his desires neither, laid
his hand upon him, so as to keep him downe from swelling up against him, but yet so
too, as to keep him up, from sinking, or falling from him, that man, that <hi>Enosh</hi> may
see the hand of God, and take God by the hand, and bid him <hi>welcome,</hi> and finde a rich,
and a sweet advantage in that correction; it is a <hi>seeing of God,</hi> not as before, in his <hi>works</hi>
abroad, but in his <hi>working</hi> upon himself, at home. Such a man God strikes so, as that
when he strikes, he strikes fire, and lights him a candle, to see his presence by; we doe
not finde that <hi>Iob</hi> came to his <hi>Dominus dedit,</hi> to his confession, <hi>The Lord giveth,</hi> till
he came to the <hi>Dominus abstulit;</hi> to the sense of Gods taking away, not to expresse his
sense of Gods blessings to him, till he felt his corrections upon him; and then they
came together, <hi>Dominus dedit,</hi> and <hi>abstulit, The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.</hi>
Darknesse is that, by which the holy Ghost himselfe hath chosen to expresse <hi>hell;</hi> hell is
<hi>darknesse;</hi> and the way to it, to hell, is <hi>Excacation</hi> in this life, blindnesse in our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
eyes. Eternall life hereafter is <hi>Visio Dei,</hi> the sight of God, and the way to that here,
is to <hi>see God</hi> here: and the <hi>eye-salve</hi> for that is, to be crossed in our desires in this world,
by the hand of God. When Christ presents things necessary for his service, he proposes
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93359:147"/>
them thus; this is his Inventary; <hi>Gold</hi> against poverty, <hi>white clothes</hi> against naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<note place="margin">Apo 3. 18.</note> and <hi>collyrium,</hi> eye-salve to see by. Now for the two first he bids us <hi>buy them;
buy-gold, buy clothes,</hi> that is, <hi>labour,</hi> endeavour to get thm; he does not say, buy
<hi>the eye-salve,</hi> that is, affliction; no man is to thrust himselfe into unnecessary dangers,
or persecutions, and call his indiscretion <hi>Martyrdome;</hi> It is to be presumed, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, how high or how abundant soever, hath eye salve enough, affliction and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
enough, if he do apply them: and therefore Christ does not say, <hi>buy them;</hi> hunt
after them, expose thy selfe to them; but he sayes onely, <hi>Anoynt</hi> thy eyes <hi>with</hi> them,
I will give thee the physick, (crosses and calamities here) do thou apply them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature of the medicine, and to the purpose of the physitian, and by them
thou shalt see God.</p>
                     <p>Our translation carries this word no farther in this part of the Text, then the other
in the former; There it was, <hi>every man may see;</hi> here it is, <hi>man,</hi> that is, <hi>this man may
behold.</hi> But as we showed you, that the former was in the originall <hi>Casu, viderunt,</hi> every
man, (let him say what he will to the contrary) yet he <hi>hath</hi> seen God, so in this part,
the word in the originall, is <hi>Iabbit,</hi> and that is <hi>videbit,</hi> in the <hi>future, he shall see,</hi> This
sight of God is not in him, <hi>naturally,</hi> that we can be sure he <hi>hath</hi> seen him, but it is
reserved to the <hi>future;</hi> let him be thus wrought upon by Gods hand, and <hi>videbit,</hi> in the
future, he <hi>shall</hi> see. Now, you remember what designes the future; <hi>he shall see;</hi> is a note
of the <hi>future,</hi> and so is, <hi>he will see.</hi> This man, this <hi>Enosh,</hi> thus moulded, thus kneaded,
by the hand of God, he <hi>shall</hi> see God, he shall (in a manner) whether he will or no, a
holy, and a heavenly violence shall be offered him, it shall not be in the power of the
world, the flesh or the devill, to blind him, he shall see God; and then <hi>he will see God,</hi>
his will shall be inclined, and disposed to it, and every first beame of Gods grace, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
influence of the Spirit of God, shall open his eyes; God shall be so jealous of him, as
that he <hi>shall</hi> see God, he shall be so watchfull upon God, and his motions, as that he <hi>will</hi>
see him.</p>
                     <p>And more then see him; for <hi>Iabbit,</hi> is <hi>Intuebitur,</hi> he will <hi>behold him,</hi> contemplate
God, ruminate, meditate upon God. Man <hi>sees</hi> best in the <hi>light,</hi> but <hi>meditates</hi> best in the
<hi>darke;</hi> for our sight of God, it is enough, that God gives the light of <hi>nature;</hi> to behold
him so, as to fixe upon him in meditation, God benights us, or eclipses us, or casts a
cloud of medicinall afflictions, and wholsome corrections upon us. Naturally we dwell
longer upon the consideration of God, when we see the Sun eclipsed, then when we see
it rise, we passe by that as an ordinary thing; and so in our afflictions we stand, and
looke upon God, and we behold him. A man may see God, and forget that ever he
saw him;<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 44.</note> 
                        <hi>When saw we thee hungry, or naked, or sick, or in prison,</hi> say those mercilesse
men; they forgot; but Christ remembers that they did see him, but not <hi>behold</hi> him, see
him, and looke off, see him so as aggravated their sin, more then if they had never seene
him. But that man, who through his owne <hi>red glasse,</hi> can see Christ, in that colour too,
through his own miseries, can see Christ Jesus in his blood, that through the calumnies
that have been put upon himselfe, can see the revilings that were multiplyed upon Christ,
that in his own imprisonment, can see Christ in the grave, and in his owne enlargement,
Christ in his resurrection, this man, this <hi>Enosh,</hi> beholds God, and he beholds him <hi>é lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginquo,</hi>
which is another step in this branch, <hi>he sees him afar off.</hi>

God is, I can see him at any distance. Being established in my foundation upon God,
being built up by faith, in that notion of God, in which he hath manifested himselfe

made like unto him, in suffering, as he suffered, I can see round about me, even to

of the Text, It is <hi>Gods workes,</hi> manifesting himselfe even to the naturall man.
But this man, this <hi>Enosh,</hi> raised by his dejection, rectified by humiliation, <hi>may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
what?</hi> here is no <hi>illud,</hi> no such word as <hi>that,</hi> no object limited, and therefore
it is that <hi>which no eye hath seene, nor eare heard, nor heart of man conceived,</hi> it is God
in the glory, and assembly of his immortall Saints in heaven. How many times go
we to Comedies, to Masques, to places of great and noble resort, nay even to Church
onely to see the company? If I had no other errand to heaven, but the <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saints,</hi> the fellowship of the faithfull, Lo see that flock of <hi>Lambs,</hi> Innocent,
unbaptized <hi>children,</hi> recompensed with the twice-baptized <hi>Martyrs,</hi> (baptized in <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and baptized in their owne <hi>blood</hi>) and that middle sort, the children bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in blood, and not in the water, that rescued Christ Jesus, by their death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Herod;</hi> to see the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and not know one from the
other, by their writings, for they all write the same things (for <hi>prophecy</hi> is but
<hi>antidated Gospell,</hi> and <hi>Gospell</hi> but <hi>postdated prophecy;</hi>) to see holy <hi>Matrons</hi> saved by
the bearing, and bringing up of children, and holy <hi>Virgins,</hi> saved by restoring their
bodies in the integrity, that they received them, sit all upon one seate; to see
<hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> crowned all with one crowne, and <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poore</hi> inherit one
portion; to see this scene, this Court, this Church, this Catholique Church, not
onely <hi>Easterne</hi> and <hi>Westerne,</hi> but <hi>Militant</hi> and <hi>Triumphant</hi> Church, all in one roome
together, to see this <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> this fellowship of the faithfull, is worth
all the paynes, that that sight costs us in this world.</p>
                     <p>But then to see the <hi>head</hi> of this Church, the Sunne, that shed all these beames,
the God of glory <hi>face</hi> to <hi>face,</hi> to see him <hi>sicuti est,</hi> as he <hi>is,</hi> to know him, <hi>at cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus,</hi>
as I am knowne, what darke, and inglorious fortune would I not passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
to come to that light, and that glory? How then hath God doubled his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
upon those persons to whom he hath afforded two great lights, a <hi>Sunne</hi> to
<hi>rule their day,</hi> honour and prosperity, and a <hi>Moone to rule their night,</hi> humiliation
and adversity, to whom he hath given <hi>both Types,</hi> in themselves, to see this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
glory by, that is, Titles and places of honour in this world, and specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in themselves to see this glory by afflictions, and crosses in this world. And
therefore since God gives both these no where so plentifully, as in <hi>Courts</hi> the place
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93359:148"/>
of <hi>Honour,</hi> and the place of <hi>Crosses</hi> too, the place of <hi>rising</hi> and the place of <hi>falling</hi> too,
you, you especially, who by having your station there, in the Court it selfe, are in
the Court exemplified, and copied in your owne noble house, you that have seen
God characterized in his <hi>Types,</hi> in titles of greatnesse, you that have beheld God presented
in his <hi>spectacle</hi> of Crosses and afflictions, the <hi>daily bread</hi> of Courts, <hi>Blesse ye the Lord;
praise him, and magnifie him for ever,</hi> and declare the wondrous workes that he hath
done for the Sonnes of men; for certainly many woes, and invincible darknesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
those, to whom neither the hand of God in his <hi>works,</hi> nor the hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E shall have occasion by and by, to say something of the danger of
<hi>Curiosity,</hi> and something of the danger of the <hi>broad way,</hi> in which,
too many walk: we will not therefore fall into either of these faults,
at first, we will not be over curious, nor we will not stray, nor cast
our selves into that broad, and boundlesse way, by entring into
those various, and manifold senses, which Expositors have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
in the handling of this place, and this part of this book; but
we take the plainest way, and that in which, the best meet, and concur, that these words
are spoken of the <hi>Ioyes,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> reserved for them, who overcome the <hi>fraud,</hi> and the
<hi>fury,</hi> the <hi>allurements,</hi> and the <hi>violences</hi> of <hi>Antichrist;</hi> in whom, in that name, and person of
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> we consider all <hi>supplanters,</hi> and all <hi>seducers,</hi> all opposers of the kingdome of
Christ, in us; for, as every man hath <hi>spontaneum daemonem,</hi> (as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speakes) a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

a day, I am afraid we should be as ill that day, as if the devill were awake, and in action,
so if those disputed, &amp; problematical <hi>Antichrists, Eastern</hi> &amp; <hi>Western</hi> Antichrist, Antichrist
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Antichrist of <hi>Constantinople, Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> were removed out of the world,
we should not for all that be delivered of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that is, of that opposition to the
kingdome of Christ, which is in our selvs. This part of the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and primarily, the glorious victory of them, who, in the later end of the world, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
stood out the persecutions of the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> enter into the triumph of heaven: And
it extends it self to all, by way of fair accommodation, who after a battel with their own
<hi>Antichrists,</hi> and victory over their owne enemies, are also made partakers of those
triumphs, those joyes, those glories, of which S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in this <hi>propheticall glasse,</hi> in
this <hi>perspective of visions,</hi> saw <hi>A great multitude, which no man could number, of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are then upon the contemplation of the joyes of heaven,<note place="margin">Divisio:</note> which are everlasting, &amp;
must we wring them into the discourse of an <hi>houre?</hi> of the glory of heaven which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and must we divide it into <hi>parts?</hi> we must; we will; we doe; into two parts; first, the
<hi>number,</hi> the great number of those that shall be saved; And then, the glorious <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
which shall be imprinted on them, who are saved: first, that salvation is a more
extensive thing, &amp; more communicable, then sullen cloystrall, that have walled salvation
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93359:149"/>
in a monastery, or in an ermitage, take it to be; or then the over-valuers of their own <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and righteousnesse, which have determined salvation in themselves, take it to be; for,
<hi>It is a great multitude, which no man can number, of all nations &amp;c.</hi> And then, in the second
place, salvation is the possession of such endowments, as <hi>naturally</hi> invite all, to the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of that, which is exposed and offered to all; that we all labour here, that we may
all stand hereafter, <hi>before the Throne, and before the Lambe, clothed in white robes &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the first of these, we shall passe by these steps; first, we shall consider the <hi>sociablenesse,</hi>
the <hi>communicablenesse</hi> of God himself, who gives us the <hi>earth,</hi> and offers us <hi>heaven,</hi> and
desires to have his kingdome well peopled; he would have <hi>many,</hi> he would have <hi>all,</hi> he
would have <hi>every one</hi> of them have all. And then, the first word of the text, <hi>(After this)</hi>
will carry us to the consideration of that which was done before; which was, first, that
they which were of this number, <hi>were sealed,</hi> and then they which were so sealed before,
were a great number, <hi>one hundred forty four thousand;</hi> but they who were made partakers
of all this after, were innumerable, <hi>After this I beheld a great multitude, which no man
could number;</hi> And therefore we shall shut up that first part with this consideration, what
sense, what interpretation may belong unto those places, where Christ says, <hi>that the way
to heaven is narrow, and the gate straight:</hi> of these peeces we shall make up our first part;
And for the particulars belonging to the second, we shall fitliest open them, then, when
we come to the handling of them.</p>
                     <p>Our first step then in this first part,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> is, the <hi>sociablenesse,</hi> the <hi>communicablenesse</hi> of God;
He loves holy meetings, he loves the <hi>communion of Saints,</hi> the <hi>houshold of the faithfull:
Deliciae ejus,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, his delight is to be with the Sons of men,</hi> and that the Sons of
men should be with him: Religion is not a <hi>melancholy;</hi> the spirit of God is not a <hi>dampe;</hi>
the Church is not a <hi>grave:</hi> it is a <hi>fold,</hi> it is an <hi>Arke,</hi> it is a <hi>net,</hi> it is a <hi>city,</hi> it is a <hi>kingdome,</hi>
not onely a house, but a house that hath <hi>many mansions</hi> in it: still it is a <hi>plurall</hi> thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of <hi>many:</hi> and very good <hi>grammarians</hi> amongst the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> have thought, and said,
that that <hi>name,</hi> by which God notifies himself to the world, in the very beginning of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi>
which is <hi>Elohim,</hi> as it is a <hi>plurall word</hi> there, so it hath no <hi>singular:</hi> they say we cannot
name God, but <hi>plurally:</hi> so sociable, so communicable, so extensive, so derivative of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is God, and so manifold are the beames, and the emanations that flow out from him.</p>
                     <p>It is a garden worthy of your walking in it: Come into it,<note place="margin">Deus unus.</note> but by the gate of <hi>nature:</hi> The
naturall man had much to do, to conceive God: a God that should be but <hi>one God:</hi> and
therefore scattered his thoughts upon a multiplicity of Gods: and he found it, (as he
thought) reasonable, to think, that there should be a God of <hi>Iustice,</hi> a God of <hi>Wisedome,</hi>
a God of <hi>Power,</hi> and so made the severall <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, severall <hi>Gods,</hi> and thought
that one God might have enough to do, with the matters of <hi>Iustice,</hi> another with the
causes that belonged to <hi>power,</hi> and so also, with the courts of <hi>Wisedome:</hi> the naturall
man, as he cannot conceive a <hi>vacuity,</hi> that any thing should be empty, so he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that any one thing, though that be a <hi>God,</hi> should fill all things: and therefore strays
upon a <hi>pluralty</hi> of Gods, upon many Gods, though, in truth, (as <hi>Athanasius</hi> expresses it)
<hi>ex multitudine numinum, nullitas numinum,</hi> he that constitutes many Gods destroys all
God; for no God can be God, if he be not <hi>all-sufficient;</hi> yet naturally, (I mean in such na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as our nature is) a man does not easily conceive God to be <hi>alone,</hi> to be but <hi>one;</hi> he
thinks there should be company in the Godhead.</p>
                     <p>Bring it farther then so.<note place="margin">3 Personae.</note> A man that lies in the dregs of obscured, and vitiated nature,
does not easily discern, <hi>unicum Deum,</hi> a God that should be <hi>alone,</hi> a God that should be
but one God. Reason rectified, (rectified by the word of God) can discern this, this one
God. But when by that means of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> he does apprehend <hi>Deum unicum, one God;</hi>
does he finde that God <hi>alone?</hi> are there not <hi>three Persons,</hi> though there be but <hi>one God?</hi>

to take in all) <hi>Deos certos &amp; incertos,</hi> Gods, which they were sure were Gods, &amp; Gods w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
might be Gods, for any thing they knew to the contrary. There is but one God; but yet
was that one God ever <hi>alone?</hi> There were more <hi>generations</hi> (infinitely infinite) before the
world was made, then there have been <hi>minutes,</hi> since it was made: all that while; there were
no <hi>creasures;</hi> but yet was God alone, any one minute of al this? was there not alwais a <hi>Father</hi>
                        <pb n="281" facs="tcp:93359:149"/>
and a <hi>Son,</hi> &amp; a <hi>holy Ghost?</hi> And had not they, always an acquiescence in one another, an
exercise of <hi>Affection,</hi> (as we may so say) a love, a delight, and a complacency towards
one another? So, as that the Father could not be without the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> so as
neither <hi>Sonne,</hi> nor <hi>holy Ghost</hi> could be without the <hi>Father,</hi> nor without one another;
God was from all eternity collected into <hi>one God,</hi> yet from all eternity he derived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into <hi>three persons:</hi> God could not be so alone, but that there have been three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as long as there hath been one God.</p>
                     <p>Had God company enough of himselfe;<note place="margin">Creatio.</note> was he satisfied in the <hi>three Persons?</hi> We
see he proceeded further; he came to a <hi>Creation;</hi> And as soon as he had made <hi>light,</hi>
(which was his first Creature) he took a pleasure in it; he said <hi>it was good;</hi> he was
glad of it; glad of the <hi>Sea,</hi> glad of the <hi>Earth,</hi> glad of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and <hi>Starres,</hi>
and he said of every one, <hi>It is good;</hi> But when he had made <hi>All,</hi> peopled the whole
world, brought all creatures together, then he was <hi>very glad,</hi> and then he said, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that <hi>it was good,</hi> but that <hi>it was very good:</hi> God was so far from being <hi>alone,</hi> as that
he found not the fulnesse of being well, till <hi>all</hi> was made, till all Creatures met together,
in <hi>an Host,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> calls it, then the <hi>good</hi> was extended into <hi>very good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Did God satisfie himselfe with this <hi>visible</hi> and discernible world;<note place="margin">Angeli.</note> with all on earth,
and all between that, and him? were those <hi>foure Monarchies,</hi> the <hi>foure Elements,</hi> and
all the subjects of those foure Monarchies, (if all the foure Elements have Creatures)
company enough for God? was that <hi>Heptarchie,</hi> the <hi>seven kingdomes</hi> of the <hi>seven
Planets,</hi> conversation enough for him? Let every Starre in the firmament, be (so some
take them to be) a severall world, was all this enough? we see, God drew persons nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to him, then Sunne, or Moon, or Starres, or any thing, which is <hi>visible,</hi> and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
to us, he created <hi>Angels;</hi> How many, how great? Arithmetique lacks <hi>numbers</hi> to
to expresse them, proportion lacks <hi>Dimensions</hi> to figure them; so far was God from
being <hi>alone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet God had not shed himselfe far enough; he had the <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Homines.</note> the Whale
in the Sea, and <hi>Behemoth</hi> and the <hi>Elephant</hi> upon the land; and all these great <hi>heavenly
bodies</hi> in the way, and <hi>Angels</hi> in their infinite numbers, and manifold offices, in heaven;
But, because <hi>Angels,</hi> could not propagate, nor make more <hi>Angels,</hi> he enlarged his love,
in making <hi>man,</hi> that so he might enjoy all natures at once, and have the nature of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
and the nature of <hi>earthly Creatures,</hi> in one Person. God would not be without man,
nor he would not come single, not alone to the making of man; but it is <hi>Faciamas ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,
Let us, us, make man;</hi> God, in his whole counsail, in his whole Colledge, in his
whole society, in the whole Trinity, makes man, in whom the whole nature of all the
world should meet.</p>
                     <p>And still our large, and our Communicable God,<note place="margin">Christus.</note> affected this association so, as that
having <hi>three Persons</hi> in himselfe, and having <hi>Creatures</hi> of divers natures, and having col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
all natures in <hi>man,</hi> who consisted of a spirituall nature, as well as a bodily, he
would have one liker himselfe, then man was; And therefore he made <hi>Christ,</hi> God and
Man, in one person, Creature and Creator together; One greater then the <hi>Seraphim,</hi>
and yet lesse then a worme; Soveraigne to all <hi>nature,</hi> and yet subject to <hi>naturall</hi> infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
Lord of <hi>life, life,</hi> it selfe, and yet prisoner to <hi>Death;</hi> Before, and beyond all
measures of <hi>Time,</hi> &amp; <hi>Born</hi> at so many <hi>moneths,</hi> yet <hi>Circumcised</hi> at so many <hi>days, Crucified</hi>
at so many <hi>years, Rose</hi> againe at so many <hi>Houres;</hi> How sure did God make himselfe of
a companion in Christ, who united himselfe, in his godhead, so inseparably to him, as
that that godhead left not that body, then when it lay dead in the grave, but staid with
it then, as closely, as when he wrought his greatest miracles.</p>
                     <p>Beyond all this,<note place="margin">Ecclesia.</note> God having thus maried soule and body in one man, and man and
God, in one Christ, he maries this Christ to the Church. Now, consider this Church
in the <hi>Type</hi> and figure of the Church, <hi>the Arke;</hi> in the Arke there were more of every
sort of cleane Creatures reserved,<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 2.</note> then of the uncleane; <hi>seven</hi> of those, for <hi>two</hi> of these:
why should we feare, but that in the Church, there are more reserved for salvation then
for destruction?<note place="margin">Act. 2. 3.</note> And into <hi>that room</hi> (which was not a Type of the Church, but the
very Church it selfe) in which they all met upon <hi>whitsunday,</hi> the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> came so as
that they were enabled, by the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> to convay, and propagate, and derive
God, (as they did) <hi>to every nation under heaven:</hi> so much does God delight in man, so
much does God desire to unite and associate man unto him; and then, what shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93359:150"/>
or frustrate Gods desires and intentions so farre, as that they should come to
him, but singly, <hi>one by one,</hi> whom he <hi>cals,</hi> and <hi>wooes,</hi> and <hi>drawes</hi> by thousands, and by
whole Congregations?</p>
                     <p>Be pleased to carry your considerations,<note place="margin">Quàm citò.</note> upon another testimony of Gods love to
the society of man, which is, his dispatch in making this match, his <hi>speed</hi> in gathering
and establishing this Church; for, forwardnesse is the best argument of love, and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
interruptions by the way, argue no great desire to the end; <hi>disguises</hi> before, are
shrewd <hi>prophecies</hi> of jealousies after: But God made hast to the consummation of this
Marriage,<note place="margin">1. 6.</note> between Christ and the Church. Such words as those to the <hi>Colosrians,</hi> (and
such words, that is, words to such purpose, there are divers) <hi>The Gospell is come unto you,
as it is into all the world;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">13.</note> And againe; <hi>It bringeth forth fruit, as it doth in you also;</hi> And
so likewise, <hi>The Gospell which is preached to every creature which is under heaven;</hi> such
words, I say, a very great part of the <hi>Antients</hi> have taken so literally, as thereupon to
conclude, That in the life of the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, the Gospell was preached, and the
Church established over all the world.</p>
                     <p>Now will you consider also, <hi>who</hi> did this, what persons? cunning and crafty persons
are not the best <hi>instruments</hi> in great businesses,<note place="margin">Quae Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta.</note> if those businesses be <hi>good,</hi> as well as
great. Here God imployed such persons, as would not have perswaded a man, that
<hi>grasse</hi> was green, that <hi>blood</hi> was red, if it had been denyed unto them: Persons that
could not have bound up your understanding, with a <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> nor have entendred, or
mollified it with a <hi>verse:</hi> Persons that had nothing but that which God himselfe calls
<hi>the foolishnesse of preaching,</hi> to bring <hi>Philosophers</hi> that argued, <hi>Heretiques</hi> that wrangled,

well, as <hi>how soone,</hi> and by <hi>what persons,</hi> so to <hi>what Doctrine,</hi> God brought them. Wee
aske but St. <hi>Augustins</hi> question, <hi>Quis tantam multitudinem, ad legem, carni &amp; sanguini
centrariam, induceret, nisi Deus? Who but God himselfe, would have drawn the world to
a Religion so contrary to flesh and blood?</hi> Take but one piece of the Christian Religion,
but <hi>one article</hi> of our <hi>faith,</hi> in the same Fathers mouth; <hi>Res incredibilis resurrectio;</hi>
That this body should be eaten by <hi>fishes</hi> in the sea, and then those fishes eaten by other
<hi>men,</hi> or that one man should be eaten by another man, and so become <hi>both one man,</hi> and
then that for all this assimilation, and union, there should arise two men, at the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Res incredibilis,</hi> sayes he, this resurrection is an incredible thing, <hi>Sed magis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibile, totum mundum credidisse rem tam incredibilem, That all the world should so soone
believe a thing so incredible, is more incredible, then the thing it selfe.</hi> That any should
believe <hi>any,</hi> is strange, but more that <hi>all</hi> such believe <hi>all,</hi> that appertains to Christianity.
The <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> pestilent Heretiques, grew to a great number, <hi>Sed
vix duo vel tres, de iisdem, eadem docebant,</hi> says <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> scarce any two or three amongst
them, were of one opinion. The <hi>Acatians,</hi> the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians, omnes
Arium parentem agnoscunt,</hi> sayes the same Father, they all call themselves <hi>Arians,</hi>
but they had as many opinions, not onely as <hi>names,</hi> but as <hi>persons.</hi> And that one Sect
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Irenaeus.</note> was quickly divided, and sub-divided into 70 sects. But <hi>so God loved
the world,</hi> the society and company of good soules, <hi>ut quasi una Domus Mundus,</hi> the
whole world was as one well governed house; <hi>similiter credunt quasi una anima,</hi> all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
the same things, as though they had all but one soule; <hi>Constanter praedicabant, quasi
unum os,</hi> At the same houre there was a Sermon at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and a Sermon at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and both so like, for <hi>fundamentall</hi> things, as if they had been preached out of one mouth.</p>
                     <p>And as this Doctrine,<note place="margin">Durat ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue.</note> so <hi>incredible</hi> in reason, was <hi>thus soone,</hi> and by <hi>these persons,</hi>
thus uniformely preached over all the world, so shall it, as it doth, continue to the
worlds end; which is another argument of Gods love to our company, and of his
loathnesse to lose us. All <hi>Heresies,</hi> and the very names of the Heretiques, are so utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perished in the world, as that if their memories were not preserved in those <hi>Fathers</hi>
which have written against them, we could finde their names no where. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> about
<hi>one hundred and eighty</hi> yeers after Christ, may reckon about <hi>twenty</hi> heresies: <hi>Tertullian,
twenty</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> yeares after <hi>him,</hi> perchance <hi>twenty seven;</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> some a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty</hi> after him, <hi>sixty;</hi> and <hi>fifty</hi> yeare after that, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> some <hi>ninety:</hi> yet
after all these, (and but a very few yeares, after <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>Theodoret</hi> sayes, that in his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93359:150"/>
time, there was no one man alive, that held any of those heresies: That all those he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
should rot, being upheld by the sword, and that onely the Christian Religion
should grow up, being mowed down by the sword, That one graine of Corne should
be cast away, and many eares grow out of that, (as <hi>Leo</hi> makes the comparison) That
one man should be executed, because he was a Christian, and all that saw him execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the <hi>Executioner</hi> himself, should thereupon become <hi>Christians,</hi> (a case that fell
out more then once, in the <hi>primitive Church</hi>) That as the flood threw down the Courts
of Princes, and lifted up the Arke of God, so the effusion of Christian blood, should
destroy <hi>heresies,</hi> and advance <hi>Christianity</hi> it self; this is argument abundantly enough,
that God had a love to man, and a desire to draw man to his society, and in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to bring them to salvation.</p>
                     <p>I will not dismisse you from this consideration,<note place="margin">Reformatio.</note> till you have brought it thus much
nearer, as to remember a later testimony of Gods love to our company, in the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Religion;</hi> A miracle scarce lesse, then the first propagation thereof, in the

                     <p>And yet,<note place="margin">Tu ipse.</note> thou must not depart from this contemplation, till thou have made <hi>thy
self</hi> an argument of all this; till thou have concluded out of this, that God hath made
love to thy soule, thy weake soule, thy sick, and foule, and sinfull soule, That he hath
<hi>written</hi> to thee, in all his <hi>Scriptures,</hi> sent <hi>Ambassage</hi> to thee, in all his <hi>preachers, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
thee, in all his <hi>temporall,</hi> and <hi>spirituall</hi> blessings, That he hath come to thee, even
in actions of <hi>uncle annesse,</hi> in actions of <hi>unfaithfulnesse</hi> towards men, in actions of <hi>distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse</hi>
towards God, and hath checked thy conscience, and delivered thee from some
sins, even then when thou wast ready to commit them, as all the rest, (That that
God, who is but one in himselfe, is yet <hi>three persons,</hi> That those three, who were <hi>all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient</hi>
to themselves, would yet make more, make <hi>Angels,</hi> make <hi>man,</hi> make a <hi>Christ,</hi>

and in so <hi>short a space,</hi> over all <hi>the world,</hi> and then <hi>reforme</hi> that Church againe,
so soone, to such a heighth) as these, I say, are to all the world, so be thou thy <hi>self,</hi> and
Gods exceeding goodnesse to thee, an argument, That that God who hath shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so loath to lose <hi>thee,</hi> is certainly loath to lose <hi>any other</hi> soule; but as he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
himself to us all here, so he would have us all partake of his joy, and glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
he that fils his <hi>Militant</hi> Church thus, would not have his <hi>Triumphant</hi> Church
empty.</p>
                     <p>So far we consider the accessiblenesse,<note place="margin">Sigillati.</note> the communicablenesse, the conversation of
our good, and gracious <hi>God</hi> to us, in the generall. There is a more speciall manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
even in the first word of our Text, <hi>After this;</hi> After what? After he had
seene the servants of God <hi>sealed;</hi> sealed: This seale seales the contract betweene God
and Man: And then consider how generall this seale is: First, God sealed us, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
his <hi>Image</hi> in our soules, and in the powers thereof, at our <hi>creation;</hi> and so,
every man hath this seale, and he hath it, as soone as he hath a soule: The <hi>wax,</hi> the
<hi>matter,</hi> is in his <hi>conception;</hi> the <hi>seale,</hi> the forme, is in his quickning, in his <hi>inanimation;</hi>
as, in <hi>Adam,</hi> the waxe was that <hi>red earth,</hi> which he was made of, the <hi>seale</hi> was that
<hi>soule,</hi> that <hi>breath</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> which God breathed into him. Where the Organs of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are so indisposed, as that this soule cannot exercise her faculties, in that man, (as in
<hi>naturall Idiots,</hi> or otherwise) there, there is a <hi>curtaine</hi> drawn over this Image, but yet
there this Image is, the Image of God, is in the most <hi>naturall Idiot,</hi> as well as in the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of men: worldly men draw <hi>other pictures</hi> over this picture, other images over this
image: The <hi>wanton</hi> man may paint <hi>beauty,</hi> the <hi>ambitious</hi> may paint <hi>honour,</hi> the <hi>covetous
wealth,</hi> and so deface this image, but yet there this image is, and even <hi>in hell</hi> it selfe it
will be, in him that goes down into hell: <hi>uri potest in gehenna, non exuri,</hi> sayes St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
The image of God may burne in hell, but as long as the soule remaines, that
image remaines there too; And then, thou who wouldest not burne their picture, that
loved thee, wilt thou betray the picture of the Maker, thy Saviour, thy Sanctifier, to
the torments of hell? Amongst the manifold and perpetuall interpretations of that
article, <hi>He descended into hell,</hi> this is a new one, that thou sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

flesh, when the image of the invisible God, <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the onely Sonne of God,
tooke our nature: for, as the <hi>Tyrant</hi> wished, that all mankinde were but one body,
that he might behead all mankinde at a blow, so God tooke into his mercie, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
in one person: As intirely, as all mankinde was in <hi>Adam,</hi> all mankinde was in
<hi>Christ;</hi> and as the <hi>seale of the Serpent</hi> is in all, by <hi>originall sinne,</hi> so the <hi>seale</hi> of God,
<hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> is on us <hi>all,</hi> by his assuming our <hi>nature.</hi> Christ Jesus tooke our souls, and
our bodies, our whole nature; and as no Leper, no person, how infectiously soever he
be diseased in his body, can say, surely Christ never tooke this body, this Leprosie, this
pestilence, this rottennesse, so no Leprous soule must say, Christ never tooke this
pride, this adultery, this murder upon himself; he sealed us all in <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> when
he tooke <hi>both,</hi> and though both dye, the <hi>soule in sin</hi> daily, the <hi>body, in sicknesse,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
this day, yet he shall afford a resurrection to both, to the <hi>soule</hi> here, to the <hi>body</hi>
hereafter, for his seale is upon both.</p>
                     <p>These two seales then hath God set upon us all,<note place="margin">In Baptisme.</note> his <hi>Image</hi> in our soules, at our <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
his <hi>Image,</hi> that is his <hi>Sonne,</hi> upon our bodies and soules, in his <hi>incarnation;</hi> And
both these seales he hath set upon us, then when neither we our selves, nor any body
else knew of it: He sets another seale upon us, when, though <hi>we</hi> know not of it, yet the
<hi>world,</hi> the <hi>congregation</hi> does, in the Sacrament of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> when the seale of
his <hi>Crosse,</hi> is a testimony, not that Christ was <hi>borne,</hi> (as the former seale was) but that
also he <hi>dyed</hi> for us; there we receive that seale upon the <hi>forehead,</hi> that we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our selves to him, who is so sealed to us. And after all these seales, he offers us

says Christ to all us, in the person of the spouse; in the <hi>Heart,</hi> by a constant <hi>faith,</hi> in
the <hi>Arme,</hi> by a <hi>declaratory works;</hi> for then are we sealed, and <hi>delivered,</hi> and <hi>witnessed;</hi> that's
our full evidence, then have we <hi>made sure our salvation,</hi> when the works of a holy life,
doe daily refresh the contract made with God there, at our <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and testifie to the
Church, that we doe carefully remember, what the <hi>Church</hi> promised in our behalfe, at
that time: for, otherwise beloved, without this <hi>seale upon the arme,</hi> that is, a stedfast
proceeding in the <hi>works</hi> of a holy life, we may have received many of the other seales,
and yet deface them all.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>Grieve not the holy Ghost, whereby you are sealed, unto the day
of Redemption,</hi> says the Apostle: they were sealed, and yet might <hi>resist</hi> the Spirit, and
<hi>grieve</hi> the Spirit, and <hi>quench</hi> the Spirit, if by a continuall watchfulnesse over their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
actions, they did not refresh those seales (formerly received in their <hi>Creation,</hi> in
Christs <hi>incarnation,</hi> in their <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and in their beginnings of <hi>faith</hi>) to themselves, and
plead them to the Church, and to the world, by such a declaration of a holy life. But
these seales being so many, and so univesall, that argues still, that which we especially
seek to establish, that is, the <hi>Accessiblenesse,</hi> the communicablenesse, the sociablenesse,
the <hi>affection,</hi> (shall I say) the <hi>Ambition,</hi> that God hath, to have us all.</p>
                     <p>Now how is this extensivenesse declared here,<note place="margin">Ante.</note> in our text? It is declared in the great
<hi>number</hi> of those who were <hi>sealed,</hi> both before, and after; to the consideration of both
which, we are invited, by this phrase, which beginnes the text, <hi>After this:</hi> for, before
that <hi>Iohn</hi> saw this, there were <hi>one hundred forty foure thousand sealed;</hi> Is that then,
(that <hi>one hundred forty foure thousand</hi>) intended for a small number? If it had been so,
it would rather have been said, <hi>of such a Tribe but twelve thousand, and but twelve
thousand of such a Tribe;</hi> but God as expressing a joy, that there were so many, repeats
his number of <hi>twelve thousand, twelve times over,</hi> of <hi>Iuda twelve thousand,</hi> of <hi>Levi
twelve thousand,</hi> and <hi>twelve thousand of every Tribe.</hi> So that then, we may justly take
this number of <hi>twelve</hi> and <hi>twelve thousand,</hi> for an indefinite, and uncertain number; and
as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> does, wheresoever he finds that number of <hi>twelve,</hi> (as the
<hi>twelve Thrones,</hi> where the <hi>Saints shall judge the world, and divers such</hi>) we may take
that number of <hi>twelve,</hi> and <hi>twelve, pro universitate salvandorum,</hi> that that number
signifies, all those who shall be saved. If we should take the number to be a certaine
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93359:151"/>
and exact number, so many, and no more, yet this number hath relation to the <hi>Iews</hi>
onely; And of the <hi>Iews,</hi> it is true, that there is so long a time of their exclusion, so
few of them doe come in, since Christ came into the world, as that we may, with Saint
<hi>Augustine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">22. 17.</note> interpret that place of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed is compared both to
the <hi>Starres of heaven,</hi> and to the <hi>dust of the earth,</hi> that the Stars of heaven signifie those
that shall be saved in heaven, and the dust of the earth, those that perish; and the dust
of the earth may be more then the Stars of heaven; though (by the way) there are an
infinite number of <hi>Stars</hi> more then we can distinguish, and so, by Gods grace, there
may be an infinite number of soules saved, more then those, of whose salvation, we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the <hi>ways,</hi> and the <hi>meanes.</hi> Let us embrace the way which God hath given us,
which is, the knowledge of his Sonne, <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> what other way God may take
with others, how he wtought upon <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Naaman,</hi> and such others as were not in the
<hi>Covenant,</hi> let us not inquire too curiously, determine too peremptorily, pronounce too
uncharitably: God be blessed, for his declaring his good-wil towards <hi>us,</hi> &amp; <hi>his will be done</hi>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

God says,<note place="margin">3. 17.</note> in <hi>Ieremy, I will take you, one out of a City, &amp; two out of a family;</hi> yet he says, he wil
do this therefore, <hi>because he is married to them;</hi> so that this seems to be an act of his love;
And therefore, I had rather take it, that God would take a particular care of them, <hi>one

                        <note place="margin">27. 12.</note> then that he would take in but <hi>one and one:</hi> As it is in that place of <hi>Esay, In

also; it is but a slumber, not a death, not a dead sleep. <hi>Have they stumbled that they
should fall?</hi> Fall utterly? God forbid. But says he, <hi>as concerning the Gospell, they are
enemies, for your sakes;</hi> (that is, that room might be made for you the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) but, as
touching election, they are beloved for their <hi>Fathers sakes;</hi> that is, they have interest
by an ancient title, which God will never disannull. And therefore a great part, of the
<hi>ancient,</hi> and <hi>later</hi> men too, doe interpret divers passages of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> of a generall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> shall be effectually wrought upon, to salvation, before the
second comming of Christ. I end this, concerning the <hi>Iews,</hi> with this note, that in all
these Tribes, which yeelded to this sealing, <hi>twelve thousand</hi> a peece, the <hi>Tribe of Dan</hi> is left
out, it is not said, that any were sealed of the Tribe of <hi>Dan;</hi> many have enquired the
reason, and satisfied themselves over easily with this, that because <hi>Antichrist</hi> was to
come of that Tribe, that Tribe is forsaken. It is true, that very many of the Fathers,
<hi>Irenaeus, Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory,</hi> (and more then these) have thought so, that
<hi>Antichrist</hi> must be of that Tribe; but yet for all that profession, which they make in
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tostat.</note> of adhering to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> one amongst them, says, <hi>Incertum,</hi> be the
Fathers as clear, and as unanimous as they will in it, it is a very uncertain, a very disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing; and another says, <hi>fabulosum est,</hi> be the Fathers as earnest, as they will, it is
but a poeticall and a fabulous thing,<note place="margin">Oleast.</note> that Antichrist must come of the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi>
But he that hath most of the <hi>workes</hi> of Antichrist upon him, of any person in the world
now, is thus far of the Tribe of <hi>Dan; Dan</hi> signifies <hi>Iudgement;</hi> And he will needs be
the Judge of all <hi>faith,</hi> and of all <hi>actions</hi> too, and so severe a Judge, as to give an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable
Judgement of <hi>Damnation,</hi> upon all that agree not with them, in all points.
Certainly this Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> that is, of such uncharitable Judges of all other men, that
will afford no salvation to any but <hi>themselves,</hi> are in the greatest danger to be left out,
at this generall seale; nothing hinders our own salvation more, then to deny salvation,
to all but our selves.</p>

Nay, it hath (says that Text) <hi>twelve foundations, Other foundation can no man lay, then
that which is layd, Christ Iesus:</hi> But that <hi>first foundation-stone</hi> being kept, though it be
not hewed, nor layd alike in every place, though Christ be not preached, nor presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the same manner, for outward <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or for <hi>problematicall opinions,</hi> yet
the <hi>foundation</hi> may remaine <hi>one,</hi> though it be, in such a sort, varied; and men may
come in at any of the <hi>twelve gates,</hi> and rest upon any of the <hi>twelve foundations,</hi> for
they are all <hi>gates,</hi> and <hi>foundations</hi> of one and the same <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and they that enter,
are a <hi>multitude that no man can number.</hi>

                     <p>If then there be this sociable,<note place="margin">Via angusta.</note> this applyable nature in God, this large and open en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
for man, why does Christ call it a <hi>straite gate,</hi> and a <hi>narrow way?</hi> Not that it
is strait in it self,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 13.</note> but that we think it so, and, indeed, we make it so. <hi>Christ is the gate,</hi>
and every wound of his admits the whole world. The <hi>Church is the gate;</hi> And <hi>in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 96.</note> says <hi>David,</hi> she hath opened her mouth, and her voice is gone over all the
world. His <hi>word</hi> is the <hi>gate;</hi> And, <hi>thy Commandement is exceeding broad,</hi> says <hi>David</hi>
too; His word and his light reaches to all cases, and all distresses. <hi>Lata porta Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
saith Saint Chrysostome, <hi>The Devill is a broad gate;</hi> but he tells us how he came
to be so, <hi>Mon magnitudine potestatis extensus, sed superbiae licentia dilatatus;</hi> not that
God put such a power into his hands, at first, as that we might not have resisted him,
but that he hath usurp'd upon us, and we have given way to his usurpations: so, says
that Father, <hi>Angusta porta Christus,</hi> Christ is a narrow gate, but he tels us also <hi>wherein,</hi>
and in what respect, <hi>Non parvitate potestatis exiguus, sed humilitatis ratione collectus;</hi>
Christ is not a narrow gate, so as that the <hi>greatest man</hi> may not come in, but called
narrow, because he fits himselfe to the <hi>least child,</hi> to the simplest soule, that will come
in: not so strait, as that all may not enter, but so strait as that there can come in but
<hi>one at once,</hi> for <hi>he that will not forsake Father and Mother, and wife, and children for him,
cannot enter in.</hi> Therefore we call the Devils way broad, because men walke in that,
with all their equipage, all their sumpters, all their state, all their sinnes; and therefore
we call Christs way strait, because a man must strippe himselfe of all inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
of all desires of ill getting, and of all possessions that are ill gotten. In a word,
it is not strait to a mans selfe, but if a man will carry his sinfull company, his sinfull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
with him, and his sinfull possessions, it is strait, for then he hath made himselfe
a <hi>Camel,</hi> and to a Camel Heaven gate is as a <hi>needles eye: But it is better comming into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

God gave such an intimation of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as that we may well enlarge,

a councell of all the <hi>three Persons,</hi> agreeing in this gracious designe upon
Man, <hi>faciamus,</hi> let us make him; <hi>make</hi> and him, <hi>mend</hi> him, and make him
<hi>sure:</hi> I, the Father, will make him by my power; if he should fall, Thou the Sonne

belonged not to him, Thou, the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> shalt apply to his particular soule, and
conscience, this <hi>mercy</hi> of mine, and this <hi>merit</hi> of the Sonnes; and so let <hi>us make him.</hi> In our
Text there is an intimation of another <hi>Trinity.</hi> The words are spoken but by <hi>one,</hi> but
the <hi>persons</hi> in the text,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> are <hi>Three;</hi> For first, The <hi>speaker,</hi> the Director of all, is the <hi>Church,</hi>
the <hi>spouse</hi> of Christ, she says, <hi>Goe forth ye daughters of Sion;</hi> And then the <hi>persons</hi> that
are <hi>called up,</hi> are, as you see, <hi>The Daughters of Sion,</hi> the obedient children of the
Church, that hearken to her voice: And then lastly, the <hi>persons</hi> upon whom they are
directed, is <hi>Solomon</hi> crowned, That is, Christ invested with the royall dignity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Head of the Church;</hi> And in this, especially, is this applyable to the occasion of our
present meeting (All our meetings now, are, to confesse, to the glory of God, and the
rectifying of our own consciences, and manners, the uncertainty of the prosperity, and
the assurednesse of the adversity of this world) That this <hi>Crown of Solomons</hi> in the text,
will appear to be Christs crown of <hi>Thornes,</hi> his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> his <hi>Passion;</hi> and so these
words will dismisse us in this blessed consolation, That then we are nearest to our crown
of Glory, when we are in <hi>tribulation</hi> in this world, and then enter into full possession of
it, when we come to our <hi>dissolution</hi> and <hi>transmigration</hi> out of this world: And these
three persons, The <hi>Church,</hi> that calls, The <hi>children</hi> that hearken, and <hi>Christ in his
Humiliation,</hi> to whom they are sent, will be the three parts, in which we shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
this Exercise.</p>
                     <p>First then,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> the person that directs us, is <hi>The Church; no man hath seen God,</hi> and lives;
but no man lives till he have <hi>heard God;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ecclesia.</note> for God spake to him, in his <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and
called him by his <hi>name,</hi> then. Now, as it were a contempt in the <hi>Kings house,</hi> for any
servant to refuse any thing, except he might heare the King in person command it,
when the King hath already so established the government of his house, as that his
commandements are to be signifyed by his great Officers: so neither are we to look,
that God should speak to us <hi>mouth to mouth, spirit to spirit,</hi> by <hi>Inspiration,</hi> by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
for it is a large mercy, that he hath constituted an Office, and established a
Church, in which we should heare him. When Christ was baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is
sayd by all those three Evangelists, that report that story, in particular circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that <hi>there was a voice heard from heaven saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am
well pleased:</hi> and it is not added in any of those three Evangelists, that that voice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Hear him:</hi> for, after that Declaration, that he, who was visibly and personally
come amongst them, was the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> there was no reason to doubt of mens wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
to hear him, who went forth in person, to preach unto them, in this world;
As long as he was to stay with them, it was not likely that they should need provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to hear him, therefore that was not added at his <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and <hi>entrance</hi> into his
<hi>personall ministery:</hi> But when Christ came to his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> which was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93359:153"/>
of his <hi>glory,</hi> in <hi>the next world,</hi> and an intimation of the approaching of the
time of his going away, to the possession of that glory, out of this world, there that
voyce from heaven sayes,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleased, heare
him:</hi> When he was gone out of this world, men needed a more particular solicitation
to heare him; for <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>in whom</hi> should they heare him, when he was <hi>gone?</hi>
In the <hi>Church,</hi> for the same testimony that <hi>God</hi> gave of <hi>Christ,</hi> to authorize and justifie
his preaching, hath <hi>Christ</hi> given <hi>of the Church,</hi> to justifie her power: The <hi>holy Ghost</hi> fell
upon <hi>Christ,</hi> at his <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> fell upon the <hi>Apostles,</hi> (who were the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
Church</hi>) at <hi>Whitsontide:</hi> The holy Ghost <hi>tarried</hi> upon Christ then, and the
holy Ghost shall tarry with the Church, <hi>us<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> ad consummationem, till the end of the world,</hi>
And therefore, as we have that institution from Christ, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> when men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractary
and perverse, to complaine to the Church, so have they who are complained
of to the Church, that institution from Christ also, <hi>Audi Ecclesiam,</hi> Hearken to the
voyce of God, in the Church; and they have from him that commination, <hi>If you diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
them, you disobey God;</hi> in what fetters soever they <hi>binde</hi> you, you shall rise bound
in those fetters; and, as he who is <hi>excommunicated</hi> in one Diocese, should not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in another; so let no man presume of a better state, in the Triumphant Church,
then he holds in the Militant, or hope for <hi>communion</hi> there, that despises <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
here. That which the <hi>Scripture</hi> says, <hi>God</hi> sayes, (says St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is his word; and that which the <hi>Church</hi> says, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> say, for she is their word,
they speak <hi>in her;</hi> they authorize her, and she explicates them; The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animates</hi>
the Scriptures, and makes them <hi>his</hi> Scriptures, the <hi>Church actuates</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and makes them <hi>our Scriptures: Nihil salubrius,</hi> says the same Father, There is
not so wholsome a thing; no soule can live in so good an aire, and in so good a diet,
<hi>Quàm ut Rationem praecedat authoritas,</hi> Then still to submit a mans owne particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to the authority of the Church expressed in the Scriptures: For, certainly it is very
truly (as it is very usefully) said by <hi>Calvin, Semper nimia morositas, est ambitiosa,</hi> A fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse,
and an aptnesse to quarrell at the proceedings of the Church, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the obligations, and constitutions of the Church, is ever accompanied
with an ambitious pride, that they might enjoy a licentious liberty; It is not because
the Church doth truly take <hi>too much</hi> power, but because they would be under <hi>none;</hi> it
is an ambition, to have all government in their own hands, and to be absolute Emperors
of themselves, that makes them refractary: But, if they will pretend to <hi>believe in God,</hi>
they must believe in God so, as God hath manifested himself to them, they must <hi>believe
in Christ;</hi> so if they will pretend to <hi>heare Christ,</hi> they must heare him there, where he
hath promised to speake, they must <hi>heare him in the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first reason then in this <hi>Trinity,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Part.</note> the person that directs, is <hi>the Church;</hi> the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi>
in which God sounds his <hi>Iudgements,</hi> and the <hi>Organ,</hi> in which he delivers his <hi>mercy;</hi>
And then the persons of the second place, the persons <hi>to whom</hi> the Church speakes here,
are <hi>Filiae Sion, The daughters of Sion, her owne daughters.</hi> We are not called, <hi>Filii Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae,
sonnes of the Church:</hi> The name of <hi>sonnes</hi> may imply more <hi>virility,</hi> more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
more sense of our owne strength, then becomes them, who professe an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Church: Therefore, as by a name, importing more <hi>facility,</hi> more supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
more application, more <hi>tractablenesse,</hi> she calls her children, <hi>Daughters.</hi> But then,
being <hi>a mother,</hi> and having the dignity of a <hi>Parent</hi> upon her, she does not proceed <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatorily,</hi>
she does not pray them, nor intreat them, she does not say, <hi>I would you
would go forth,</hi> and <hi>I would you would looke out,</hi> but it is <hi>Egredimini, &amp; videte, impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
authoritatively, <hi>Do it, you must do it:</hi> So that she showes, what, in important
and <hi>necessary cases,</hi> the power of the Church is, though her <hi>ordinary</hi> proceedings,
by us, and our Ministery, be, <hi>To pray you, in Christs stead, to be reconciled to God.</hi> In
your <hi>baptisme,</hi> your <hi>soules</hi> became daughters of the Church; and they must continue

                     </p>
                     <p>Here are two duties enjoyn'd; at least two steps,<note place="margin">3 Part.</note> two degrees; <hi>Egredimini, Go forth,</hi> and
then, <hi>Videte, Behold,</hi> contemplate; And, after the duty, or wrap'd in the duty, we have <hi>the
Object,</hi> which we are to look upon, &amp; in that, divers things to be considered; as we shall
see in their order.<note place="margin">Egredimini.</note> First, when we are bid to <hi>Go forth,</hi> it is not to go so far, as <hi>out</hi> of that
Church, in which God hath given us our station; for, as <hi>Moses</hi> says, That <hi>the word of
God is not beyond Sea;</hi> so the Church of God, is not so <hi>beyond Sea,</hi> as that we must needs
seek it <hi>there,</hi> either in a <hi>painted Church,</hi> on one side, or in <hi>a naked Church,</hi> on another;
a Church in a <hi>Dropsie,</hi> overflowne with <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or a Church in a <hi>Consumption,</hi> for
want of such Ceremonies, as the primitive Church found usefull, and beneficiall for
the advancing of the glory of God, and the devotion of the Congregation. That which
Christ says to the Church it selfe, the Church says to every soule in the Church: <hi>Goe
thy way forth,<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 8.</note> by the footsteps of the flocke;</hi> Associate thy selfe to the true shepheard, and
true sheep of Christ Jesus, and stray not towards <hi>Idolatrous Chappels,</hi> nor towards <hi>schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
Conventicles, but goe by the footsteps of the flock;</hi> there must be <hi>footsteps,</hi> some
must have gone that way before, take heed of <hi>Opinions,</hi> that begin in thy selfe; and the
whole flock must have gone that way, take heed of opinions vented by a <hi>few new men,</hi>
which have not had the establishment of a Church. And truly the best way to discerne
footsteps, is <hi>Daniels way, Daniels</hi> way was to <hi>straw ashes,</hi> and so their footsteps that
had been there, were easily discerned: Walke in thine own <hi>ashes,</hi> in the meditation of
thine own death, or in the <hi>ashes of Gods Saints,</hi> who are dead before thee, in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of their example, and thou wilt see some <hi>footsteps of the flock,</hi> some impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
some directions, how they went, and how thou art to follow, to the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Jerusalem. In conversing evermore, with them which tread upon <hi>Carpets,</hi> or upon
<hi>Marbles,</hi> thou shalt see no footsteps, Carpets and Marbles receive no impressions; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them that tread in <hi>ashes,</hi> in the ways of holy sorrow, and <hi>religious humiliation,</hi>
thou shalt have the way best marked out unto thee. <hi>Goe forth,</hi> that is, <hi>goe farther then
thy selfe,</hi> out of thy selfe; at least out of the <hi>love of thy self,</hi> for that is but a short, a gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
a vertiginous walk how little a thing is the greatest man? If thou have many rooms
in thy selfe, many capacities to contemplate thy selfe in, if thou walke over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of thy selfe, as thou hast such a title of <hi>Honour,</hi> such an Office of Command,
such an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> such a pedegree, such a <hi>posterity,</hi> such an <hi>Allyance,</hi> if this be not a
short walke, yet it is a round walke, a giddy, a vertiginous proceeding. Get beyond
thine own circle; consider thy selfe at thine end, at thy death, and then <hi>Egredere,</hi>
Goe further then that, <hi>Go forth and see</hi> what thou shalt be after thy death.</p>
                     <p>Still that which we are to look upon,<note place="margin">Videte.</note> is especially <hi>our selves,</hi> but it is <hi>our selves,</hi> enlarg'd
&amp; extended into the <hi>next world;</hi> for till we see, what we shall be then, we are but <hi>short-sighted.</hi>
Wouldst thou say, thou knew'st a man, because thou hadst seen him in <hi>his Cradle?</hi>
no more canst thou be said, to have known thy self, because thou knowest the titles, and
additions, which thou hast received in this world; for all those things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have here, are
but <hi>swadling clouts,</hi> &amp; all our <hi>motions,</hi> &amp; preferments, from place, to place, are but the <hi>rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a cradle.</hi> The first thing that Christ says to his spouse in the Canticles, is, <hi>If thou
know not thy selfe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. 8.</note> (for so all the Ancients read it, and so the Originall beares it)

                        <hi>If thou know not thy selfe, O thou fairest of women;</hi> she might know, that she was the
fairest of women, and yet not know her selfe; Thou mayst know, that thou art the
happyest of men, in this world, and yet not know thy self. All this life is but a <hi>Preface,</hi>
or but an <hi>Index</hi> and <hi>Repertory</hi> to the book of <hi>life;</hi> There, at that book beginnes thy
study; To grow perfect in that book, to be dayly conversant in that book, to find
what be the marks of them, whose names are written in that book, and to finde those
marks, ingenuously, and in a rectified conscience, in thy selfe, To finde that no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
at Gods corrections, no disappointing of thy hopes, no interrupting of thy
expectations, no frustrating of thy possibilities in the way, no <hi>impatience in sicknesse,</hi>
and in the agony of death, can deface those marks, this is to goe <hi>forth,</hi> and see thy self,
beyond thy self, to see what thou shalt be in the next world. Now, we cannot see our
own face, without a glasse: and therefore in the old Temple,<note place="margin">Exod. 38. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>In, or about that laver
of brasse,</hi> where the water, for the uses of the Church was reserved, <hi>Moses</hi> appointed
<hi>looking-glasses</hi> to be placed; that so, at the entring into the Temple, men might see
themselves, and make use of that water, if they had contracted any foulnesse, in any
part about them. Here, at your coming hither now, you have <hi>two glasses,</hi> wherein you
may see your selves from head to foot; One in the Text, your <hi>Head, Christ Iesus,</hi>
represented unto you, in the name and person of <hi>Solomon, Behold King Solomon crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp;c.</hi> And another, under your feet, in the dissolution of this great <hi>Monarch,</hi> our
<hi>Royall Master,</hi> now layd lower by death then any of us, his Subjects and servants.</p>
                     <p>First then, behold your selves in that first glasse, <hi>Behold King Solomon; Solomon</hi> the
sonne of <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Solomon.</note> but not the Son of <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> but of a better mother, the most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> For, <hi>Solomon,</hi> in this text, is not a <hi>proper</hi> Name, but an <hi>Appellative;</hi>
a significative word: <hi>Solomon</hi> is <hi>pacificus,</hi> the <hi>Peacemaker,</hi> and our peace is made in,
and by Christ Jesus: and he is that <hi>Solomon,</hi> whom we are called upon to see here.
Now, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> says, that <hi>he would know nothing but Christ,</hi> (that's his first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement)
and then he would know nothing of Christ, but <hi>him crucifyed,</hi> (and that's
the re-abridgement) so we seek no other glasse, to see our selves in, but Christ, nor
any other thing in this glasse, but his <hi>Humiliation.</hi> What need we? Even that, his
lowest humiliation, his death, is expressed here, in three words of exaltation, It is a
<hi>Crown,</hi> it is a <hi>Mariage,</hi> it is the <hi>gladnesse of heart: Behold King Salomon crowned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Crown, which we are called to see him crowned with, <hi>his mother</hi> put upon him;
The Crown which his <hi>Father gave him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Corona.</note> was that glory, wherewith he was glorifyed,
with the Father, <hi>from all eternity,</hi> in his <hi>divine nature:</hi> And the Crown wherewith
his Father crowned his <hi>Humane nature,</hi> was the glory given to that, in his <hi>Ascension.
His Mother</hi> could give him no such Crown: she her selfe had no Crown, but that, which
<hi>he</hi> gave her. The Crown that <hi>she</hi> gave him, was that substance, that he received from
her, <hi>our flesh,</hi> our <hi>nature,</hi> our <hi>humanity;</hi> and this, <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and this, Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
calls the <hi>Crown,</hi> wherewith <hi>his Mother crowned him,</hi> in this text, his infirm, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature. Or, <hi>the Corwn wherewith his Mother corwned him,</hi> was that Crown, to
which, that infirme nature which he tooke from her, submitted him, which was his <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
his <hi>Crown of thornes;</hi> for so <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and divers others take this Crown of his,
from her, to be his <hi>Crown of thorns: Woe to the Crown of pride, whose beauty is a fading
flower,</hi> says the Prophet;<note place="margin">Esa. 28. 1.</note> But blessed be this Crown of Humiliation, whose flower
cannot fade. Then was there truly a <hi>Rose</hi> amongst <hi>Thorns,</hi> when through his Crown
of <hi>Thorns,</hi> you might see his title, <hi>Iesus Nazarenus:</hi> for, in that very name <hi>Nazare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
is involved the signification of a <hi>flower;</hi> the very word signifies a <hi>flower. Esay's</hi>
flower in the Crown of pride fades, and is removed; This flower in the Crown of
Thornes fades not, nor could be removed; for, for all the importunity of the Jews,
<hi>Pilate</hi> would not suffer <hi>that title</hi> to be removed, or to be changed; still <hi>Nazarenus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
and still a rose amongst thorns. You know the curse of the earth, <hi>Thorns and
thistles shall it bring forth unto thee;</hi> It did so to our <hi>Solomon</hi> here, it brought forth
thornes to Christ,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 18.</note> and he made a <hi>Crown</hi> of those thorns, not onely for <hi>himself,</hi> but for

his <hi>marriage, Behold him crowned in the day of his Espousals.</hi> His Spouse is the <hi>Church,</hi>
His marriage is the <hi>uniting</hi> of himselfe to this Spouse, in his becomming <hi>Head of the

Death flowed out from his side, those two <hi>Elements of the Church, water</hi> and <hi>bloud;</hi>

and merit thou shalt have that Crown.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Behold</hi> him once again,<note place="margin">Letitia.</note> and you shall see not a <hi>beam,</hi> but a <hi>stream</hi> of comfort;
for this day, which is the day of his death, he calls here <hi>The day of the gladnesse of
his heart. Behold him crowned in the day of the gladnesse of his heart.</hi> The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the compasse, the two <hi>Hemispheres</hi> of Heaven, are often designed to us,
in these two names, <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Glory:</hi> If the <hi>Crosse</hi> of Christ, the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ,
present us both these,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note> how neare doth it bring, how fully doth it deliver Heaven it self
to us in this life? And then we heare the Apostle say, <hi>We see Iesus, for the suffering of

then,<note place="margin">12, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>for the joy that was set before him, he indured the Crosse;</hi> There is the <hi>other half,

                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 16.</note> All Heaven purchased by Death. And therefore, <hi>if any man suffer as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
let him not be ashamed,</hi> saith the Apostle; but <hi>let him glorifie God, In isto Nomine,</hi>
as the <hi>vulgate</hi> read it; <hi>In that behalfe,</hi> as <hi>we</hi> translate it. But, <hi>In isto Nomine,</hi> saith S.

And therefore, though we admit <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>humane sorrow,</hi> in the calamities
which overtake us, and surround us in this life: (for as <hi>all glasses</hi> will gather drops and

our Saviour, which tooke flesh <hi>(Verbum Caro factum est)</hi> or it is
the spirit of his mouth, by which we live, <hi>and not by bread onely.</hi>
And so, in a large acceptation, every truth is the word of God;
for truth is uniforme, and irrepugnant, and indivisible, as God
<hi>Omne verum est omni vero consentiens.</hi> More strictly the word of
God, is that which God hath uttered, either in writing, as twice
in the Tables to <hi>Moses;</hi> or by ministery of Angels, or Prophets, in words; or by the
unborne, in action, as in <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> exultation within his mother; or by new-borne,
from the mouths of babes and sucklings; or by things unreasonable, as in <hi>Balaams</hi>
Asse; or insensible, as in the whole booke of such creatures, <hi>The heavens declare the
glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. But nothing is more properly the word of God to us, then that which
God himself speakes in those Organs and Instruments, which himself hath assumed
for his chiefest worke, our redemption. For in creation God spoke, but in redemption
he did; and more, he suffered. And of that kinde are these words. God in his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
man-hood saith, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These words shall be fitliest considered, like a goodly palace, if we rest a little, as
in an outward Court, upon consideration of prayer in generall; and then draw neare
the view of the Palace, in a second Court, considering this speciall prayer in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
as the face of the whole palace. Thirdly, we will passe thorow the chiefest rooms
of the palace it self; and then insist upon foure steps: 1. Of whom he begs, <hi>(Father)</hi>
2. What he asks, <hi>(forgive them.)</hi> 3. That he prays upon reason, <hi>(for.)</hi> 4. What the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, <hi>(they know not.)</hi> And lastly, as into the backside of all, we will cast the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
as why onely <hi>Luke</hi> remembers this prayer: and why this prayer, (as it seemes by
the punishment continuing upon the Jews to this day) was not obtained at Gods hands.</p>
                     <p>So therefore prayer is our first entry,<note place="margin">Of Prayer.</note> for when it is said, <hi>Ask and it shall be given,</hi> it
is also said, <hi>Knock and it shall be opened,</hi> showing that by prayer our entrance is. And
not the entry onely, but the whole house: <hi>My house is the house of prayer.</hi> Of all the
conduits and conveyances of Gods graces to us, none hath been so little subject to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villations, as this of prayer. The Sacraments have fallen into the hands of flatterers
and robbers. Some have attributed too much to them, some detracted. Some have
painted them, some have withdrawn their naturall complexion. It hath been disputed,
whether they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the word hath been made a servant of ambitions, and a shop of many mens new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled
wares. Almost every meanes between God and man, suffers some adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and disguises: But prayer least: And it hath most wayes and addresses. It may
be mentall, for we may thinke prayers. It may be vocall, for we may speake prayers.
It may be actuall, for we do prayers. For deeds have voyce; the vices of <hi>Sodome</hi> did
cry, and the Almes of <hi>Toby.</hi> And if it were proper for St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the first of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi>
to turne back to see a voyce, it is more likely God will looke down, to heare
a worke. So then to do the office of your vocation sincerely, is to pray. How much

to be able to say to servants, Doe this: But to say to God, <hi>Domine fac hoc,</hi> and prevail,
is more; And yet more easie. God is replenishingly every where: but most contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly,
and workingly in the Temple. Since then every rectified man, is the temple of
the Holy Ghost, when he prays; it is the Holy Ghost it selfe that prays; and what can
be denyed, where the Asker gives? He plays with us, as children, shewes us pleasing
things, that we might cry for them, and have them. Before we call, he answers, and
when we speak, he heares: so <hi>Esay</hi> 65. 24. Physicians observe some symptomes so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,

be sorry that thou canst not be sorry. So whosoever thou be, that canst not readily
pray, at least pray, that thou mayst pray. For, as in bodily, so in spirituall diseases, it is

                     <p>It were unmannerlinesse to hold you longer in the Entry. One turne in the inner
Court,<note place="margin">Of this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> of this speciall prayer in generall, and so enter the Palace. This is not a
prayer for his own ease, as that in his Agony seemes. It hath none of those infirmities,
which curious schismatikes finde in that. No suspicion of ignorance, as there, (If it be
possible.) No tergiversation nor abandoning the noble worke which he had begunne,
as there, <hi>(Let this cup passe.)</hi> It is not an exemplar, or forme, for us to imitate precisely,
(otherwise then in the Doctrine) as that Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. which we call the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
not because he sayd it, for he could never say, <hi>forgive us our trespasses,</hi> but because
he commanded us to say it. For though by <hi>Matthew,</hi> which saith, <hi>After this manner pray,</hi>
we seem not bound to the words, yet <hi>Luke</hi> sayth, <hi>When you pray,</hi> say, <hi>Our Father which
art, &amp;c.</hi> But this is a prayer of God, to God. Not as the Talmudists Jews faine God
to pray to himselfe, <hi>Sit voluntas mea, ut misericordia mea superet iram meam;</hi> But as
when forain merchandise is mis-ported, the Prince may permit, or inhibit his Subjects to
buy it, or not to buy it. Our blessed Saviour arriving in this world fraited with salvation,
a thing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> this world never had power to have without him, except in that short time,
between mans Creation and fall, he by this prayer begs, that even to these despisers of it,
it may be communicable, and that their ignorance of the value of it, may not deprive
them of it. Teaching that by example here, which he gave in precept before, <hi>Mat. 5. 44.
Pray for them which persecute you,</hi> that you may be the children of your Father which is
in heaven. Therefore,<note place="margin">Father.</note> doing so now, he might well say, <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi> which
is the first room in this glorious Palace. And in this contemplation, my unworthy
soule, thou art presently in the presence. No passing of guards, nor ushers. No exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of thy degree or habit. The Prince is not asleep, nor private, nor weary of giving,
nor refers to others. He puts thee not to prevaile by Angels nor Archangels. But lest
any thing might hinder thee, from coming into his presence, his presence comes into
thee. And lest Majesty should dazell thee, thou art to speake but to thy Father. Of
which word, <hi>Abba,</hi> the root is, <hi>To will;</hi> from which root, the fruit also must be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse,
and propensenesse to grant. God is the Father of Christ, by that mysticall
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93359:157"/>
and eternall unexpressible generation, which never began nor ended. Of which incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
mystery, <hi>Moses</hi> and the ancient Prophets spake so little, and so indirectly,
that till the dawning of the day of Christ, after <hi>Esdras</hi> time, those places seem not to
be intended of the Trinity. Nay, a good while after Christ, they were but tenderly
applyed to that sense. And at this day, the most of the writers in the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
considering that we need not such farre fetcht, and such forced helps, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
weighing how well the Jews of these times are provided with other expositions of
those places, are very sparing in using them, but content themselves modestly herein,
with the testimonies of the New Testament. Truly, this mystery is rather the object
of faith then reason; and it is enough that we believe Christ to have ever been the Son
of God, by such generation, and our selves his sonnes by adoption. So that God is
Father to all; but yet so, that though Christ say, <hi>Iohn 10. My Father is greater then all,</hi>
he addes, <hi>I and my Father are all one,</hi> to shew his eternall interest: and <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. Hee
seemes to put a difference, <hi>I goe to my Father,</hi> and your Father, my God, and your God.
The Roman stories have, that when <hi>Claudius</hi> saw it conduce to his ends, to get the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buneship,
of which he was incapable, because a Patrician, he suffered himself to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted.
But against this Adoption, two exceptions were found; one, that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
by a man of lower ranke, a Plebeian; which was unnaturall; and by a younger
man then himselfe, which took away the presentation of a Father. But our Adoption
is regular. For first, we are made the sonnes of the Most High, and of the ancient of
daies, there was no one word, by which he could so nobly have maintained his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
kept his station, justified his cause, and withall expressed his humility and charity,
as this, Father. They crucifyed him, for saying himself to be the Sonne of God. And
in the midst of torment, he both professes the same still, and lets them see, that they
have no other way of forgivenesse, but that he is the Sonne of that Father. For no man
cometh to the Father but by the Son.</p>
                     <p>And at this voice (Father) O most blessed Saviour,<note place="margin">Forgive them.</note> thy Father, which is so fully
thine, that for thy sake, he is ours too, which is so wholly thine, that he is thy selfe,
which is all mercy, yet will not spare thee, all justice, yet will not destroy us. And that
glorious Army of Angels, which hitherto by their own integrity maintained their first
and pure condition, and by this worke of thine, now neare the <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> attend
a confirmation, and infallibility of ever remaining so; And that faithfull company of
departed Saints, to whom thy merit must open a more inward and familiar room in
thy Fathers Kingdome, stand all attentive, to heare what thou wilt aske of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And what shall they hear? what doest thou aske? <hi>Forgive them,</hi> forgive them?
Must murderers be forgiven? Must the offended aske it? And must a Father grant it?
And must he be solicited, and remembred by the name of Father to doe it? Was not
thy passion enough, but thou must have compassion? And is thy mercy so violent, that
thou wilt have a fellow-feeling of their imminent afflictions, before they have any feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
The Angels might expect a present employment for their destruction: the Saints
might be out of feare, that they should be assumed or mingled in their fellowship. But
thou wilt have them pardoned. And yet doest not out of thine own fulnesse pardon
them, as thou didst the theef upon the Crosse, because he did already confesse thee;
but thou tellest them, that they may be forgiven, but at thy request, and if they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their Advocate to be the Son of God. Father, forgive them. I that cannot
revenge thy quarrell, cannot forgive them. I that could not be saved, but by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
cannot forgive them. And must a Father, Almighty, and well pleased in thee,
forgive them? Thou art more charitable towards them, then by thy direction wee
may be to our selvs. We must pray for our selvs limitedly, forgive us, as we forgive. But
thou wilt have their forgivenes illimited and unconditioned. Thou seemest not so much
as to presume a repentance; which is so essentiall, and necessary in all transgressions, as
where by mans fault the actions of God are diverted from his appointed ends, God
himself is content to repent the doing of them. As he repented first the making of
man, and then the making of a King. But God will have them within the armes of
his generall pardon. And we are all delivered from our Debts; for God hath given his
word, his co-essential word, for us all. And though, (as in other prodigall debts, the
Interest exceed the Principall) our Actuall sinnes exceed Originall, yet God by giving
his word for us, hath acquitted all.</p>

                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:93359:157"/>
But the Affections of our Saviour are not inordinate, nor irregular. He hath a <hi>For,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">For.</note> for his Prayer: <hi>Forgive them, for, &amp;c.</hi> And where he hath not this <hi>For,</hi> as in his Praier
in his agony, he quickly interrupts the violence of his request, with a But, <hi>Father, let
this cup passe;</hi> but <hi>not my will:</hi> In that form of Prayer which himself taught us, he hath
appointed a <hi>for,</hi> on Gods part, which is ever the same unchangeable: <hi>For thine is the
Kingdome;</hi> Therefore supplications belong to thee: <hi>The power,</hi> Thou openest thy hand
and fillest every living thing: <hi>The Glory,</hi> for thy Name is glorified in thy grants. But
because on our part, the occasions are variable, he hath left our <hi>for,</hi> to our religious
discretion. For, when it is said, James 4. <hi>You lust and have not, because you aske not;</hi> it
followeth presently, <hi>You aske and misse, because you aske amisse.</hi> It is not a fit <hi>for,</hi> for
every private man, to aske much means, for he would doe much good. I must not
pray, Lord put into my hands the strength of Christian Kings, for out of my zeale, I
will imploy thy benefits to thine advantage, thy Souldiers against thine enemies, and
be a bank against that Deluge, wherewith thine enemy the Turk threatens to overflow
thy people. I must not pray, Lord fill my heart with knowledge and understanding,
for I would compose the Schismes in thy Church, and reduce thy garment to the first
continuall and seemlesse integrity; and redresse the deafnesses and oppressions of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and Officers. But he gave us a convenient scantling for our <hi>fors,</hi> who prayed,
Give me enough, for I may else despair, give me not too much, for so I may presume.
Of Schoolmen, some affirm Prayer to be an act of our will; for we would have that
which we aske. Others, of our understanding; for by it we ascend to God, and better
our knowledge, which is the proper aliment and food of our understanding; so, that
is a perplexed case. But all agree, that it is an act of our Reason, and therefore must be
reasonable. For onely reasonable things can pray; for the beasts and Ravens, Psalme
147. 9. are not said to pray for food, but <hi>to cry.</hi> Two things are required to make a
Prayer. <hi>1. Pius affectus,</hi> which was not in the Devills request, Matth. 8. 31. <hi>Let us
goe into the Swine;</hi> nor Job <hi>1. 2. Stretch out thy hand, and touch all he hath;</hi> and, <hi>stretch
out thy hand, and touch his bones;</hi> and therefore these were not Prayers. And it must
be <hi>Rerum decentium:</hi> for our government in that point, this may inform us. Things
absolutely good, as Remission of sinnes, we may absolutely beg: and, to escape things
absolutely ill, as sinne. But mean and indifferent things, qualified by the circumstances,
we must aske conditionally and referringly to the givers will. For 2 Cor. 8. when
<hi>Paul</hi> begged <hi>stimulum Carnis</hi> to be taken from him, it was not granted, but he had this
answer, <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Hast thou, O God, filled all thy Scriptures, both of thy <hi>Recorders</hi> and <hi>Notaries,</hi>
which have penned the <hi>History of thy love, to thy People;</hi> and of thy <hi>Secretaries</hi> the
Prophets, admitted to the foreknowledge of thy purposes, and instructed in thy Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;
hast thou filled these with prayses and perswasions of wisedome and knowledge,
and must these persecutors be pardoned for their ignorance? Hast thou bid <hi>Esay</hi> to
say, 27. 11. <hi>It is a people of no understanding, therefore he that made them, shall not have
compassion of them.</hi> And <hi>Hosea 4. 6. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge:</hi> and
now dost thou say, Forgive them because they know not? Shall ignorance, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the cause of sinne, often a sinne it self, often the punishment of sinne, and ever an
infirmity and disease contracted by the first great sinne, advantage them? Who can
understand his faults, saith the man according to thy heart, <hi>Psalme 19. 12. Lord cleanse
me from my secret faults:</hi> He durst not make his ignorance the reason of his prayer, but
prayed against ignorance. But thy Mercy is as the Sea: both before it was the Sea, for
it overspreads the whole world; and since it was called into limits: for it is not the lesse
infinite for that. And as by the Sea, the most remote and distant Nations enjoy one
another, by traffique and commerce, East and West becoming neighbours: so by
mercy, the most different things are united and reconciled; Sinners have Heaven;
Traytors are in the Princes bosome; and ignorant persons are in the spring of wisdome,
being forgiven, not onely though they be ignorant, but because they are ignorant. But
all ignorance is not excusable; nor any lesse excusable, then not to know, what igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is not to be excused. Therefore, there is an ignorance which they call <hi>Nescien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi>
a not knowing of things not appertaining to us. This we had had, though <hi>Adam</hi>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:93359:158"/>
had stood; and the Angels have it, for they know not the latter day, and therefore
for this, we are not chargeable. They call the other privation, which if it proceed
meerly from our owne sluggishnesse, in not searching the meanes made for our instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is ever inexcusable. If from God, who for his owne just ends hath cast clouds over
those lights which should guide us, it is often excusable. For <hi>1 Tim. 1. 13. Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>I was ablasphemer, and a persecutor, and an oppressor, but I was received to mercy, for I did
it ignorantly, through unbelief.</hi> So, though we are all bound to believe, and therefore
faults done by unbeliefe cannot escape the name and nature of sinne, yet since beliefe
is the immediate gift of God, faults done by unbeliefe, without malicious concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and circumstances, obtaine mercy and pardon from that abundant fountaine of
grace, Christ Jesus. And therefore it was a just reason, <hi>Forgive them, for they know not.</hi>
If they knew not, which is evident, both by this speech from truth it self, and by <hi>2 Cor.
2. 8. Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;</hi> and <hi>Acts 3. 17.
I know that through ignorance ye did it.</hi> And though after so many powerfull miracles,
this ignorance were vincible, God having revealed enough to convert them, yet there
seemes to be enough on their parts, to make it a perplexed case, and to excuse, though
not a malitious persecuting, yet a not consenting to his Doctrine. For they had a Law,
<hi>Whosoever shall make himself the sonne of God, let him dye:</hi> And they spoke out of their
Lawes, when they said, <hi>We have no other King but Caesar.</hi> There were therefore some
among them reasonably, and zealously ignorant. And for those, the Sonne ever-wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and well-heard, begged of his Father, ever accessible, and exorable, a pardon ever
ready and naturall.</p>
                     <p>We have now passed through all those roomes which we unlockt and opened at first.
And now may that point, Why this prayer is remembred onely by one Evangelist,
and why by <hi>Luke,</hi> be modestly inquired: For we are all admitted and welcommed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the acquaintance of the Scriptures, upon such conditions as travellers are into other
Countries: if we come as praisers and admirres of their Commodities and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not as spies into the mysteries of their State, nor searchers, nor calumniators
of their weaknesses. For though the Scriptures, like a strong rectified State, be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
by such a curious malice of any, yet he which brings that, deserves no admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
When those great Commissioners which are called the Septuagint, sent from
<hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to translate the Hebrew Scriptures into Greeke, had perfected their work,
it was, and is an argument of Divine assistance, that writing severally, they differed not.
The same may prove even to weake and faithlesse men, that the holy Ghost super-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the foure Evangelists, because they differ not; as they which have written their
harmonies, make it evident: But to us, faith teacheth the other way. And we conclude
not, because they agree, the holy Ghost directed; for heathen Writers and Malefactors
in examinations do so; but because the holy Ghost directed, we know they agree, and
differ not. For as an honest man, ever of the same thoughts, differs not from himself,
though he do not ever say the same things, if he say not contraries; so the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
observe the uniformity and samenesse of their guide, though all did not say
all the same things, since none contradicts any. And as, when my soule, which enables
all my limbs to their functions, disposes my legs to go, my whole body is truly said to
go, because none stayes behinde; so when the holy Spirit, which had made himself as
a common soule to their foure soules, directed one of them to say any thing, all are well
understood to have said it. And therefore when to that place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 8. where
that Evangelist cites the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> for words spoken by <hi>Zachary,</hi> many medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
are applyed by the Fathers; as, That many copies have no name, That <hi>Ieremy</hi>
might be binominous, and have both names, a thing frequent in the Bible, That it
might be the error of a transcriber, That there was extant an <hi>Apocryph</hi> booke of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
in which these words were, and sometimes things of such books were vouched, as
<hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> by <hi>Paul;</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> insists upon, and teaches rather this, That
it is more wonderfull, that all the Prophets spake by one Spirit, and so agreed, then if
any one of them had spoken all those things; And therefore he adds, <hi>Singula sunt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
&amp; omnia sunt singulorum,</hi> All say what any of them say; And in this sense most
congruously is that of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> applyable, that the foure Evangelists are <hi>Quadriga
Divina,</hi> That as the foure Chariot wheeles, though they looke to the foure corners of
the world, yet they move to one end and one way, so the Evangelists have both one
scope, and one way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:93359:158"/>
Yet not so precisely, but that they differ in words: For as their generall intention,
common to them all begat that consent, so a private reason peculiar to each of them,
for the writing of their Histories at that time, made those diversities which seem to be
for <hi>Matthew,</hi> after he had preached to the Jewes, and was to be transplanted into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vineyard, the Gentiles, left them written in their owne tongue, for permanency,
which he had preached transitorily by word. <hi>Mark,</hi> when the Gospell fructified in the
West, and the Church enlarged her self, and grew a great body, and therefore required
more food out of <hi>Peters</hi> Dictates, and by his approbation published his Evangile. Not
an Epitome of <hi>Matthewes,</hi> as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> (I know why) imagines, but a just and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
History of our blessed Saviour. And as <hi>Matthewes</hi> reason was to supply a want in
the Eastern Church, <hi>Markes</hi> in the Western; so on the other side <hi>Lukes</hi> was to cut off
an excesse and superfluitie: for then many had undertaken this Story, and dangerously
inserted and mingled uncertainties and obnoxious improbabilities: and he was more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and more particular then the rest, both because he was more learned, and because
he was so individuall a companion of the most learned Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and did so much
write <hi>Pauls</hi> words, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> thereupon mistaketh the words <hi>2 Tim. 2. 1. Christ
is raised according to my Gospell,</hi> to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> was author of this Gospell attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Luke. Iohn</hi> the Minion of <hi>Christ</hi> upon earth, and survivor of the Apostles,
(whose books rather seem fallen from Heaven, and writ with the hand which ingraved
the stone Tables, then a mans work) because the heresies of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> were
rooted, who upon this true ground, then evident aud fresh, that Christ had spoke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things which none of the other three Evangelists had Recorded, uttered many things
as his, which he never spoke: <hi>Iohn</hi> I say, more diligently then the rest handleth his
Divinity, and his Sermons, things specially brought into question by them. So there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all writ one thing, yet all have some things particular. And <hi>Luke</hi> most, for he
writ last of three, and largeliest for himselfe, <hi>1 Act. 1.</hi> saith, <hi>I have made the former
Treatise of all that Iesus began to doe and teach, untill the Day that he was taken up;</hi> which
speech, lest the words in the last of <hi>Iohn, If all were written which Iesus did, the world
could not contain the Bookes,</hi> should condemne, <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> interpret well
out of the words themselves, <hi>Scripsit de omnibus, non omnia,</hi> He writ of all, but not
all: for it must have the same limitation, which <hi>Paul</hi> giveth his words, who saith, <hi>Acts
20.</hi> in one verse, <hi>I have kept nothing back, but have shewed you all the counsell of God;</hi>
and in another, <hi>I kept back nothing that was profitable.</hi> It is another peculiar singularity
of <hi>Lukes,</hi> that he addresseth his History to one man, <hi>Theophilus.</hi> For it is but weakely
surmised, that he chose that name, for all <hi>lovers of God,</hi> because the interpretation of
the word suffereth it, since he addeth <hi>most noble Theophilus.</hi> But the work doth not
the lesse belong to the whole Church, for that, no more then his Masters Epistles doe
though they be directed to particulars.</p>
                     <p>It is also a singularitie in him to write upon that reason, because divers have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
In humane knowledge, to abridge or suck, and then suppresse other Authors, is not
ever honest nor profitable: We see after that vast enterprise of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> who distilled
all the Law into one vessell, and made one Booke of 2000. suppressing all the rest, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate</hi>
wisheth he had let them alone, and thinketh the Doctors of our times, would bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
have drawn usefull things from those volumes, then his <hi>Trebonian</hi> and <hi>Dorothee</hi> did.
And <hi>Aristotle</hi> after, by the immense liberality of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he had ingrossed all
Authors, is said to have defaced all, that he might be in stead of all: And therefore,
since they cannot rise against him, he imputes to them errours which they held not:
vouches onely such objections from them, as he is able to answer; and propounds all
good things in his own name, which he ought to them. But in this History of <hi>Lukes,</hi>
it is otherwise: He had no authority to suppresse them, nor doth he reprehend or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
them, but writes the truth simply, and leaves it to outweare falshood: and
so it hath: <hi>Moses</hi> rod hath devoured the Conjurers rods, and <hi>Lukes</hi> Story still retains
the majestie of the maker, and theirs are not.</p>
                     <p>Other singularities in <hi>Luke,</hi> of form or matter, I omit, and end with one like this in
our Text. As in the apprehending of our blessed Saviour, all the Evangelists record,
that <hi>Peter</hi> cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare, but onely <hi>Luke</hi> remembers the healing of it again: (I
think) because that act of curing, was most present and obvious to his consideration,
who was a Physician: so he was therefore most apt, to remember this Prayer of Christ,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:93359:159"/>
which is the Physick and <hi>Balsamum</hi> of our Soule, and must be applied to us all, (for
we doe all Crucifie him, and we know not what we do) And therefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
gave a right Character of him, in his Epistle to <hi>Paulinus, Fuit Medicus, &amp; pariter om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
verba illius, Animae languentis sunt Medicinae,</hi> As he was a Physitian, so all his
words are Physick for a languishing soule.</p>
                     <p>Now let us dispatch the last consideration, of the effect of this Prayer. Did Christ
intend the forgivenesse of the Jewes, whose utter ruine God (that is, himselfe) had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decreed?
And which he foresaw, and bewaild even then hanging upon the Crosse?
For those Divines which reverently forbeare to interpret the words <hi>Lord, Lord, why
hast thou forsaken me?</hi> of a suffering hell in his soule, or of a departing of the Father from
him; (for <hi>Ioh. 16.</hi> it is, <hi>I am not alone, for the Father is with me</hi>) offer no exposition
of those words more convenient, then that the foresight of the Jewes imminent calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
expressed and drew those words from him: <hi>In their Afflictions, were all kindes, and
all degrees of Miserie.</hi> So that as one writer of the Roman Story saith elegantly, <hi>He
that considereth the Acts of Rome, considereth not the Acts of one People, but of Mankinde:</hi>
I may truly of the Jewes Afflictions, he that knoweth them, is ignorant of nothing that
this world can threaten. For to that which the present authority of the Romanes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon them, our Schools have added upon their posterities; that they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>laves
to Christians, and their goods subject to spoile, if the Lawes of the Princes where
they live, did not out of indulgency defend them. Did he then aske, and was not
heard? God forbid. A man is heard, when that is given which his will desired; and our
will is ever understood to be a will rectified, and concurrent with God. This is <hi>Voluntas,</hi>
a discoursed and examined will. That which is upon the first sight of the object, is <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leit
as,</hi> a willingnesse, which we resist not, onely because we thought not of it. And such
a willingnesse had Christ, when suddenly he wished that the cup might passe: but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conformed his will to his Fathers. But in this Prayer his will was present, therefore
fulfilled. Briefly then, in this Prayer he commended not all the Jewes, for he knew the
chief to sin knowingly, and so out of the reach of his reason, <hi>(for they know not.)</hi> Nor
any, except they repented after: for it is not ignorance, but repentance, which deriveth
to us the benefit of Gods pardon. For he that sinnes of Ignorance, may be pardoned if
he repent; but he that sinnes against his Conscience, and is thereby impenitible, cannot
be pardoned. And this is all, which I will say of these words, <hi>Father forgive them, for
they know not what they do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O eternall God, look down from thy Throne to thy footstoole: from thy blessed Company
of Angels and Saints, to us, by our own faults made more wretched and contemptible, then
the wormes, which shall eat us, or the dust which we were, and shall be. O Lord, under the
weight of thy Iustice we cannot stand. Nor had any other title to thy mercie, but the Name
of Father, and that we have forfeited. That name of Sonnes of God, thou gavest to us, all
at once in <hi>Adam;</hi> and he gave it away from us all by his sinne. And thou hast given it
again to every one of us, in our regeneration by Baptisme, and we have lost it again by our
transgressions. And yet thou was not weary of being mercifull, but diddest choose one of us,
to be a fit and worthy ransome for us all; and by the death of thy Christ, our Iesus, gavest
us again the title and priviledge of thy Sonnes; but with conditions, which though easie, we
have broke, and with a yoke, which though light, and sweet, we have cast off. How shall we
then dare to call thee Father? Or to beg that thou wilt make one triall more of us? These
hearts are accustomed to rebellions, and hopelesse. But, O God, create in us new hearts, hearts
capable of the love and feare, due to a Father. And then we shall dare to say, <hi>Father,</hi> and
to say, <hi>Father forgive us.</hi> Forgive us O Father, and all which are engaged, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to thee for us: forgive our Parents, and those which undertooke for us in Baptisme.
Forgive the civill Magistrate, and the Minister. Forgive them their negligences, and us
our stubbornnesses. And give us the grace that we may ever sincerely say, both this Prayer of
Example and Counsell, <hi>Forgive our enemies,</hi> and that other of Precept, <hi>Our Father which
art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

us to heaven, but then we fell, and (if we consider our selves
onely) irrecoverably. He put us after into another way, over
thorny hedges and ploughed Lands, through the difficulties
and incumbrances of all the Ceremoniall Law; there was no
way to heaven then, but that; after that, he brought us a crosse way, by the
Crosse of Jesus Christ, and the application of his Gospell, and that is our way
now. If we compare the way of nature, and our way, we went out of the way at

of this building particularly and principally in this place, where having intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us the severall benefits we have received from Christ Jesus in that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,

of comfort presented to us, in that Christ is presented to us as a stone, for there
we shall finde him, first, to be the <hi>foundation stone,</hi> nothing can stand which is not
built upon Christ; Secondly, to be <hi>Lapis Angularis, a corner stone,</hi> that unites
things most dis-united; and then to be <hi>Lapis Iacob,</hi> the stone that <hi>Iacob</hi> slept

                     <p>First in the metaphor,<note place="margin">Lapis.</note> that Christ is called a stone, the firmnesse is expressed:
Forasmuch as he loved his owne which were in the world, <hi>In finem dilexit eos,</hi>
sayes St. <hi>Iohn, He loved them to the end;</hi> and not to any particular end,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note> for any use of
this owne,<note place="margin">Cyrill.</note> but to their end; <hi>Qui erant in mundo,</hi> sayes <hi>Cyrill, ad distinctionem An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum,</hi>
he loved them in the world, and not Angels; he loved not onely them
who were in a confirmed estate of mutuall loving him too, but even them who
were themselves conceived in sinne, and then conceived all their purposes in sinne
too, them who could have no cleansing but in his blood, and when they were clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in his blood,<note place="margin">Iob 27.</note> their <hi>owne clothes would defile them</hi> againe, them who by nature
are not able to love him at all, and when by grace they are brought to love him, can
expresse their love no other way, but to be glad that he was betrayed, and scourged,
and scorned, and nayled, and crucified; and to be glad, that if all this were not
already done, it might be done yet, to long, and wish, that if Christ were not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
he might be crucified now, (which is a strange manner of expressing love) those
men he loved, and <hi>loved unto the end;</hi> Men and not Angels; and then men, <hi>Ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctionem
mortuorum,</hi> sayes <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> not onely the Patriarchs, who were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the world, who had loved him so well, as to take his word for their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and had lived and dyed in the faithfull contemplation of a future promise,
which they never saw performed; but those who were partakers of the performance
of all those promises, those into the midst of whom he came in person, those up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom he wrought with his piercing Doctrine, and his powerfull miracles, those
who for all this loved not him, he loved: <hi>Et in finem, he loved them to the end:</hi> It
is much that he should love them <hi>in fine,</hi> at their end, that he should looke graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
on them at last, that when their sunne sets, their eyes faint, his sunne of grace
should arise, and his East be brought to their West, that then in the shadow of death,
the Lord of life should quicken and inanimate their hearts: that when their last bell
tolls, and calls them to their first Judgement, (and first and last Judgement to this
purpose is all one) the passing bell, and Angels trump sound all but one note, <hi>Surgite
qui dormitis in pulvere, Arise ye that sleepe in the dust,</hi> which is the voyce of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and <hi>Surgite qui vigilatis in plumis,</hi> Arise ye that cannot sleepe in feathers, for
the pangs of death, which is the voyce of the bell, is but one voyce; for God at the
generall Judgement, shall never reverse any particular Judgement, formerly given;
that God should then come to the beds side, <hi>ad sibilandum populum suum,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaks, to hisse softly for his childe, to speake comfortably in his eare,
to whisper gently to his departing soule, and to drowne and overcome with this soft
Musick of his, all the danger of the Angels Trumpets, all the horror of the ringing
Bell, all the cryes, and vociferations of a distressed, and distracted, and scattering fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
yea all the accusations of his owne conscience, and all the triumphant accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the Devill himselfe; that God should love a man thus <hi>in fine,</hi> at his end,
and returne to him then, though he had suffered him to go astray from him before,
it is a great testimony of an unspeakable love: but his love is not onely <hi>in fine,</hi> at the
end, but <hi>in finem, to the end,</hi> all the way to the end. He leaves them not uncalled at
first, he leaves them not unaccompanied in the way, he leaves them not unrecompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at the last, that God who is Almighty, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> first and last, that
God is also love it selfe, and therefore this love is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> first and last too;
Consider Christs proceeding with <hi>Peter</hi> in the ship,<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 14.</note> in the storme; first he suffered him
to be in some danger, but then he visites him with that strong assurance, <hi>Noli timere,
Be not afraid, it is I,</hi> any testimony of his presence rectifies all. This puts <hi>Peter</hi> into
that spirituall knowledge and confidence, <hi>Iube me venire, Lord bid me come to thee;</hi>
he hath a desire to be with Christ, but yet stayes his bidding; he puts not himselfe
into an unnecessary danger, without a commandment; Christ bids him, and <hi>Peter</hi>
comes, but yet, though Christ were in his sight, and even in the actuall exercise
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:93359:160"/>
of his love to him, yet as soone as he saw a gust, a storme, <hi>timuit,</hi> he was afraid, and
Christ letteth him feare, and letteth him sinke, and letteth him crie; But he directeth
his feare, and his crie to the right end. <hi>Domine salvum me fac,</hi> Lord save me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he stretcheth out his hand and saved him: God doth not raise his children to
honour, and great estates, and then leave them, and expose them to be subjects, and
exercises of the malice of others, nor he doth not make them mightie, and then leave
them, <hi>ut glorietur in malo qui potens est,</hi> that he should thinke it a glory to be able to do
harm. He doth not impoverish and dishonour his children, and then leave them;
leave them unsensible of that Doctrine, that patience is as great a blessing as aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
God giveth not his children health, and then leaveth them to a boldnesse in
surfetting; nor beauty, and leave them to a confidence of opening themselves to all
sollicitations; nor valour, and then leaveth them to a spirit of quarrelsomnesse: God
maketh no patterns of his works, no modells of his houses, he maketh whole pieces, he
maketh perfect houses, he putteth his children into good wayes, and he directeth and
protecteth them in those wayes: For this is the constancy and the perseverance of the
love of Christ Jesus, as he is called in this Text a stone. To come to the particular
benefits;<note place="margin">Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis.
1 Cor. 3.</note> the first is that he is <hi>lapis fundamentalis,</hi> a foundation stone; for other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
can no man lay then that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus. Now where Saint
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, (as he doth in two or three places) that this place of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> is one of these places of which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith <hi>Quaedam difficilia,</hi>
There are some things in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hard to be understood: Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that the difficulty is in the next words, how any man should build hay or stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon so good a foundation as Christ, how any man that pretendeth to live in
Christ, should live ill, for in the other there can be no difficulty, how Christ Jesus to
a Christian, should be the onely foundation: And therefore to place salvation or
damnation in such an absolute Decree of God, as should have no relation to the fall
of man, or reparation in a Redeemer; this is to remove this stone out of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
for a Christian may be well content to beginne at Christ: If any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have laid any other foundation to his Faith, or any other foundation to his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
possession of great places, alliance in great Families, strong parties in Courts,
obligation upon dependants, acclamations of people; if he have laid any other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
for pleasure, and contentment, care of health, and complexion, appliable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in conversation, delightfulnesse in discourses, cheerefulnesse in disportings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanging
of secrets, and such other small wares of Courts and Cities as these are:
whosoever hath laid such foundations as these, must proceed as that Generall did,
who when he received a besieged Towne to mercy, upon condition that in signe of
subjection they should suffer him to take off one row of stones from their walls, he
tooke away the lowest row, the foundation, and so ruined and demolished the whole
walls of the Citie: So must he that hath these false foundations, (that is, these ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits)
divest the habite, roote out the lowest stone, that is, the generall, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
inclination to these disorders: For he shall never be able to watch and resist e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular temptation, if he trust onely to his Morall Constancy; No, nor if
he place Christ for the roofe to cover all his sinnes, when he hath done them; his
mercy worketh by way of pardon after, not by way of <hi>Non obstante,</hi> and priviledge to
doe a sinne before hand; but before hand we must have the foundation in our eye;
when we undertake any particular Action, in the beginning, we must looke how that
will suite with the foundation, with Christ; for there is his first place, to be <hi>Lapis
fundamentalis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then,<note place="margin">Angularis.</note> after we have considered him, first, in the foundation (as we are all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians)
he growes to be <hi>Lapis Angularis,</hi> the Corner stone, to unite those Christians,
which seem to be of divers ways, divers aspects, divers professions together; as wee
consider him in the foundation, there he is the root of faith, As we consider him in the
Corner,<note place="margin">Esay 28.</note> there hee is the root of charity, In <hi>Esay</hi> hee is both together, <hi>A sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
and a <hi>Corner stone,</hi> as he was in the place of <hi>Esay, Lapis probatus,</hi> I will
lay in <hi>Sion</hi> a tryed stone;<note place="margin">118.</note> and in the <hi>Psalm, Lapis reprobatus,</hi> a stone that the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
refused, In this consideration, he is <hi>Lapis approbatus,</hi> a stone approved by all
sides, that unites all things together: Consider first, what divers things he unites
in his own person; That he should be the sonne of a woman, and yet no sonne of man,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93359:161"/>
That the sonne of a woman should be the sonne of God, that mans sinfull nature, and
innocency should meet together, a man that should not sinne, that Gods nature
and mortality should meet together, a God that must die; Briefly, that he should
doe and suffer so many things impossible as man, impossible as God. Thus hee was
a Corner stone, that brought together natures, naturally incompatible. Thus he was
<hi>Lapis Angularis,</hi> a Corner stone in his Person, Consider him in his Offices, as
a Redeemer, as a Mediatour, and so, hee hath united God to man; yea, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
man to jealous God: Hee is such a Corner stone, as hath united heaven,
and earth, Jerusalem and Babylon together.</p>
                     <p>Thus in his Person, and thus in his Offices, Consider him in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and hee is such a Corner stone, as that hee is the God of Peace, and
Love, and Union, and Concord. Such a Corner stone as is able to unite,
and reconcile (as it did in <hi>Abrahams</hi> house) a Wife, and a Concubine in one
bed, a covetous Father, and a wastfull Sonne in one family, a severe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and a licentious people in one City, an absolute Prince, and a jealous
People in one Kingdome, Law, and Conscience in one Government, Scripture,
and tradition in one Church. If we would but make Christ Jesus and his peace,
the life and soule of all our actions, and all our purposes; if we would mingle that
sweetnesse and supplenesse which he loves, and which he is, in all our undertakings;
if in all controversies, booke controversies, and sword controversies, we would fit
them to him, and see how neere they would meet in him, that is, how neere
we might come to be friends, and yet both sides be good Christians; then wee
placed this stone in his second right place, who as hee is a Corner stone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
God and man in his owne Person, and a Corner stone in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
God and mankinde in his Office, so hee desires to bee a Corner stone in
reconciling man and man, and setling peace among our selves, not for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ends, but for this respect, that wee might all meet in him to love one another,
not because wee made a stronger party by that love, not because wee made a
sweeter conversation by that love, but because wee met closer in the bosome of
Christ Jesus; where wee must at last either rest altogether eternally, or bee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether eternally throwne out, or bee eternally separated and divorced from one
another.</p>
                     <p>Having then received Christ for the foundation stone,<note place="margin">Lapis Iacob.</note> (wee beleeve aright) and
for the Corner stone (we interpret charitably the opinions, and actions of other
men) The next is, that hee bee <hi>Lapis Iacob,</hi> a stone of rest and security to our
selves. When <hi>Iacob</hi> was in his journey, hee tooke a stone, and that stone was
his pillow,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> upon that hee slept all night, &amp;c. resting upon that stone, hee
saw the Ladder that reached from heaven to earth; it is much to have this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
and regresse to God, to have a sense of being gone from him, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and meanes of returning to him; when wee doe fall into particular sinnes, it
is well if wee can take hold of the first step of this Ladder, with that hand of
<hi>David,<note place="margin">Psal. 47. 20.</note> Domine respice in Testamentum, O Lord, consider thy Covenant,</hi> if wee can
remember God of his Covenant, to his people, and to their seed, it is well; it is more,
if wee can clamber a step higher on this ladder to a <hi>Domine labia mea aperies,</hi> if we
come to open our lips in a true confession of our wretched condition and of those
sinnes by which we have forfeited our interest in that Covenant, it is more; and more
then that too,<note place="margin">Esay 16. 9.</note> if we come to that <hi>inebriabo me lacrymis,</hi> if we overflow and make our
selves drunke with teares, in a true sense, and sorrow for those sinnes, still it is more;
And more then all this, if we can expostulate with God in an <hi>Vsque quo Domine, How
long,<note place="margin">Psal. 13. 2.</note> O Lord, shall I take counsell in my self, having wearinesse in my heart?</hi> These steps,
these gradations towards God, do well; warre is a degree of peace, as it is the way of
peace; and these colluctations and wrestlings with God, bring a man to peace with
him; But then is a man upon this <hi>stone</hi> of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when in a faire, and even, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
religious course of life, he enters into his sheets every night, as though his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
next day were to shrowd and wind him in those sheets; he shuts up his eyes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night, as though his Executors had closed them; and lies downe every night, not as
though his man were to call him up next morning, or to the next dayes sport, or busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but as though the Angels were to call him to the resurrection; And this is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93359:161"/>
our third benefit, as Christ is a <hi>stone,</hi> we have security and peace of conscience in
him.</p>
                     <p>The next is,<note place="margin">Lapis Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</note> That he is <hi>Lapis David,</hi> the stone with which <hi>David</hi> slew <hi>Goliah,</hi> and
with which we may overcome all our enemies; <hi>Sicut baculus crucis, ita lapis Christi
habuit typum; Davids</hi> sling was a type of the Crosse,<note place="margin">August.</note> and the stone was a type of Christ,
we will chuse to insist upon spirituall enemies, sinnes; And this is that stone that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the weakest man to overthrow the strongest sinne, if he proceed as <hi>David</hi> did:
<hi>David</hi> sayes to <hi>Goliah, Thou comest to me with a speare and a shield, but I come to thee in
the name of the God of the hosts of Israel, whom thou hast railed upon,)</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam 14. 15.</note> if thou watch the
approach of any sinne, any giant sinne that transports thee most; if thou apprehend it
to rayle against the Lord of Hosts, (that is, that there is a loud and active blasphemy
against God, in every sinne) if thou discerne it to come with a <hi>sword,</hi> or a <hi>speare,</hi> (that
is, perswasions of advancement if thou do it, or threatings of dishonour, if thou do
it not,) if it come with a <hi>shield,</hi> (that is, with promises to cover and palliate it, though
thou do it,) If then this <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gregory.</note> (thy attempted soule) can put his hand into his bag (as
<hi>David</hi> did) (for <hi>quid cor hominis nisi sacculus Dei?</hi> a mans heart is that bag in which God
layes up all good directions) if he can but take into his consideration his Jesus, his
Christ, and sling one of his works, his words, his commandments, his merits, This
<hi>Goliah,</hi> this Giant sinne, will fall to the ground, and then, as it is said of <hi>David,</hi> that
he slew him when he had no sword in his hand, and yet in the next verse, that he tooke
his sword and slew him with that: so even by the consideration of what my Lord hath
done for me, I shall give that sinne the first deaths wound, and then I shall kill him
with his owne sword, that is, his owne abomination, his owne foulenesse shall make
me detest him. If I dare but looke my sinne in the face, if I dare tell him, <hi>I come in
the name of the Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> if I consider my sinne, I shall triumph over it, <hi>Et dabit certan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The last benefit which we consider in Christ,<note place="margin">Lapis, Petra.</note> as he is a <hi>stone,</hi> is, That he is <hi>Petra,</hi> a
Rock;<note place="margin">Num. 20.</note> The Rock gave water to the Israelites in the wildernesse; and he gave them
honey out of the stone,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 13.</note> and oyle out of the hard Rock: Now when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes,
That our Fathers dranke of the same Rock as we, he adds that the same Rock was
Christ;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10</note> So that all Temporall, and all Spirituall blessings to us, and to the Fathers,
were all conferred upon us in Christ; but we consider not now any miraculous produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the Rock, but that which is naturall to the Rock; that it is a firme defence
to us in all tempests, in all afflictions, in all tribulations; and therefore, <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

easie of digestion, and good nourishment to us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Thy holy spirit of patience shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>That these stones be made bread;</hi> And we shall finde more juice, more marrow in
these stones, in these afflictions, then worldly men shall do in the softnesse of their oyle,
in the sweetnesse of their honey, in the cheerefulnesse of their wine; for as Christ is
our foundation, we beleeve in him, and as he is our corner-stone, we are at peace with
the world in him; as he is <hi>Iacobs</hi> stone, giving us peace in our selves and <hi>Davids</hi> stone,
giving us victory over our enemies, so he is a Rock of stone, (no affliction, no tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shal shake us.) And so we have passed through all the benefits proposed to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this first part, As Christ is a stone.</p>
                     <p>It is some degree of thankfulnesse,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> to stand long in the contemplation of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
which we have received, and therefore we have insisted thus long upon the first
part. But it is a degree of spirituall wisdome too, to make haste to the consideration
of our dangers, and therefore we come now to them, Wee may fall upon this stone,
and be broken. This stone may fall upon us, and grinde us to powder, and in the first
of these, we may consider, <hi>Quid cadere,</hi> what the falling upon this stone is: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93359:162"/>
                        <hi>Quid frangi,</hi> what it is to broken upon it: and then thirdly, the latitude
of this <hi>unusquisque,</hi> that whosoever fals so, is so broken; first then, because Christ
loves us to the end, therefore will we never put him to it, never trouble him till then;
as the wiseman sayd of <hi>Manna,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wisd. 16. 24.</note> that it had abundance of all pleasure in it, and was meat
for all tasts, that is, (as Expositors interpret it) that <hi>Manna</hi> tasted to every one, like
that which every one liked best: so this stone Christ Jesus, hath abundance of all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of stone in it, and is all the way such a stone to every man, as he desires it should
be. Unto you that beleeve saith, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it is a precious stone, but unto the disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
a stone to stumble at: for if a man walke in a gallery, where windowes, and tables,
and statues, are all of marble, yet if he walke in the darke, or blindfold, or carelesly,
he may breake his face as dangerously against that rich stone, as if it were but brick;
So though a man walke in the true Church of God, in that Jerusalem which is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the foundation, the gates, the walls, all precious stone, yet if a
man bring a mis-belief, a mis-conceipt, that all this religion is but a part of civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and order; if a man be scandalized, at that humility, that patience, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
that lowlinesse of spirit which the Christian Religion inclines us unto; if he will
say, <hi>Si Rex Israel,</hi> If Christ will be King, let him come downe from the Crosse, and
then we will beleeve in him, let him deliver his Church from all crosses, first, of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and then of persecution, and then we will beleeve him to be King; if we will
say, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare,</hi> we will admit Christ, but we will not admit him to reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us, to be King; if he will be content with a Consulship, with a Collegueship, that
he &amp; the world may joyn in the government, that we may give the week to the world,
and the Sabbath to him, that we may give the day of the Sabbath to him and the night
to our licentiousnesse, that of the day we may give the forenoon to him, and the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
to our pleasures, if this will serve Christ, we are content to admit him, but <hi>Nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
regnare,</hi> we will none of that absolute power, that whether we eat or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we doe, we must be troubled to thinke on him, and respect his glory in every
thing. If he will say, <hi>Praecepit Angelis,</hi> God hath given us in charge to his Angels,
and therefore we need not to look to our own ways, He hath locked us up safely, and
lodged us softly under an eternall election, and therefore we are sure of salvation, if he
will walke thus blindely, violently, wilfully, negligently in the true Church, though he
walke amongst the Saphires, and Pearls, and Chrysolytes, which are mentioned there,
that is, in the outward communion and fellowship of Gods Saints, yet he may bruise
and break, and batter himselfe, as much against these stones, as against the stone
Gods of the heathen, or the stone Idols of the Papists; for first, the place of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon this <hi>stone,</hi> is the true Church; <hi>Qui jacet in terra,</hi> he that is already upon the
ground, in no Church, can fall no lower, till he fall to hell; but he whom God hath
brought into his true Church, if he come to a confident security, that he is safe enough
in these outward acts of Religion, he falls, though it be upon this stone, he erreth,
though in the true Church. This is the place then, the true Church; the
falling it selfe (as farre as will fall into our time of consideration now) is a falling into some particular sinne, but not such as quenches our faith; wee fall so, as
we may rise againe. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expresseth it so,<note place="margin">Hierome.</note> 
                        <hi>Qui cadit, &amp; tamen credit,</hi> he that
falls, but yet beleeves, that fals and hath a sense of his fall, <hi>reservatur per paenitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
ad salutem,</hi> that man is reserved by Gods purpose, to come by repentance, to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for this man that fals there, fals not so desperately, as that he feeles nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
hell and him, nothing to stop at, nothing to check him by the way, <hi>Cadit super,</hi>
he falls upon some thing; nor he falls not upon flowers, to wallow and tumble in his
sinne, nor upon feathers, to rest and sleep in his sinne, nor into a cooling river, to disport,
and refresh, and strengthen himself in his sinne; but he falls upon a stone, where he
may receive a bruise, a pain upon his fall, a remorse of that sinne he is fallen into: And
in this fall, our infirmitie appears three wayes: The first is <hi>Impingere in lapidem,</hi> To
stumble, for though he be upon the right stone in the true Religion, and have light
enough,<note place="margin">Esa. 50. 10.</note> yet <hi>Impingimus meredie,</hi> as the Prophet saith, even at noon we stumble; we
have much more light, by Christ being come, then the Jewes had, but we are sorry we
have it: when Christ hath said to us for our better understanding of the Law, <hi>He that
looketh and lusteth hath committed Adultery, He that coveteth hath stollen, He that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
hath murdered,</hi> we stumble at this, and we are scandalized with it; and we thinke
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93359:162"/>
that other Religions are gentler, and that Christ hath dealt hardly with us, and we
had rather Christ had not said so, we had rather he had left us to our libertie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
to looke, and court, and to give a way to our passions, as we should finde it
most conduce to our ease, and to our ends. And this is <hi>Impingere,</hi> to stumble, not to
goe on in an equall and even pace, not to doe the will of God cheerefully. And a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
degree is <hi>calcitrare,</hi> to kick, to spurre at this stone; that is, to bring some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sinne, and some particular Law into comparison: To debate thus, if I doe
not this now, I shall never have such a time; if I slip this, I shall never have the like
opportunitie; if I will be a foole now, I shall be a begger all my life: and for the
Law of God that is against it, there is but a little evill for a great deale of good; and
there is a great deale of time to recover and repent that little evill. Now to remove
a stone which was a landmarke, and to hide and cover that stone, was all one fault in
the Law; to hide the will of God from our owne Consciences with excuses and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuatious,
this is, <hi>calcitrare,</hi> as much as we can to spurn the stone, the landmarke out of
the way; but the fulnesse and accomplishment of this is in the third word of the Text,
<hi>Cadere,</hi> to fall; he falls as a piece of money falls into a river; we heare it fall, and we
see it sink, and by and by we see it deeper, and at last we see it not at all: So no man
falleth at first into any sinne, but he heares his own fall. There is a tendernesse in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Conscience at the beginning, at the entrance into a sinne, and he discerneth a while
the degrees of sinking too: but at last he is out of his owne sight, till he meete this
stone; (this stone is Christ) that is, till he meete some hard reprehension, some
hard passage of a Sermon, some hard judgement in a Prophet, some crosse in the
World, some thing from the mouth, or some thing from the hand of God, that breaks
him: <hi>He falls upon the stone and is broken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that to be broken upon this stone,<note place="margin">Frangi.</note> is to come to this sense, that though our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
be lost, that we be no more whole and intire vessells, yet there are meanes of
piecing us again: Though we be not vessells of Innocency, (for who is so?) (and for
that enter not into judgement with thy servants O Lord) yet we may be vessells of
repentance acceptable to God, and usefull to his service: for when any thing falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a stone, the harme that it suffereth, is not alwayes (or not onely) according to
the proportion of the hardnesse of that which it fell upon, but according to the heighth
that it falleth from, and according to that violence that it is throwne with: If their
fall who fall by sinnes of infirmitie, should referre onely to the stone they fall upon,
(the Majestie of God being wounded and violated in every sinne) every sinner
would be broken to pieces, and ground to powder: But if they fall not from too far
a distance, if they have lived within any nearnesse, any consideration of God, if they
have not fallen with violence, taken heart and force in the way, grown perfect in the
practise of their sinne, if they fall upon this stone, that is, sinne, and yet stoppe at
Christ, after the sinne, this stone shall breake them; that is, breake their force, and
confidence, breake their presumption, and security, but yet it shall leave enough
in them, for the Holy Ghost to unite to his Service; yea, even the sinne it self, <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operabitur
in bonum,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> as the Apostle saith, the very fall it selfe shall be an occasion of
his rising: And therefore though Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> seeme to venture farre, it is not
too farre, when he saith, <hi>Audeo dicere,</hi> it is boldly said, and yet I must say it, <hi>utile est ut
caderem in aliquod manifestum peccatum;</hi> A sinner falleth to his advantage, that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into some such sinne, as by being manifested to the World, manifesteth his
owne sinnefull state, to his owne sinnefull Conscience too: It is well for
that man that falleth so, as that he may thereby looke the better to his footing ever
after;<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
                        <hi>Dicit Domino Susceptor meus es tu,</hi> sayes St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> That man hath a new Title to

could fall, having nothing to tempt him (for so many of the Antiens interpret
that place of the fall of the Angels, and when the Angels fell, there were no other
creatures made,) but <hi>Quid est homo aut filius hominis?</hi> since the Father of man, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
could not, how shall the sonnes of him, that inherit his weaknesse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
more, and contribute their temptations to one another, hope to stand? <hi>Adam</hi>
fell, and he fell <hi>à longè,</hi> farre off, for he could see no stone to fall upon, for when he
fell, there was no such <hi>Messias,</hi> no such meanes of reparation proposed, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
when he fell, as now to us; The blessed Virgin, and the forerunner of Christ,
<hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> fell too, but they fell <hi>propè,</hi> neerer hand, they fell but a little way, for
they had this stone (Christ Jesus) in a personall presence, and their faith was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

an infinite depth; If he fall not upon a soft place, to a delight in sinne, but upon a
stone, and this <hi>stone,</hi> (no harder, sharper, ruggedder then this, not into a diffidence, or
distrust in Gods mercy) he that falls so, and is broken so, that comes to a remorsefull,
to a broken, and a contrite heart, he is broken to his advantage, left to a possibility,
yea brought to a neerenesse of being pieced againe, by the Word, by the Sacraments,
and other medicinall institutions of Christ in his Church.</p>

                        <hi>upon whom this stone falls, it
will grinde him to powder;</hi> where we shall onely tell you first, <hi>Quid conteri,</hi> what this
grinding is; and then, <hi>Quid cadere,</hi> what the falling of this stone is; And briefly this
grinding to powder, is to be brought to that desperate and irrecoverable estate in sinne,
as that no medicinall correction from God, no breaking, no bowing, no melting, no
moulding can bring him to any good fashion; when God can worke no cure, do no
good upon us by breaking us; not by breaking us in our health, for we will attribute
that to weaknesse of stomach, to surfeit, to indigestion; not by breaking us in our
states, for we will impute that to falshood in servants, to oppression of great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
to inquity of Judges; not by breaking us in our honour, for we will accuse for
that, factions, and practises, and supplantation in Court; when God cannot breake us
with his corrections, but that we will attribute them to some naturall, to some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
causes, and never thinke of Gods judgements, which are the true cause of
these afflictions; when God cannot breake us by breaking our backs, by laying on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
loads of calamities upon us, nor by breaking our hearts, by putting us into a sad,
and heavy, and fruitlesse sorrow and melancholy for these worldly losses, then he
comes to breake us by breaking our necks, by casting us into the bottomlesse pit,
and falling upon us there, in this wrath and indignation, <hi>Comminuam eos in pulverem,</hi>
sayth he,<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>I will beate them as small as dust before the winde,</hi> and tread them as flat as clay
in the streets,<note place="margin">Esay 30. 14.</note> the breaking thereof shall be like the breaking of a Potters vessell, which
is broken without any pity. (No pity from God, no mercy, neither shall any man
pity them, no compassion, no sorrow:) And in the breaking thereof, saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
there <hi>is not found a sheard to take fire at the hearth,</hi> nor to take water at the pit:
that is, they shall be incapable of any beam of grace in themselves from heaven, or any
spark of zeale in themselves, (not a sheard to fetch fire at the hearth) and incapable of
any drop of Christs blood from heaven, or of any teare of contrition in themselves,
not a sheard to fetch water at the pit,<note place="margin">Ierem. 19. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>I will breake them as a Potters vessell, quod non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

which God hath ordained in his Church) to recompact them againe, no voice of Gods
word to draw them, no threatnings of Gods judgements shall drive them, no cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Gods Church shall fit them, no Sacrament shall cement and glue them to
Christs body againe; In temporall blessings, he shall be unthankfull, in temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
he shall be obdurate: And these two shall serve, as the upper and nether stone
of a mill, to grinde this reprobate sinner to powder.</p>
                     <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Cadere.</note> this is to be done, by Christs falling upon him, and what is that? I know
some Expositors take this to be but the falling of Gods judgements upon him in this
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:93359:163"/>
world; But in this world there is no grinding to powder, all Gods judgements here, (for
any thing that we can know) have the nature of Physick in them, &amp; may, &amp; are wont to
cure; &amp; no man is here so absolutely broken in pieces, but that he may be re-united: we
chuse therefore to follow the Ancients in this, That the falling of this stone upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
is Christs last &amp; irrecoverable falling upon him, in his last judgment; that when
hee shall wish that the Hills might fall and cover him, this stone shall fall, &amp; <hi>grinde him
to powder; He shall be broken, and he no more found,</hi> says the Prophet, <hi>yea, he shall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and no more sought:</hi> No man shall consider him what he is now,<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 18.</note> nor remember him
what he was before: For, that stone, which in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> was cut out without hands
(which was a figure of Christ, who came without ordinary generation) when that great
Image was to be overthrown, broke not an arme or a leg, but brake the whole Image
in peeces, and it wrought not onely upon the weak parts, but it brake all, the clay, the
iron, the brasse, the silver, the gold; so when this stone fals thus, when Christ comes
to judgement, he shall not onely condemn him for his clay, his earthly and covetous
sinnes, nor for his iron, his revengefull oppressing, and rustly sinnes, nor for his brasse, his
shining, and glittering sinnes, which he hath filed and polished, but he shall fall upon
his silver and gold, his religious and precious sinnes, his hypocriticall hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
his singular observing of Sabbaths, his Pharisaicall giving of almes, and as well
his subtill counterfeiting of Religion, as his Atheisticall opposing of religion, this stone,
Christ himselfe, shall fall upon him, and a showre of other stones shall oppresse him too.

there shall fall upon him the naturall Law, which was written in his heart, and did
rebuke him, then when he prepared for a sinne; there shall fall upon him the written
Law, which cryed out from the mouthes of the Prophets in these places, to avert him
from sinne; there shall fall upon him those sinnes which he hath done, and those sins
which he hath not done, if nothing but want of means &amp; opportunity hindred him from
doing them; there shall fall upon him those sinnes which he hath done after anothers
dehortation, and those, which others have done after his provocation; there the stones
of Nineveh shall fall upon him, and of as many Cities as have repented with lesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of mercy and grace, then God afforded him; there the rubbage of Sodom
and Gomorrah shall fall upon him, and as many Cities as in their ruine might have been
examples to him. All these stones shall fall upon him, and to add weight to all these,
Christ Jesus himselfe shall fall upon his conscience, with unanswerable questions,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 11.</note> and
grinde his soule to powder. But <hi>hee that overcometh, shall not bee hurt by the second
death,</hi> he that feeles his own fall upon this stone, shall never feel this stone fall upon
him, he that comes to a remorse, early, and earnestly after a sinne, and seeks by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
meanes, his reconcileation to God in his Church, is in the best state that man
can be in now; for howsoever we cannot say that repentance is as happy an estate as
Innocency, yet certainly every particular man feels more comfort and spirituall joy,
after a true repentance for a sin, then he had in that degree of Innocence which he had
before he committed that sinne; and therefore in this case also we may safely repeat
those words of <hi>Augustine, Audeo dicere,</hi> I dare be bold to say, that many a man hath
been the better for some sin.</p>
                     <p>Almighty God, who gives that civill wisdome, to make use of other mens infirmities,
give us also this heavenly wisdome, to make use of our own particular sins, that thereby our
own wretched conditions in our selves, and our meanes of reparation in Iesus Christ, may be
the more manifested unto us; To whom with the blessed Spirit, &amp;c.</p>

that all their <hi>Gospels</hi> were severally refused by one Sect of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
or other. But it was proper to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> alone, to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a Sect, that admitted <hi>all the</hi> other three Evangelists, (as
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> remembers) and refused onely Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> These
were the <hi>Alogiani,</hi> a limme and branch of the <hi>Arians,</hi> who being
unable to looke upon the glorious Splendour, the divine Glory,
attributed by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> to this <hi>Logos,</hi> (which gave them their name of <hi>Alogiani</hi>) this
<hi>Word,</hi> this <hi>Christ,</hi> not comprehending this <hi>Mystery,</hi> That <hi>this Word was so with God,
as that it was God;</hi> they tooke a round way, and often practised, to condemne all that
they did not understand, and therefore refuse the whole <hi>Gospell.</hi> Indeed his <hi>whole Gospell</hi>
is comprehended in the beginning thereof. In this <hi>first Chapter</hi> is contracted all that
which is extensively spred, and dilated through the whole Booke. For here is first, the
<hi>Foundation</hi> of all, the <hi>Divinitie</hi> of Christ, to the 15. verse. Secondly, the <hi>Execution</hi> of
all, the <hi>Offices</hi> of Christ, to the 35. verse. And then the <hi>Effect,</hi> the <hi>Working,</hi> the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of all, that is, who were to <hi>Preach</hi> all this, to the ends of the world, the <hi>calling of
his Apostles,</hi> to the end of the Chapter: for the first, <hi>Christs Divinity,</hi> there is enough
expressed in the very first verse alone: for, there is his <hi>Eternitie,</hi> intimated in that word,
<hi>In principio, in the beginning.</hi> The first booke of the Bible, <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the last booke,
(that is, that which was <hi>last written) this Gospell,</hi> begin both with this word, <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
But the <hi>last</hi> beginning was the <hi>first,</hi> if <hi>Moses</hi> beginning doe onely denote the
<hi>Creation,</hi> which was not 6000. yeares since, and Saint <hi>Iohns,</hi> the <hi>Eternity of Christ,</hi>
which no Millions, multiplied by Millions, can calculate. And then, as his <hi>Eternitie,</hi> so
his <hi>distinction of Persons,</hi> is also specified in this 1. verse, when the <hi>Word,</hi> (that is, <hi>Christ</hi>)
is said to have been <hi>apud Deum,</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> For, therefore, (saith Saint <hi>Basil</hi>) did the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> rather choose to say <hi>apud Deum,</hi> then in <hi>Deo, with God,</hi> then <hi>in God, ne aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renda
Hypostaseos occasionem daret,</hi> lest he should give any occasion of denying the same
<hi>Nature,</hi> in divers <hi>Persons;</hi> for it doth more clearly notifie a distinction of Persons, to
say, he was <hi>with him,</hi> then to say, he was <hi>in him;</hi> for the severall Attributes of God,
<hi>(Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> and the rest) are <hi>in God,</hi> and yet they are not distinct Persons. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there is also expressed in this 1. verse Christs <hi>Equality</hi> with God, in that it is said, <hi>&amp;


Verbum erat Deus,</hi> and <hi>this Word was God.</hi> As it was <hi>in the beginning,</hi> and therefore <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,</hi>
and as it was <hi>with God,</hi> and therefore a <hi>distinct</hi> Person, so it was <hi>God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forre
<hi>equall</hi> to the Father; which phrase doth so vexe and anguish the <hi>Arians,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disfurnished of all other escapes, they corrupted the place, onely with a false inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
and broke of the words, where they admitted no such pause; for, they read it
thus, <hi>Verbum erat apud Deum;</hi> (so far, well) <hi>Et Deus erat.</hi> There they made their
point; and then followed in another sentence: <hi>Verbum hoc erat in principio,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The first part then of this Chapter, (and indeed of the whole Gospell) is in that 1.
verse the <hi>manifestation</hi> of his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> in his <hi>Eternitie,</hi> in the <hi>distinction</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in the <hi>equalitie</hi> with the Father. The second part of the Chapter layeth downe
the <hi>Office of Christ,</hi> his <hi>Propheticall,</hi> his <hi>Priestly,</hi> his <hi>Royall Office.</hi> For the first, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a <hi>Prophet</hi> consisting in three severall <hi>exercises,</hi> to <hi>manifest</hi> things <hi>past,</hi> to <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell</hi>
things <hi>to come,</hi> and to <hi>expound</hi> thing <hi>present,</hi> Christ declared himself to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
in all these three: for, for the first, he was not onely a <hi>Verball,</hi> but an <hi>Actuall</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifester
of former <hi>Prophecies,</hi> for all the former Prophecies were accomplished in his
<hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>in his deeds,</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> in his <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>Passion.</hi> For the second, his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93359:164"/>
of <hi>future</hi> things, he foretold the state <hi>of the Church,</hi> to the end of the world. And
for the third (declaring of <hi>present things</hi>) He told the <hi>Samaritan woman,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 19.</note> so exquisite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all her own History, that she gave presently that attestation, <hi>Sir, I see that thou art
a Prophet:</hi> so his <hi>Propheticall</hi> Office, is plainly laid down. For his <hi>second</hi> Office, his
<hi>Priesthood,</hi> that is expressed in the 36. verse, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God;</hi> for, in this, he was
our <hi>Priest,</hi> that he was our <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> he was our <hi>Priest,</hi> in that he offered himselfe for
our sinnes. Lastly, his <hi>Royall Office</hi> was the <hi>most naturall</hi> to him of all the rest. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a <hi>Prophet</hi> was <hi>Naturall</hi> to none; none was <hi>born</hi> a Prophet. Those who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>children of the Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>sonnes of the Prophets,</hi> are but the <hi>Prophets Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
Though the Office of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> by being annexed to <hi>one Tribe,</hi> may (in some
sense) be called <hi>Naturall,</hi> yet in Christ it could not be so, for he was not of that Tribe
of <hi>Levi:</hi> so that he had no interest in the <hi>legall Priesthood,</hi> but <hi>was a Priest according to
the Order of Melchisedec.</hi> But his Title to be <hi>King,</hi> was <hi>naturall,</hi> by <hi>descent,</hi> he was of
the <hi>bloud Royall,</hi> and the nearest in succession; so that he, and onely he, had, <hi>De Iure,</hi> all
the <hi>three unctions</hi> upon him. <hi>David</hi> had <hi>two;</hi> he was both a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a <hi>King;</hi> he
had those two capacities; <hi>Melchisedec</hi> had <hi>two</hi> too; he was both a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Priest;</hi>
he had two: Onely Christ had all <hi>three,</hi> both a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the third part of the Chapter, which is <hi>the calling of foure of his Apostles,</hi> we may
observe that the first was called, was not <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Andrew;</hi> that there might be
laid at first some interruption, some stop to their zealous fury, who will still force, and
heap up every action which any way concerns Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to the building up of his
imaginary <hi>primacy,</hi> which primacy, they cared not though <hi>Peter</hi> wanted, if they could
convey that primacy to his <hi>Successor,</hi> by any <hi>other Title;</hi> for which Successours sake it
is, and not for Saint <hi>Peters</hi> own, that they are so over diligent in advancing his <hi>prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi>
But, it was not <hi>Peter,</hi> that was called, but <hi>Andrew.</hi> In <hi>Andrews</hi> present and
earnest application of himself to <hi>Christ,</hi> we may note, (and onely so) divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
fit for use and imitation. In his first question, <hi>Master, where dwellest thou?</hi> there is
not onely, (as <hi>Cyrill</hi> observes) a reverent ascribing to him <hi>a power of instructing</hi> in that
compellation, <hi>Master,</hi> but a desire to have more time afforded to hearken to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, <hi>Where dwellest thou,</hi> that I may dwell with thee? And as soon as ever he had
taken in some good portion of knowledge <hi>himselfe,</hi> he conceives presently a desire to
communicate his happinesse with <hi>others;</hi> and he seeks his brother <hi>Peter,</hi> and tells him,
<hi>Invenimus Messiam, we have found the Messias;</hi> which is, (as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> notes)
<hi>vox quaerentis:</hi> In this, that he rejoyces in the finding of him, he testifies that he had
sought him, and that he had continued in the expectation of a <hi>Messias</hi> before. <hi>Invenit
Messiam,</hi> he had found the <hi>Messias;</hi> but, saith the Text, <hi>Duxit ad Iesum,</hi> he brought
his brother the glorious newes of having found a <hi>King,</hi> the King of the Jewes, but he
led him to <hi>Iesus,</hi> to a <hi>Saviour;</hi> that so, all kinds of happinesse, <hi>temporall</hi> and <hi>spirituall,</hi>
might be intimated in this discovery of a <hi>King,</hi> and of a <hi>Saviour;</hi> What may not his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
hope for at his hands, who is both those, a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and hath <hi>worldly</hi>
preferments, and the Glory of <hi>Heaven in his power?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, though the words of this Text, <hi>(He was not that light, but was sent to beare
witnesse of that light)</hi> are placed in the first part of the Chapter, that which concernes
<hi>Christs Divine nature,</hi> yet they belong, and they have a respect to all three; To his
<hi>Divine nature,</hi> to his <hi>Offices,</hi> and to his <hi>Calling of his Apostles:</hi> For, first, <hi>light</hi> denotes
his <hi>Divine nature;</hi> secondly, the testimony that is given of him by <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
(of whom the words of our Text are spoken) declares him to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and
<hi>Messias,</hi> (which signifies <hi>anointed</hi>) involves all his <hi>Offices,</hi> are his <hi>three Offices,</hi> are his
<hi>three vocations;</hi> and thirdly, the Application of this testimony, given by <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
here, by the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>Successors</hi> after, intimates or brings to our memory
this their first <hi>vocation,</hi> in this Chapter. So that the Gospel of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> containes
all <hi>Divinity,</hi> this Chapter <hi>all the Gospell,</hi> and this Text all the <hi>Chapter.</hi> Therefore
it is too large to goe through at this time; at this time we shall insist upon such bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as arise out of that consideration, <hi>what, and who this light is,</hi> (for, we shall finde
it to be both a <hi>personall light,</hi> (it is <hi>some body</hi>) and, otherwise too, a <hi>reall light,</hi> (it is
<hi>some thing</hi>) therefore we inquire, <hi>what,</hi> this light is, <hi>(what thing)</hi> and <hi>who</hi> this light
is, <hi>(what person)</hi> which <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> is denied to be. Hereafter we shall consider, <hi>the
Testimony</hi> which is given of this light; in which part in due time, we shall handle,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93359:165"/>
the <hi>person</hi> of the witnesse <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> in whom we shall finde many considerable, and
extraordinary circumstances: and then, his <hi>Citation,</hi> and calling to this testimony; and
thirdly, the <hi>testimony</hi> it selfe that he gave: and lastly, <hi>why any testimony</hi> was requisite to
so evident a thing as <hi>light.</hi> But the first part, <hi>who,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> this light is, belongs most
properly to <hi>this day,</hi> and will fill that portion of the day, which is afforded us for this
exercise. Proceed we therefore to that, <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was not that light, <hi>who was,
what was?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though most expositors,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> as well ancient, as modern agree with one generall, and
unanime consent,<note place="margin">Quis lux.</note> that <hi>light</hi> in this <hi>verse</hi> is intended and meant of <hi>Christ,</hi> Christ is this
light, yet in some precedent and subsequent passages in this Chapter, I see other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
have been admitted of this word, <hi>light,</hi> then perchance those places will beare; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
other then those places need: particularly, in the <hi>fourth verse (In it was life, and
that life was the light of men)</hi> there they understand <hi>life,</hi> to be nothing but this <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life</hi> which we breath, and <hi>light</hi> to be onely that <hi>naturall life, naturall reason,</hi> which
distinguishes us <hi>men,</hi> from other creatures. Now, it is true that they may have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for some ground of this interpretation in antiquity it selfe, for, so says Saint <hi>Cyrill,
Filius Dei Creativè illuminat,</hi> Christ doth enlighten us, in creating us. And so some
others of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and some of the <hi>Schooles,</hi> understand by that light <hi>naturall Reason,</hi>
and that life, conservation in life. But this interpretation seemes to me subject to both
these dangers, that it goes so farre, and yet reaches not home. So far, in wresting in
<hi>divers</hi> senses into a word, which needs but <hi>one,</hi> and is of it selfe cleare enough, that is
<hi>light,</hi> and yet reaches not home, for it reaches not to the <hi>essentiall light,</hi> which is <hi>Christ
Iesus,</hi> nor to the <hi>supernaturall light,</hi> which is <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> which seemes to have
been the Evangelists principall scope, to declare the comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> (who is the
<hi>essentiall light</hi>) and his purpose in comming, to raise and establish a Church, by <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Grace,</hi> which is the <hi>supernaturall light:</hi> For, as the holy Ghost himselfe interprets
<hi>life</hi> to be meant of Christ,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>(He that hath the Sonne hath life)</hi> so we may justly doe of
<hi>light</hi> too, <hi>he that sees</hi> the Sonne, the <hi>Sonne of God hath light.</hi> For, light is never, (to my
remembrance) found in any place of the Scripture, where it must necessarily signifie
the light of nature, <hi>naturall reason;</hi> but wheresoever it is transferred from the naturall
to a figurative sense, it takes a higher signification then <hi>that;</hi> either it signifies <hi>Essentiall</hi>
light, Christ Jesus, (which answers our first question, <hi>Quis lux, who is this light,</hi> it is
<hi>Christ, personally</hi>) or it signifies the <hi>supernaturall light</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> (which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
our second question, <hi>Quid lux, what is this light,</hi> for it is the <hi>working of Christ,</hi>
by his Spirit, in his <hi>Church,</hi> in the infusion of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> for <hi>beliefe,</hi> and <hi>manners</hi>)
And therefore though it be ever lawfull, and often times very usefull, for the raising and
exaltation of our devotion, and to present the plenty, and abundance of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>
in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> who satisfies us as with marrow, and with fatnesse, to induce the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
senses</hi> that the Scriptures doe admit, yet this may not be admitted, if there may
be danger thereby, to neglect or weaken the <hi>literall sense</hi> it selfe. For there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of that <hi>spirituall wantonnesse</hi> of finding more then necessary senses; for, the more
<hi>lights</hi> there are, the more <hi>shadows</hi> are also cast by those many lights. And, as it is true
in religious duties, so is it in interpretation of matters of Religion, <hi>Necessarium &amp; Satis
convertuntur;</hi> when you have done that you ought to doe in your calling, you have
done enough; there are no such <hi>Evangelicall counsailes,</hi> as should raise workes of <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation,</hi>
more then you are bound to doe, so when you have the <hi>necessary sense,</hi> that is
the meaning of the holy Ghost in that place, you have senses enow, and not till then,
though you have never so many, and never so delightfull.</p>
                     <p>Light therefore,<note place="margin">Illa lux.</note> is in all this Chapter fitliest understood of <hi>Christ;</hi> who is noted
here, with that distinctive article, <hi>Illa lux, that light.</hi> For, <hi>non sic dicitur lux, sicut lapis;</hi>
Christ is not so called <hi>Light,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Augustin.</note> as he is called a <hi>Rock,</hi> or a <hi>Cornerstone;</hi> not by a
metaphore, but truly, and properly. It is true that the Apostles are said to
be <hi>light,</hi> and that with an article, <hi>the light;</hi> but yet with a limitation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the light of the world,</hi> that is, set up to convey light to the world. It is true
that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> himselfe was called <hi>light,</hi> and with large additions, <hi>Lucerna ardens,
a burning,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> and <hi>a shining lampe,</hi> to denote both his owne <hi>burning zeale,</hi> and the <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi>
of this his light to others. It is true,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> that <hi>all the faithfull</hi> are said to be <hi>light in
the Lord;</hi> but all this is but to signifie that they had been in darknesse before; they
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93359:165"/>
had been beclouded, but were now illustrated; they were light, but light by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,</hi>
by illustration of a greater light. And as in the first creation, <hi>vesper &amp;
mane dies unus, The evening and the morning made the day, evening</hi> before <hi>morning,
darknesse</hi> before <hi>light,</hi> so in our <hi>regeneration,</hi> when wee are made <hi>new Creatures,</hi> the
Spirit of God findes us in <hi>naturall darknesse,</hi> and by him we are made <hi>light in the Lord.</hi>
But Christ himselfe, and hee onely, is <hi>Illa lux, vera lux; that light, the true light.</hi>
Not so opposed to those other lights, as though the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> or
the <hi>faithfull,</hi> who are called <hi>lights,</hi> were <hi>false</hi> lights; but that they were <hi>weake</hi>
lights. But Christ was <hi>fons lucis,</hi> the fountaine of all their light; light so, as
no body else was so; so, as that hee was nothing but light. Now, neither the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> nor the <hi>Elect,</hi> no nor the <hi>virgin Mary</hi> (though wee
should allow all that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> aske in her behalfe) for the Roman
Church is not yet come to that searednesse, that obduratenesse, that impudency,
as to pronounce that the <hi>virgin Mary</hi> was <hi>without originall sinne,</hi> (though they
have done many shrewd acts towards it, to the prejudice of the contrary opinion)
yet none of these were so light, as they were nothing but light. <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe
who received and delivered the law, was not so; and to intimate so much, there
was an illustration, and irradiation upon <hi>his face,</hi> but not so of <hi>all his body.</hi>
Nay, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> himselfe, who fulfilled the law, <hi>as man,</hi> was not so; which he
also intimated in the greatest degree of glorification which he accepted upon earth,
which was his <hi>transfiguration,</hi> for, though it be said in that, <hi>That the fashion of his
Countenance was changed, and his garment was white, and glistered,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 27.</note> yet, <hi>lineamenta
Petro agnoscibilia servavit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertull.</note> hee kept that former proportion of body, that <hi>Peter</hi>
could know him by it. So that this was not a glorifying of the body, and making
it <hi>thorough light;</hi> but hee suffered his <hi>Divine nature</hi> to appeare and shine thorough
his <hi>flesh,</hi> and not to swallow, or annihilate that flesh. All other men, by occasion
of this flesh, have darke <hi>clouds,</hi> yea <hi>nights,</hi> yea long and frozen winter nights of
<hi>sinne,</hi> and of the <hi>works of darknesse.</hi> Christ was incapable of any such nights, or any
such clouds, any approaches towards <hi>sinne;</hi> but yet Christ admitted some <hi>shadowes,</hi>
some such degrees of <hi>humane infirmity,</hi> as by <hi>them,</hi> he was willing to show, that the
nature of man, in the best perfection thereof, is not <hi>vera lux, tota lux,</hi> true
light, all light, which he declared in that <hi>Si possible,</hi> and that <hi>Transeat calix, If it
hee possible, let this cup passe;</hi> words,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> to which himselfe was pleased to allow so
much of a retractation, and a correction, <hi>Veruntamen, yet Father,</hi> whatsoever the
sadnesse of my soule have made mee say, <hi>yet, not my will but thine be done; not mine,
but thine;</hi> so that they were not altogether, <hi>all one;</hi> humane infirmity made some
difference. So that no one man, not Christ, (considered but so as man) was <hi>tota
lux,</hi> all light, no cloud. No not <hi>mankinde,</hi> consider it <hi>collectively,</hi> can bee light so,
as that there shall bee no darknesse. It was not so, when all mankind was in one <hi>person,</hi> in
<hi>Adam.</hi> It is said sometimes in School, that <hi>no man</hi> can keep the commandements, yet
<hi>man, collectively,</hi> may keep them. They intend no more herein, but that some one man
may abstaine from doing any act against worshipping of <hi>Images,</hi> another from <hi>stealing,</hi>
another from <hi>adultery,</hi> and others from others. But if it were possible to compose a man
of such elements, as that the principallest vertues, and eminencies of all other men, should
enter into his composition, and if there could bee found a man, as perfect in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
vertues, as <hi>Moses</hi> was in meeknesse,<note place="margin">Numb.12.</note> (who was a <hi>meeke man, above all the
men that were upon the earth</hi>) yet this man would not bee <hi>vera lux, tota lux,</hi>
true light, all light. <hi>Moses</hi> was not so <hi>meeke,</hi> but that hee <hi>slew the Egyptian,</hi>
nor so meek, but that hee disputed and expostulated with <hi>God</hi> many times, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.
Every man is so far from beeing <hi>tota lux,</hi> all light, as that he hath still <hi>within
him,</hi> a darke vapor of <hi>orginall sinne,</hi> and the cloud of <hi>humane flesh without him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay not onely no man, (for so we may consider him in the whole course of his
life) but <hi>noone act,</hi> of the most perfect, and religious man in the world, though
that act employ but halfe a minute in the doing thereof, can bee <hi>vera lux,</hi> true
light, all light, so perfect light, as that it may serve another, or thy selfe, for a lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne
to his, or thy feet, or a light to his, or thy steps, so that hee or thou may thinke
it enough to doe so still. For, another man may doe so good works, as it may justly work
to thy shame, and confusion, and to the aggravating of thy condemnation, that thou livest
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93359:166"/>
not as well as <hi>hee,</hi> yet, it would not perchance serve thy turne, to live <hi>but</hi> so well;
for, <hi>to whom God gives more, of him he requires more.</hi> No man hath <hi>veram lucem,</hi>
true light, thorough light; no man hath <hi>meridiem, Augem,</hi> that high point
that casts no shadow, because, besides <hi>originall sinne,</hi> that ever smoakes up, and
creates a foote in the soule, and besides <hi>naturall infirmities,</hi> which become sinnes,
when wee consider <hi>Grace,</hi> no man does carry his good actions to that heighth
as, by that grace, which God affords him, hee might doe. Slacker men have
a declination even in their <hi>mornings;</hi> a <hi>West</hi> even in their <hi>East;</hi> coolings, and
faintnesses and after-noones, as soon as they have any dawnings, any breake of
day, any inchoation of any spirituall action or purpose. Others have some farther
growth, and increasing, and are more diligent in the observation of spirituall duties;
but yet they have not their <hi>meridiem,</hi> their <hi>Augem,</hi> their noon, their <hi>south point,</hi> no
such heighth, as that they might not have a higher, by that <hi>grace</hi> which they
have received. In the best degree of our best actions, particularly in this service,
which wee doe to God at this houre, if we brought with us hither a religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to sanctifie this festivall, if wee answer to the callings of his most blessed Spirit,
whilest wee are here, if wee carry away a detestation of our sinnes, and a holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of amendment of life, this is a good degree of proficiency, and God bee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
if any of us all arrive to that degree; but yet, this is not <hi>vera lux,</hi> true light,
all light; for, who amongst us can avoid the testimony of his conscience, that since
he begun this present service to God, his thoughts have not strayed upon <hi>pleasures</hi> and
<hi>vanities</hi> or <hi>profit,</hi> and leapt the walls of this Church, yea, perchance within the
walls of this flesh, which should bee the <hi>Temple of the holy Ghost?</hi> Besides, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>vera lux, tota lux,</hi> true light, thorough light, requires <hi>persebrrance</hi> to the
end. So that till our naturall light goe out, wee cannot say that wee have this
light; for, as the darknesse of hell fire is, so this light of this heavenly fire, must bee
everlasting. If ever it go cleane out, it was never throughly kindled, but kindled
to our farther damnation; it was never <hi>vera lux,</hi> true light, for, as one office of
the <hi>law</hi> is, but to show sinne, so all the <hi>light of grace</hi> may end in this, to show me my
desperate estate, from the abuse of grace. In all Philosophy there is not so darke a thing
as <hi>light;</hi> As the sunne, which is <hi>fons lucis naturalis,</hi> the beginning of naturall light,
is the most evident thing to bee seen, and yet the hardest to be looked upon, so is
naturall light to our reason and understanding. Nothing clearer, for it is <hi>clearnesse</hi> it
selfe, nothing darker, it is enwrapped in so many scruples. Nothing nearer, for
it is round about us, nothing more remote, for wee know neither entrance, nor
limits of it. Nothing more <hi>easie,</hi> for a child discerns it, nothing more <hi>hard,</hi> for no
man understands it. It is apprehensible by <hi>sense,</hi> and not comprehensible by <hi>reason.</hi>
If wee winke, wee cannot chuse but see it, if we stare, wee know it never the better.
No man is <hi>yet</hi> got so neare to the knowledge of the qualities of light, as to know
whether <hi>light</hi> it selfe be a <hi>quality,</hi> or a <hi>substance.</hi> If then this <hi>naturall light</hi> be so darke
to our naturall reason, if wee shall offer to pierce so far, into the light of this text, the
<hi>Essentiall light Christ Iesus,</hi> (in his nature, or but in his <hi>offices</hi>) or the <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
light</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> (how far <hi>faith</hi> may be had, and yet lost, and how far the
<hi>freewill</hi> of man may concur and cooperate with <hi>grace,</hi> and yet <hi>still</hi> remaine nothing in
it selfe) if wee search farther into these points, then the Scripture hath opened us a
way, how shall wee hope to unentangle, or extricate our selves? They had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
composition for <hi>lamps,</hi> amongst the <hi>ancients,</hi> reserved especially for <hi>Tombes,</hi>
which kept light for many hundreds of yeares; we have had <hi>in our age</hi> experience, in
some casuall openings of ancient vaults, of finding such lights, as were kindled, (as
appeared by their inscriptions) <hi>fifteen</hi> or <hi>sixteen hundred</hi> years before; but, as soon as that
light comes to our light, it vanishes. So this <hi>eternall,</hi> and this <hi>supernaturall light, Christ</hi>
and <hi>faith,</hi> enlightens, warmes, purges, and does all the profitable offices of <hi>fire,</hi> and
<hi>light,</hi> if we keep it in the right spheare, in the proper place, (that is, if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in <hi>points necessary</hi> to salvation, and <hi>revealed</hi> in the Scripture) but when wee
bring this light to the common light of <hi>reason,</hi> to our inferences, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies,
it may be in danger to vanish it selfe, and perchance extinguish our reason too;
we may search so far, and reason so long of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> as that we may lose not
onely <hi>them,</hi> but even our reason too, and sooner become <hi>mad</hi> then <hi>good.</hi> Not that we are
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93359:166"/>
bound to believe any thing <hi>against reason,</hi> that is, to believe, we know not why. It
is but a slacke opinion, it is not <hi>Beliefe,</hi> that is not grounded upon reason. He
that should come to a <hi>Heathen man,</hi> a meere naturall man, uncatechized, uninstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the rudiments of the Christian Religion, and should at first, without any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
present him first with this necessitie; Thou shalt burn in fire and brimstone eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
except thou believe <hi>a Trinitie of Persons, in an unitie of one God,</hi> Except thou
believe the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the second Person of the Trinitie, the Sonne of God, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou believe that <hi>a Virgine had a Soone,</hi> and the same Sonne that God had, and
that God was Man too, and being the immortall God, yet died, he should be so farre
from working any spirituall cure upon this poore soule, as that he should rather bring
Christian Mysteries into scorne, then <hi>him</hi> to a beliefe. For, that man, if you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
so, Believe all, or you burne in Hell, would finde an easie, an obvious way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
all; that is, first not to believe <hi>Hell</hi> it selfe, and then nothing could binde him to
believe the rest.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>reason</hi> therefore of Man, must first be satisfied; but the way of such satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
must be <hi>this,</hi> to make him see, That this World, a frame of so much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
so much concinnitie and conveniencie, and such a correspondence, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
in the parts thereof, must necessarily have had a workeman, for nothing
can make it selfe: That no such workeman would deliver over a frame, and worke,
of so much Majestie, to be governed by <hi>Fortune,</hi> casually, but would still retain the
Administration thereof in his owne hands: That if he doe so, if he made the World,
and <hi>sustaine</hi> it still by his watchfull Providence, there belongeth a worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to him, for doing so: That therefore he hath certainly revealed to man,
what kinde of worship, and service, shall be acceptable to him: That this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of his Will, must be permanent, it must be <hi>written,</hi> there must
be a <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Will:</hi> And that therefore, from that
Scripture, from that Word of God, all Articles of our Beliefe are to bee
drawne.</p>
                     <p>If then his <hi>Reason</hi> confessing all this, aske farther proofe, how he shall know that
<hi>these Scriptures</hi> accepted by the Christian Church, are the true Scriptures, let him
bring any other Booke which pretendeth to be the Word of God, into compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with these; It is true, we have not a <hi>Demonstration;</hi> not such an Evidence as that
one and two, are three, to prove these to be Scriptures of God; God hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in that manner, to drive our Reason into a pound, and to force it by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
necessitie to accept these for Scriptures, for then, here had been no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of our <hi>Will,</hi> and our assent, if we could not have resisted. But yet these
Scriptures have so orderly, so sweet, and so powerfull a working upon the reason, and
the understanding, as if any third man, who were utterly discharged of all precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
and anticipations in matter of Religion, one who were altogether <hi>neutrall,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interessed,
unconcerned in either party, nothing towards a <hi>Turke,</hi> and as little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
a <hi>Christian,</hi> should heare a <hi>Christian</hi> pleade for his Bible, and a <hi>Turke</hi> for his
Alcoran, and should weigh the evidence of both; the Majesty of the <hi>Style,</hi> the
punctuall accomplishment of the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> the harmony and concurrence of the
<hi>foure Evangelists,</hi> the consent and unanimity of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> ever since,
and many other such reasons, he would be drawne to such an Historicall, such a
Grammaticall, such a Logicall beliefe of our Bible, as to preferre it before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that could be pretended to be the Word of God. He would believe it, and
he would know <hi>why</hi> he did so. For let no man thinke that <hi>God</hi> hath given him so
much ease here, as to save him by believing he knoweth not what, or why. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
cannot save us, but we cannot be saved without Knowledge; Faith is not
on this side Knowledge, but beyond it; we must necessarily come to <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
first, though we must not stay at it, when we are come thither. For, a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Christian, being now a <hi>new Creature,</hi> hath also <hi>a new facultie of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi>
and so believeth the Mysteries of Religion, out of another Reason,
then as a meere naturall Man, he believed naturall and morall things. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
them for their own sake, by <hi>Faith</hi> though he take <hi>Knowledge</hi> of them
before, by that common Reason, and by those humane Arguments, which worke
upon other men, in naturall or morall things. Divers men may walke by the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93359:167"/>
Sea side, and the same beames of the Sunne giving light to them all, one gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the benefit of that light pebles, or speckled shells, for curious vanitie,
and another gathers precious Pearle, or medicinall Ambar, by the same light. So the
common light of reason illumins us all; but one imployes this light upon the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of impertinent vanities, another by a better use of the same light, finds out the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Religion; and when he hath found them, loves them, not for the lights sake,
but for the naturall and true worth of the thing it self. Some men by the benefit of
this light of Reason, have found out things profitable and usefull to the whole world;
As in particular, <hi>Printing,</hi> by which the learning of the whole world is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to one another, and our minds and our inventions, our wits and compositions
may trade and have commerce together, and we may participate of one anothers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
as well as of our Clothes, and Wines, and Oyles, and other Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize:
So by the benefit of this light of reason, they have found out <hi>Artillery,</hi> by
which warres come to quicker ends then heretofore, and the great expence of bloud
is avoyded: for the numbers of men slain now, since the invention of Artillery, are
much lesse then before, when the sword was the executioner. Others, by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this light have searched and found the secret corners of gaine, and profit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they lie. They have found wherein the weakenesse of another man consisteth,
and made their profit of that, by circumventing him in a bargain: They have found
his riotous, and wastefull inclination, and they have fed and fomented that disorder,
and kept open that leake, to their advantage, and the others ruine. They have
found where was the easiest, and most accessible way, to sollicite the Chastitie of a
woman, whether <hi>Discourse, Musicke,</hi> or <hi>Presents,</hi> and according to that discovery,
they have pursued <hi>hers,</hi> and <hi>their</hi> own eternall destruction. By the benefit of this
light, men see through the darkest, and most impervious places, that are, that is,
<hi>Courts of Princes,</hi> and the greatest <hi>Officers</hi> in Courts; and can submit themselves to
second, and to advance the humours of men in great place, and so make their profit of
the weakenesses which they have discovered in these great men. All the wayes, both
of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> and of <hi>Craft</hi> lie open to this light, this light of naturall reason: But when
they have gone all these wayes by the benefit of this light, they have got no further,
then to have walked by a tempestuous Sea, and to have gathered pebles, and speckled
cockle shells. Their light seems to be great out of the same reason, that a Torch in
a misty night, seemeth greater then in a clear, because it hath kindled and inflamed
much thicke and grosse Ayre round about it. So the light and wisedome of worldly
men, seemeth great, because he hath kindled an admiration, or an applause in Aiery
flatterers, not because it is so in deed.</p>
                     <p>But, if thou canst take this light of reason that is in thee, this poore snuffe, that is
almost out in thee, thy saint and dimme knowledge of God, that riseth out of this
light of nature, if thou canst in those embers, those cold ashes, finde out one small
coale, and wilt take the paines to kneell downe, and blow that coale with thy devout
<hi>Prayers,</hi> and light thee a <hi>little candle,</hi> (a <hi>desire</hi> to read that Booke, which they call the
Scriptures, and the Gospell, and the Word of God;) If with that little candle thou
canst creep humbly into low and poore places, if thou canst finde thy Saviour in a
<hi>Manger,</hi> and in his <hi>swathing clouts,</hi> in his humiliation, and blesse God for that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
if thou canst finde him flying into Egypt, and finde in thy selfe a disposition to
accompany him in a persecution, in a banishment, if not a bodily banishment, a locall
banishment, yet a <hi>reall, a spirituall banishment,</hi> a banishment from those sinnes, and
that sinnefull conversation, which thou hast loved more then thy <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
or thine owne body, which perchance thou hast consumed, and destroyed with
that sinne; if thou canst finde him contenting and containing himselfe at home in his
fathers house, and not breaking out, no not about the worke of our salvation, till
the due time was come, when it was to be done. And if according to that example,
thou canst contain thy selfe in that station and vocation in which God hath planted
thee, and not, through a hasty and precipitate <hi>zeale,</hi> breake out to an imaginary,
and intempestive, and unseasonable <hi>Reformation,</hi> either in <hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
which belong not to thee; if with this little poore light, these <hi>first degrees</hi>
of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> thou canst follow him into the <hi>Garden,</hi> and gather up
some of the droppes of his precious Bloud and sweat, which he shed for thy soule,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93359:167"/>
if thou canst follow him to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and pick up some of those <hi>teares,</hi> which he
shed upon that City, and upon thy soule; if thou canst follow him to the place of his
scourging, and to his crucifying, and provide thee some of that balme, which must
cure thy soule; if after all this, thou canst turne this little light inward, and canst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
discerne where thy diseases, and thy wounds, and thy corruptions are, and canst
apply those teares, and blood and balme to them, (all this is, That if thou attend the
light of naturall reason, and cherish that, and exalt that, so that that bring thee to a <hi>love
of the Scriptures,</hi> and that <hi>love to a beleefe</hi> of the truth thereof, and that <hi>historicall
faith</hi> to a <hi>faith of application, of appropriation,</hi> that as all those things were certainly
done, so they were certainly done <hi>for thee)</hi> thou shalt never envy the lustre and glory
of the great lights of worldly men, which are great by the infirmity of others, or by
their own opinion, great because others think them great, or because they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so, but thou shalt finde, that howsoever they magnifie their lights, their wit,
their learning,<note place="margin">Habak 1.</note> their industry, their fortune, their favour, and <hi>sacrifice to their owne nets,</hi>
yet thou shalt see, that thou by thy small light hast gathered <hi>Pearle</hi> and <hi>Amber,</hi> and
they by their great lights nothing but shels and pebles; they have determined the
light of nature, upon the booke of nature, this world, and thou hast carried the light
of nature higher, thy naturall reason, and even <hi>humane arguments,</hi> have brought thee
to reade the Scriptures, and to that <hi>love,</hi> God hath set to the seale of <hi>faith.</hi> Their
light shall set at noone; even in their heighth, some heavy crosse shall cast a damp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their soule, and cut off all their succours, and devest them of all comforts, and
thy light shall grow up, from a <hi>faire hope,</hi> to a modest assurance and <hi>infallibility,</hi> that
that light shall never go out, nor the <hi>works of darknesse,</hi> nor the <hi>Prince of darknesse</hi> ever
prevaile upon thee, but as thy light of <hi>reason</hi> is exalted by <hi>faith</hi> here, so thy light of
<hi>faith</hi> shall be exalted into the light <hi>of glory,</hi> and fruition in the Kingdome of heaven.
Before the sunne was made, there was <hi>a light</hi> which did that office of distinguishing

                        <hi>Reason</hi> is that first, and primogeniall light, and goes no farther in a

light of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> flowing from that fountaine of light Christ Jesus, works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the light of <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> it may conduce to the raising of your devotions, if
we do (without any long insisting upon the severall parts thereof) present to you some
of those many and divers lights, which are in this world, and admit an application to
this light in our Text, the <hi>essentiall</hi> light, <hi>Christ Iesus;</hi> and the <hi>supernaturall</hi> light, <hi>faith</hi>

of the light of essence, in this life. The next is the light of glory.</p>
                     <p>This is that <hi>Glorification</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lux Gloriae.</note> which we shall have at the last day, of which glory, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
a great part to be in that <hi>Denudation,</hi> that manifestation of all to all; as, in this
world, a great part of our inglorious servitude is in those disguises, and palliations,
those colours, and pretences of <hi>publique good,</hi> with which men of power and authority
apparell their oppressions of the poore; In this are we the more miserable, that we
<hi>cannot see their ends,</hi> that there is none of this denudation, this laying open of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to one another, which shall accompany that state of glory, where we shall see
one anothers <hi>bodies,</hi> and <hi>soules, actions</hi> and <hi>thoughts.</hi> And therefore, as if this place
were now that Tribunall of Christ Jesus, and this that day of Judgement, and denu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
we must be here, as we shall be there, content to stand <hi>naked</hi> before him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that there be a discovery, a revealing, a manifestation of all our sinnes, wrought
upon us, at least to our owne <hi>consciences,</hi> though not to the congregation; If we will
have glory, we must have this <hi>denudation.</hi> We must not be glad, when our sins scape the
<hi>Preacher.</hi> We must not say, (as though there were a comfort in that) though he have
hit such a mans <hi>Adultery,</hi> and anothers <hi>Ambition,</hi> and anothers <hi>extortion,</hi> yet, for all
his diligence, he hath missed <hi>my sinne;</hi> for, if thou wouldest faine have it mist, thou
wouldest faine hold it still. And then, why camest thou hither? What camest thou
for to <hi>Church,</hi> or to the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Why doest thou delude God, with this <hi>comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
visit,</hi> to come to his house, if thou bring not with thee, a disposition to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and his service? Camest thou onely to try whether God <hi>knew</hi> thy sinne, and
could tell thee of it, by the Preacher? Alas, he knowes it infallibly; And, if he take
no knowledge of his knowing it, to thy <hi>conscience,</hi> by the words of the Preacher, thy
state is the more desperate. God sends us to preach <hi>forgivenesse of sinnes;</hi> where wee
finde no sinne, we have no Commission to execute; How shall we finde your sinnes?
In the old sacrifices of the law, the Priest did not fetch the sacrifice from the herd, but
he received it from him that brought it, and so sacrificed it for him. Doe thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prevent the Preacher; Accuse thyselfe before he accuse thee; offer up thy sinne
thy selfe; Bring it to the top of thy memory, and thy conscience, that he finding it
there, may sacrifice it for thee; Tune the instrument, and it is the fitter for his hand.
Remember thou thine own sins, first and then every word that fals from the preachers
lipsshall be a drop of the <hi>dew of heaven,</hi> a dram of the <hi>balme of Gilead,</hi> a portion of the
bloud of thy Saviour, to wash away that sinne, so presented by thee to be so sacrificed
by him; for, if thou onely of all the congregation finde that the preacher hath not
touched <hi>thee,</hi> nor hit <hi>thy sinnes,</hi> know then, that thou wast not in his Commission for
the <hi>Remission</hi> of sinnes, and be afraid, that thy conscience is either <hi>gangrend,</hi> and unsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of all incisions, and <hi>cauterizations,</hi> that can be made by denouncing the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of God, (which is as far as the preacher can goe) or that thy whole constitution,
thy complexion, thy composition is sinne; the preacher cannot hit thy particular
sinne, because thy whole life, and the whole body of thy actions is one continuall sin.
As long as a man is alive, if there appeare any offence in his breath, the physician will
assigne it to some <hi>one</hi> corrupt <hi>place,</hi> his <hi>lungs,</hi> or <hi>teeth,</hi> or <hi>stomach,</hi> and thereupon apply
convenient remedy thereunto. But if he be dead, and putrefied, no man askes <hi>from
whence that ill aire and offence comes,</hi> because it proceeds from thy whole carcasse. So,
as long as there is in you a <hi>sense</hi> of your sinnes, as long as we can touch the offended
and wounded part, and be felt by you, you are not desperate, though you be fro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward,
and impatient of our increpations. But when you <hi>feele nothing,</hi> whatsoever wee
say, your soule is in an <hi>Hectique fever,</hi> where the distemper is not in any one humor,
but in the whole substance; nay, your soule it selfe is become a carcasse. This then is
our first couple of these lights, by our <hi>Conversation in heaven</hi> here, (that is, a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
that we fall not into sinne) we have <hi>lucem essentiae,</hi> possession and fruition
of heaven, and of the light of Gods presence; and then, if we doe, by infirmity, fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sinne, yet, by this <hi>denudation</hi> of our soules, this manifestation of our sinnes to God
by <hi>confession,</hi> and to that purpose, a gladnesse when we heare our sinne spoken of by
the preacher, we have <hi>lumen gloriae,</hi> an inchoation of our glorified estate; and then, an
other couple of these lights, which we propose to be considered, is <hi>lumen fidei,</hi> and
<hi>lumen naturae,</hi> the light of <hi>faith,</hi> and the light of <hi>nature.</hi>

                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:93359:168"/>
Of these two lights,<note place="margin">Lux fidei.</note> 
                        <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> first, and then <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> we said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
before, but never too much, be cause contentious spirits have cast such clouds
upon both these lights, that some have said, <hi>Nature</hi> doth <hi>all</hi> alone, and others, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath <hi>nothing</hi> to do at all, but all is <hi>Grace:</hi> we decline wranglings, that tend not to
edification, we say onely to our present purpose, (which is the operation of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
couples of lights) that by this light of <hi>Faith,</hi> to him which hath it, all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in <hi>Prophecies,</hi> is clear, and evident, as in a History already done; and all that is
wrapped up in <hi>promises,</hi> is his own already in <hi>performance.</hi> That man needs not goe so

for the <hi>place;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mich. 5. 2.</note> nor for the <hi>time</hi> when he should accomplish all this, so far as to <hi>Daniel;</hi>
no,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> nor so far, as to the <hi>Evangelists</hi> themselves, for the History and the evidence, that
all this that was to be done in his behalf by the <hi>Messias,</hi> was done 1600. yeares since.
But he hath a whole <hi>Bible,</hi> and an abundant Library in his own heart, and there by this
light of <hi>Faith,</hi> (which is not onely a knowing, but an applying, an <hi>appropriating</hi> of all
to thy benefit) he hath a better knowledge then all this, then either <hi>Propheticall,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall;</hi>
for though both these be irrefragable, and infallible proofs of a Messias,
(the Propheticall, that he <hi>should,</hi> the Evangelicall, that he <hi>is</hi> come) yet both these
might but concern others: this light of Faith brings him home <hi>to thee.</hi> How sure so ever
I be, that the <hi>world</hi> shall never perish by <hi>water,</hi> yet <hi>I may</hi> be drowned; and how sure so
ever that the <hi>Lamb of God hath taken away the sinnes of the world,</hi> I may perish,
without I have this <hi>applicatory Faith.</hi> And as he needs not looke back to <hi>Esay,</hi> nor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
nor <hi>Adam,</hi> for the Messias, so neither needs he to looke forward. He needs not
stay in expectation of the <hi>Angels Trumpets,</hi> to awaken the dead; he is not put to his
<hi>usquequo Domine, How long, Lord, wilt thou defer our restitution?</hi> but he hath already
<hi>died the death of the righteous;</hi> which is, to die to sinne; He hath already had his <hi>buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
by being <hi>buried with Christ in Baptisme,</hi> he hath had his <hi>Resurrection</hi> from sinne, his
<hi>Ascension</hi> to holy purposes of amendment of life, and his <hi>Iudgement,</hi> that is, <hi>peace of
Conscience,</hi> sealed unto him, and so by this light of applying Faith, he hath already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
an eternall possession of Gods eternall Kingdome. And the other light in this
second couple is <hi>Lux naturae,</hi> the light of Nature.</p>
                     <p>This,<note place="margin">Lux Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae.</note> though a fainter light, directs us to the other, <hi>Nature to Faith:</hi> and as by the
quantitie in the light of the <hi>Moone,</hi> we know the position and distance of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> how
far, or how neare the Sunne is to her, so by the working of the light of <hi>Nature</hi> in us,
we may discern, (by the measure and virtue and heat of that) how near to the other
greater light, the light of <hi>Faith,</hi> we stand. If we finde our <hi>naturall faculties rectified,</hi> so
as that that <hi>free will</hi> which we have in <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>Civill</hi> actions, be bent upon the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
duties</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> (as every naturall man may, out of the use of that <hi>free will,
come to Church, heare the Word preached, and believe it to be true)</hi> we may be sure, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater light is about us. If we be <hi>cold</hi> in them, in actuating, in exalting, in using
our <hi>naturall faculties</hi> so farre, we shall be deprived of all light; we shall not see the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi>

                     <p>And therefore,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 19.</note> as the Apostle saith, <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> I say too, <hi>Quench not the
light of Nature,</hi> suffer not <hi>that</hi> light to goe out; study your <hi>naturall faculties;</hi> husband
and improve them, and love the <hi>outward acts of Religion,</hi> though an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and
though a naturall man may doe them. Certainly he that loves not the <hi>Militant
Church,</hi> hath but a faint faith in his interest in the <hi>Triumphant.</hi> He that cares not though
the <hi>materiall Church</hi> fall, I am afraid is falling from the <hi>spirituall.</hi> For, can a man be
sure to have his <hi>money,</hi> or his <hi>plate,</hi> if his <hi>house</hi> be burnt? or to preserve his <hi>faith,</hi> if
the <hi>outward exercises</hi> of Religion faile? He that undervalues <hi>outward things,</hi> in the
religious service of God, though he begin at <hi>ceremoniall</hi> and <hi>rituall</hi> things, will come
quickly to call <hi>Sacraments</hi> but outward things, and <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>publique prayers,</hi> but
outward things, in contempt. As some <hi>Platonique</hi> Philosophers, did so over-refine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and devotion, as to say, that nothing but the <hi>first thoughts</hi> and <hi>ebullitions</hi> of a
devout heart, were fit to serve God in. If it came to any <hi>outward action</hi> of the body,
<hi>kneeling,</hi> or lifting up of <hi>hands,</hi> if it came to be but invested in our <hi>words,</hi> and so made
a <hi>Prayer,</hi> nay if it passed but a revolving, a turning in our inward thoughts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
were mingled with our <hi>affections,</hi> though <hi>pious affections,</hi> yet, say they, it is not pure
enough for a service to God; nothing but the <hi>first motions</hi> of the heart is for him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
outward things apparell God; and since God was content to take <hi>a body,</hi> let not
us leave him naked, nor ragged; but, as you will bestow not onely some <hi>cost,</hi> but some
<hi>thoughts,</hi> some <hi>study,</hi> how you will clothe your <hi>children,</hi> and how you will clothe your
<hi>servants,</hi> so bestow both cost and thoughts, thinke seriously, execute cheerfully in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
declarations, that which becomes the dignity of him, who evacuated himselfe for
you. The <hi>zeale of his house</hi> needs not <hi>eat you up,</hi> no nor eat you out of house and home;
God asks not <hi>that</hi> at your hands. But, if you eat <hi>one dish the lesse</hi> at your feasts for his
house sake, if you spare somewhat for his reliefe, and his glory, you will not be the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
nor the weaker, for that abstinence. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> bore witnesse of the light, <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things</hi> beare witnesse of your faith, the exalting of our <hi>naturall faculties</hi> beare
witnesse of the supernaturall. We do not compare the master and the servant, and yet
we thank that servant that brings us to his master. We make a great difference between
the <hi>treasure</hi> in the chest, and the <hi>key</hi> that opens it, yet we are glad to have that key in
our hands. The <hi>bell</hi> that cals me to <hi>Church,</hi> does not catechise me, nor preach to me,
yet I observe the sound of that bell, because it brings me to <hi>him</hi> that does those offices
to me. The light of <hi>nature</hi> is far from being enough; but, as a <hi>candle</hi> may kindle a
<hi>torch,</hi> so into the faculties of nature, well imployed, God infuses <hi>faith.</hi> And this is
our second couple of lights, the subordination of the light of <hi>nature,</hi> and the light of
<hi>faith.</hi> And a third payre of lights of <hi>attestation,</hi> that beare witnesse to the light of our
Text, is <hi>Lux aeternorum Corporum,</hi> that light which the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and those
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93359:169"/>
glorious bodies give from heaven, and <hi>lux incensionum,</hi> that light, which those things;
that are naturally combustible, and apt to take fire, doe give upon earth; both
these beare witnesse of this light,<note place="margin">Lux aeterno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum corporu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> that is, admit an application to it. <hi>For,</hi> in the first of
these, the glorious lights of heaven, we must take nothing for <hi>stars,</hi> that are <hi>not stars;</hi> nor
make Astrological and fixed conclusions out of <hi>meteors,</hi> that are but transitory; they may
be <hi>Comets,</hi> and <hi>blazing starres,</hi> and so portend much mischiefe, but they are none of
those <hi>aeterna corpora,</hi> they are not fixed stars, not stars of heaven. So is it also in the
<hi>Christian Church,</hi> (which is the proper spheare in which the light of our text, <hi>That light</hi>
the <hi>essentiall light</hi> Christ Jesus moves by that supernaturall light of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi>
which is truly the <hi>Intelligence</hi> of that spheare, the Christian Chruch) As in the heavens
the stars were created at once, with one <hi>Fiat,</hi> and then being so made, stars doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
new stars, so the <hi>Christian doctrine necessary</hi> to salvation, was delivered at once, that
is, intirely in one spheare, in the body of the Scriptures. And then, as stars doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
stars, Articles of faith doe not beget Articles of faith; so, as that the <hi>Councell of
Trent</hi> should be brought to bed of <hi>a new Creed,</hi> not conceived before by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>
in the Scriptures, and, (which is a monstrous birth) the child greater then the Father,
as soon as it is borne, the new Creed of the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> to containe more Articles,
then the old Creed of the Apostles did. Saint <hi>Iude</hi> writing of the <hi>common salvation</hi> (as
he calls it) (for,<note place="margin">verse 3.</note> Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> it seems, knew no such <hi>particular salvation,</hi> as that it was
impossible for <hi>any man</hi> to have, salvation is <hi>common salvation</hi>) exhorts them to <hi>contend
earnestly for that faith, which was once delivered unto the Saints. Semel, once;</hi> that is;
<hi>at once, semel, simul, once altogether.</hi> For this is also <hi>Tertullians</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertull.</note> note; that the rule of
faith is, that it be <hi>una, immobilis, irreformabilis;</hi> it must not be <hi>deformed,</hi> it cannot be
<hi>Reformed;</hi> it must not be mard, it cannot be mended; whatsoever needs mending,
and <hi>reformation, cannot be the rule of faith, says <hi>Tertullian. Other foundation can no man
lay then Christ;</hi>
                        </hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11.</note> not onely no <hi>better,</hi> but no <hi>other;</hi> what other things soever are added by
men, enter not into the nature and condition of a foundation. The additions, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and superedifications of the Roman Church, they are not <hi>lux aeternorum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum,</hi>
they are not fixed bodies, they are not stars to direct us; they may be <hi>meteors,</hi>
and so exercise our discourse, and Argumentation, they may raise controversies; And
they may be <hi>Comets,</hi> and so exercise our feares, and our jealousies, they may raise <hi>rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Treasons,</hi> but they are not fixed and glorious bodies of heaven, they are not
<hi>stars.</hi> Their <hi>non-communions,</hi> (for, communions where there are no communicants, are
no communions) when they admit no bread at all, no wine at all, all is <hi>transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi>
are no communions; their <hi>semi-communions,</hi> when they admit the <hi>bread</hi> to be
given, but <hi>not the wine;</hi> their <hi>sesqui-communions,</hi> Bread and Wine to the taste, and to
all other trialls of bread and wine, and yet that bread and wine, the very body, and the
very bloud of Christ; their <hi>quotidian miracles,</hi> which destroy and contradict even the
nature of the miracle, to make miracles ordinary, and fixed, constant and certain; (for,
as that is not a miracle which nature does, so that's not a miracle which man can doe
certainly, constantly, infallibly every day, and every day, every Priest can miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
change bread into the body of Christ, and besides they have certaine fixed shops,
and <hi>Marts of miracles,</hi> in one place a shop of miracles for <hi>barrennesse,</hi> in another, a shop
for the <hi>tooth-ache</hi>) To contract this, their <hi>occasionall Divinity,</hi> doctrines to serve pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasions, that in <hi>eighty eight,</hi> an Hereticall Prince must necessarily be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
and an Hereticall Prince excommunicated must necessarily be deposed, but at
another time it may be otherwise, and <hi>conveniencies,</hi> and <hi>dispensations</hi> may be admitted,
these, and such as these, <hi>traditionall, occasionall, Almanack Divinity,</hi> they may bee
<hi>Comets,</hi> they may be <hi>Meteors,</hi> they may raine bloud, and raine fire, and raine hailestones,
<hi>hailstones as big as Talents,</hi> (as it is in the Revelation) milstones, to grinde the world
by their oppressions, but they are not <hi>lux aeternorum corporum,</hi> the light of the stars and
other heavenly bodies, for, they were made <hi>at once,</hi> and diminish not, encrease not.
<hi>Fundamentall articles</hi> of faith, are always the same. And that's our application of this
<hi>lux aeternorum corporum,</hi> the light of those heavenly bodies, to the light of our Text,
Christ working in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Now,<note place="margin">Lux incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionum.</note> for the consideration of the other light in this third couple, which is <hi>lux in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censionum,</hi>
the light of things, which take, and give light here upon earth, if we reduce
it to application and practise, and contract it to one Instance, it will appeare that the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93359:170"/>
                        <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>zeale</hi> of him, that is best affected, is, for the most part, in the disposition
of a <hi>torch,</hi> or a <hi>knife,</hi> ordained to take <hi>fire,</hi> and to give <hi>light.</hi> If it have <hi>never</hi> been <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
it does not easily take light, but it must be <hi>bruised,</hi> and <hi>beaten</hi> first; if it have been
lighted and put out; though it cannot take fire of <hi>it self,</hi> yet it does easily conceive fire,
if it be presented within any convenient distance. Such also is the soule of man towards
the fires of the <hi>zeale</hi> of Gods glory, and <hi>compassion</hi> of others misery. If there be any
that <hi>never</hi> tooke this fire, that was never affected with either of these, the glory of God,
the miseries of other men, can I hope to kindle him? It must be Gods worke to <hi>bruise</hi>
and <hi>beat</hi> him,<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> with his rod of affliction, before he will take fire. <hi>Paulus revelatione com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsus
ad fidem,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was compelled to believe; not the light which he saw, but
the power which he felt wrought upon him; not because that light shined from heaven,
but because it <hi>strooke</hi> him to the earth.<note place="margin">August.</note> 
                        <hi>Agnoscimus Christum in Paulo prius cogentem, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde
docentem;</hi> Christ begun not upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with <hi>a catechisme,</hi> but with <hi>a rod.</hi> If
therefore here be any in <hi>Pauls</hi> case, that were never kindled before, Almighty God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the same way with <hi>them,</hi> and come so neare to a friendship towards them, as to be
at enmity with them; to be so mercifull to them, as to seeme unmercifull; to be so
well pleased, as to seeme angry; that so by inflicting his <hi>medicinall afflictions,</hi> he may
give them comfort by discomfort, and life by death, and make them seeke his face,
by turning his face from them; and not to suffer them to continue in a stupid <hi>inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and lamentable <hi>senslesnesse</hi> of their miserable condition, but <hi>bruise</hi> and <hi>breake</hi>
them with his rod, that they may take fire. But for you, who have taken this fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that have been enlightned in both <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and in the <hi>preaching</hi> of the word;
in the <hi>meanes,</hi> and in some measure of <hi>practise</hi> of <hi>holinesse</hi> heretofore, if in not supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>oyle</hi> to your Lamps, which God by his ordinance had kindled in you, you have let
this light go out by negligence or inconsideration, or that storms of <hi>worldly calamities</hi>
have blowne it out, do but now at this instant call to minde, <hi>what</hi> sin of <hi>yesterday,</hi> or
t'other day, or long ago, begun, and practised, and prevailed upon you, or <hi>what future
sinne,</hi> what purpose of doing a sinne to night, or to morrow, possesses you; do but
thinke seriously <hi>what sinne,</hi> or <hi>what crosse</hi> hath blown out that light, that grace, which
was formerly in you, before that sinne, or that crosse invaded you, and turne your soul,
which hath been enlightned before, towards this fire which Gods Spirit blowes this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
and you will conceive new fire, new zeale, new compassion. As this <hi>Lux incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionum,</hi>
kindles easily, when it hath been kindled before, so the soule accustomed to the
presence of God in <hi>holy meditations,</hi> though it fall asleep in some darke corner, in some
<hi>sinne of infirmity,</hi> a while, yet, upon every holy occasion, it takes fire againe, and the
meanest <hi>Preacher</hi> in the Church, shall worke more upon him, then the <hi>foure Doctors</hi>
of the Church should be able to do, upon a person who had never been enlightned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that is, never accustomed to the presence of God in his <hi>private meditations,</hi> or
in his <hi>outward acts</hi> of Religion. And this is our third couple of lights, that <hi>beares wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
that is, admit an application to the light of our Text; and then the fourth and
last couple, which we consider, is <hi>Lux Depuratarum Mixtionum,</hi> the light and lustre of
<hi>precious stones,</hi> and then <hi>Lux Repercussionum,</hi> the light of <hi>Repercussion,</hi> and <hi>Reflexion,</hi>
when one body, though it have no light in it self, casts light upon other bodies.</p>
                     <p>In the application of the first of these lights,<note place="margin">Lux Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratarum Mixtionum.</note>
                        <hi>Depuratarum Mixtionum, precious stones,</hi>
we shall onely apply their <hi>making</hi> and their <hi>value.</hi> Precious stones are first <hi>drops of the
dew</hi> of heaven, and then refined by the sunne of heaven. When by long lying they have
exhal'd, and evaporated, and breathed out all their grosse matter, and received another
concoction from the sunne, then they become precious in the eye, and estimation of
men: so those <hi>actions</hi> of ours, that shall be precious or acceptable in the eye of God,
must at first have been conceived from <hi>heaven,</hi> from the <hi>word</hi> of God, and then receive
<hi>another concoction,</hi> by a holy <hi>deliberation,</hi> before we bring those actions to <hi>execution,</hi> lest
we may have mistaken the roote thereof. Actions precious, or acceptable in Gods eye,
must be <hi>holy purposes</hi> in their beginning, and then <hi>done in season;</hi> the <hi>Dove</hi> must lay
the <hi>egge,</hi> and hatch the <hi>bird;</hi> the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> must infuse the purpose, and <hi>sit</hi> upon it, and
<hi>overshadow</hi> it, and mature and ripen it, if it shall be precious in Gods eye. The <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of abuses</hi> in <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> is a holy purpose, there is that drop of the dew of
heaven in it; but if it be <hi>unseasonably attempted,</hi> and have not a farther concoction,
then the <hi>first motions of our owne zeale,</hi> it becomes ineffectuall. Stones precious in the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:93359:170"/>
estimation of men, begin with the <hi>dew of Heaven,</hi> and proceed with the <hi>sunne of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
Actions precious in the acceptation of God, are purposes conceived by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and executed in his time <hi>to his Glory,</hi> not conceived out of <hi>Ambition,</hi> nor executed
out of <hi>sedition.</hi> And this is the application of this <hi>Lux depuratarum mixtionum,</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stones, out of their <hi>making,</hi> we proposed another out of their <hi>valuation;</hi> which
is this, That whereas a Pearle or Diamond of such a bignesse, of so many <hi>Carats,</hi> is so
much worth, one that is twice as big, is ten times as much worth. So, though God
vouchsafe to value every good work thou dost, yet as they grow greater he shall mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
his estimation of them infinitely, When he hath prized at a high rate, the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie</hi>
and <hi>continency</hi> of thy <hi>youth,</hi> if thou adde to this, a <hi>moderation</hi> in thy <hi>middle age,</hi>
from <hi>Ambition,</hi> and in thy latter age from <hi>covetousnesse</hi> and <hi>indevotion,</hi> there shall be
no price in Gods treasure (not the last drop of the blood of his Sonne) too deare for
thee, no roome, no state in his Kingdome (not a <hi>Iointenancie</hi> with his onely Sonne)
too glorious for thee. This is one light in this Couple; The lustre of precious stones:
the other the last is <hi>Lux Repercussionum,</hi> The light of Repercussion, of Reflexion.</p>
                     <p>This is,<note place="margin">Lux Reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussionum.</note> when Gods light cast upon us, reflecteth upon <hi>other men too,</hi> from us; when
God doth not onely accept our works for <hi>our selves,</hi> but imployes those works of ours
upon <hi>other</hi> men. And here is a true, and a Divine <hi>Supererogation;</hi> which the <hi>Devill,</hi> (as
he doth all <hi>Gods Actions,</hi> which fall into his compasse) did mischievously counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
in the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> when he induced their Doctrine of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> that a
man might do so much more then he was bound to do <hi>for God,</hi> as that <hi>that superplusage</hi>
might <hi>save</hi> whom he would; and that if he did not direct them in his intention, upon
any particular person, the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> was generall <hi>Administrator</hi> to all men, and
might bestow them where he would. But here is a true supererogation; not from
<hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>his Merit,</hi> but <hi>from God;</hi> when our good works shall not onely profit <hi>us,</hi> that
<hi>do</hi> them, but <hi>others</hi> that <hi>see them</hi> done; and when we by this light of <hi>Repercussion,</hi> of
<hi>Reflexion,</hi> shall be made <hi>specula divinae gloriae, quae accipiunt &amp; reddunt,</hi> such looking
glasses as <hi>receive</hi> Gods face upon our selves,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> and <hi>cast it upon others by a holy life,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
conversation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To end all,<note place="margin">Conclusio.</note> we have no <hi>warmth</hi> in <hi>our selves;</hi> it is true, but Christ came even in the

first, the <hi>dignity,</hi> the <hi>fitnesse</hi> of the person, implyed in the first word of this part of our
Text, <hi>but; he was not that light;</hi> that is true, but yet he was something towards it;
he was <hi>nothing</hi> considered with <hi>Christ,</hi> but he was <hi>much</hi> considered with any <hi>other</hi> man.
And then we shall see his <hi>title</hi> to his office, <hi>Missus est,</hi> as he was fit in himself, so he was

shall determine our first part, the consideration of his <hi>person,</hi> we shall descend to the
other, his <hi>office;</hi> and therein stop but upon two steps neither; first, <hi>why any</hi> testimony
was required to so cleare a thing as <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> a light, <hi>that light;</hi> and then, <hi>what
kinde</hi> of testimony <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did give to that light. So have you the designe, and
frame of our building, and the severall partitions, the roomes; passe we now to a more

marks of nobility,<note place="margin">Philo Iud.</note> (<hi>Merchandize,</hi> or <hi>Arms,</hi> or <hi>Letters,</hi> amongst the Jewes <hi>Priesthood</hi>

had the best <hi>education,</hi> from their parents, and the best <hi>knowledge</hi> of things that
concerne the publique, by having had their conversation with the best, and most
intelligent persons; as also, because they have for the most part, more to lose
them inferiour persons have, and therefore are likelier to be carefull and vigilant in
their imployment; And againe, because they draw a better respect from those to
whom they are imployed, (which is of great importance in such negotiations, to
send persons acceptable to them to whom they are sent) and yet, do not lye so
open to the tentations and corruptions of their Ministers, as men of <hi>needy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,</hi>

                     <p>This fitnesse <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had, he was of a good family and extraction. It

                     <p>Two things especially make a man a competent witnesse: First, that he have
in himselfe <hi>a knowledge</hi> of the thing that he testifies; else he is an incompetent
witnesse: And then, that he have a <hi>good estimation</hi> in others, that he be reputed
an honest man; else he is an unprofitable witnesse. If he be ignorant, he sayes
truth, but by chance; if he be dishonest, and say truth, it is but upon designe,
and not for the truths sake; for, if those circumstances did not leade him, he would
not say truth. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had both, knowledge and estimation.</p>
                     <p>He knew,<note place="margin">Scientia.</note> 
                        <hi>per scientiam infusam,</hi> by infused knowledge; as he was a Prophet; for
so Christ testifies that he was. But all Prophets knew not all things; therefore he was
<hi>more then a Prophet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 11.9.</note> which is also testified by Christ, in his behalfe. More then any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Prophet.<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> And yet, the Prophet <hi>Esaiah</hi> was (even in his Prophecy) an <hi>Evangelist,</hi>
his Prophecy of Christ was so cleer, so particular, as that it was rather <hi>Gospell,</hi> and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi>
then Prophecy. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was more then <hi>that;</hi> for, he did not onely declare a
present Christ, (in that, <hi>Esay</hi> may seem to come neer him) but he was <hi>Propheta Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus,</hi>
A Prophet that was prophesied of; even <hi>Esay</hi> himself bore witnesse of this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;<note place="margin">Esay 40. 3.</note>
                        <hi>(A voyce cried in the wildernesse, Prepare the way of the Lord.)</hi> And the Prophet
<hi>Malachi</hi> bore witnesse of this witnesse too,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>(Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall
prepare the way before me.)</hi> So he hath the restimony of the first and last of the <hi>Prophets;</hi>
and of him too, who was the first and the last, the cause and the effect, the moving and
fulfilling of all prophecy, of Christ himself,<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>(This is he, of whom it is written,)</hi> and so he
cites those words of <hi>Malachi</hi> concerning <hi>Iohn Baptist. Iohn Baptist</hi> then had this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency,
by knowledge infused by God, declared in former Prophecies, he knew the
matter, which he was to testifie. Which is so essentiall, so substantiall a circumstance in
matter of testimony, in what way soever we will be witnesses to God, as that no man is
a competent witnesse for God, not in his <hi>preaching,</hi> not in his <hi>living,</hi> not in his <hi>dying,</hi>
(though he be a witnesse in the highest sense, that is, a <hi>Martyr)</hi> if he do not <hi>know, upon
what ground,</hi> he sayes, or does, or suffers that, which he suffers, and does, and sayes.
Howsoever he pretend the honour of God in his testimony, yet, if the thing be <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
false,</hi> (false in it self, though true in his opinion) or <hi>formally false,</hi> (true in it self, but
not known to be so, to him that testifies it) both ways he is an incompetent witnesse.
And this takes away the honour of having been witnesses for Christ, and the consolation
and style of Martyrs, both from <hi>them,</hi> who, upon such evidence, as can give no assurance
(that is, <hi>traedi tions of men)</hi> have grounded their faith in God, and from <hi>them,</hi> who take their
light in corners, and conventicles, and not from the City set upon the top of a hill, the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93359:172"/>
Church of God. Those <hi>Roman Priests</hi> who have given their lives, those <hi>Separatists</hi> which
have taken a voluntary banishment, are not competent witnesses for the glory of God;
for a witnesse must know; and <hi>qui testatur de scientia, testetur de modo scientiae,</hi> sayes
the Law, He that will prove any thing by his knowledge, must prove how he came by
that knowledge; The <hi>Papist</hi> hath not the knowledge of his Doctrine from any
Scripture, the <hi>Separatist</hi> hath not the knowledge of his Discipline from any precedent,
any example in the primitive Church.</p>
                     <p>How farre then is that wretched and sinfull man, from giving any testimony
or glory to Christ in his life, who never comes to the knowledge, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>why</hi> he was sent into this life? who is so farre from doing his errand, that
he knowes not what his errand was; not whether he received any errand or no. But,
as though that God, who for infinite millions of ages, delighted himself in himself,
and was sufficient in himself, and yet at last did bestow <hi>six dayes labour</hi> for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and provision of <hi>man,</hi> as though that God, who when man was sowr'd in the
lumpe, poysoned in the fountaine, withered in the roote, in the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi>
would then ingage <hi>his Sonne,</hi> his beloved Sonne, his onely Sonne to be <hi>man,</hi> by a
temporary life, and to be <hi>no man,</hi> by a violent and a shamefull death, as though that
God, who when he was pleased to come to a creation, might have left out <hi>thee,</hi>
amongst <hi>privations,</hi> amongst <hi>nothings,</hi> or might have shut thee up, in the close prison,
of a bare <hi>being,</hi> and no more, (as he hath done <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>stones)</hi> or, if he would have
given thee life, might have left thee a <hi>Toad,</hi> or, if he would have given thee a <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
soule,</hi> might have left thee a <hi>heathen,</hi> without any knowledge of God, or, if
he had afforded thee a Religion, might have left thee a <hi>Iew,</hi> or, though he had made
thee a Christian, might have left thee a <hi>Papist;</hi> as though that God that hath done
so much more, in breeding thee in his true Church, had done all this for <hi>nothing,</hi> thou
passest thorough this world, like a <hi>flash,</hi> like a <hi>lightning,</hi> whose beginning or end no
body knowes, like an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> in the aire, which does not onely not give light
for any use, but not so much as portend or signifie any thing; and thou passest
out of the world, as thy hand passes out of a basin of water, which may bee
somewhat the fouler for thy washing in it, but retaines no other impression of thy
having been there; and so does the world for thy life in it. When God placed
<hi>Adam</hi> in the <hi>world, he</hi> bad him <hi>fill it,</hi> and <hi>subdue</hi> it, and <hi>rule</hi> it; and when he
placed him in <hi>paradise,</hi> he bad him <hi>dresse,</hi> and <hi>keepe paradise;</hi> and when he sent
his children into the over-flowing <hi>Laud of promise,</hi> he bad them <hi>fight,</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi>
the Idolaters; to every body some task, some errand for his glory; And thou
comest from him, into this world, as though he had said nothing unto thee, but
<hi>Go and do as you see cause, Go, and do as you see other men do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou knowest not, that is, <hi>considerest</hi> not, what thou wast sent to doe,
what thou <hi>shouldest have</hi> done, but thou knowest much lesse, what thou <hi>hast</hi>
done. The light of nature hath taught thee to <hi>hide thy sinnes</hi> from other men,
and thou hast been so diligent in that, as that thou hast hid them from thy self,
and canst not finde them in thine owne <hi>conscience,</hi> if at any time the Spirit of
God would burne them up, or the blood of Christ Jesus wash them out; thou
canst not finde them out so, as that a <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Sacrament</hi> can work upon them.
Perchance thou canst tell, when was the first time, or where was the first place,
that thou didst commit such or such a sinne; but as a man can remember when
he began to <hi>spell,</hi> but not when he began to <hi>reade perfectly,</hi> when he began to
joyne his letters, but not when he began to write perfectly, so thou remembrest
when thou wentest timorously and bashfully about sinne, at first, and now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
art ashamed of that shamefastnesse, and sorry thou beganst no sooner.
Poore bankrupt! that hast sinned out thy soule so profusely, so lavishly, that thou
darest not cast up thine accounts, thou darest not aske thy selfe whether thou
have any soule left; how farre art thou, from giving any testimony to Christ,
that darest not testifie to thy selfe, nor heare thy conscience take knowledge of thy
transgressions, but haddest rather sleepe out thy daies, or <hi>drinke</hi> out thy daies,
then leave one minute for <hi>compunction</hi> to lay hold on; and doest not sinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
for the love of that sinne, but for feare of a <hi>holy sorrow,</hi> if thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not fill up thy time, with that sinne. <hi>God cannot be mocked,</hi> saith the Apostle,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93359:172"/>
nor God cannot be <hi>blinded.</hi> He seeth all the way, and at <hi>thy last gaspe,</hi> he will make
thee see too, through the multiplying Glasse, the Spectacle of <hi>Desperation.</hi> Canst
thou hope that that God, that seeth this darke Earth through all the vaults and
arches of the severall spheares of Heaven, that seeth thy body through all thy
stone walls, and seeth thy soul through that which is darker then all those, thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
flesh, canst thou hope that that God can be blinded with drawing a curtain between
thy sinne and him? when he is all eye, canst thou hope to put out that eye, with put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out a candle? when he hath planted legions of Angels about thee, canst thou hope
that thou hast taken away all <hi>Intelligence,</hi> if thou have corrupted, or silenced, or sent

a little tendernesse in thy heart, a little melting in thy bowels, a little dew in thine eyes,
that if thou beest come to know, that thou art a sinner, thou dost therefore presently
know thy sinnes. Thou wouldst have so much tendernes, so much compassion, if thou
knewest that he that fits next thee, were in this danger of Gods heavy indignation;
thou wouldst commiserate thy neighbours wretched condition so much. But proceed
with thy self further, bring this dawning and breake of day to a full light, and this little
sparke to a perfect acknowledgement of thy sinnes. Go home, with this spark of Gods
Spirit in you, and there looke upon your <hi>Rentalls,</hi> and know your oppressions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torsions;
looke upon your <hi>shop-bookes,</hi> and know your deceits and falsifications;
looke upon your <hi>ward-robes,</hi> and know your excesses; looke upon your <hi>childrens
faces,</hi> and know your fornications. Till then, till you come to this scrutiny, this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey,
this sifting of the Conscience, if we should cry <hi>peace, peace,</hi> yet there were no
peace. The Oratour said, <hi>Imposuimus populo, &amp; Oratores visi sumus;</hi> we have cousened
the people, and they say we are excellent Oratours, powerfull, well spoken men. We
might flatter you, and you would say, we were sweet, and smooth, and comfortable
<hi>Preachers,</hi> and we might perish together. But if you study your selves, reade your
own History, if you get to the knowledge of your errand hither, and the ill discharge
of those duties here, the sorrow and compunction which will grow from thence, is a
faire degree of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> (for as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> saith of <hi>Chastitie, Habet pudicitia ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vata,
Martyrium suum,</hi> Chastity preserved is a continuall Martyrdome, so a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse,
if that Chastity have not been preserved, and likewise a true remorse for every
sinne, is a fair degree of Martyrdome) for, <hi>Martyr</hi> is <hi>Testis,</hi> the very name of Martyr
signifieth a <hi>Witnesse;</hi> and this Martyrdome, this true remorse and sorrow, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction
for your sinnes, becomes a witnesse to your selves of your reconciliation to
God in the merits of Christ Jesus. But we may carry this branch no further, that
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> being a competent witnesse therefore, because he understood the matter
hee testified, before wee can bee competent witnesses to our owne Consciences,
of our Reconciliation to God, wee must understand, (and therefore search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our particular sinnes) not onely that wee are sinners, but sinners in such and
such kindes, such times, such places, such persons; for that Soule, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to rest in <hi>generalls,</hi> would but deceive it selfe. <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
was, That as hee knew the matter about which hee was sent, so hee
had, (and justly) a good <hi>estimation</hi> amongst them, to whom hee was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
                     <p>If I have a prejudice against a Man,<note place="margin">Integritas.</note> and suspect his <hi>honestie,</hi> I shall not bee
much moved with his Testimony. The Devill testified for Christ; but, if
there were no other Testimony but his, I should demurre upon the <hi>Gospell,</hi>
I should not die for that Faith. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was a credible person amongst
them. How was this credit acquired? It seemeth <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did no <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi>
Whether hee did or no, is not a cleare Case; for that which is said,
<hi>(Iohn Baptist did no miracles)</hi> is not said by the Evangelist himselfe; Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> doeth not say,<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 41.</note> that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did no miracles; but those that resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him at that place, said that <hi>(He doth no miracles)</hi> for they had seene
none. If he did none,<note place="margin">Aquin.</note> that reason may be good enough, <hi>ne aequalis Christo putaretur,</hi>
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:93359:173"/>
it was forborne in him, that he might appeare to be inferiour to Christ. And, if he
did none, yet there were miracles done by him. The <hi>reformation</hi> of manners, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men to <hi>repentance,</hi> is a miracle. It is a lesse miracle to raise a man from a <hi>sick bed,</hi>
then to hold a man from a <hi>wanton bed,</hi> a litentious bed; lesse to overcome and quench
his fever, then to quench his lust. <hi>Ioseph</hi> that refused his <hi>mistris</hi> was a greater <hi>miracle</hi>
then <hi>Lazarus</hi> raised from the dead. Of these resurrections, we have divers examples,
<hi>Iosephs</hi> case, (I thinke) is singular. There were miracles done so, by <hi>Iohn Baptist preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to <hi>others;</hi> and there were miracies done <hi>upon himself;</hi> &amp; early; for, his <hi>springing in his
mothers womb,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> was a miracle; and a miracle done for others: <hi>Significatio rei à majoribus
cognoscende, non à minori cognitae;</hi> The child catechized his elders, in that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
understood not; that is, the presence of his Saviour, in the virgin then present,
<hi>Divinitus in infante, non humanitus ab infante,</hi> says the same Father; it was not a joy, and
exultation in the child, but an institution, an instruction to the rest. But miracle or no
miracle is not our issue; witnesses for Christ, require not <hi>wonder,</hi> but <hi>beliefe;</hi> we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not <hi>miracles,</hi> but propose Gods ordinary meanes, we look not for <hi>Admiration,</hi>

that even they confessed, that <hi>all that he said was true.</hi> Content thy selfe
with <hi>truths</hi> evident <hi>truths, fundamentall truths,</hi> let matter of <hi>wonder</hi> and admiration

                     <p>He was a witnesse competent to them for his <hi>truth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Austeritas.</note> and <hi>integrity,</hi> and he was so also
for the outward <hi>holinesse of his life;</hi> which, for the present, we consider onely in the
strict and austere manner of living, that he embraced. For, certainly, he that uses no
<hi>fasting,</hi> no <hi>discipline,</hi> no <hi>mortification,</hi> exposes himselfe to many dangers in himselfe,
and to a cheape and vulgar estimation amongst others. <hi>Caro mea jumentum meum,</hi> says
S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> my body is the horse I ride; <hi>iter ago in Ierusalem,</hi> my businesse lies at
<hi>Ierusalem;</hi> thither I should ride; <hi>De via conatur excutere,</hi> my horse over pampered casts
me upon the way, or carries me out of the way; <hi>non cohibebo jejunio,</hi> says he; must not that
be my way, to bring him to a gentler riding, &amp; more command, by lessening his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of provender?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> meanes the same that S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>I beat down my
body,</hi> says he, and <hi>bring it in subjection;</hi> And, (as <hi>Paulinus</hi> reades that place) <hi>Lividum
reddo, I make my body blacke and blue; white</hi> and <hi>red</hi> were not Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> colours. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> was at this time departed, (in outward profession) from the sect of the Pharisees,
and from their ostentations of doing their disciplines in the sight and for the praise of
man; but yet, being become a Christian he left not his <hi>austerity;</hi> And it is possible
for us, to leave the <hi>leaven of the Papist,</hi> the opinion of <hi>merit,</hi> and <hi>supererogation,</hi> and
doing more then we are bound to doe in the ways of godlinesse, and yet nourish our
soules, with that wholesome bread of taming our bodies. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had his <hi>Disciplines,</hi>
his <hi>mortifications;</hi> he tells us so, but he does not tell us <hi>what</hi> they were; lest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
a reverence to his person, and example, might binde mis-devout men, to doe
punctually as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did. The same <hi>Rule</hi> cannot serve all; but the same <hi>Reason</hi>
may.</p>
                     <p>The institution of <hi>friars</hi> under a certain <hi>Rule,</hi> that all of them, just at this time,
shall doe just thus, cannot be a rule of <hi>Iustice;</hi> but the generall doctrine, that
every body needs at some times, some helpes, some meanes, is certainly true. Shall
the riotous, the voluptuous man stay till this something bee a <hi>surfet</hi> or a <hi>fever?</hi> 'Tis
true, this surfet and this fever, will subdue the body, but then thou doest it not. Shall
<hi>a lascivious</hi> wanton stay, till a <hi>consumption</hi> or such contagious diseases as shall make
him unsociable, and so, unable to exercise his sinne, subdue his body? These can doe
it,<note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> but this is <hi>Perimere, non subjugare,</hi> not a subduing of the body alone, but a destroying
of body and soule together. Moderate disciplines subdue the body, as under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a <hi>King,</hi> a father of his people, that governs them by a law. But when
the body comes to bee subdued, by paines, and anguish, and loathsome diseases,
this becomes a <hi>tyranny, a conquest;</hi> and he that comes in by conquest, imposes what
lawes hee will; so that these subduings of the body brought in by sinne, may
worke in us, an obduration; we shall feel them, but not discerne the hand of God
in them; or, if his hand, yet not his hand to that purpose, to relieve us, but to seale
our condemnation to us. Beloved, because our Adversaries of the <hi>Romane heresie,</hi> have
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93359:173"/>
erroneously made a pattern for their <hi>Eremiticall</hi> and <hi>Monasticall</hi> life in <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
and coloured their <hi>idlenesse,</hi> by his <hi>example;</hi> some of the <hi>Reformation</hi> have bent a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
too far the other way, and denied, that there was any such austerity in the life of St.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> as is ordinarily conceived: They say that his conversation in the <hi>Desert,</hi> may
well be understood to have been but a withdrawing of himself from publique and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
businesses, home to his fathers house; for, his father dwelt in that Desert, and
thither went <hi>Mary</hi> to salute <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

                     <p>Especially to the Jewes it was so; amongst them this austerity of life, and abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that there was an eternall Nation, that had lasted many Generations, and yet
never any borne amongst them; <hi>I am foecunda illis aliorum vitae poenitentia,</hi> for, every
man that was crossed or wearied in his owne course of life, applied himselfe to their
Sect and manner of living, as the onely way to Heaven. And <hi>Iosephus</hi> writing
his owne life and forwardnesse, and pregnancy, (perchance a little too favourably or
gloriously in his owne behalfe, to be throughly beleeved; for he saith, that when he

thought himselfe unperfect till he had spent some time, in the strictnesse of all

more, with one <hi>Bannus</hi> an <hi>Ermit,</hi> who lived in the wildernesse, upon herbs and roots,
<hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> austerity of life made him a competent and credible witnesse to them, who
had such austeritie in estimation.</p>
                     <p>And truely, hee that will any way bee a witnesse for Christ, that is, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him, hee must endevour, even by this <hi>outward holinesse of life,</hi> to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to good men. <hi>Vox Populi, vox Dei,</hi> the generall voyce is seldome false;
so also <hi>Oculi populi, Oculi Dei,</hi> In this case God looketh upon man, as man doth; <hi>Singuli

most part, good evidence, with, or against a man. Every one of us is ashamed of the
prayse and attestation of one, whom all the world besides, taketh to be dishonest; so,
will Christ be ashamed of that witnesse, that seeketh not the good opinion of good
men.</p>
                     <p>When I see a <hi>Iesuit</hi> solicite the chastity of a daughter of the house, where he
is harboured, and after knowledge taken by the Parents, upon her complaint, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
it with saying, that he did it but to trie her, and to be the better assured of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
constancy; when I see a <hi>Iesuit</hi> conceale and foment a <hi>powder Treason,</hi> and say
he had it but in <hi>Confession,</hi> and then see these men to proclaim themselves to be <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
witnesses for Christ in the highest degree; I say still, the Devill may be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but I ground not my Faith upon that Testimony: A competent witnesse must
be an honest man. This competency <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had, the good opinion of good men;
And then, he had the seale of all, <hi>Missus est,</hi> he had his Commission, <hi>He was sent to
bear witness of that Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though this word <hi>Missus est,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Missus.</note> He was sent, be not literally in the Text here, yet it
is necessarily implyed, and therefore providently supplyed by the <hi>Translatours</hi> in this
verse, and before in the sixt verse, it is literally expressed, <hi>There was a man sent from God,
whose name was</hi> John. The Law saith, concerning witnesses, <hi>Qui se ingerunt &amp; offerunt,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93359:174"/>
suspecti habentur,</hi> those that offer their testimony before they be cited, are suspicious
witnesses. Therefore they must have a <hi>Mission,</hi> a sending. For, by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule,
<hi>How can they preach except they be sent?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15</note> Preach they may; but <hi>how?</hi> with what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
what effect, what blessing? So that the good successe of <hi>Iohn Bapstists</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Luc. 3. 7.</note>
(For, the multitudes, <hi>The people came to him;</hi> and not light people carried about
with every winde of rumour and noise,<note place="margin">Matt. 3. 7.</note> and noveltie, but <hi>Pharises,</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> men of
learning, of sadnesse and gravity; and not onely <hi>Scholars</hi> affected with subtilties, but,
<hi>Publicans</hi> too,<note place="margin">Luc. 3. 12.</note> men intent upon the world; and other men, whose very profession sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them to many occasions of departing from the strict rules, which regularly binde
other men, and therefore may be in some things, (which tast of injustice) more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
then other men;<note place="margin">14.</note> 
                        <hi>The souldiers likewise came to him, and said, What shall we doe?)</hi>
This his working upon all sorts of men, the blessing that accompanied his labours, was
a subsequent argument of his Mission, that he was sent by God. God himself argues
against them, that were not sent, so, <hi>They were not sent, for they have done no good. I have
not sent those Prophets,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 21.</note> saith the Lord, <hi>yet they ran, I have not spoken to them, and yet they
prophecied;</hi> but, <hi>if they had stood in my counsell, then they should have turned the people
from their evill wayes, and from the wickednesse of their inventions.</hi> This note God
layes upon them, to whom he affords this <hi>vocation</hi> of his <hi>internall Spirit,</hi> that though
others which come without any calling, may gather men in corners, and in <hi>Conventicles,</hi>
and work upon their affections and passions, to singularity, to schisme, to sedition: and
though others which come with an outward, and ordinary calling onely, may advance
their own <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and increate their estimation, and draw their <hi>Auditory</hi> to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reverence of their Persons, and to a delight in hearing them rather then other men,
yet, those onely who have a true <hi>inward Calling</hi> from the Spirit, <hi>shall turn the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from their evill wayes, and from the wickednesse of their inventions.</hi> To such mens
planting and watering God gives an increase; when as others which come to <hi>declame,</hi>
and not to <hi>preach,</hi> and to vent their own gifts, or the purposes of great men for their
gifts, have onely a proportionable reward, winde for winde, <hi>Acclamation</hi> for <hi>Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
popular praise for popular eloquence: for, if they doe not truly <hi>beleeve themselves,</hi>
why should they looke that others should believe them? <hi>Qui loquitur ad cor, loquatur
ex corde;</hi> he that will speake to the heart of another, must finde that that he saith in his
own heart first.</p>
                     <p>Whether the <hi>Mission of the Church of Rome</hi> of Priests and Jesuites hither, be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to satisfie their consciences who are so sent, and sent (in intendment of the Law)
to inevitable losse of life here, hath been laboriously enough debated, and safely enough
concluded, that such a Mission cannot satisfie a rectified conscience. What are they
sent for?<note place="margin">Baroni</note> To defend the Immunities of the Church: that is, to take away the inherent
right of the Crown, the <hi>supremacy</hi> of the King: What seconds them? what assures
them?<note place="margin">Alvarez.</note> That which is their generall Tenent, that into what place so ever the Pope may
send <hi>Priests,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Azor.</note> he may send <hi>Armies</hi> for the security of those Priests; and (as another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
it) in all Cases,<note place="margin">Maynardus.</note> where the Pope may injoyne any thing, he may lawfully proceed
by way of <hi>Warre</hi> against any that hinder the execution thereof. That these <hi>Missions</hi>
from the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> are unlawfull,<note place="margin">vide Pseudo-Mart. f. 154.</note> is safely enough concluded, <hi>A priori,</hi> in the very
nature of the commandement and Mission. For, it is to a place, in which he that sends
hath no power, for it is into the Dominions of another absolute King; and it is of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
in whom he hath no interest, for they are the subjects of another Prince; and my
neighbours setting his mark upon my sheep, doth not make my sheep his. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
if that which they cannot make lawfull <hi>A priori,</hi> in the Nature of the thing, you
will make lawfull in their behalf, <hi>A posteriori,</hi> in the effect and working thereof; that is,
if when these men are thus sent hither, you will run after them to their <hi>Masses,</hi> though
you pretend it be but to meet company, and to see who comes, and to hear a <hi>Church-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;</hi>
if, though you abstain your self, you will lend them a <hi>wife,</hi> or a <hi>childe,</hi> or a <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
to be present there, <hi>A posteriori,</hi> by this effect, by this their working upon you, you
justifie their unjust Mission, and make them thinke their sending and coming lawfull.
So also, (to return to our former consideration) <hi>If you depart not from your evill wayes,
and from the wickednesse of your own inventions:</hi> If for all our preaching you proceed in
your sinnes, you will make us afraid, that our Mission, our Calling is not warrantable,
for thereby you take away that consolation, which is one seale of our Mission, when
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93359:174"/>
we see a good effect of our preaching in your lives. It lyes much in you, to convince
them, and to establish us, by that way, which is Gods own way of arguing, <hi>à posteriori,</hi>
by the effect, by our working upon you. If you say <hi>God is God,</hi> we are sent; if you say
<hi>Baal is God,</hi> you justifie their sending. <hi>Missus est, Iohn Baptist</hi> was sent, it appeared by
the <hi>effect</hi> of his preaching; but it appeares too, by a divers and manifold <hi>citation,</hi>
which he had <hi>received,</hi> upon some of which, there may be good use to insist a little.</p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">1 Citation.</note> he was <hi>cited, called,</hi> before he <hi>was</hi> at all; and called againe before he was <hi>borne;</hi>
called a third time, out of the <hi>desert,</hi> into the <hi>world;</hi> and called lastly out of <hi>this</hi> world
<hi>into</hi> the next; and by all these callings, these citations, these missions, he was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
witnesse. His first citation was before he was any thing, before his <hi>conception.</hi>
Out of the dead embers of <hi>Zacharies</hi> aged loins, and <hi>Elizabeths</hi> double obstacle, <hi>age</hi>
and <hi>barrennesse,</hi> when it was almost as great a worke as a <hi>creation,</hi> to produce a childe

he rings a bell, he showes thee an example in the concourse of people hither, and here,
he sets up a man, to present the prayer of the Congregation to him, and to deliver his
messages to them; and whether <hi>curiosity,</hi> or <hi>custome,</hi> or <hi>company,</hi> or a loathnesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre

to do with thee, now thou art here, even this is a <hi>citation,</hi> a calling, by being
personally here at these exercises of Religion, thou art some kinde of witnesse of this

                        <hi>That he should be filled with the

when the <hi>word</hi> came to the <hi>voyce, (The word of God came to Iohn in the wildernesse, and
he came into all the Countrey preaching the Baptisme of repentance.)</hi> To that we must
come, to <hi>practise.</hi> For, in this respect, an <hi>Vniversity</hi> is but a <hi>wildernesse,</hi> though we
gather our learning there, our private meditation is but a wildernesse, though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
God there, nay our <hi>being here,</hi> is but a wildernesse, though we serve God here,
if our service end so, if we do not proceed to <hi>action,</hi> and glorifie God in the publique.
And therefore <hi>Citaris huc,</hi> thou art cited <hi>hither,</hi> here thou must be, and <hi>Citaris hîc,</hi>
thou art cited <hi>here,</hi> to lay hold upon that grace which God offers in his Ordinance;
and <hi>Citaris hinc,</hi> thou art cited <hi>from hence,</hi> to embrace a <hi>calling</hi> in the world. He that
undertakes no course, no <hi>vocation,</hi> he is no part, no member, no limbe of the body of
this world; no eye, to give light to others; no eare to receive profit by others. If he
think it enough to be excrementall <hi>nayles,</hi> to scratch and gripe others by his lazy usury,
and extortion, or excrementall <hi>hayre,</hi> made onely for ornament, or delight of others,
by his <hi>wit,</hi> or <hi>mirth,</hi> or delightfull conversation, these men have not yet felt this third
citation, by which they are called to glorifie God, and so to <hi>witnesse</hi> for him, in such
publique actions, as Gods cause for the present requires, and comports with their
calling.</p>
                     <p>And then <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had a fourth citation<note place="margin">4 Citation.</note> to bear witnesse for Christ, by laying
down his life for the Truth; and this was that that made him a witnesse, in the highest
sense, a <hi>Martyr.</hi> God hath not served this citation upon us, nor doth he threaten us,
with any approches towards it, in the feare of <hi>persecution</hi> for religion. But remember
that <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> Martyrdome, was not for the <hi>fundamentall rock,</hi> the body of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion,</hi> but for a <hi>morall truth,</hi> for matter of <hi>manners.</hi> A man may be bound to
suffer much, for a lesse matter then the utter overthrow, of the whole frame and body
of religion. But leaving this consideration, for what causes a man is bound to lay
downe his life, consider we now, but this, that a man lays downe his life for Christ, and
beares witnesse of him, even in death, when he prefers Christ before this world, when
he <hi>desires to be dissolved, and be with him,</hi> and obeyes cheerefully that citation, by the
hand of death, whensoever it comes; and that citation must certainly be served upon
you all; whether this night in your beds, or this houre, at the doore, no man knowes.
You who were cited <hi>hither,</hi> to <hi>heare,</hi> and cited <hi>here,</hi> to <hi>consider,</hi> and cited <hi>hence,</hi> to
<hi>worke</hi> in a <hi>calling</hi> in the world, must be cited <hi>from thence</hi> too, from the face to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of the earth, from treading upon other mens, to a lying downe in your owne
graves. And yet that is not your last citation, there is fifth.</p>
                     <p>In the grave, <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> does, and we must attend a <hi>fifth citation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">5 Citation.</note> from the grave
to a <hi>Iudgement.</hi> The first citation hither to Church, was served by <hi>Example</hi> of other
men, you saw them come, and came. The second citation, here, in the Church, was
served by the <hi>Preacher,</hi> you heard him and beleeved. The third, from hence, is served
by <hi>the law,</hi> and by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> they binde you to embrace a <hi>profession,</hi> and a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and you do so. The fourth, which is from thence, from this, to the next world,
is served by <hi>nature</hi> in <hi>death,</hi> he touches you, and you sinke. This <hi>fifth to Iudgement</hi>
shall be by <hi>an Angell,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 16.</note> by an Archangell, by the Lord himself, <hi>The Lord himself shall
descend from heaven with a shout, with the voyce of the Archangell, and with the Trump
of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise.</hi> This citation is not served by a <hi>bell,</hi> that tolls
to bring you hither; not by a <hi>man</hi> that speaks to instruct you here; not by a <hi>law,</hi> that
compells you to live orderly in the world; not by a <hi>bell,</hi> that rings out to lay thee in
thy grave; but by the <hi>great shout of the Lord descending</hi> from heaven, <hi>with the voyce of
the Archangel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Chro. 9. 27.</note> and <hi>with the Trump of God, to raise the dead in Christ.</hi> It is not the <hi>Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perire

That God opens our mouth, the mouth of the Preacher, to worke upon you,

him. I shall rise from the dead, from the darke station, from the prostration, from
the prosternation of death, and never misse the sunne, which shall then be put out, for
I shall see the Sonne of God, the Sunne of glory, and shine my self, as that sunne
shines. I shall rise from the grave, and never misse this City, which shall be no where,

never end,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 9.</note> and be united to the <hi>Antient of dayes,</hi> to God himselfe, who had <hi>no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
never began. There I shall beare witnesse for Christ, in ascribing the salvation of
the whole world, <hi>to him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb,</hi> and Christ shall bear
witnesse for me, in ascribing his righteousnesse unto me, and in delivering me into his
Fathers hands, with the same tendernesse, as he delivered up his owne soule, and in
making me, who am a greater sinner, then they who crucified him on earth for me, as
innocent, and as righteous as his glorious selfe, in the Kingdome of heaven. And these
occasions of advancing your devotion, and edification, from these two branches of
this part, first, the <hi>fitnesse</hi> of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to be sent, and then his <hi>actuall sending,</hi> by
so divers callings, and <hi>citations</hi> in him, appliable, as you have seene, to us. More will
be ministred, in due time, out of the last part, and the two branches of that; first, <hi>why</hi>
this light required <hi>any</hi> witnesse, and then, <hi>what</hi> witnesse
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> gave to this light.
But those, because they leade us not to the celebration of any particular <hi>Festivall,</hi> (as
these two former parts have done, to <hi>Christmas</hi> and <hi>Midsommer</hi>) I may have leave to
present to you at any other time. At this time let us onely beg of God a blessing upon
this that hath been said &amp;c.</p>

in that <hi>darke</hi> time of the yeer told you <hi>who,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> was this <hi>light</hi>

upon <hi>his owne</hi> day, insisted upon the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>Iohn Baptist, who,</hi>

And the third consideration, which (as I told you then) was not tied nor affected to any
particular <hi>Festivall,</hi> you shall (by Gods grace) have now, the <hi>office</hi> of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> his
<hi>testimony;</hi> and in that, these two parts; first, <hi>a problematicall part, why so</hi> evident a thing

every thing else to us, and it selfe too, if all be well disposed, yet, in the <hi>fifth</hi> verse

course of life, that heare, and beleeve, but practise not, <hi>sol lucernas quaerit,</hi> this light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
testimony. There may be light then and we not know it, because we are <hi>asleep;</hi>
and asleep so,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 24.</note> as <hi>Iairus daughter</hi> was, of whom Christ says, <hi>the maid is not dead but
asleep.</hi> The maide was absolutely dead; but because he meant forthwith to raise her,
he calls it a sleep. The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in their ignorance, are <hi>dead;</hi> we, in our <hi>corrupt nature,</hi>
dead, as dead as they, we cannot heare the voice, we cannot see the light; without Gods
<hi>subsequent grace,</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> can no more proceed, then the <hi>Gentile</hi> can beginne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his <hi>preventing grace.</hi> But, because, amongst us, he hath established the <hi>Gospell,</hi>
and in the ministery and dispensation thereof, ordinary meanes for the conveyance of
his farther grace, we noware but <hi>asleep</hi> and may wake. A sodain <hi>light</hi> brought into a room
doth awaken some men; but yet a <hi>noise</hi> does it better, and a <hi>shaking,</hi> and a pinching. The exalting of <hi>naturall faculties,</hi> and good <hi>morall life, inward inspirations,</hi> and private
<hi>meditations, conferences, reading,</hi> and the life, doe awaken some; but the testimony of
the messenger of God, the <hi>preacher,</hi> crying according to Gods ordinance, shaking the
soule, troubling the conscience, and pinching the bowells, by denouncing of Gods
Judgements, these beare witnesse of the light, when otherwise men would sleep it out;
and so <hi>propter non intelligentes,</hi> for those that lye in the suddes of <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>cannot,</hi> or

and <hi>covet darknesse,</hi> and grow weary of instruction, and angry at increpation; And,
as the <hi>eye of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 24. 15.</note> so, the eare of this fastidious and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
man, longeth for the end of the Sermon, or the end of that point in the Sermon,
which is a thorne to his conscience; But as, if a man wink in a cleare day, he shall for
all that discerne light thorough his eylids, but not light enough to keep him from
stumbling: so the most perverse man that is, either in <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>manners,</hi> that winkes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the light of <hi>nature,</hi> or light of the <hi>law,</hi> or light of <hi>grace</hi> exhibited in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, the most determined <hi>Atheist</hi> that is, discernes through all his stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
though not light enough to rectifie him, to save him, yet enough to condemne
him, though not enough to enable him, to reade his owne name in the book of life, yet
so much, as makes him afraid to read his own story by, and to make up his
owne <hi>Audit</hi>
and account with God. And doth not this light to this man need testimony, That
as he does see, it is a light, so he might see, that there is warmth and nourishment in this
light, and so, as well see the way to God by that light, as to see by it, that there is a
God; and, this he may, if he doe not sleep nor winke; that is, not forbeare comming
hither, nor resist the grace of God, always offred here, when he is here. <hi>Propter incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulos,</hi>

sees as little with <hi>staring,</hi> as the other with <hi>winking.</hi> His eye hath seen, but it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
nothing to the <hi>common sense.</hi> We may pore upon <hi>books,</hi> stare upon <hi>preachers,</hi> yet

serve them to proceed to practise, <hi>sol lucernas,</hi> this light requires testimony.</p>
                     <p>Yet, if we be neither <hi>dead,</hi> nor <hi>asleep,</hi> nor <hi>winke,</hi> nor <hi>looke negligently,</hi> but doe come
to some degrees of holinesse in <hi>practise</hi> for a time,<note place="margin">Propter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsos.</note> yet if at any time, we put our
selves in such a position and distance from this light, as that we suffer dark thick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to interpose, and eclipse it, that is, <hi>sadnesse</hi> and <hi>dejection</hi> of spirit, for worldly losses;
nay, if we admit inordinate <hi>sadnesse</hi> for sinne it selfe, to eclipse this light of comfort
from us, or if we suffer such other lights, as by the corrupt estimation of the world,
have a greater splendour to come in; (As the light of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> the
light of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> of popular <hi>Applause</hi> and <hi>Acclamation</hi>) so that this light which
we speake of, (the light of former <hi>Grace</hi>) be darkned by the accesse of other lights,
worldly lights, then also you shall finde that you need more and more Testimony of
this light. God is light in the Creature, in nature; yet the <hi>naturall Man</hi> stumbles and
falls, and lies in that ignorance, Christ bears witnesse of this light, in establishing a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shian
Church;</hi> yet many Christians fall into <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> and lie and die in
it. The Holy Ghost hath born further witnesse of this light, and, (if we may take so
low a Metaphore in so high a Mystery) hath <hi>snuffed</hi> this candle, mended this light, in
the <hi>Reformation</hi> of Religion; and yet there is a damp, or a cloud of <hi>uncharitablenesse,</hi> of
<hi>neglecting,</hi> of <hi>defaming</hi> one another; we deprave even the <hi>fiery,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 2. 3.</note> the <hi>claven tongues</hi> of the
Holy Ghost: Our tongues are <hi>fiery</hi> onely to the consuming of another, and they are <hi>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
onely in speaking things contrary to one another. So that still there need more wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
more testimonies of this light. God the Father is <hi>Pater Luminum</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> of
all Lights; God the <hi>Sonne,</hi> is <hi>Lumen de lumine,</hi> Light of light, of the Father; God the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is <hi>Lumen de luminibus,</hi> Light of lights, proceeding both from the Father,
and the Sonne; and this light the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> kindles more lights in the Church, and
drops a coale from the Altar upon every lamp, he lets fall beams of his Spirit upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man, that comes in the name of God, into this place; and he sends you one man
to day, which beareth witnesse of this light <hi>ad ignaros,</hi> that bends his preaching to
the convincing of the <hi>naturall man,</hi> the ignorant soul, and works upon him. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
another day, that bears witnesse <hi>ad incredulos,</hi> that fixeth the promises of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,</hi>
and the <hi>merits</hi> of Christ Jesus, upon that startling and timorous soul, upon that
jealous and suspicious soul, that cannot beleeve that those promises, or those merits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to him, and so bends all the power of his Sermon to the binding up of such bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hearts, and faint beleevers. He sendeth another to bear witnesse <hi>ad infirmos,</hi> to them
who though they have shaked off their sicknesse, yet are too weake, to walke, to them,
who though they doe beleeve, are intercepted by tentations from preaching, and his
Sermon reduces them from their ill manners, who thinke it enough to come, to hear,
to beleeve. And then he sendeth another <hi>ad Relapsos,</hi> to bear witnesse of this light to
them who have relapsed into former sinnes, that the merits of Christ are inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the mercies of God in him indefatigable: As God cannot be deceived with a
false repentance, so he cannot resist a true, nor be weary of multiplying his mercies in
that case. And therefore thinke not that thou hast heard witnesses enow of this light,
<hi>Sermons enow,</hi> if thou have heard all the points preached upon, which concerne thy
salvation. But because <hi>new Clouds</hi> of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> of <hi>Incredulitie,</hi> of <hi>Infirmitie,</hi> of <hi>Relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>
rise every day and call this light in question, and may make thee doubt whether
thou have it or no, every day, (that is, as often as thou canst) heare more and more wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of this light; and bless that God, who for thy sake, would submit himselfe to
these <hi>Testimonia ab homine,</hi> these Testimonies from men, and being all light himselfe,
and having so many other Testimonies, would yet require the Testimony of <hi>Man,</hi> of
<hi>Iohn;</hi> which is our other branch of this first part.</p>
                     <p>Christ,<note place="margin">A seipso.</note> (who is still the light of our Text, <hi>That light,</hi> the <hi>essentiall light</hi>) had testimony
enough without <hi>Iohn.</hi> First, he bore witness <hi>of himselfe.</hi> And though he say of himself,
<hi>(If I beare witnesse of my self, my witnesse is not true)</hi> yet that he might say either out of a
<hi>legall</hi> and <hi>proverbiall</hi> opinion of theirs,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 31.</note> that ordinarily they thought, That a witness
testifying for himself, was not to be beleeved, whatsoever he said; Or, <hi>as Man,</hi>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:93359:177"/>
(which they then took him to be) he might speake it of <hi>himselfe</hi> out of his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that, in <hi>Iudicature</hi> it is a good rule, that a man should not be beleeved in his own
case. But, after this, and after he had done enough to make them see, that he was more
then man,<note place="margin">8. 13.</note> by multiplying of <hi>miracles,</hi> then he said, <hi>though I beare witnesse of my selfe, my
witnesse is true.</hi> So the onely infallibility and unreproachable evidence of our <hi>election,</hi>
is in the <hi>inward word of God,</hi> when <hi>his Spirit beares witnesse with our Spirit, that we are the
Sonnes of God;</hi> for, if the Spirit, (the Spirit of <hi>truth)</hi> say he is in us, he is in us. But yet
the Spirit of God is content to submit himselfe to an ordinary triall, to be tried by God
and the Countrey; he allowes us to <hi>doubt,</hi> and to be <hi>afraid</hi> of our <hi>regeneration,</hi> except
we have the testimony of <hi>sanctification.</hi> Christ bound them not to <hi>his own</hi> testimony,
till it had the seale of <hi>workes,</hi> of <hi>miracles;</hi> nor must we build upon any testimony in our
selves, till other men, that see our life, testifie for us to the world.</p>
                     <p>He had also the testimony of <hi>his Father,</hi> (the <hi>Father himselfe which hath sent me,
beareth witnesse of me.)</hi> But where should they see the Father,<note place="margin">A Patre.</note> or heare the Father speak?
That was all which <hi>Philip</hi> asked at his hands,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 37. 14. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>(Lord show us the Father, and it sufficeth
us.)</hi> He had the testimony of an <hi>Angel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ab Angelo.</note> who came to the shepheards so, as no where in
all the Scriptures, there is such an <hi>Apparition</hi> expressed, (the <hi>Angel of the Lord came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 8.</note> and the glory of the Lord shone round about them)</hi> but where might a man <hi>talke</hi>
with this Angel, and know more of him? As Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> says of <hi>Moses, Scripsit &amp;
abiit,</hi> he hath written a little of the Creation, and he is gone; <hi>Si hîc esset, tenerem &amp;
rogarem,</hi> if <hi>Moses</hi> were here, says he, I would hold him fast, till I had got him to give
me an exposition of that which he writ. For, beloved, we must have such witnesses, as
we may consult farther with.<note place="margin">A stella.</note> I can see no more by an <hi>Angel,</hi> then by <hi>lightning.</hi> A
<hi>star</hi> testified of him, at his birth. But what was that star? was it any of those stars that
remaine <hi>yet? Gregory Nissen</hi> thinkes it <hi>was,</hi> and that it onely then changed the naturall
course, and motion for that service. But almost all the other Fathers thinke, that it was
a light but <hi>then created,</hi> and that it had onely the <hi>forme of a star,</hi> and no more; and some
few, that it was the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> in that forme. And, if it were one of the fixed <hi>stars,</hi> and
remaine <hi>yet,</hi> yet it is not now in that office, it testifies nothing of Christ <hi>now.</hi> The wise
men of the East testified of him,<note place="margin">A Magis.</note> too; But <hi>what</hi> were they, or <hi>who,</hi> or <hi>how many,</hi> or <hi>from
whence,</hi> were they; for, all these circumstances have put Antiquity it selfe into more
distractions,<note place="margin">A Simeone.</note> and more earnest disputations, then <hi>circumstances</hi> should doe. <hi>Simeon</hi>
testified of him,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 25.</note> who had a revelation from the holy Ghost, that he should not <hi>see death,
till he had</hi> seen Christ.<note place="margin">Ab Anna.</note> And so did the <hi>Prophetess Anna, who served God, with fasting and
prayer,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> 
                        <hi>day and night. Omnis sexus &amp; aetas,</hi> both <hi>sexes,</hi> and all <hi>ages</hi> testified of him;
and he gives examples of all, as it was easie for him to doe. Now after all these testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
from <hi>himselfe,</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> from the <hi>Angel,</hi> from the <hi>star,</hi> from the <hi>wise
men,</hi> from <hi>Simeon,</hi> from <hi>Anna,</hi> from all, what needed the testimony of <hi>Iohn?</hi> All those
witnesses had been <hi>thirty years before Iohn</hi> was cited for a witnesse, to come from the
wildernesse and preach. And in <hi>thirty years,</hi> by reason of his obscure and retired life, in his
father <hi>Iosephs</hi> house, all those personall testimonies of Christ might be forgotten; and,
for the most part, those witnesses onely testified that he was <hi>borne,</hi> that he was come
into the world, but for all their testimony, he might have been gone out of the world
long. Before this, he might have perished in the generall flood, in that flood of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood, in which <hi>Herod</hi> drowned all the young children of that Countrey. When
therefore Christ came forth to <hi>preach,</hi> when he came to call <hi>Apostles,</hi> when he came to
settle a <hi>Church,</hi> to establish meanes for our ordinary salvation, (by which he is the
light of our text, the <hi>Essentiall light</hi> shining out in his Church, by the supernaturall light
of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>grace)</hi> then he admitted, then he required <hi>Testimonium ab homine,</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
from man. And so, for our conformity to him, in using and applying those
meanes, which convay this light to us, in the Church, we must doe so too; we must
have the seale of <hi>faith,</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but this must be in the testimony of men; still
there must be that done by us, which must make men testifie for us.</p>
                     <p>Every Christian is a state, a common-wealth to <hi>himselfe,</hi> and in him, the <hi>Scripture</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Scripturas esse.</note>
is his <hi>law,</hi> and the <hi>conscience</hi> is his <hi>Iudge.</hi> And though the Scripture be inspired from
<hi>God,</hi> and the conscience be illumined and rectified by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> immediately, yet,
both the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Conscience</hi> admit <hi>humane arguments.</hi> First, the Scriptures
doe, in all these three respects; first that there are <hi>certaine Scriptures,</hi> that are the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:93359:177"/>
revealed will of God. Secondly, that these books which we call <hi>Canonicall,</hi> are those
Scriptures. And lastly, that this and this is the true sense and meaning of such and such
a place of Scripture. First, that there is a manifestation of the will of God in certain
Scriptures, if we who have not power to infuse <hi>Faith</hi> into men, (for that is the work of
the Holy Ghost onely) but must deal upon the <hi>reason</hi> of men, and satisfie that, if we
might not proceed, <hi>per testimonia ab homine,</hi> by humane Arguments, and argue, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>thus,</hi> That if God will save man for worshipping him, and damne him for not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
him, so as he will be worshipped, certainly God hath revealed to man, how he
will be worshipped, and that in some visible, in some permanent manner in <hi>writing,</hi> and
that that writing is <hi>Scripture,</hi> if we had not these testimonies, these necessary consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
derived even from the <hi>naturall reason</hi> of man to convince men, how should we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them, since our way is not to create <hi>Faith,</hi> but to satisfie <hi>reason?</hi> And therefore
let us rest in this testimony of men, that all <hi>Christian</hi> men, nay <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> too,
have ever beleeved, that there are certain Scriptures, which are the revealed will of
God, and that God hath manifested to us, in those Scriptures, all that he requires at
our hands for <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners.</hi> Now, which are those Scriptures?</p>
                     <p>As for the whole body intirely together,<note place="margin">Hos eos li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros esse.</note> so for the particular limbs and members of
this body, the <hi>severall books</hi> of the Bible, we must accept <hi>testimonium ab homine,</hi> humane
Arguments, and the testimony of men. At first, the Jewes were the Depositaries of
Gods Oracles; and therefore the first Christians were to aske the Jewes, <hi>which</hi> books
were those Scriptures. Since the Church of God is the <hi>Master</hi> of those <hi>Rolls,</hi> no doubt
but the <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>Testimonium à Deo,</hi> The Spirit of God to direct her, in declaring
<hi>what Books</hi> make up the Scripture; but yet even the <hi>Church,</hi> which is to deal upon
men, proceedeth also <hi>per testimonium ab homine,</hi> by humane Arguments, such as may
work upon the <hi>reason</hi> of man, in declaring the Scriptures of God. For the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
there is no question made of any Book, but in <hi>Conventicles</hi> of <hi>Anabaptists;</hi> and for
the <hi>Old,</hi> it is testimony enough that we receive all that the Jews received. This is but the
testimony of man, but such as prevails upon every man. It is somewhat boldly said, (not
to permit to our selves any severer, or more bitter animadversion upon him) by a great
man in the <hi>Romam Church,</hi> that perchance the book of <hi>Enoch,</hi> which S. <hi>Iude</hi> cites in
his Epistle,<note place="margin">Melchilanus.</note> was not an <hi>Apocryphal</hi> book, but <hi>Canonicall Scripture</hi> in the time of the <hi>Iews.</hi>
As though the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> were a time-server, and would sometimes issue some things,
for present satisfaction, which he would not avow nor stand to after; as though the <hi>holy
Ghost</hi> had but a Lease for certain years, a determinable estate in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which
might expire, and he be put from his evidence; that that book might become none of
<hi>his,</hi> which was his before. We therefore, in receiving these books for <hi>Canonicall,</hi> which
we do, and in post-posing the <hi>Apochryphall,</hi> into an inferior place, have <hi>testimonium ab
homine,</hi> testimony from the People of God, who were, and are the most competent,
and unreproachable witnesses herein: and we have <hi>Testimonium ab inimico,</hi> testimony
from our adversary himself,<note place="margin">Idem ex <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Perniciosius est Ecclesiae librum recipere pro sacro, qui non est,
quàm sacrum rejicere,</hi> It is a more pernicious danger to the Church, to admit a book for
<hi>Canonicall,</hi> which is <hi>not so,</hi> then to reject one that is so. And therefore, <hi>ne turberis novitie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cajetan.</note>
(saith another great Author of theirs) Let no young student in Divinity be troubled, <hi>si

books reckned amongst the Canonical, <hi>nam ad Hiero. limam, verba Doctorum &amp; Concilio

<hi>testimonium ab homine,</hi> the testimony of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that prevailed upon S. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself.</p>
                     <p>It is so for the whole body,<note place="margin">Sensus loco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
                        <hi>The bible;</hi> it is so for all the limbs of this body, <hi>every

place,</hi> of very book thereof; for, for that, (the sense of the place) we must have <hi>testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium

not rest upon thy self, nor upon any private man. <hi>Iohn</hi> was a witnesse that had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,

derogateth from God, that makes him a false, or an impotent, or a cruell God, That
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93359:178"/>
every contradiction, and departing from the Analogy of <hi>Faith,</hi> doth derogate from
God, and divers such grounds, and such inferences, as every man confesses, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
to be naturally and necessarily consequent, these are <hi>Testimonia ab homine,</hi>
Testimonies that passe like currant money, from man to man, obvious to every man,
suspicious to none. Thus it is in the generall; but then, when it is deduced to a more
particular triall, (what is the sense of such or such a place) when Christ saith, <hi>Scrutamini
Scripturas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 5.39.</note> search the Scriptures, <hi>non mittit ad simplicem lectionem, sed ad scrutationem
exquisitam,</hi> It is not a bare <hi>reading,</hi> but a diligent <hi>searching,</hi> that is enjoyned us. Now
they that will search, must have a warrant to search; they upon whom thou must rely
for the sense of the Scriptures, must be sent of God by his Church. Thou art robbed
of all, devested of all, if the Scriptures be taken from thee; Thou hast no where to
search; blesse God therefore, that hath kept thee in possession of that sacred Treasure,
the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and then, if any part of that treasure ly out of thy reach, or ly in the
dark, so as that thou understandest not the place, <hi>search,</hi> that is, apply thy self to them
that have warrant to <hi>search,</hi> and thou shalt lack no light necessary for thee. Either thou
shalt understand that place, or the not understanding of it shall not be imputed to
thee, nor thy salvation hindred by that Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>It is but to a woman that Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> 
                        <hi>Ama Scripturas, &amp; amabit te Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>

they are dark;<note place="margin">August.</note> purposely left so by the Holy Ghost, <hi>ne semel lectas fastidiremus,</hi> lest we

by <hi>any other man;</hi> no not by them, who have warrant to search, Commission from God,
by their calling, to interpret the Scriptures, not every where by the <hi>whole Church,</hi> God
hath reserved the <hi>understanding of some places of Scripture, till the time come for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of those Prophecies;</hi> as many places of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were not understood, till
Christ came, in whom they were fulfilled. If therefore thou wilt needs know, whether,
when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> took his information of the behaviour of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 11.</note> from those
of <hi>Chloe,</hi> whether this <hi>Chloe,</hi> were a <hi>woman,</hi> or a <hi>place,</hi> the Fathers cannot satisfie
thee, the latter Writers cannot satisfie thee, there is not <hi>Testimonium ab homine,</hi> no
such humane Arguments as can determine thee, or give thee an Acquittance; the greatest
pillars whom God hath raised in his Church, cannot give a satisfaction to thy curiosity.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93359:178"/>
But if the Doctrine of the place will satisfie thee, (which Doctrine is, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not
give credit to light rumors against the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> nor to clandestine whisperers, but
tells them who accused them, and yet, as well as he loved them, he did not stop his
eares against competent witnesses, (for he tells them, they stood accused, and by
whom) then thou maist <hi>bore this pearle</hi> thorough, and make it fit for thy use, and
wearing, in knowing so much of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> purpose therein, as concerns thy edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
though thou never know,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> whether <hi>Chloe</hi> were a <hi>Woman,</hi> or a <hi>Place. Tantum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati

much harme, as a false translation, a false Commentary, as a false copy; And therefore,
forbearing to make any interpretation at all, upon dark places of Scripture, (especially
those, whose understanding depends upon the future fulfilling of prophecies) in places that
are clear, &amp; evident thou maist be thine own interpreter; In places that are more obscure,
goe to those men, whom God hath set over thee, and either they shall give thee
that sense of the place, which shall satisfie thee, by having the sense thereof, or that
must satisfie you, that there is enough for your salvation, though that remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted.
And let this <hi>Testimonium ab homine,</hi> this testimony of man establish
thee for the Scripture, that there is a Scripture, a certaine book, that is the word;
and the revealed will of God; That these books which we receive for <hi>Canonicall,</hi>
make up that book; And then, that this and this is the true sense of every place,
which the holy Ghost hath opened to the present understanding of his Church.</p>
                     <p>We said before,<note place="margin">Conscientia.</note> that a Christian being a Common-wealth to himselfe, the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
was his <hi>law,</hi> (and for that law, that Scripture, he was to have <hi>Testimonium ab
homine,</hi> the testimony of man) And then, his <hi>Conscience</hi> is his <hi>Iudge,</hi> and for that
he is to have the same testimony too. Thou must not rest upon the testimony and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of thine owne conscience;<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> 
                        <hi>Nec illud de trivio paratum habere,</hi> thou must not
rest in that vulgar saying, <hi>sufficit mihi &amp;c.</hi> As long as mine owne Conscience stands
right, I care not what all the world say. Thou must care what the world says, and
study to have the approbation and testimony of good men. Every man is enough
defamed in the generall depravation of our whole <hi>nature<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Adam</hi> hath cast an infamy
upon us all: And when a man is defamed, it is not enough that he purge himselfe by
<hi>oath,</hi> but he must have <hi>compurgators</hi> too: other men must sweare, that they beleeve
he sweares a truth. Thine owne conscience is not enough, but thou must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

world, and have <hi>Testimonium ab homine,</hi> good men must thinke thee good. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that admits no search from others, is <hi>cauterizata,</hi> burnt <hi>with a hot Iron;</hi> not
<hi>cured,</hi> but <hi>seared;</hi> not at peace, but stupefied. And when in the verse immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our text, it is said, <hi>That Iohn came to beare witnesse of that light,</hi> it is added, that
<hi>through him,</hi> (that is, through that man, through <hi>Iohn,</hi> not through it, through
that light) that <hi>through him all men beleeve.</hi> For though it be efficiently the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the light it selfe, (that is, Christ himselfe) that all men beleeve yet the holy Ghost
directs us to that that is nearest us, to this testimony of man, that instrumentally, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterially
works this beliefe in men. If then for thy <hi>faith,</hi> thou must have <hi>testimonium
ab homine,</hi> the testimony of men, and maist not beleeve as no man but thy selfe beleeves,
much more for thy <hi>manners,</hi> and conversation. Thinke it not enough to satisfie thy self,
but satisfie <hi>good men;</hi> nay <hi>weake men;</hi> nay <hi>malicious men:</hi> till it come so far, as that for
the desire of satisfying man, thou leave God unsatisfied, endeavour to satisfie all. God
must waigh down all; thy selfe and others; but as long as thy selfe onely art in one
balance, and other men in the other, let this preponderate; let the opinion of other men,
waigh downe thine owne opinion of thy selfe. 'Tis true, (but many men flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
too far, with this truth) that it is a sin, to do any thing in <hi>Conscientiâ dubiâ,</hi> when
a man doubts whether he may doe it, or no, and in <hi>Conscientiâ scrupulosâ,</hi> when the
conscience hath received any single scruple, or suspicion to the contrary, and so too in
<hi>conscientiâ opinante,</hi> in a conscience that hath conceived, but an <hi>opinion,</hi> (which is
far from a debated, and deliberate determination) yea in <hi>conscientiâ errante,</hi> though the
conscience be in an error, yet it is sin to do aright against the conscience; but then, as it is
a sin, to do against the conscience labouring under any of these infirmities, so is it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sin, not to labour to recover the conscience, and devest it of those scruples, by <hi>their</hi>
advise, whom God hath indued with knowledg, and power, for that purpose. For, (as it
is <hi>in civill Iudicature)</hi> God refers causes to <hi>them,</hi> and according to their <hi>reports,</hi> Gods
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:93359:179"/>
ordinary way is to decree the cause, to <hi>loose</hi> where they loose, to <hi>binde</hi> where they binde.
Their imperfections, or their corruptions God knowes how to punish in them; but
thou shalt have the recompense of thy humility and thy obedience to his ordinance,
in hearkning to <hi>them,</hi> whom he hath set over thee, for the rectifying of thy conscience.
Neither is this to erect a <hi>parochiall popacy,</hi> to make every minister a <hi>Pope</hi> in his own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
or to re-enthrall you to a necessity of communicating all your sinnes, or all your
doubtfull actions to <hi>him;</hi> God forbid. God of his goodnesse hath delivered us, from
that bondage, and butchery of the conscience, which our Fathers suffered from <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>Anathema,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 22.</note> and <hi>Anathema Maran-atha,</hi> cursed be he till the Lord comes, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when the Lord comes, that should go about to bring us in a relapse, in an <hi>eddy,</hi> in a
whirlepoole, into that disconsolate estate, or into any of the pestilent errors of that
Church. But since you think it no diminution to you, to consult with a <hi>Physician</hi> for
the state of your body, or with a <hi>Lawyer</hi> for your Lands, since you are not borne, nor
grown good Physicians, and good Lawyers, why should you think your selves born, or
grown so good <hi>Divines,</hi> that you need no counsell, in doubtfull cases, from other men?
And therefore, as for the <hi>Law</hi> that governs us, that is, the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we go the way that
Christ did, to receive the testimony of man, both for the <hi>body,</hi> that Scriptures there are,
and for the limbs of that body, that these books make up those Scriptures, and for the
soule of this body, that this is the sense of the holy Ghost in that place; so, for our <hi>Iudge,</hi>
which is the <hi>conscience,</hi> let that be directed before hand, by their advise whom God hath
set over us, and setled, and quieted in us, by their testimony, who are the witnesses of
our conversation. And so we have done with our Problematicall part; we have asked
and answered both these questions, Why this light requires <hi>any</hi> testimony, (and that is
because exhalations, and damps, and vapours arise, first from our <hi>ignorance,</hi> then from
our <hi>incredulity,</hi> after from our <hi>negligence</hi> in <hi>practising,</hi> and lastly, from our <hi>slipperinesse
in relapsing,</hi> and therefore we need more and more attestations, and remembrances of
this light) and the other question, Why after so many <hi>other</hi> testimonies, (from <hi>himself,</hi>
from his <hi>Father,</hi> from the <hi>Angell,</hi> from the <hi>Star,</hi> from the <hi>Magi,</hi> from <hi>Simeon,</hi> from
<hi>Anna,</hi> from many, many, very many more) he required this testimony of <hi>Iohn;</hi> and
that is, because all those other witnesses had testified <hi>long before,</hi> and because <hi>God</hi> in all
matters belonging to <hi>Religion</hi> here, or to <hi>salvation</hi> hereafter, refers us to <hi>man,</hi> but to
man sent, and ordained by God, for our direction, that we may do well; and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of <hi>good men,</hi> that we have done well. And so we passe to our <hi>dogmaticall</hi> part,
<hi>what</hi> his testimony was; what <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and his successors in preaching, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ways of Christ, are sent to do; he was sent <hi>to beare witnesse of that light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Princes which send Ambassadors,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> use to give them <hi>a Commission,</hi> containing the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
scope of the businesse committed to them, and then <hi>Instructions,</hi> for the fittest
way to bring that businesse to effect. And upon due contemplation of both these, (his
<hi>Commission,</hi> and his <hi>Instructions)</hi> arises the use of the Ambassadors judgement and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
in making his Commission, and his Instructions, (which do not always agree in
all points, but are often various, and perplext) serve most advantagiously towards the
ends of his negotiation. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had both; therefore they minister three conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
unto us; first, his <hi>Commission,</hi> what <hi>that</hi> was; and then his <hi>Instructions,</hi> what
<hi>they</hi> were; and lastly, the <hi>execution,</hi> how he proceeded therein.</p>
                     <p>His Commission was drawn up,<note place="margin">Commissio.</note> and written in <hi>Esa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> and recorded and entred into
Gods Rolls by the Evangelists.<note place="margin">Esa. 40. 3.</note> It was, <hi>To prepare the way of the Lord,</hi> to make <hi>streight
his paths,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mark 1. 2.</note> that therefore <hi>every valley should be exalted, every mountaine made law;</hi> and
all this he was to <hi>cry</hi> out, to make them inexcusable, who contemne the outward
Ministery, and relie upon private inspirations. This Commission lasts during
Gods pleasure; and Gods pleasure is, that it should last to the end of the world;
Therefore are <hi>we</hi> also joyned in Commission with <hi>Iohn,</hi> and we <hi>cry out</hi> still to you
to all those purposes.</p>
                     <p>First, that you <hi>prepare the way of the Lord.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Praeparate viam.</note> But when we bid you do so, we do not
meane, that this preparing or pre-disposing of your selves, is <hi>in your selves,</hi> that you can
prevent Gods <hi>preventing grace,</hi> or mellow, or supple, or fit your selves for the entrance
of that grace, by any <hi>naturall faculty</hi> in your selves. When we speak of a <hi>co-operation,</hi> a
joint working with the grace of God, or of a <hi>post-operation,</hi> an after working upon the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a former grace, this <hi>co-operation,</hi> &amp; this <hi>post-operation</hi> must be mollified with a good
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93359:179"/>
concurrent cause with that grace. So there is a good sense of <hi>co-operation,</hi> and <hi>post-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
but <hi>praeoperation,</hi> that we should work, <hi>before</hi> God work upon us, can admit no good
interpretation. I could as soon beleeve that I had a being before <hi>God</hi> was, as that I
had a <hi>will</hi> to good, before God moved it. But then, God having made his way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, by his <hi>preventing grace, prepare that way,</hi> not <hi>your</hi> way, but <hi>his</hi> way, (sayes
our Commission) that is, that way that he hath made in you, prepare that by forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and avoiding to cast new hinderances in that way. In <hi>sadnesse</hi> and <hi>dejections</hi> of
spirit, seek not your comfort in <hi>drinke,</hi> in <hi>musique,</hi> in <hi>comedies,</hi> in <hi>conversation;</hi> for,
this is but a preparing a way of your owne. To prepare the <hi>Lords way,</hi> is to look, and
consider, what way the Lord hath taken, in the like cases, in the like distresses with
other servants of his, and to prepare that way in thy self, and to assure thy selfe, that
God hath but practised upon <hi>others,</hi> that he might be perfect when he comes to <hi>thee,</hi>
and that he intends to thee, in these thy tribulations, all that he hath promised to all,
all that he hath already performed to any one. Prepare <hi>his way;</hi> apply that way, in
which he hath gone <hi>to others,</hi> to thy self.</p>
                     <p>And then,<note place="margin">Rectas facite semitas Dei. <hi>Tertull.</hi>
                        </note> by our Commission we cry out to you, <hi>to make streight his paths.</hi> In which
we do not require, that you should absolutely rectifie all the deformities and crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which that <hi>Tortuositas Serpentis,</hi> the winding of the old Serpent hath brought
you to; for, now the streame of our corrupt nature, is accustomed to that crooked
channell, and we cannot divert that, we cannot come to an absolute directnesse, and
streightnesse, and profession in this life; and, in this place, the holy Ghost speaks but of <hi>a
way,</hi> a path; not of <hi>our rest</hi> in the end, but of our labour in the way. Our Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then is not to those <hi>sinlesse</hi> men, that think they have nothing for God to <hi>forgive;</hi>
But, when we bid you make streight <hi>his paths,</hi> (as before we directed you, to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
what <hi>his</hi> wayes towards <hi>others</hi> had been) so here we intend, that you should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
which is the Lords path into you, by what way he comes oftnest into you, who
are his <hi>Temple,</hi> and do not lock that doore, do not pervert, do not crosse, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
that path. The ordinary way, even of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> for the conveying of <hi>faith,</hi>
and supernaturall graces, is (as the way of worldly knowledge is) by the <hi>senses:</hi> where
his way is by the <hi>care,</hi> by hearing his word <hi>preached;</hi> do not thou crosse that way of his,
by an inordinate delight, in hearing the eloquence of the preacher; for, so thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
the man, and not <hi>God,</hi> and goest <hi>thy way,</hi> and not <hi>his.</hi> God hath divers wayes into
divers men; into some he comes at noone, in the sunshine of prosperity; to some in
the <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>heavy</hi> clouds of adversity. Some he affects with the musick of the Church,
some with some particular Collect or Prayer; some with some passage in a Sermon,
which takes no hold of him, that stands next him. Watch the way of the Spirit of
God, into thee; that way which he makes his path, in which he comes oftnest to thee,
and by which thou findest thy self most affected, and best disposed towards him, and
pervert not that path, foule not that way. <hi>Make streight his paths,</hi> that is, keepe them
<hi>streight;</hi> and when thou observest, which is his path in thee, (by what means especially
he workes upon thee) meet him in that path, embrace him in those meanes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bring a facile, a fusil, a ductile, a tractable soule, to the offers <hi>of his grace,</hi>
in his way.</p>
                     <p>Our Commission reaches to the exalting of your <hi>valleys,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Omnis Vallis exaltetur.</note> 
                        <hi>Let every valley be exalted;</hi>
In which, we bid you not to raise your selves in this world, to such a <hi>spirituall heighth,</hi> as
to have no regard to this world, to your <hi>bodies,</hi> to your <hi>fortunes,</hi> to your <hi>families.</hi> Man
is not all soule, but a body too; and, as God hath married them together in thee, so
hath he commanded them mutuall duties towards one another; and God allowes us
large uses of <hi>temporall blessings,</hi> and of recreations too. To <hi>exalt valleyes,</hi> is not to
draw up flesh, to the heighth of spirit; that cannot be, that should not be done. But it
is to draw you so much towards it, as to consider (and consider with an application)
that the very <hi>Law,</hi> which was but <hi>the schoolmaster</hi> to the Gospell, was given upon a
<hi>mountaine;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exo. 24. 29.</note> That <hi>Moses</hi> could not so much as see the Land of promise, till he was brought

                           </gap>
                        </note> even that <hi>humiliation,</hi> an <hi>exaltation, Si exaltatus, If I be exalted, lifted up,</hi> sayes
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:93359:180"/>
Christ <hi>signifying what death he should die.</hi> Now, if our depressions, our afflictions be
exaltations, (so they were to Christ, so they are to every good Christian) how far
doth God allow us, an <hi>exalting of our vallies,</hi> in a considering with a spirituall bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the heighth and dignity of <hi>mankind,</hi> and to what glory God hath created us.
Certainly man may avoid as many sinnes, by this <hi>exalting his vallies,</hi> this considering
the heighth and dignity of his nature, as by the humblest meditations in the world.
For,<note place="margin">20. 8. Greg.</note> upon those words of <hi>Iob, Manus tuae fecerunt me,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> says, <hi>Misericordiae
judicis, dignitatem suae conditionis opponit; Iob</hi> presents the dignity of his creation, by
the hand of God, as an inducement why God should regard him; It is not his valley,
but his mountaines, that he brings into Gods sight; not that dust which God took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hands, when he made him, but that person which the hands of God had made of
that dust. Man is an abridgement of all the world; and as some <hi>Abridgements</hi> are
greater, then some other authors, so is one man of more dignity, then all the earth.
And therefore <hi>exalt thy vallies,</hi> raise thy selfe above the pleasures that this earth can
promise. And above the sorrowes, it can threaten too. A painter can hardly diminish
or contract an Elephant into so little a forme, but that that Elephant, when it is at the
least, will still be greater then an Ant at the life, and the greatest. Sinne hath dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
man shrowdly, and brought him into a narrower compasse; but yet, his <hi>naturall
immortality,</hi> (his soule cannot dye) and his <hi>spirituall possibility,</hi> even to the last gaspe,
of spending that immortality in the kingdome of glory, and living for ever with God,
(for otherwise, our immortality were the heaviest part of our curse) exalt this valley,
this cold of earth, to a noble heighth. How ill husbands then of this dignity are we
by <hi>sinne,</hi> to forfeit it by submitting our selves to inferior things? either to <hi>gold,</hi> then
which every worme, (because a worme hath life, and gold hath none) is in nature,
more estimable, and more precious; Or, to that which is lesse then gold, to <hi>Beauty;</hi>
for there went neither labour, nor study, nor cost to the making of that; (the Father
cannot diet himselfe so, nor the mother so, as to be sure of a faire child) but it is a thing
that hapned by chance, wheresoever it is; and, as there are Diamonds of divers waters,
so men enthrall themselves in one clime to a black, in another to a white beauty. To
that which is lesse then <hi>gold</hi> or <hi>Beauty, voice, opinion, fame, honour,</hi> we sell our selves.
And though the good opinion of good men, by good ways, be worth our study, yet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
applause, and the voice of inconsiderate men, is too cheape a price to set our selves
at. And yet, it is hardly got too; for as a ship that lies in harbour within land, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
needs most of the points of the Compasse, to bring her forth: so if a man sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
himselfe wholly to the opinion of other men, and have not his <hi>Criterium,</hi> his
touchstone within him, he will need both <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> all the points of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
the breath of all men; because, as there are contrary Elements in every body,
so there are contrary factions in every place, and when one side cries him up, the other
will depresse him, and he shall, (if not <hi>shipwrack)</hi> lie <hi>still.</hi> But yet we doe forfeit our
dignity, for that which is lesse then all, then <hi>Gold,</hi> then <hi>Beauty,</hi> then <hi>Honour;</hi> for <hi>sinne;</hi>
sinne which is but a privation, (as darknesse is but a privation) and privations are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And therefore exalt every valley, consider the dignity of man in his <hi>nature,</hi> and
then, in the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> his assuming that nature, which gave it a new dignity, and
this will beget in thee a <hi>Pride</hi> that God loves, a valuing of thy selfe above all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of this world.</p>
                     <p>But yet exalt this valley temperately,<note place="margin">Omnis mons humiliabitur</note> consider and esteem this dignity modestly,
for our Commission goes farther, not onely to the exalting of every valley, but, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
mons humiliabitur, every mountain must be made low:</hi> which is not to bring our moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous,
and swelling affections, and passions, to that flatnesse, as that we become stupid,
and insensible. Mortification is not to kill nature, but to kill sinne. Bring therefore
your <hi>Ambition</hi> to that bent, to covet a place in the kingdome of heaven, bring your
<hi>anger,</hi> to flow into <hi>zeale,</hi> bring your <hi>love</hi> to enamour you of that face, which is <hi>fairer
then the children of men,</hi> that face, on which the Angels desire to look, Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and you have brought your mountains to that lownesse, which is intended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
here.</p>
                     <p>Now,<note place="margin">In Deserto.</note> this Commission, <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was, and we are, to publish <hi>in deserto,</hi> in the
Desert, in the wildernesse; that is, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> notes, not in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

place, a place of distraction, but in the <hi>Desert,</hi> a place of solitude, and retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:93359:180"/>
And yet this does not imply an abandoning of society, and mutuall offices, and
callings in the world, but onely informes us, that every man is to have a <hi>Desert in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
a retiring into himself, sometimes of emptying himself of worldly businesses, and
that he spend some houres in such solitudes, and lay aside, (as one would lay aside a
garment) the <hi>Lawyer,</hi> the <hi>Physician,</hi> the <hi>Merchant,</hi> or whatsoever his profession be, and
say, <hi>Domine hîe sum,</hi> Lord, I am here, I, he whom thou madest, and such as thou madest
him, not such as the world hath made me, <hi>Hî sum,</hi> I am here, not where the affairs of
the world scatter me, but <hi>here,</hi> in this retirednesse, Lord, <hi>I am here, command what thou
wilt;</hi> in this retirednesse, in this solitude, (but is not a Court, is not an Army, is not a
Fair a solitude, in respect of this association, when God and a good soul are met?) but
in this home solitude, in this home Desert, are we commanded to publish this Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as the fittest time to make impressions of all the parts thereof, <hi>Prepare the way of
the Lord, make streight his path, exalt your vallies, and bring down your mountains.</hi> And
this was <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> Commission, <hi>What</hi> to do, And then he had <hi>Instructions</hi> with
his <hi>Commission, how to doe it;</hi> which is another consideration.</p>
                     <p>His Commission was long before in <hi>Esay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Instructions.</note> so he was <hi>Legatus natus,</hi> born an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour;
his <hi>Instructions</hi> were delivered to him by God immediately, when <hi>The Word of
God came unto</hi> John,<note place="margin">Luc. 3. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>in the wildernesse.</hi> Princes oftentimes vary their Instructions from
their Commissions, and to perplex their Ambassadours, God proceeded with <hi>Iohn
Baptist,</hi> and doth with us directly. Our Commission is to conform you to him, our
Instructions are to doe that, that way, <hi>By preaching the Baptisme of Repentance,</hi> for the
<hi>remission of sinnes.</hi> It is, in a word, by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> First, he sends us not
as <hi>Spies,</hi> to lie, and learn, nor to learn and lie; but to deale apertly, manifestly, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
to preach; which as it forbids forcible and violent pressing the Conscience by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or Ecclesiasticall authority, so it forbids clandestin and whispering <hi>Conventicles;</hi> It
is a <hi>Preaching,</hi> a working by instructing and informing the understanding; it is a <hi>Preaching</hi>
a publique avowing of Gods Ordinance, in a right Calling. He gives us not our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to offer Peace and reconciliation to all, and yet he not mean it to all; He
bids us preach unto <hi>all;</hi> he bids all <hi>hearers repent,</hi> and he allowes us to set to his seales
of reconciliation, to <hi>all</hi> that come as penitents. He knowes <hi>who will,</hi> and who <hi>will not
repent,</hi> we doe not; but both he knowes, and so doe we, that <hi>all may,</hi> so far as that, if
they doe not, they finde enough in themselves to <hi>condemne</hi> themselves, and to discharge
God and us. Our Instructions are to preach, that is our way, and to preach <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
there begin you in your own bosoms: He that seeks upwards to a River, is sure
to finde that head; but he that upon every bubling spring, will think to finde a River,
by that may erre many wayes. If thou repent truely, thou art sure to come up to <hi>Gods
Decree</hi> for thy salvation; but if thou begin above at the <hi>Decree,</hi> and say, <hi>I am saved,</hi>
therefore <hi>I shall repent,</hi> thou mayest misse both. Repent, and you shall have the Seals;
the Seals are the <hi>Sacraments; Iohns</hi> was <hi>Baptisme;</hi> but to what? <hi>He baptized to the
amendment of life.</hi> This then is the chain; we <hi>preach,</hi> you <hi>repent;</hi> then we give you the
<hi>Seals,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and you <hi>plead</hi> them, that is, declare them in a holy life; for, till
that <hi>(Sanctification)</hi> come, <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> atd <hi>Seals,</hi> are ineffectuall. A
good life inanimates all. And so, having done with his Commission, <hi>what</hi> he was to do,
and his Instructions, <hi>how</hi> he was to do it, we passe to our last branch, in this last part,
The execution of his Commission, and Instructions, what, and how he did it, what
Testimony he gave of this light.</p>
                     <p>First, he testified, <hi>se non esse,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Se non esse.</note> that <hi>he was not this light,</hi> this Christ, this Messias. And
secondly, <hi>Christum esse,</hi> that this light, this Christ, this Messias was come into the
world, there was no longer expectation: And lastly, <hi>hunc esse,</hi> that this particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom he designed and specified in the <hi>Ecce Agnus, behold the Lambe of God,</hi> was
this Light, this Christ, this Messias. He <hi>was</hi> not, One was, Christ was; In these three
consists his Testimony. First,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 20.</note> he testified that himself was not the Messias, he confessed
and denied not, and said plainly, <hi>I am not the Christ.</hi> Therefore, lest <hi>I. Baptist</hi> might be
overvalued,<note place="margin">August.</note> and their devotions fixed and determined in him, <hi>S. Augstine</hi> enlarges this
consideration, <hi>Erat Mons illustratus, non ipse Sol; Iohn Baptist</hi> was a hill, and a hill glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously

it shines, to be the light it self, you shipwrack upon the top of a hill. If we rest in the
person, or in the gifts of any man, to what heighth soever this hill be raised in opinion,
or in the Church, still we mistake; <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> men of the greatest endowments, and
goodnesse too, are but instruments, they are not the workman himself. And therefore
as they are most inexcusable, that put an infallibility in the breast of <hi>one man,</hi> (our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
of <hi>Rome</hi>) so do they transgresse too farre that way, that runne, and pant, and
thrust after <hi>strange preachers,</hi> and leave their owne <hi>Church</hi> deserted, and their owne
<hi>Pastour</hi> discouraged; for some one family, by the greatnesse thereof, or by the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, may induce both those inconveniences. Truly, though it may seeme bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, it may be said safely, that we were better heare some <hi>weaknesses</hi> from our owne
Pastour, then some excellencies from another; go farther, some <hi>mistakings</hi> from our
own, then some truths from another; for, all truths are not necessary; nor all mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
pernicious; but obedience to order is necessary, and all disorder pernicious. Now
what a way had <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> open to him, if he had been popularly disposed. Amongst
a people, that at that time expected their <hi>Messias,</hi> (for, all the Prophecies preceding
his comming were then fulfilled) and such a <hi>Messias</hi> as should be a <hi>Temporall King,</hi> and
had invested an opinion, that he, <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> was that Christ, what rebellions, what
earth-quakes, what inundations of people might he have drawne after him, if he would
have countenanced and cherished their error to his advantage? They would have lacked
no <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to authorize their actions. They would have found particular places of
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to have justified any act of theirs, in advancing their <hi>Messias,</hi> then expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Therein he is our patterne; not to preach <hi>our selves, but Christ Iesus;</hi> not to
preach for admiration, but for edification; not to preach to advance <hi>civill ends,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>spirituall ends;</hi> to promote all the way the peace of all <hi>Christian Kingdomes,</hi> but
to refer all principally to the Kingdome of peace, and the King of peace, the God of
heaven. He confessed, and denied not, and said plainly, <hi>I am not the Christ;</hi> That was
his Testimony; we confesse, and deny not, and say plainly, That our <hi>own parts,</hi> our
<hi>owne passions,</hi> the purpose of great persons, the purpose of any State, is not Christ;
we <hi>preach Christ Iesus, and him crucified;</hi> and whosoever preaches any other Gospell,
or any other thing for Gospell, let him be accursed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am not</hi> the man,<note place="margin">Esse Natum. Iohn 1. 26.</note> sayes <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> for, that <hi>man</hi> is <hi>God</hi> too; but yet that man,
that God, that <hi>Messias</hi> consisting of both, is come, though I be not he. <hi>There is one
amongst you, whom you know not, whose shooe-latchet I am not worthy to loose.</hi> In which, he
says all this; <hi>There is one among you;</hi> you need seek no farther; all the promises, and
Prophecies, (the <hi>Semen mulieris,</hi> That the <hi>seed of the woman should bruise the Serpents
head;</hi> the <hi>appropriation</hi> to <hi>Abraham, In semine tuo, In thy seed shall all Nations be blessed:</hi>
the fixation upon <hi>David, Donec Shiloh,</hi> till <hi>Shiloh</hi> come; <hi>Esay's Virgo concipiet, Behold a

                     <p>Is he come,<note place="margin">Hunc esse.</note> and amongst you, and do you not know him? what will make you know
him? You beleeve you need a <hi>Messias;</hi> you cannot restore your selfe. You beleeve
this <hi>Messias</hi> must come at a certaine time, specified by certaine marks; were all these
marks upon <hi>any other?</hi> or lacks there any of these in <hi>him?</hi> Do you thus magnifie <hi>me,</hi>
and neglect a person, <hi>whose shooe-latchet I am not worthy to loose. Iohn Baptist</hi> was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>more then a Prophet, The greatest of the sonnes of women:</hi> Who could be so much
greater then <hi>he,</hi> and not the <hi>Messias?</hi> we must necessarily enwrap all these three in one
another, and into one another they do easily and naturally fall: He testifies that <hi>he</hi> was
not the man, (he preaches not himself) he testifies that <hi>that</hi> man is <hi>come;</hi> (future expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
are frivolous) and he testifies, that the <hi>characters</hi> and <hi>marks</hi> of the expected
<hi>Messias,</hi> can fall upon <hi>none</hi> but <hi>this man,</hi> and therefore he delivers him over to them
with that confidence, <hi>Ecce Agnus Dei, Behold the Lambe of God,</hi> there you may see him;
and this is his Testimony.</p>
                     <p>These three,<note place="margin">Conclusio.</note> 
                        <hi>we,</hi> we to whom <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> Commission is continued, testifie too.
First, we tell you, what is <hi>not Christ;</hi> austerity of life, and outward sanctity is not <hi>hee;
Iohn Baptist</hi> had <hi>them</hi> abundantly, but yet permitted not, that they should have that

sinne, <hi>that Christ,</hi> or the way to him. We tell you, <hi>stetit in medio,</hi> he hath been amongst
you, you have heard him <hi>preached</hi> in your ears; yea yee have heard him <hi>knock</hi> at your
hearts, and for all that, we tell you that you <hi>have not known him.</hi> Which, though it be
the discomfortablest thing in the world, (not to have known Christ in those approches)
yet we tell it you somewhat to your comfort; and to your excuse,<note place="margin">I Cor. 2. 8.</note> for, <hi>had you known<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Act. 17. 30.</note> as we doe <hi>all,</hi> by our daily sinnes. And
though God have winked at these times of ignorance, (pretermitted your former <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerations)</hi>
now,<note place="margin">Luke 19. 42.</note> he commandeth all men every where to <hi>repent.</hi> And therefore,
that thou maist know, even thou, (as Christ iterates it) at least in this thy day, the
things which belong to thy Peace, we tell you who he is, and where he is; <hi>Ecce agnus
Dei, Behold the lambe of God, Here, here</hi> in this his ordinance he supplicates you, when
the Minister,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> how meane soever, prays you, in <hi>his stead, be yee reconciled to God.</hi> Here he
proclaims, and cries to you, <hi>Venite omnes, come all that are weary and heavy laden.</hi> Here
he bleeds in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> here he takes away the sinnes of the world, in deriving a
jurisdiction upon us, to binde and loose upon earth, that which he will binde and loose
in heaven. This we testifie to you; Doe you but receive this testimony. Till you hear
that voice of consummation in heaven, <hi>Venite benedicti, come yee blessed,</hi> you shall never
heare a more comfortable Gospell then this, which was preached by Christ himselfe,
the <hi>Spirit of the Lord is upon me, to preach the Gospell to the poore, to heale the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to preach deliverance to the captives, and the acceptable yeare of the Lord:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 4. 16. Esay 61. 1.</note> for, this was
not a deliverance from their brick-making in <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor from their <hi>scornes</hi> and <hi>contempts</hi>
in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but a deliverance from that unexpressible, that unconceivable bondage <hi>of
sinne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> and <hi>death,</hi> not by the hand of a <hi>Moses,</hi> but a <hi>Messias, Opt as dare qui praecipit petere,</hi>
he that commands us to aske, would faine give: <hi>Cupit largiri, qui desider at postulari,</hi>
he that desires us to pray to him, hath that ready, and a readinesse to give that, that he
bids us pray for. If the King give a <hi>generall pardon,</hi> will any man be so suspiciously tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
in his own behalfe, as to say, for all this large extent of his mercy, he meant
not <hi>me,</hi> and therefore I will sue out no pardon? If the King cast a <hi>donative,</hi> at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
will any man lie still and say, he meant none of that money to <hi>me?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 14.</note> When the

God did not hate <hi>Esau,</hi> as he was a <hi>man,</hi> but as he was a <hi>sinner.</hi> Should he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

                        <note place="margin">Mar. 2. 17.</note> Why then he should receive <hi>none,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> for we are all so; and he
came for none but such, but sinners. <hi>Perfectiorum est nihil in peccatore odiisse praeter
peccata,</hi> To hate nothing in a sinner, but his sinne, is a great degree of perfection;
God is that perfection; he hates nothing in thee but thy sinne; and that sinne he
hath taken upon himself, and sees it not in thee. Should he exclude thee because thou
art <hi>impenitent,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chrysoft.</note> because thou hast not repented? Doe it now. <hi>Peccasti, paenitere,</hi> Hast
thou sinned? repent. <hi>Millies peccasti? millies poenitere?</hi> Hast thou multiplied thy sinnes
by thousands? multiply thy penitent teares so too. Should he exclude thee, because
thou art <hi>impenitible,</hi> thou canst not repent; how knowest thou thou <hi>canst</hi> not repent?
Doest thou try, doest thon endevour, doest thou strive? why, this, this holy contention
of thine is repentance. Discredit not Gods evidence; he offers thee <hi>Testimonium ab
homine,</hi> the testimony of man, of the man of God, the Minister, that the promises of the
Gospell belong to <hi>thee.</hi> Judge not against that evidence; confesse that there is <hi>no other
name given under heaven,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> to be <hi>saved, but the name of Iesus,</hi> and that <hi>that is.</hi> And then,
when thou hast thus admitted his witnesses to <hi>thee,</hi> that his <hi>preaching</hi> hath wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, be thou his witnesse to <hi>others,</hi> by thy <hi>exemplar life,</hi> and holy conversation. In
this chapter, in the calling of the Apostles some such thing is intimated, when of those
two Disciples, which, upon <hi>Iohns</hi> testimony, followed Christ, one is named, <hi>(Andrew)</hi>
and the other is not named. No doubt,<note place="margin">verse 40.</note> but the other is also written in the book of life,
and long since enjoyes the blessed fruit of <hi>that</hi> his forwardnesse. But in the testimony
of the Gospell, written for posterity, onely <hi>Andrew</hi> is named, who sought out his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <hi>Simon,</hi> and drew <hi>him</hi> in, and so propagated the Church, and spread the Glory
of God. They who testifie their faith by <hi>works,</hi> give us the better comfort, and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the better example. It will be but Christs first question at the last day, <hi>What hast
thou done for me?</hi> If we can answer <hi>that,</hi> he will aske, <hi>What hast thou suffered for me?</hi> and
if we can answer <hi>that,</hi> he will aske, at last, <hi>Whom hast thou won to me, what soul hast thou
added to my Kingdome?</hi> Our thoughts, our words, our doings, our sufferings, if they
bring <hi>but our selves</hi> to Heaven, they are not <hi>Witnesses;</hi> our example brings <hi>others;</hi> and
that is the purpose, and the end of all we have said, <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was a witnesse to <hi>us,</hi>
we are so to <hi>you,</hi> be you so to one <hi>another.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is one of those places of Scripture, which afford an argument
for <hi>that,</hi> which I finde often occasion to say, That there are not
so <hi>eloquent</hi> books in the world, as the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> For there is not
onely that <hi>non refugit,</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> speaketh of in this place,
<hi>(Non refugit in Organis suis Spiritus Sanctus leporem &amp; facetias,</hi>
The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in his Instruments, (in those whose tongues or
pens he makes use of) doth not forbid, nor decline elegant and
cheerfull, and delightfull expression; but as God gave his Children a bread of <hi>Manna,</hi>
that tasted to every man like that that he liked best, so hath God given us <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
in which the plain and simple man may heare God speaking to him in his own plain and
familiar language, and men of larger capacity, and more curiosity, may heare God in
that Musique that they love best, in a curious, in an harmonious style, unparalleled by
any. For, that also <hi>Calvin</hi> adds in that place, that there is no secular Authour, <hi>Qui
jucundis vocum allusionibus, &amp; figuris magis abundat,</hi> which doth more abound with
perswasive <hi>figures</hi> of Rhetorique, nor with musicall <hi>cadences</hi> and <hi>allusions,</hi> and assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and conformity, and correspondency of words to one another, then some of
the <hi>Secretaries of the Holy Ghost,</hi> some of the authours of some books of the Bible doe.
Of this Rule, this Text is an example. These <hi>Philippians,</hi> amongst whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
had planted the Gospell in all sincerity, and impermixt, had admitted certain new men,
that preached <hi>Traditionall,</hi> and <hi>Additionall</hi> Doctrines, the <hi>Law</hi> with the <hi>Gospell, Moses</hi>
with <hi>Christ, Circumcision</hi> with <hi>Baptisme.</hi> To these new Convertites, these new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
inculcated often that charm, <hi>You are the Circumcision,</hi> you are <hi>they</hi> whom God
hath sealed to himself by the Seale of <hi>Circumcision; They</hi> whom God hath distinguished
from all Nations, by the marke of Circumcision; <hi>They</hi> in whom God hath imprinted,
(and that in so high a way, as by a <hi>Sacrament</hi>) an internall Circumcision, in an externall;
and will you breake this <hi>Seale</hi> of Circumcision? will you deface this <hi>marke</hi> of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision?
will you depart from this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Circumcision? You are the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.
Now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meets with these men upon their haunt; and even in the
sound of that word which they so often pressed; he sayes they presse upon you Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
but <hi>beware of Concision,</hi> of tearing the Church of God, of <hi>Schismes,</hi>
and separations from the Church of God, of aspersions and imputations <hi>upon</hi> the
Church of God,<note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> either by imaginary superfluities, or imaginary defectivenesse,
in that Church: for, saith the Apostle, <hi>We are the Circumcision,</hi> we who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and rejoyce in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and have no confidence in the
flesh. If therefore they will set up another Circumcision beyond this Circumcision, if
they will continue a significative, a relative, a preparative figure, after the substance,
the body, Christ Jesus is manifested to us, a legall Circumcision in the flesh, after the
spirituall Circumcision in the heart is established by the Gospell, their end is not <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:93359:182"/>
but <hi>Concision:</hi> they pretend <hi>Reformation,</hi> but they intend <hi>Destruction,</hi> a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
a renting, a wounding the body, and frame, and peace of the Church, and by all
means, and in all cases <hi>Videte Concisionem, Beware of Concision.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First then,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> we shall from these words consider, the lothnesse of God to lose
us. For, first, he leaves us not without a Law, he <hi>bids</hi> and he <hi>forbids,</hi> and then he does
not surprise us with <hi>obsolete laws,</hi> he leaves not his laws without <hi>proclamations,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshes
to our memories, and represents to us our duties, with such commonefactions
as these in our Text, <hi>Videte, Cavete,</hi> this and this I have commanded you, <hi>Videte,</hi> see
that ye do it, this and this will hinder you, <hi>Cavete,</hi> beware ye do it not, <hi>Beware of
Concision.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this, thus derived, and digested into these three branches: first, Gods lothnesse
to lose us; and then his way of <hi>drawing</hi> us to him, by manifestation of his will in a law;
and lastly his way of <hi>holding</hi> us with him, by making that law effectuall upon us, by these
his frequent commonefactions, <hi>Videte, Cavete,</hi> looke to it, beware of it, this will be
our first part. And then our second will be the thing it self that falls under this inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and caution, which is <hi>Concision,</hi> that is, a tearing, a renting, a shredding in peeces
that which should be intire. In which second part, we shall also have, (as we had in the
former) three branches; for, we shall consider, first, <hi>Concisionem corporis,</hi> the shredding
of the <hi>body</hi> of Christ into fragments, by unnecessary wrangling in <hi>Doctrinall points;</hi> and
then, <hi>Concisionem vestis,</hi> the shredding of the <hi>garment</hi> of Christ into rags, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
wrangling in matter of <hi>Discipline,</hi> and <hi>ceremoniall</hi> points; and lastly, <hi>Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem
spiritus,</hi> (which will follow upon the former two) the concision of thine owne
spirit, and heart, and minde, and <hi>soule,</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> into perplexities, and into sandy,
and incoherent doubts, and scruples, and jealousies, and suspitions of <hi>Gods purpose</hi> upon
thee, so as that thou shalt not be able to recollect thy self, nor reconsolidate thy self,
upon any assurance, and peace with God, which is onely to be had in Christ, and by
his Church. <hi>Videte Concisionem,</hi> beware of tearing the <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine;</hi> beware of
tearing the <hi>Garment,</hi> the <hi>Discipline;</hi> beware of tearing thine owne spirit, and <hi>conscience,</hi>
from her adhaesion, her agglutination, her cleaving to God, in a holy <hi>tranquillity,</hi> and
acquiescence in his <hi>promise,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> in the <hi>merits</hi> of his Sonne, applyed by the holy
Ghost, in the Ministry of the Church.</p>
                     <p>For our first consideration,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Part.</hi> Vult omnes.</note> of Gods lothnesse to lose us, this is argument enough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That we are here now, <hi>now</hi> at the participation of that grace, which God alwayes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to al such Congregations as these, gathered in his name. For, I pray God there stand
any one amongst us here now, that hath not done something since <hi>yesterday,</hi> that made
him unworthy of being here to day; and who, if he had been left under the damp, and
mist of <hi>yesterdayes sinne,</hi> without the light of <hi>new grace,</hi> would never have found way
hither of himself. If God be weary of me, and would faine be rid of me, he needs not
repent that he wrapped me up in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and derived me of <hi>Christian parents,</hi>
(though he gave me a great help in <hi>that</hi>) nor repent that he bred me in a <hi>true Church,</hi>
(though he afforded me a great assistance in <hi>that</hi>) nor repent that he hath brought me
<hi>hither</hi> now, to the participation of his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> (though thereby also I have a great
advantage) for, if God be weary of me, and would be rid of me, he may finde enough
in me now, and here, to let me perish. A present <hi>levity</hi> in me that speake, a present
<hi>formality</hi> in you that heare, a present <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> spread over us all, would justifie God;
if now,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 8.</note> and here, he should forsake us. When our blessed Saviour sayes, <hi>When the Son
of man comes, shall he finde faith upon earth?</hi> we need not limit that question so, if he
come to a <hi>Westminster,</hi> to an <hi>Exchange,</hi> to an <hi>Army,</hi> to a <hi>Court,</hi> shall he finde <hi>faith</hi>
there? but if he come to a <hi>Church,</hi> if he come hither, shall he finde <hi>faith</hi> here? If (as
Christ speaks in another sense, That <hi>Iudgement should begin at his owne house,</hi>) the great
and generall judgement should begin now at this <hi>his house,</hi> and that the first that should
be taken up in the clouds, to meet the Lord Jesus, should be we, that are met now in
this his house, would we be glad of that acceleration, or would we thank him for that
haste? Men <hi>of little faith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 1. 6.</note> I feare we would not. There was a day, when the Sonnes
of God presented themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also amongst them;
one Satan amongst many Sonnes of God. Blessed Lord, is not our case far otherwise?
do not we, (we, who, as we are but <hi>we,</hi> are all the Sonnes of Satan) present our selves

us. If thou Lord wert weary of me, and wouldest be rid of me, (may many a
soule here say) Lord thou knowest, and I know many a <hi>midnight,</hi> when thou mightest
have been rid of me,<note place="margin">Ier. 27. 28.</note> if thou hadst left me to my selfe then. But <hi>vigilavit Doninus,</hi> the
Lord vouchsafed to <hi>watch</hi> over me,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 31.</note> and <hi>deliciae ejus,</hi> the delight of the Lord was to be
with me; And what is there in me, but his <hi>mercy?</hi> but then, what is there in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that that may not reach <hi>to all,</hi> as well as to <hi>me?</hi> The Lord is loth to lose any, the
Lord would not the death of <hi>any;</hi> not of <hi>any sinner;</hi> much lesse if he do not see him,
nor consider him so; the Lord would not lose him, <hi>though a sinner,</hi> much lesse <hi>make</hi>
him a sinner, that he might be lost: <hi>Vult omnes,</hi> the Lord would have all men come unto
him, and be saved, which was our first consideration, and we have done with that, and
our second is, The way by which he leads us to him, that he declares and manifests his
will unto us, in a <hi>Law,</hi> he <hi>bids,</hi> and he <hi>forbids.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The laborers in the Vine-yard took it ill at the Stewards hand,<note place="margin">Lex. Mat. 20. 22.</note> and at his Masters
too, that those which came late to the labour, were made equall with them, who had
borne the heate, and the burden of the day. But if the Steward, or the Master had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meant, or actually never had given any thing at all, to them that had borne the
heate and the burden of the day, there had been much more cause of complaint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there had passed a <hi>contract</hi> between them. So hath there passed a <hi>contract</hi> between
God, and us, <hi>Beleeve,</hi> and <hi>thou shalt live, Do this and thou shalt live.</hi> And in this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
hath God expressed his love to us, and his lothenesse to lose us, that he hath
passed such a <hi>contract</hi> with us, and manifested to us a way, to come to him. We say,
every day, in his owne prayer, <hi>Fiat voluntas tua, thy will be done;</hi> that is, done <hi>by us,</hi> as
well as done <hi>upon us.</hi> But this petition presumes another; the <hi>Fiat</hi> suposes a <hi>Patefiat
voluntas,</hi> if it must be done, it must be known. If man were put into this world, &amp; under
an obligation of doing the will of God, upon <hi>damnation,</hi> and had no meanes to <hi>know</hi>
that will which he was bound to doe, of all creatures he were the most miserable. That
which we read,<note place="margin">Psal. 144. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord what is man that thou takest knowledge of him?</hi> the <hi>Vulgat</hi> edition;
and the <hi>Fathers</hi> following the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> read thus, <hi>Quia innotuisti ei,</hi> Lord what is
man that he should have any knowledge of <hi>thee,</hi> that thou shouldest make thy selfe
known to <hi>him?</hi> This is the heighth of the mercy of God, this innotescence, this mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of himselfe to <hi>us.</hi> Now what is this innotescence, this manifestation of God
to us? It is, say our old Expositors, the <hi>law.</hi> That's that, which is so often called <hi>the
face of God,</hi> and the <hi>light of his Countenance;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> for, <hi>facies Dei est, qua nobis innotescit,</hi>
that's Gods face, by which God is known to us, and that's his <hi>law,</hi> the declaration of
his will to me, and my way to him. When Christ reproaches those hard-hearted men,
that had not <hi>fed him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 44.</note> when he <hi>was hungry,</hi> nor clothed him, when he was naked, and
that they say, <hi>Lord when did we see thee naked, or see thee hungry?</hi> (inconsiderate men,
or men loth to give, the penurious and narrow soule, shall not see an occasion of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when it is presented, which is a heavy blindnesse, and obcaecation, not to see occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of doing good) yet those men doe not say, when did we see thee <hi>at all,</hi> as though
they had never seen him? The blindest man that is, hath the face of God so turned
towards him, as that he may be seen by him; even the <hi>naturall man</hi> hath so; for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
does the Apostle make him inexcusable,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.12.</note> if in the visible worke, he doe not see the
<hi>invisible</hi> God. But all sight of God, is by the benefit of a <hi>law;</hi> the naturall man sees
him by a law written in his <hi>heart, the Iew,</hi> by a law given by <hi>Moses,</hi> the Christian, in a
clearer glasse, for, his law is the <hi>Gospell.</hi> But there is more mercy, that is, more manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this text, then all this. For, besides the naturall mans seeing God, in a law, in the
faculties of his owne <hi>nature,</hi> (which we consider to be the work of the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> in
that <hi>Faciamus homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Let us make man in our own Image,</hi> let us shine out in him, so as that
he may be a glasse, in which he may see us, in himselfe) and besides the <hi>Iews</hi> seeing of
God in the law written in the stone <hi>tables,</hi> (which we consider to be the worke of the
<hi>Father)</hi> And besides the Christians seeing of God, in the law written in <hi>bloud,</hi> (in which
we consider especially <hi>the Sonne)</hi> there is in this text an operation, a manifestation of
God, proper to the holy Ghost, and wrought by his holy suggestions and inspirations,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93359:183"/>
That God does not onely speake to us, but call upon us; not onely give us a Law, but
<hi>Proclamations</hi> upon that law, that he refreshes to our memories, generall duties, by such
particular warnings, and excitations, and commonefactions, as in this text, <hi>Videte,
Beware,</hi> which is the last branch of this part, though it be the first word of our text, <hi>Vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Videte.</note>
                        <hi>Beware.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing exalts Gods goodnesse towards us, more then this, that he multiplies the
meanes of his mercy to us, so, as that no man can say, <hi>once</hi> I remember I might
have been saved, <hi>once</hi> God called unto mee, <hi>once</hi> hee opened mee a doore, a passage
into heaven, but I neglected <hi>that,</hi> went not in then, and God never came more.
No doubt, God hath come often to that doore since, and knocked, and staid at
that doore; And if I knew who it were that said this, I should not doubt to make
that suspitious soule see,<note place="margin">Psal. 62. 11.</note> that God is at that doore <hi>now. God hath spoken once, and
twice have I heard him;</hi> for the foundation of all. God hath spoken but <hi>once,</hi> in
his Scriptures. Therefore doth Saint <hi>Iude</hi> call that <hi>fidem semel traditam,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> the faith
<hi>once</hi> delivered to the Saints; once, that is, <hi>at once;</hi> not at once so, all at one time,
or in one mans age; the Scriptures were not delivered so; for, God <hi>spoke by
the mouth of the Prophets, that have been, since the world beganne;</hi> But, <hi>at once,</hi> that
is, <hi>by one way,</hi> by <hi>writing,</hi> by Scriptures; so, as that after that was done, after
God had declared his whole will, in the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Gospell,</hi>
there was no more to bee added. <hi>God hath spoken once,</hi> in his Scriptures, <hi>and wee
have heard him twice,</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> in our owne readings, and againe and againe <hi>here,</hi> in
his <hi>Ordinances.</hi> This is the heighth of Gods goodnesse, that he gives us his <hi>Law,</hi>
and a <hi>Comment</hi> upon that Law, <hi>Proclamations,</hi> declarations upon that Law. For,
without these subsequent helpes, even the law it selfe might be mistaken; as you
see it was,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> when Christ was put to rectifie them, with his <hi>Audiistis,</hi> and <hi>Audiistis,</hi>
this you have heard, and this hath been told you, <hi>Ego autem dico,</hi> but this <hi>I say, ab
initio,</hi> from the beginning it was not so, the foundations were not thus laid, and upon
the foundations laid by God in the Scriptures, and not upon the superedifications of
men, in traditionall additions, must wee build. In stormes and tempests at sea men
come sometimes to cut down Galleries, and teare up Cabins, and cast them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
to ease the ship, and sometimes to hew downe the Mast it selfe, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Mast the ship can make no way; but no soule weather can make them
teare out the keele of the ship, upon which the ship is built. In cases of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Church may forbeare her <hi>Galleries,</hi> and <hi>Cabinets,</hi> meanes of ease and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency;
yea, and her <hi>Mast</hi> too, meanes of her growth, and propagation, and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of her selfe, and be content to <hi>hull</hi> it out, and consist in her present, or a worse
state, during the storme. But to the <hi>keele</hi> of the <hi>ship,</hi> to the <hi>fundamentall articles</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
may no violence, in any case, be offered.</p>
                     <p>God multiplies his mercies to us,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 2.</note> in his divers ways of speaking to us. <hi>Caeli
enarrant,</hi> says <hi>David, The heavens declare the glory of God;</hi> and not onely by showing,
but by <hi>saying;</hi> there is a <hi>language</hi> in the heavens; for it is <hi>enarrant,</hi> a verball decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and, as it followes literally, <hi>Day unto day uttereth speech.</hi> This is the true har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spheares, which every man may heare. Though he understand no
tongue but his owne, he may heare God in the motions of the same, in the seasons of
the yeare, in the vicissitudes and revolutions of Church, and State, in the voice of
Thunder, and lightnings, and other declarations of his power. This is Gods <hi>English</hi>
to thee, and his <hi>French,</hi> and his <hi>Latine,</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> to others. God
once confounded languages; that conspiring men might not understand one another,
but never so, as that all men might not understand <hi>him.</hi> When the holy Ghost fell
upon the Apostles, they spoke so, as that all men understood them, <hi>in their owne
tongues.</hi> When the holy Ghost fell upon the waters, in the Creation, God spoke
so, in his language of <hi>Workes,</hi> as that all men may understand them. For, in this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
the language of <hi>workes,</hi> the <hi>Eye</hi> is the <hi>eare, seeing</hi> is <hi>hearing.</hi> How often does the
holy Ghost call upon us, in the Scriptures, <hi>Ecce, quia os Domini locutum, Behold, the mouth
of the Lord hath spoken it?</hi> he calls us to <hi>behold,</hi> (which is the office of the <hi>eye</hi>) and that
that we are to behold, is the <hi>voice</hi> of God, belonging to the eare; seeing is hearing, in Gods
first language, the language of <hi>works.</hi> But then God translates himself, in particular <hi>works;
nationally,</hi> he speaks in particular judgments, or deliverances to one nation; &amp;, <hi>domestically,</hi>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:93359:184"/>
he speaks that language to a particular family; &amp; so <hi>personally</hi> too; he speaks to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
soul. God will speak unto me, in that voice, and in that way, which I am most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with, &amp; hearken most to. If I be <hi>covetous,</hi> God wil tel me that heaven is a pearle, a
treasure. If cheerfull and affected with mirth, that heaven is all <hi>Ioy.</hi> If ambitious,
and hungry of preferment, that it is all <hi>Glory.</hi> If sociable, and conversable, that it is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints.</hi> God will make a <hi>Fever</hi> speake to me, and tell me his minde, that there
is no health but in <hi>him,</hi> God will make the <hi>disfavour,</hi> and frowns of <hi>him</hi> I depend upon,
speake to me, and tell me his minde, that there is no safe dependence, no assurance but
in <hi>him;</hi> God will make a <hi>storme</hi> at Sea, or a <hi>fire</hi> by land, speake to me, and tell mee
his minde, that there is no perpetuity, no possession but in <hi>him;</hi> nay, God will make
my <hi>sinne</hi> speake to me, and tell me his minde; even my sinne shall be a Sermon, and
a Catechisme to me; God shall suffer mee me to fall into some such sinne, as that
by some circumstances in the sinne, or consequences from the sinne, I shall be drawn
to hearken unto him; and whether I heare <hi>Hosannaes,</hi> acclamations, and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or <hi>Crucifiges,</hi> exclamations and condemnations from the world, I shall still finde the
voice and tongue of God, though in the mouth of the Devill, and his instruments.
God is a declaratory God. The whole yeare, is, to his Saints, a continuall <hi>Epiphany,</hi>
one day of manifestation. In every minute that strikes upon the <hi>Bell,</hi> is a syllable, nay
a syllogisme from God. And, and in my <hi>last Bell,</hi> God shall speake too; that Bell,
when it tolls, shall tell me I am going, and when it rings out, shall tell you I am gone
into the hands of that God, who is the God of the living and not of the dead, for,
they dye not that depart in him. <hi>Dives</hi> pressed <hi>Abraham</hi> to send a preacher from the
dead,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 27.</note> to his brethren. This was to put God to a new language, when he had spoken
sufficiently by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi> And yet, even in this language, the tongue of
the dead, hath God spoken too. <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> says, that that Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prooemium in Ionam. 1 Reg. 17.</note> who
was sent to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> was the same <hi>man,</hi> whom, beeing then a <hi>child,</hi> and dead in his
mothers house, the widow of <hi>Zarepta's</hi> house, <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet raised to life againe;
and so, God spoke to <hi>Niniveh</hi> in that language, in the tongue of the <hi>dead.</hi> But be that
but <hi>Problematicall,</hi> wrapped up in a Traditionall, and Historicall faith, this is <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,</hi>
and irrefragable, that God hath spoken to the whole world in the tongue of
the dead, in his Sonne <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the Lord of life, and yet the <hi>first borne of the
dead.</hi> God is lothe to lose us, at worst, and therefore, did not, surely, reject us, before
we were ill, (And that was our first) God hath drawn us to him, by manifesting his
will, and our way in a law, and therefore, will not judge us at last, by any thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
revealed to us, (And that was our second) God holds us to him by these remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
these common manifestations in our text, <hi>Videte, Cavete,</hi> and therefore let
no man that does not heare God speaking to him, in this present voice, despaire
that hee shall never heare him, but hearken still, and in one language or other,
perchance a <hi>sicknesse,</hi> perchance a <hi>sinne,</hi> hee shall heare him, for these are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Dialects in Gods language, severall instruments in Gods Consort;
And this is our third consideration, and the end of this first part, the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
the Commonefaction, <hi>Videte, Cavete;</hi> And wee passe to our second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
part, and the three branches of <hi>that,</hi> that that falls under this Prohibition, <hi>Videte
Concisionem, Beware the Concision.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> embraces here,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Part.</hi> Concision.</note> that elegancy of language familiar to the holy Ghost,
They pretend <hi>Circumcision,</hi> they intend <hi>Concision;</hi> there is a certaine elegant and holy
delicacy, a certaine holy <hi>juvenility</hi> in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> choosing these words of this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
cadence and agnomination, <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and <hi>Concision;</hi> But then this delicacy,
and juvenility presents matter of gravity and soundnesse. Language must waite upon
matter, and <hi>words</hi> upon <hi>things.</hi> In this case, (which indeed makes it a strange
case) the matter is the forme; The matter, that is, the doctrine that we preach,
is the forme, that is, the Soule, the <hi>Essence;</hi> the language and words wee preach
in, is but the Body, but the <hi>existence.</hi> Therefore, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who would
not allow <hi>Legall figures,</hi> not Typicall figures, not Sacramentall figures, not
Circumcision it selfe, after the <hi>body,</hi> Christ Jesus, was once exhibited,
does not certainely allow <hi>Rhetoricall</hi> figures, nor <hi>Poeticall</hi> figures, in the
preaching, or hearing of Christ preached, so, as that that should bee the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
leader of hearer, or speaker. But this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> authoriseth in his owne
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93359:184"/>
practise, and the holy Ghost in <hi>him,</hi> That in elegant language, he incorporates,
and invests sound and important Doctrine; for, though he choose <hi>words</hi> of musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
sound, <hi>Circumcision</hi> and <hi>Concision,</hi> yet it is a matter of weighty consideration
that he intends in this Concision. Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> both agree
in this interpretation, That whereas <hi>Circumcision</hi> is an orderly, a usefull, a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall,
a beneficiall pruning and paring off, that which is superfluous, <hi>Conciditur quod
temere, &amp; inutiliter decerpitur,</hi> Concision is a hasty and a rash plucking up, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe, and an unprofitable tearing, and renting into shreds and fragments, such,
as the Prophet speaks of,<note place="margin">Ier. 19. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>The breaking of a Potters vessell, that cannot be made up again.</hi>
Concision is, at best, <hi>Solutio Continui,</hi> The severing of that, which should be kept
intire. In the State, the aliening of the <hi>head</hi> from the body, or of the body from the
head, is Concision; and <hi>videte,</hi> it is a fearefull thing to be guilty of <hi>that.</hi> In the <hi>Church,</hi>
(which Church is not a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> otherwise then as she is united in her head, Christ
Jesus) to constitute a Monarchy, an universall <hi>head</hi> of the Church, to the dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herison,
and to the tearing of the Crownes of Princes, who are heads of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in their Dominions, this is Concision; and <hi>videte,</hi> it is a fearefull thing to
be guilty of <hi>that,</hi> to advance a forein <hi>Prelate.</hi> In the family, where God hath made
man and wife, <hi>one,</hi> to divide with others, is <hi>Concision;</hi> and <hi>videte,</hi> it is a fearefull thing
to be guilty of <hi>that.</hi> Generally, the tearing of that in peeces, which God intended
should be kept intire, is this <hi>Concision,</hi> and falls under this Commonefaction, which
implies an increpation, <hi>videte, beware.</hi> But because thus, <hi>Concision</hi> would receive a
concision into infinite branches, we determined this consideration, at first, into
these three; first, <hi>Concisio Corporis,</hi> the concision of the <hi>body,</hi> dis-union in <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
things;</hi> and <hi>Concisio vestis,</hi> the Concision of the <hi>garment,</hi> dis-union in <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall</hi>
things; and then <hi>Concisio Spiritus,</hi> the Concision of the Spirit, dis-union,
<hi>irresolution,</hi> unsetlednesse, diffidence, and distrust in thine owne minde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                     <p>First, for this Concision of <hi>the body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Concisio Corporis.</note> of the body of Divinity, in <hi>Doctrinall</hi>
things, since still Concision is <hi>Solutio continui,</hi> the breaking of that which should be
intire, consider we first, what this <hi>Continuum,</hi> this that should be kept intire, is;
and it is, sayes the Apostle, <hi>Iesus himself. Omnis spiritus qui solvit Iesum,</hi> (so the
Antients reade that place) <hi>Every spirit which dissolveth Iesus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 3.</note> that breakes Jesus
in peeces, that makes <hi>Religion</hi> serve turnes, that admits so much Gospell as may
promove and advance present businesses, every such spirit is <hi>not of God.</hi> Not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the whole Gospell, <hi>Totum Iesum,</hi> not to beleeve all the Articles of faith, this
is <hi>Solutio continui,</hi> a breaking of that which should be intire; and this is truly <hi>conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
Now with concision in this kinde, our greatest adversaries, they of the <hi>Romane</hi>
heresie, and mis-perswasion, do not charge us. They do not charge us that we deny
any article of any antient Creed: nor may they deny, that there is not enough for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in those antient Creeds. This is <hi>Continuitas universalis,</hi> a continuity, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirenesse
that goes through the whole Church; a skin that covers the whole body;
the whole Church is bound to beleeve all the articles of faith. But then, there is
<hi>Continuitas particularis, Continuitas modi,</hi> a continuity, a harmony, an intirenesse, that
does not go through the whole Church; the whole Church does not alwaies agree
in the manner of explication of all the articles of faith; but this may be a skin that
covers some particular limbe of the body, and not another; one Church may expound
an article thus, and some other some other way, as, in particular, the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church
expounds the article of <hi>Christs descent</hi> into hell, one way, and the <hi>Calvinist</hi> another.
Now, in cases, where <hi>neither</hi> exposition destroyes the article, in the substance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it is <hi>Concision,</hi> that is, <hi>Solutio continui,</hi> a breaking of that which should be kept
intire, for any man to breake the peace of that Church, in which he hath received
his <hi>baptisme,</hi> and hath his <hi>station,</hi> by advancing the exposition of any other Church,
in that. And as this is <hi>Concision, Solutio continui,</hi> a breaking of that which is intire,
to break the peace of the Church, where we were baptized, by teaching otherwise then
that Church teaches, in these things <hi>De modo,</hi> of the manner of expounding such or
such articles of faith, so is there another dangerous <hi>Concision</hi> too. For, to inoculate a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
bud, or to engraffe a forein bough, is <hi>concision,</hi> as well as the cutting off an arme
from the tree; to inoculate, cleaves the rinde, the bark; and to <hi>engraffe,</hi> cleaves the tree:
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:93359:185"/>
it severs that which should be entire. So, when a particular Church, in a holy, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
modesty, hath abstained from declaring her self in the exposition of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Articles, or of some Doctrines, by faire consequence deducible from those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and contented her self with those generall things which are necessary to salvation,
(As the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath, in the Article of <hi>Christs descent into Hell</hi>) it is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
it is <hi>solution Continui,</hi> a breaking of that which should be intire, to inoculate a new
sense, or engraffe a new exposition, which howsoever it may be true in it selfe, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be truly said, to be the sense of that Church; not perchance because that Church was
not of that mind, but because that Church finding the thing it self to be no <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
thing, thought it unnecessary to descend to particular declarations, when as in such
declarations she must have departed from some other Church of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> that
thought otherwise, and in keeping her self within those generall termes that were <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and sufficient, with a good conscience she conserved peace and unity with all. <hi>David,</hi>
in the person of every member of the Church, submits himself to that increpation, <hi>Let
my right hand forget her cunning, and let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not Ierusalem before my chiefest joy.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 137. 6.</note> Our chiefest joy, is, for the most part, our <hi>own
opinions,</hi> especially when they concur with other learned and good men too. But then, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
is our love of the peace of the Church; and in such things as do not violate
foundations, let us prefer <hi>Ierusalem</hi> before our chiefest Joy, love of peace before our
own opinions, though concurrent with others. For, this is that, that hath misled many
men, that the common opinion in the Church is necessarily the opinion of the Church.
It is not so; not so in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church : There the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion is, That the blessed
<hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was conceived without originall sin: But cannot be said to be the opinion of
that Church; nor may it be safely concluded in any Church : Most Writers in the
Church have declared themselves this way, therefore the Church hath declared her
self, for the declarations of the Church are done publiquely, &amp; orderly, and at once. And
when a Church hath declared her self so, in all things necessary and sufficient, let us possess
our souls in peace, and not say that that Church hath, or presse that that Church would
proceed to further declarations in lesse necessary particulars. When we are sure we have
beleeved &amp; practised, all that the Church hath reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to us, in these generals, then,
and not till then, let us call for more declarations; but in the mean time prefer <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
before our chiefest joy, love of peace by a generall forbearance on all sides, rather then
victory by wrangling, and uncharitablenesse. And let our right hand forget her cunning,
(let us never set pen to paper to write) Let our tongue cleave to the roofe of our mouth,
(let us never open our mouth to speake of those things) in which <hi>Silence</hi> was an
Act of <hi>Discretion,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> before, but now is also an Act of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and of
<hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Loyaltie.</hi> But that which <hi>David</hi> said to the Lord, (<hi>Psalme</hi> 65. 1.)
Let us also accommodate to the Lords anointed, <hi>Tibi laus silentium,</hi> our best sacrifice
to both, is to be silent in those things. So then, this is <hi>Concisio corporis,</hi> that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of the <hi>body,</hi> which you are to beware in <hi>Doctrinall things,</hi> first, <hi>non solvere Iesum,</hi>
not to dissolve, not to break Jesus in pieces, not to depart, in any respect, with any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Article of faith, for that is a skin that covers the whole body, an obligation that
lies upon the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and then for that particular <hi>Church,</hi> in which you have your
station, first, to conform your self to all that, in which she had evidently declared herself,
and then not to impute to her, not to call such articles <hi>hers, as she never avowd.</hi> And our
next <hi>consideration</hi> is <hi>Concisio vestis, the tearing of the garment,</hi> matter of <hi>discipline,</hi> and
<hi>government.</hi>

                     <p>To a <hi>Circumcision</hi> of the <hi>garment,</hi>

as were superstitious, or superfluous, of an ill use, or of no use, our <hi>Church</hi> came in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> To a <hi>Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cision</hi> we came; but those <hi>Churches</hi> that came to a
<hi>Concision</hi> of the <hi>garment,</hi> to an absolute taking away of <hi>all ceremonies,</hi> neither provided so
safely for the <hi>Church</hi> it self in the substance thereof, nor for the exaltation of <hi>Devotion in
the Church.</hi> Divide the law of the <hi>Iews</hi> into 2 halfs, and the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> will be the greater;
we cannot cal the <hi>Morall</hi> law, the <hi>Iews</hi> law; that was <hi>ours</hi> as wel as <hi>their,</hi> peculiar to none;
but of that law w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is peculiar to the <hi>Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judicial &amp; Ceremonial, the Ceremonial</hi> is far the
greater part. So great a care had God, of those thing, which though they be not of the
<hi>revenue</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet are of the <hi>subsidy</hi> of Religion, and, though they be not the <hi>soule</hi>
of the Church, yet are they those <hi>Spirits</hi> that unite soule and body together. H's man
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:93359:185"/>
did but <hi>shave the beards</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> servants,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.</note> he did not cut off their heads; He did
not cut their clothes so, as that he stripped them naked. Yet, for that that he did, (says
that story) <hi>he stanke in Davids sight,</hi> (which is a phrase of high indignation in that
language) and so much, as that it cost him forty thousand of his horsemen in one bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
And therefore as this Apostle enters this <hi>Caveat</hi> in another place, <hi>If yee bite one
another, cavete, take heed yee be not consumed of one another,</hi> so <hi>cavete,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 15.</note> take heed of this
concision of the garment, lest if the garment be torne off, the body wither, and perish.
A shadow is nothing, yet, if the rising or falling Sunne shine out, and there be no sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
I will pronounce there is no body in that place neither. Ceremonies are <hi>nothing;</hi>
but where there are no Ceremonies, order, and uniformity, and obedience, and at last,
(and quickely) Religion it selfe will vanish. And therefore <hi>videte concisionem,</hi> beware
of tearing the body, or of tearing the garment, which will induce the other, and both
will induce the third, <hi>concisionem spiritus,</hi> the tearing of thine owne spirit, from that
rest which it should receive in God; for, when thou hast lost thy hold of all those han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
which God reaches out to thee, in the Ministery of his Church, and that thou hast
no means to apply the promises of God in Christ to thy soule, which are onely appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Gods <hi>Ordinances</hi> in his Church, when anything falls upon thee, that overcomes
thy <hi>morall constancy</hi> (which <hi>morall constancy,</hi> God knowes, is soon spent, if we have lost
our recourse to God) thou wilt soon sinke into an irrecoverable <hi>desperation,</hi> which is the
fearfullest concision of all; and <hi>videte,</hi> beware of this concision.</p>
                     <p>When God hath made himselfe one body with me,<note place="margin">Concisio Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus.</note> by his assuming this <hi>nature,</hi> and
made me <hi>one spirit</hi> with himselfe, and that by so high a way, as making me <hi>partaker of
the divine nature,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> so that now, <hi>in Christ Iesus,</hi> he and I are one, this were <hi>solutio Iesus,</hi>
a tearing in peeces,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4.</note> a dissolving of Jesus, in the worst kinde that could be imagined, if I
should teare my selfe from Jesus, or by any jealousie or suspicion of his mercy, or any
horror in my own sinnes, come to thinke my selfe to be none of <hi>his,</hi> none of <hi>him.</hi>
Who ever comes into a Church to denounce an <hi>excommunication</hi> against himselfe?
And shall any sad soule come hither, to gather arguments, from our preaching, to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi>
it selfe,<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 30.</note> or <hi>to</hi> pronounce an impossibility upon her owne salvation? <hi>God
did a new thing, Says Moses,</hi> a strange thing, a thing never done before, when the earth
opened her mouth (and <hi>Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> went downe quicke into the pit. Wilt thou
doe a stranger thing then that? To teare open the jawes of Earth, and Hell, and cast
thy self actually and really into it, out of mis-imagination, that God hath cast thee into
it before? Wilt thou force God to second thy irreligious <hi>melancholy,</hi> and to condemne
thee at last, because thou hadst precondemned thy selfe, and renounced his mercy?
Wilt thou say with <hi>Cain, My sinne is greater then can be pardoned?</hi> This is <hi>Concisio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatis,</hi>
a cutting off the <hi>power</hi> of God, and Treason against the <hi>Father,</hi> whose Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
is <hi>Power.</hi> Wilt thou say, God never meant to save me? this is <hi>Concisio Sapientiae,</hi> a
cutting off the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of God, to thinke, that God intended himselfe glory in a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and would not have that kingdome peopled, and this is Treason against the <hi>Son</hi>
whose Attribute is <hi>wisdoms?</hi> Wilt thou say, I shall never finde comfort in <hi>Praying,</hi> in
<hi>Preaching,</hi> in <hi>Receiving?</hi> This is <hi>Concisio consolationis,</hi> the cutting off consolation, and
treason against the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> whose office is <hi>comfort.</hi> No man violates the <hi>Power</hi> of the
<hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Wisedome</hi> of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> the <hi>Goodnesse</hi> of the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> so much as he, who
thinkes himselfe out of their reach, or the latitude of their working. <hi>Rachel</hi> wept for
her children,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 18.</note> and would not be comforted; but why? <hi>Because they were not.</hi> If her
children had been but gone for a time from her, or but sicke with her, <hi>Rachel</hi> would
have been comforted; but, <hi>they were not.</hi> Is that thy case? Is not thy soule, a soule still?
It may have gone from thee, in sins of <hi>inconsideration;</hi> it may be sicke within thee, in
sins of <hi>habit and custome;</hi> but is not thy soul, a soul still? And hath God made any <hi>species</hi>
larger then himself? is there more soul, then there is God, more <hi>sin</hi> then <hi>mercy?</hi> Truly
<hi>Origen</hi> was more excusable, more pardonable, if he did beleeve, that the <hi>Devill</hi> might
possibly be saved, then that man, that beleeves that <hi>himself</hi> must necessarily be damned.
And therefore, <hi>videte concisionem,</hi> beware of cutting off thy spirit from this spirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
take heed of shreading Gods <hi>generall promises;</hi> into so narrow propositions, as that
they will not reach home to <hi>thee,</hi> cover thee, invest thee; beware of such <hi>distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> &amp; such
subdivisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as may make the way to heaven too narrow for thee, or thegate of heaven too
strait <hi>for thee.</hi> 'Tis true, one drop of my Saviours bloud would save me, if I had but <hi>that,</hi>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:93359:186"/>
one teare from my Saviours eye, if I had but <hi>that;</hi> but he hath none that hath not <hi>all;</hi> A
drop, a teare, would wash away an <hi>Adultery,</hi> a <hi>murder,</hi> but lesse then the whole sea of
both, will not wash away a wanton looke, an angry word. God would have <hi>all,</hi> and
gives all to all. And for Gods sake, let God be as good as he will; as mercifull,
and as large, as liberall, and as generall as he will. Christ came to save sinners; thou
are sure thou art one of them; At what time soever a sinner repents, he shall be heard;
be sure to be one of them too. Beleeve that God in Christ proposes conditions to thee;
endevour the performing, repent the not performing of those conditions, and be that
the issue between God and thy soule; And lest thou end in this concision, the conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Spirit, beware of the other two concisions, of the body, and of the garment,
by which onely, all heavenly succors are appliable to thee.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N bestowing of <hi>Benefits,</hi> there are some <hi>Circumstances,</hi> that vitiate and
deprave the nature of the benefit (as when a man gives onely in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of <hi>Retribution,</hi> for then he is not <hi>Dator,</hi> but <hi>Mercator,</hi> this is
not a giving, but a Merchandising, a permutation, or when he is <hi>Cymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibilis
Dator,</hi> (as our <hi>Canons</hi> speake) one that gives Mint and Cumin,
so small things, and in so small proportions, as onely keeps him alive
that receives, and so <hi>Ipsum quod dat, perit, &amp; vitam producit ad miseriam,</hi> that that is
given is lost, and he that receives it, is but continued in misery, and so the <hi>benefit,</hi> hath
almost the nature of an <hi>injury,</hi> because but for that poore benefit, hee might
have got out of this life. And then there are circumstances, that doe absolutely <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate</hi>
a benefit, amongst which, one is, if the giver take so expresse, so direct, so publique
knowledge of the wants of the receiver, as that he shall be more ashamed by it, then
refreshed with it; for in many courses of life, it does more deject a man, in his own
heart, and in the opinion of others too, and more retard him in any preferment, to be
<hi>known</hi> to be <hi>poore,</hi> then to <hi>be</hi> so indeed; And he that gives so, does not onely make
him that receives, his <hi>Debtor,</hi> but his <hi>Prisoner,</hi> for he takes away his liberty of applying
himselfe to others, who might be more beneficiall to him, the <hi>he</hi> that captivated, and
ensnared him, with that small benefit. And therefore many times in the Scripture, the
phrase is such in doing a curtesie, as though the receiver had done it, in accepting it; so
when <hi>Iacob</hi> made a present to his brother <hi>Esau, I beseech thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 33.</note> says he, <hi>to take my blessing</hi>
that <hi>I may finde favour in thy sight;</hi> so he compelled him to take it. So when Christ
recommends here to his people, the great, and inestimable benefit in our text, <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> he delivers that benefit of all those accidents, or circumstances, that
might vitiate it; and amongst those, of this, that we should not be confounded with
the notice taken of our poverty, and indigence; for he proceeds with man, as though
man might be of some use to him, and with whom it were fit for him to hold good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence,
he sends to him by <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> (as it is in the words immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the text) and by those Ambassadors he <hi>prays him,</hi> that he would accept the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of Reconciliation. To us, who are his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and therefore might be turned and
wound by his <hi>generall providence,</hi> without employment of any particular messengers,
he sends particular messengers; to us that are his <hi>enemies,</hi> and fitter to receive denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of a war, by a <hi>Herald,</hi> then a <hi>Message,</hi> by <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> he sends Ambassadors, to
us, who are indeed <hi>Rebells,</hi> and not enemies, and therefore rather to be reduced and
reclaimed by <hi>Executioners,</hi> then by <hi>Commissioners,</hi> he sends Commissioners, not to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
not to capitulate, but to pray, and to intreat, and not to intreat us to accept
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:93359:186"/>
Gods reconciliation to us, but, as though God needed us, to intreat us to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to him; <hi>We pray you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these words,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> our parts will be three: <hi>Our</hi> Office towards <hi>you; yours</hi> towards <hi>us;</hi>
and the Negotiation it self, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God. In each of these three, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derivation
into three branches: for, in the two first (besides the matter) there are two
kinds of <hi>persons, we</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> The <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> (we <hi>pray you.</hi>) And in the last
there are two kinds of persons too, <hi>you</hi> and <hi>God; Be ye reconciled to God.</hi> But because
all these kinds of persons, <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>we,</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> fall frequently into our consideration,
there is the lesse necessity laid upon us to handle them, as distinct branches, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then as they fall into the Negotiation it self. Therefore we shall determine our
selves in these three: First, our office towards you, and our stipulation and contract
with you, <hi>We pray you;</hi> we come not as Lords or Commanders over you, but in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in submissive manner, <hi>We pray you.</hi> And then your respect to us, because in what
manner soever we come, we come <hi>in Christs stead,</hi> and though dimly, yet represent <hi>him.</hi>
And lastly, the blessed effect of this our humility to you, and this your respect to us,
Reconciliation to God. Humility in us, because we are sent to the poorest soul; respect
in you, because we are sent to represent the highest King, work in you this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God, and it is a Text well handled; practice makes any Sermon a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Part.</note> then, for <hi>our office</hi> towards you, because you may be apt to say, <hi>You take too
much upon you, you sonnes of Levi;</hi> We the sonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> open unto you our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and we pursue but that we professe, that we are sent but to pray, but to intreat
you; and we accompany it with an outward declaration, we stand bare, and you sit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
When greater power seems to be given us, of treading upon <hi>Dragons</hi> and <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,</hi>
of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loosing,</hi> of <hi>casting out Devills,</hi> and the like, we confesse these are

for, as though it were hard, even to him, to expresse the humility which we are to use,
rather then lose any soul for which Christ hath dyed, he hath taught us this obsecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this praying, this intreating in our Text, in a word, by which the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> the first
Translators into <hi>Greek,</hi> expresse divers affections, and all within the compasse of this
<hi>Obsecramus,</hi> We pray you. Some of them we shall present to you.</p>
                     <p>Those Translators use that word for <hi>Napal. Napal</hi> is <hi>Ruere, Postrare,</hi> to throw down,
to deject our selves, to admit any undervalue, any exinanition, any evacuation of our
selves, so we may advance this great work. <hi>I fell down before the Lord,</hi> says <hi>Moses</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and <hi>Abraham</hi> fell upon his face, says <hi>Moses</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> and in no sense is this word
oftner used, by them, then in this humiliation. But yet, as it signifies to need the favour
of another, so does it also to be favourable, and mercifull to another; for so also, the
same Translators use this word for <hi>Chanan,</hi> which is to oblige and binde a man by bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
or to have <hi>compassion upon him;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 19. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends,
for the hand of God hath touched me;</hi> there is our word repeated. So that, whether we
professe to you, that as Physicians must consider excrements, so we must consider sin,
the leprosie, the pestilence, the ordure of the soule, there is our dejection of our selves,
or make you see your poverty and indigence, and that that can be no way supplied, but
by those means, which God conveys by us, both ways we are within our word, <hi>Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramus,</hi>
we pray you, we intreat you.</p>
                     <p>They use this word also for <hi>Calah,</hi> and <hi>Calah</hi> is <hi>Dolere,</hi> to grieve within our selves, for
the affliction of another; But it signifies also <hi>vulnerare,</hi> to wound, and afflict another;
for so it is said in this word,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 31. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Saul was sore wounded.</hi> So that, whether we expresse our
grief, in the behalf of Christ, that you will not be reconciled to God, or whether we
wound your consciences, with a sense of your sins, and his judgements, we are still what
in the word of our Commission, <hi>Obsecramus,</hi> we pray, we intreat.</p>
                     <p>To contract this consideration, they use this word for <hi>Cruciare,</hi> to vex, and for <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care</hi>
too,<note place="margin">Mic. 6. 3.</note> to appease, to restore to rest and quiet. <hi>Therefore will I make thee sick in smiting
thee;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Zech. 7. 12.</note> there it is vexation; And then, <hi>They sent unto the House of the Lord, Placare Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
to appease the Lord, as we translate it, and well, <hi>To pray.</hi> And therefore, if from
our words proceed any vexation to your consciences, you must not say, <hi>Transeat calix,</hi>
let that <hi>Cup passe,</hi> no more of that matter, for it is the <hi>physick</hi> that must first <hi>stirre</hi> the
humour, before it can <hi>purge</hi> it; And if our words apply to your consciences, the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
balm of the merits of your Saviour, and that thereupon your troubled consciences
finde some rest, be not too soon secure, but proceed in your good beginnings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in hearing, as we shall continue in all these manners of praying and intreating, which
fall into the word of our Text, <hi>Obsecramus,</hi> by being beholden to <hi>you</hi> for your applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or making <hi>you</hi> beholden to us, for our ministration, which was the first use of the
words, of <hi>grieving</hi> for you, or <hi>grieving you</hi> for your fins, which was the second, of <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:93359:187"/>
your <hi>consciences,</hi> and then of setling them again, in a calm reposednesse, which was
the third signification of the word in their Translation.</p>
                     <p>Yet does the Holy Ghost carry our <hi>office,</hi> (I speak of the manner of the execution of
our office, for, for the office it self, nothing can be more glorious, then the <hi>ministration</hi>
of the Gospel,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 15.</note> into lower terms then these. He suffered his Apostles to be thought to
be drink; They were full of the Holy Ghost, and they were thought full of new wine.
A dramme of zeal more then ordinary, against a <hi>Patron,</hi> or against a great <hi>Parishioner,</hi>
makes us presently scandalous Ministers. Truly, beloved, we confesse, one sign of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse
is, not to remember what we said. If we doe not in our practise, remember
what we preached, and <hi>live</hi> as we <hi>teach,</hi> we are dead all the week, and we are drunk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sunday. But <hi>Hannah</hi> praid,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 15.</note> and was thought drunk, and this grieved her heart;
so must it us, when you ascribe our zeale to the glory of God, and the good of your
souls, to any inordinate passion, or sinister purpose in us.</p>
                     <p>And yet hath the Holy Ghost laid us lower then this. To be drunk is an alienation of
the minde, but it is but a short one; but S. <hi>Paul</hi> was under the imputation of <hi>madnesse.</hi>
Nay,<note place="margin">Mar. 3. 21.</note> our blessed Saviour himself did some such act of vehement zeal, as that his very
friends thought him <hi>mad.</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> because his madnesse was imputed to a false cause, to
a pride in his much <hi>learning,</hi> disavowed his madnesse, <hi>I am not mad, O noble Festus.</hi> But
when the <hi>cause</hi> was justifiable,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 13. Theophil.</note> he thought his <hi>madnesse</hi> justifiable too; <hi>If we be besides
our selves, it is for God;</hi> and so long well enough. <hi>Insaniebat amatoriam insaniam Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> was mad for love; S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, and we doe take into our contemplation,
the beauty of a Christian soul; Through the ragged apparell of the afflictions of this
life; through the scarres, and wounds, and palenesse, and morphews of sin, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we can look upon the soul it self, and there see that incorruptible beauty, that <hi>white</hi>
and <hi>red,</hi> which the <hi>innocency</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ hath given it, and we are mad for
love of this soul, and ready to doe any act of danger, in the ways of persecution, any act
of diminution of our selves in the ways of humiliation, to <hi>stand at her doore,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and
begge, that <hi>she would be reconciled to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet does the Holy Ghost lay us lower then this too. Mad men have some fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
some twilights,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 10.</note> some returns of sense and reason, but the <hi>foole</hi> hath none; And, <hi>we
are fools for Christ,</hi> says the Apostle; And not onely we, the persons, but the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> the function it self is <hi>foolishnesse;</hi> It <hi>pleased God by the foolishnesse of preaching
to save them that beleeve.</hi> Anger will bear an action, and <hi>Racah</hi> will bear an action, but
to say <hi>Foole,</hi> was the heaviest imputation; and we are <hi>fooles</hi> for Christ, and pretend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to work by, but the foolishnesse of preaching. Lower then this, we cannot be cast,
and higher then this we offer not to climbe; <hi>Obsecramus,</hi> we have no other Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but to pray, and to intreat, and that we doe, in his words, in his tears, in his blood,
and in his bowels who sent us, <hi>we pray you in Christs stead,</hi> which is that that constitutes
our second Part, with what respect you should receive us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In mittendariis servanda dignitas mittentis.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Part.</note> To diminish the honour of his Master, is
not an humility, but a prevarication in any Ambassadour; and that is our quality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in this verse. God is the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> and he is the <hi>Prince of peace;</hi> He needs
neither the Armies of Princes, nor the wisdome of Councell Tables, to come to his

                        <hi>Ye have taken

and your great hearts are but little boxes in his cabinet, and he can fill them with deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

he sends Pursuivants, and Serjeants; he sends not Ambassadours; God does,
and we are they; and we look to be received by you, but as we perform those two laws
which binde Ambassadours, First, <hi>Reisuae ne quis legatus esto,</hi> Let no man be received as
an Ambassadour, that hath that title, onely to negotiate for himself, and doe his own
businesse in that Country; And then, <hi>Nemini credatur sine principale mandato,</hi> Let no
man be received for an Ambassadour; without his Letters of Credence, and his Masters
Commission. To these two we submit our selves.</p>
                     <p>First, we are not <hi>Rei nostrae legati,</hi>

in our own behalfs, and to doe our own businesse.</p>
                     <p>Indeed where men are sent out, to vent and utter the ware and merchandises of the
Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to proclaime, and advance the value, and efficacy of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>reliques,</hi> and superstitious charms, and incantations, when they are sent to sell parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sinnes at a certain price, and to take so much for an <hi>incest,</hi> so much for a <hi>murder,</hi>
when they are sent with many summs of Indulgencies at once, as they are now to the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and were heretofore to us, when these Indulgencies are accompanied with this
Doctrine, that if the Indulgence require a certain peece of money to be given for it, (as
for the most part they doe) if all the spirituall parts of the Indulgence be performed by
the poore sinner, yet if he give not that money, though he be not worth that money,
though that Merchant of those Indulgencies, doe out of his charity give him one of
those Indulgencies, yet all this doth that man no good, in these cases, they are indeed
<hi>Rei suae Legati,</hi> Ambassadours to serve their own turns, and do their owne businesse.
When that Bishop sends out his <hi>Legatos à latere,</hi> Ambassadours from his own chair and

those that are ill; They, those Legats <hi>à latere,</hi> are, (as they use to expresse it) incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the Pope, and therefore they are <hi>Rei sui Legati,</hi> Ambassadours that ly to doe

spirit against the flesh, when we present to you no other holy water, but the teares of
Christ Jesus, no other <hi>reliques,</hi> but the commemoration of his Passion in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
no other Indulgencies, and acquittances, but the application of his Merits to your
souls, when we offer all this without silver, and without gold, when we offer you that
Seal which he hath committed to us, in <hi>Absolution,</hi> without extortion or fees, wherein
are we <hi>Rei nostrae Legati,</hi> Ambassadours in our own behalfs, or advancers of our owne
ends?</p>
                     <p>And as we are not so,<note place="margin">Sine Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dato.</note> so neither are we in the second danger, to come <hi>sine Principali
Mandato,</hi> without Commission from our Master. Christ himselfe would not come of
<hi>himselfe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 12. 49.</note> but acknowledged and testified his Mission, <hi>The Father which sent me, he gave

produced their Commissions,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Neither received I it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
the revelation of Iesus Christ.</hi> How should <hi>they preach except they be sent?</hi> is a question
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> intended for a <hi>conclusive</hi> question, that none could answer, till in the
Romane Church they excepted <hi>Cardinals, Quibus sine literis creditur, propter persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
solennitatem,</hi> who for the dignity inherent in their persons, must be received, though
they have no Commission.</p>
                     <p>When our adversaries do so violently, so impetuously cry out, that we have no
Church, no Sacrament, no Priesthood, because none are sent, that is, none have a right
calling, for <hi>Internall calling,</hi> who are called by the Spirit of God, they can be no Judges,
and for <hi>Externall calling,</hi> we admit them for Judges, and are content to be tried by their
own <hi>Canons,</hi> and their own evidences, for our Mission and vocation, or sending and
our calling to the Ministery. If they require a necessity of lawfull Ministers to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of a Church, we require it with as much earnestnesse as they; <hi>Ecclesia non est
quae now habet sacerdotem,</hi> we professe with Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> It is no Church that hath no
Priest. If they require, that this spirituall power be received from them, who have the
same power in themselves, we professe it too, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> no man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
other power upon another, then he hath himself. If they require <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:93359:188"/>
in conferring Orders, we joyn hands with them. If they will have it a Sacrament; men
may be content to let us be as liberall of that name of Sacrament, as <hi>Calvin</hi> is; and he
says of it, <hi>Institut. l. 4. c. 14. § 20. Non invitus patior vocari Sacramentum, it a inter ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria
Sacramenta non numero,</hi> I am not loth, it should be called a Sacrament, so it be not
made an ordinary, that is, a generall Sacrament; and how ill hath this been taken at
some of our mens hands, to speak of more such Sacraments, when indeed they have
learnt this manner of speech, and difference of Sacraments, not onely from the ancient
Fathers, but from <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, who always spoke with a holy warinesse, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whatsoever their own authors, their own Schools, their own Canons doe require
to be essentially and necessarily requisite in this Mission in this function, we, for our
parts, and as much as concerns our Church of <hi>England,</hi> admit it too, and professe to
have it. And whatsoever they can say for their Church, that from their first Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they have had an orderly derivation of power from one to another, we can as justly
and truly say of our Church, that ever since her first being of such a Church, to this day,
she hath conserved the same order, and ever hath had, and hath now, those Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
sent, with the same Commission, and by the same means, that they pretend to
have in <hi>their</hi> Church. And being herein convinced, by the evidence of undeniable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
which have been therefore shewed to some of their Priests, not being able to deny
that such a Succession and Ordination, we have had, from the hands of such as were
made Bishops according to their Canons, now they pursue their common beaten way,
That as in our Doctrine, they confesse we affirm no Heresie, but that we deny some
Truths, so in our Ordination, and sending, and Calling, when they cannot deny, but that
from such a person, who is, by their own Canons, able to confer Orders, we, in taking our
Orders, (after their own manner) receive the Holy Ghost, and the power of binding and
loosing, yet, say they, we receive not the full power of Priests, for, we receive onely a
power <hi>in Corpus mysticum,</hi> upon the mysticall body of Christ, that is, the persons that
constitute the visible Church, but we should receive it <hi>in Corpus verum,</hi> a power upon
the very naturall body, a power of Consecration, by way of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
They may be pleased to pardon, this, rather <hi>Modesty,</hi> then <hi>Defect,</hi> in us, who, so
we may work fruitfully, and effectually upon the <hi>mysticall</hi> body of Christ, can be
content that his reall, and true body work upon us. Not that we have no interest
to work upon the reall body of Christ, since he hath made us Dispensers even of that,
to the faithfull, in the Sacrament; but for such a power, as exceeds the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who
in the <hi>incarnation</hi> of Christ, when he overshadowed the blessed Virgin, did but make
man of the woman, who was one part disposed by nature thereunto, whereas these men
make man, and God too of bread, naturally wholly indisposed to any such change, for
this power we confesse it is not in our Commission; and their Commission, and ours
was all one; and the Commission is manifest in the Gospel; and, since they can charge
us with no rasures, no expunctions, we must charge them with interlinings, and additions,
to the first Commission. But for that power, which is to work upon you, to whom we
are sent, we are defective in nothing, which they call necessary thereunto.</p>
                     <p>This I speak of this Church, in which God hath planted us, That God hath affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us all that might serve, even for the stopping of the Adversaries mouth, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
them in their own way: which I speak, onely to excite us to a thankfulnesse to
God, for his abundant grace in affording us so much, and not to disparage, or draw in
question any other of our <hi>neighbour Churches,</hi> who, perchance, cannot derive, as we can,
their power, and their <hi>Mission,</hi> by the ways required, and practised in the Romane
Church, nor have had from the beginning a continuance of Consecration by Bishops, and
such other concurrences, as those <hi>Canons</hi> require, and as our <hi>Church</hi> hath enjoyed. They,
no doubt, can justly plead for themselves, that Ecclesiasticall positive Laws admit <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation</hi> in cases of necessity; They may justly challenge a Dispensation, but we need
none; They did what was lawfull in a case of necessity, but Almighty God preserved
us from this necessity. As men therefore,<note place="margin">Bern.</note> 
                        <hi>Qui nec jussi renuunt, nec non jussi
affectant,</hi> which neither neglect Gods calling, when we have it, nor counterfeit it,
when wee have it not, <hi>Qui quod verecundè excusant, obstinatiùs non recusant,</hi>
who though wee confesse our selves altogether unworthy, have yet the seales of
God, and his Church upon us, <hi>Nec rei nostrae legati,</hi> not to promove our own ends,
but your reconciliation to God, <hi>Nec sine principali mandate,</hi> not without a direct
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93359:189"/>
and published Commission, in the Gospell, we come to you in Christs stead, and so
should be received by you. As for our <hi>Mission,</hi> that being in the quality of <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,</hi>
we submitted our selves to those two obligations, which we noted to lie upon
Ambassadours,<note place="margin">Receptio.</note> so here in our <hi>Reception,</hi> we shall propose to you two things, that are,
for the most part, practised by Princes, in the reception of Ambassadours. One is, that
before they give audience, they endevour, by some confident servant of theirs, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and understand the inclination of the Ambassadour, and the generall scope, and
purpose of his negotiation, and of the behavior that he purposeth to use in delivering his
Message; left for want of thus much light, the Prince might either be unprepared in
what manner to expresse himselfe, or be surprised with some such message, as might
not well comport with his honour to heare. But in these Ambassages from God to
man, no man is made so equall to God, as that he may refuse to give <hi>Audience,</hi> except
he know before hand that the message be agreeable to his minde. Onely he that will
be more then man, that <hi>Man of sinne,</hi> who esteemeth himselfe to be joyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
with God, onely he hath a particular Officer to know before hand, what mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
Gods Ambassadours bringeth, and to peruse all Sermons to be preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and to expunge, correct, alter, all such things as may be disagreeable to
him. It cannot therefore become you to come to these Audiences upon conditions;
to informe your selves from others first, what kinde of messages, such or such an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
useth to deliver; whether he preach <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Iudgement;</hi> that if he preach
against <hi>Vsury,</hi> you will heare <hi>Court-sermons,</hi> where there is less occasion to mention
it; If hee preach against <hi>Incontinency,</hi> you will goe; whither? Is there any place
that doth not extort from us, reprehensions, exclamations against that sinne?
But if you beleeve us to come in Christs stead, what ever our message be, you must
hear us.</p>
                     <p>Doe that, and for the second thing that Princes practise in the Reception of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
which is, to referre Ambassadours to their Councell, we are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to admit from you. Whosoever is of your nearest Councell, and whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
you best trust in, we are content to submit it to. Let naturall reason, let affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
let the profits or the pleasures of the world be the <hi>Councell Table,</hi> and can they
tell you, that you are able to maintaine a warre against God, and subsist so, without
being reconciled to him? Deceive not your selves, no man hath so much pleasure in
this life, as he that is at peace with God.</p>
                     <p>What an Organe hath that man tuned, how hath he brought all things in the world

plucked out your owne eyes, and have given them to me.</hi> Consider the zeale of any Church
to their Pastor, it will come short of the Pastor to the Church. All that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
saith of the <hi>Galatians</hi> towards him, is farre short of that which he said to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
That he <hi>could wish himselfe separated from Christ, for his brethren;</hi> or that of <hi>Moses,</hi> that
he would be <hi>blotted out of the Booke of Life,</hi> rather then his charge should. When we
consider the manner of hearing Sermons, in the Primitive Church, though we doe not
wish that manner to be renewed, yet we cannot deny, but that though it were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with many inconveniences, it testified a vehement devotion, and sense of that
that was said, by the preacher, in the hearer; for, all that had been formerly used in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters,
<hi>Acclamations</hi> and <hi>Plaudites,</hi> was brought into the <hi>Church,</hi> and not onely the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
people, but learned hearers were as loud, and as profuse in those declarations, those
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93359:189"/>
vocall acclamations, and those plaudites in the passages, and transitions, in Sermons, as
ever they had been at the Stage, or other recitations <hi>of their Poets, or Orators.</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
charges <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> that howsoever he differed from him in opinion after, yet when he
had heard him preach of the Resurrection before, he had received that Doctrine with
Acclamation and <hi>Plaudites.</hi> And as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith of himselfe, that he was thus
applauded in his Preaching; he saith it also of him whom he called his Master, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
Nazianzen,</hi> a grave and yet a facetious man, of him he telleth us this Story. That
he having intreated <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> to tell him the meaning of that place,<note place="margin">Luc. 6. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>What that second
Sabbath after the first was?</hi> he played with me, he jested at me, saith he, <hi>Eleganter lusit,</hi>
and he bad me be at Church next time he preached, and he would preach upon that
Text, <hi>Et toto acclamante populo, cogeris invitus scire quod nescis,</hi> and when you see all
the Congregation applaued me, and cry out that they are satisfied, you will make your
self beleeve you understand the place, as they doe, though you doe not; <hi>Et si solus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cueris,

in those <hi>Plaudites,</hi> the whole Congregation will thinke you the onely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
person in the Congregation; for, as we may see in Saint <hi>Augustin,</hi> the manner was,
that when the people were satisfied in any point which the Preacher handled, they would
almost tell him so, by an acclamation, and give him leave to passe to another point; for;
so saith that Father, <hi>Vidi in voce intelligentes, plures video in silent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

many, to whom, by this acclamation, I see, enough hath been said, but I see more that
are silent, and therefore, for their sakes, I will say more of it, Saint <hi>Agustine</hi> accepted
these acclamations more willingly, at least more patiently, then some of the Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had done; <hi>Audistis, laudastis; Deo gratias;</hi> you have heard that hath been
said, and you have approved it with your praise; God be thanked for both; <hi>Et laudes
vestrae foliae sunt arborum, sed fructus quaero;</hi> Though I looke for fruit from you, yet
even these acclamations are Leafes, and Leafes are Evidences that the tree is alive.
Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> was more impatient of them, yet could never overcome them. To
him, they came a little closer; for it was ordinary, that when he began to speake, the
people would cry out, <hi>Audiamus tertiumdecimum Apostolum;</hi> Let us hearken to the
thirteenth Apostle. And he saith, <hi>Si placet, hanc nunc legem firmabimus,</hi> I pray let

                        <hi>Ne quis auditor plaudat, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu

in a Sermon preached after this, <hi>Animo cogitavi Legem ponere,</hi> I have often pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to establish such a Law, <hi>Vt decore, &amp; cum silentio audiatis,</hi>

                        <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> (a Bishop himselfe, but whether <hi>then</hi> or no, know not)
saith of another Bishop, that hearing even <hi>praedicationes repentinas,</hi> his extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Sermons <hi>raucus plausor audivi,</hi> I poured my selfe out in loud acclamations, till
I was hoarse: And, to contract this consideration, wee see evidently, that this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
continued in the Church, even to Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> time. Neither is it left yet
in some places, beyond the Seas, where the people doe yet answer the Preacher, it
his questions be applyable to them, and may induce an answer, with these vocall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
<hi>Sir, we will, Sir, we will not.</hi> And truely wee come too neare re-indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
this vain glorious fashion, in those often periodicall murmurings, and noises,
which you make, when the Preacher concludeth any point; for those impertinent
Interjections swallow up one quarter of his houre, and many that were not within di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of hearing the Sermon, will give a censure upon it, according to the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
or paucitie of these acclamations.</p>
                     <p>These fashions then, howsoever, in those times they might be testimonies of Zeale,
yet because they occasioned <hi>vain glory,</hi> and many times, <hi>faction,</hi> (as those Fathers have

have said of a good Pastor and a good people; (which is the blessedest union of this
world) bendeth, and driveth, what, and how blessed a thing it is to be reconciled to
God.</p>
                     <p>Reconciliation is a redintegration, a renewing of a former friendship, that hath been
interrupted and broken. So that this implyeth a present enmity,<note place="margin">3 Part.</note> and hostility with God;
and then a former friendship with God, and also a possibility of returning to that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
friendship; stop a little upon each of these, and we have done.</p>
                     <p>Amongst <hi>naturall Creatures,</hi> because howsoever they differ in bignesse, yet they
have some proportion to one another,<note place="margin">Inimicus.</note> we consider that some very little creatures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
in themselves, are yet called enemies to great creatures, as the Mouse is to
the Elephant.(For the greatest Creature is not <hi>Infinite,</hi> nor the least is not <hi>Nothing.)</hi>
But shall man, betweene whom and nothing, there went but a word, <hi>Let us make
Man,</hi> That Nothing, which is infinitely lesse then a Mathematicall point, then
an imaginary Atome, shall this Man, this yesterdayes Nothing, this to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow
worse then Nothing, be capable of that honour, that <hi>dishonour able honour,</hi>
that confounding honour, to be the enemy of God, of God who is not onely a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipled
Elephant, millions of Elephants multiplied into one, but a multiplied World,
a multiplied All, All that can be conceived by us, infinite many times over; Nay,
(if we may dare to say so,) a multiplyed God, a God that hath the Millions of the
Heathens gods in himselfe alone, shall this man be an enemy to this God? Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be allowed so high a sinne, as enmity with God. The Devill himselfe is but a
<hi>slave</hi> to God, and shall Man be called his enemy? It is true, if we consider the infinite
disproportion between them, he cannot; but to many sad purposes, and in many
heavy applications Man is an enemy to God. <hi>Iob</hi> could goe no higher in expressing
his misery,<note place="margin">13. 24. 33. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Why hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</hi> and againe, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
he findeth occassions against me, and counteth me for his enemy.</hi> So man is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

adhere to Man, to ascribe any thing to the power of his <hi>naturall faculties,</hi> to thinke of
any beame of clearnesse in his own understanding, or any line of rectitude in in his owne
will, this is to accumulate and multiply enmities against God, and to assemble and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
up more, and more man, to fight against God.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is required,<note place="margin">Amici.</note> therefore there is an <hi>enmitie;</hi> but it is but a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore was a friendship; There was a time when God and Man were
friends, God did not hate man from all Eternitie, God forbid. And this friendship
God meant not to breake; God had no purpose to fall out with man, for then hee
could never have admitted him to a friendship.<note place="margin">August.</note>

this yeare, and meane to bee his enemy next. Gods foreknowledge that man and he
should fall out, was not a foreknowledge of any thing that he meant to doe to that
purpose, but onely that Man himselfe would become incapable of the continuation of
this friendship. Man might have persisted in that blessed amitie; and, since if he had
done so, the cause of his persisting had beene his owne will, I speak of the next and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

any thing towards inducing an enmity, ot doe any thing towards hindring this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation;
which reconciliation is, to be restored to as good an estate in the love of God,
as you had in <hi>Adam,</hi> and our estate is not as good, if it be not as generall, if the merit
of Christ be not as large, as the sinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> and if it be not as possible for you to
be saved by him, as it is impossible for you to be saved without him.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore but praying you in Christs stead, that you be reconciled to God. And,
if you consider what God is, The Lord of hosts, and therefore hath meanes to destroy
you, or what he is not, He is not man that he can repent, and therefore it belongs to
you, to repent first, If you consider what the Lord doth, He that dwells in the heavens
doth laugh them to scorne, and hath them in derision, or what he doth not, He doth
not justifie the wicked balance,<note place="margin">Mic. 6. 11.</note> nor the bag of deceitfull waights, If you consider
what the Lord would doe, <hi>Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how often would I have gathered thy

not doe, <hi>As I live, sayeth the Lord, I desire not the death of the wicked,</hi> if yee consider all
this, any of this,<note place="margin">Ezck. 33. 11.</note> dare you, or can you if you durst, or would you if you could, stand out
in an irreconciliable war against God? Especially if you consider, that that is more to
you, then what God is, and does, and would doe, and can doe, for you or against
you, that is, what he hath done already; that he who was the party offended, hath not
onely descended so low, as to be reconciled first, and to pay so deare for that, as the
bloud of his owne, and onely Sonne, but knowing thy necessity better then thy selfe,
he hath reconciled thee to him, though thou knewest it not; <hi>God was in Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
the world unto himselfe,</hi> as it is in the former verse; there the worke is done,
thy reconciliation is wrought; God is no longer angry so, as to withhold from thee
the meanes; for, there it followes, <hi>Hee hath committed to us the word of Reconciliation;</hi>
That wee might tell you the instrument of Reconciliation is drawn between God and
you,<note place="margin">Binius. To. 1. so. 320.</note> and, as it is written in the history of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> that two Bishops
who died before the establishing of the Canons, did yet subscribe and set their
names to those Canons, which to that purpose were left upon their graves
all night, so though you were dead in your sinne and enemies to God, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, (as all by nature are) when this Reconciliation was wrought, yet
the Spirit of God may give you this strength, to dip your pennes in the bloud
of the Lambe, and so subscribe your names, by acceptation of this offer of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.
Doe but that, subscribe, accept, and then, <hi>Caetera omnia,</hi> all the

Decree, and a <hi>Book of life</hi> in thy behalfe, if thou looke for it by this light,
and reach to it with this Hand, the acceptation of this Reconciliation? They
are written in those reverend and sacred Records, and Rolls, and Parchments,
even the skinne and flesh of our Blessed Saviour; written in those his stripes,
and those his wounds, with that bloud, that can admit to <hi>Index expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
no expunction, no satisfaction; But the life of his death lies in thy accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

                        </note> and then thou hast put on thy wedding garment. A man might
get into that feast, without his wedding garment; so a man may get into the
Church, to bee a visible part of a Christian Congregation, without this acceptation
of reconciliation, that is the <hi>particular apprehension,</hi> and application of Christ; but hee
is still subject to a remove, and to that question of confusion, <hi>Quomodo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trasti,</hi>
How came you in? That man in the Gospell could have answered to
that question, directly, I came in by the invitation, and conduct of thy servants, I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

may answer to Christs <hi>Quomodo intrasti,</hi> How camest thou in? I came in by faithfull
<hi>parents,</hi> to whom, and their seed thou hast sealed a Covenant; I was admitted by thy

hear them preach thy word, and doing the other externall offices of a Christian. But
there is more in this question; <hi>Quomodo intrasti,</hi> is not onely how <hi>didst</hi> thou come in,
but how <hi>durst</hi> thou come in? If thou camest to my feast, without any purpose
to eate, and so to discredit, to accuse either my meat, or the dressing of it, to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
at the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or at the <hi>Discipline</hi> of my Church, <hi>Quomodo intrasti,</hi> How didst
thou, how durst thou come in? If thou camest with a purpose to poison my meat,
that it might infect others, with a determination to goe forward in thy sinne, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Preacher say, and so to encourage others by thy example, <hi>Quomodo
intrasti,</hi> How durst thou come in? If thou camest in with thine own provision in

<hi>Sermons,</hi> or <hi>Sacraments, Qvmodo intrasti,</hi> How durst thou come in? Him that
came in there, without this Wedding garment, the Master of the Feast cals <hi>Friend;</hi>
but scornfully, <hi>Friend how camest thou in?</hi> But he cast him out. God may call us
<hi>Friends,</hi> that is, admit, and allow us the estimation and credit of being of his <hi>Church,</hi>
but at one time or other, hee shall minister that Interrogatory, <hi>Friend, how came you
in?</hi> and for want of that Wedding garment, and for want of wearing it in the sight of
men, (for it is not said that that man had no such Wedding garment at home, in his
Wardrobe, but that hee had none <hi>on)</hi> for want of <hi>Sanctification</hi> in a holy life, God
shall deliver us over to the execution of our own consciences, and eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>But be ye reconciled to God, embrace this reconciliation in making your use of those
means, and this reconciliation shall work thus, it shall restore you to that state, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had in Paradise. What would a soule oppressed with the sense of sin give, that she
were in that state of Innocency, that she had in <hi>Baptisme?</hi> Be reconciled to God, and
you have that, and an elder Innocency then that, the Innocency of <hi>Paradise.</hi> Go home,
and if you finde an over-burden of children, negligence in servants, crosses in your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
narrownesse, penury in your estate, yet this penurious, and this encumbred house
shall be your Paradise. Go forth, into the Country, and if you finde unseasonablenesse

And as in Paradise <hi>Adam</hi> at first needed no Saviour, so when by this reconciliation,

                        <q>For, the Children of Israel shall abide many dayes, without a King, and without a Prince,

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome Cosmographers have said, <hi>That there is no land so placed in the
world, but that from that land, a man may see other land.</hi> I dispute it not,
I defend it not; I accept it, and I apply it; there is scarce any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
expressed in the Scriptures, but that from that mercy you may
see another mercy. Christ sets up a candle now here, onely to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that one roome, but as he is <hi>lumen de lumine, light of light,</hi> so he
would have more lights lighted at every light of his, and make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
former mercy an argument, an earnest, a conveyance of more. Between land and
land you may see seas, and seas enraged with tempests; but still, say they, some other
land too. Between mercy, and mercy, you may finde Comminations, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but still more mercy. For this discovery let <hi>this text be our Mappe.</hi> First
we see land, we see mercy in that gracious compellation, Children, <hi>(the Children of
Israel)</hi> Then we see sea, then comes a Commination, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Judgement that shall last some
time, <hi>(many days</hi> shall <hi>the Children of Israel suffer)</hi> But there they may see land too, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mercy, even this time of Judgement shall be a <hi>day,</hi> they shall not be benighted,
not left in darkenesse in their Judgement; <hi>(many dayes,</hi> all the while, it shall
bee day) Then the text opens into a deep Ocean, a spreading Sea, <hi>(They shall bee
without a King, and without a Prince, and without a Sacrifice, and without an Image,
and without an Ephod, and without Teraphim.)</hi> But even from this Sea, this vast
Sea, this Sea of devastation, wee see land; for, in the next verse followes another
mercy, <hi>(The Children of Israel shall returne, and shall seeke the Lord their God, and
David their King, and shall feare the Lord, and his goodnesse in the later dayes.)</hi> And
beyond this land, there is no more Sea; beyond this mercy, no more Judgement, for
with this mercy the Chapter ends.</p>
                     <p>Consider our text then, as a <hi>whole Globe,</hi> as an <hi>intire Spheare,</hi> and then our <hi>two
Hemispheares</hi> of this Globe,<note place="margin">Divisio:</note> our <hi>two parts</hi> of this text, will bee, First, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versnesse
of ours, no rebellion, no disobedience puts God beyond his mercy, nor
extinguishes his love; still hee calls <hi>Israel,</hi> rebellious <hi>Israel his Children;</hi> nay his
owne anger, his owne Judgements, then, when hee is in the exercise thereof, in the
execution thereof, puts him not beyond his mercy, extinguishes not his love; hee
hides not his face from them then, hee leaves them not then, in the darke, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
their calamity with a light, hee makes that time, though cloudy, though
overcast, yet <hi>a day</hi> unto them; <hi>(the Children of Israel shall abide many days in this case.)</hi>
But then, as no disobedience removes God from himself, (for he is love, and mercy)
so no interest of ours in God, doth so priviledge us, but that hee will execute
his Judgements upon his Children too, even the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> shall fall into
these Calamities. And from this first part, wee shall passe to the second;
from these generall considerations, <hi>(That no punishments should make us desperate,</hi>
                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:93359:192"/>
that <hi>no favours should make us secure)</hi> we shall passe to the particular commination,
and judgements upon the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in this text, <hi>without King, without
Prince &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In our first part,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> we stop first, upon this declaration of his mercy, in this fatherly
appellation,<note place="margin">Filii.</note> Children, <hi>(the children of Israel)</hi> He does not call them children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
as though hee disavowed them, and put them off to another Father; but
therefore, because they are the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> they are his Children,
for,<note place="margin">Hose. 2. 9.</note> hee <hi>had maried Israel;</hi> and maried her to himselfe <hi>for ever.</hi> Many of
us are Fathers; and, from God, here may learne tendernesse towards chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
All of us are children of some parents, and therefore should hearken after the
name of Father,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> which is <hi>nomen pietatis &amp; potestatis,</hi> a name that argues their <hi>power</hi>
over us, and our <hi>piety</hi> towards them; and so, concernes many of us, in a double capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(as we are children, and parents too) but all of us in one capacity, as we are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
derived from other parents. God is the Father of man, otherwise then he is of
other creatures. He is the Father of all Creatures; so <hi>Philo</hi> calls all Creatures <hi>sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

suas,</hi> his sisters; but then, all those sisters of man, all those daughters of God are
not alike maried. God hath placed his Creatures in divers rankes, and in divers condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
neither must any man thinke, that he hath not done the duty of a Father, if he
have not placed all his Sonnes, or not matched all his daughters, in a condition equall
to himselfe, or not equall to one another. God hath placed creatures in the heavens,
and creatures in the earth, and creatures in the sea, and yet, all these creatures are his
children, and when he looked upon them all, in their divers stations, he saw, <hi>omnia
valde bora,</hi> that all was very well; And that Father that imploies one Sonne in learning;
another to husbandry, another to Merchandise, pursues Gods example, in disposing
his children, (his creatures) diversly, and all well. Such creatures as the <hi>Raine,</hi> (though
it may seem but an imperfect, and ignoble creature, fallen from the wombe of a cloud)
have God for their Father;<note place="margin">Iob 38. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>(God is the Father of the Raine.)</hi> And such creatures as
<hi>light,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iames 1. 17.</note> have but God for their Father. God is <hi>Pater l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>minum,</hi> the Father of lights. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we take lights there to be the <hi>Angels,</hi> created with the light, (some take it so) or
to be the severall lights set up in the heavens, Sun, and Moon and Stars, (some take
it so) or to be the light of <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>infusion</hi> by the Spirit, or the light of the <hi>Church,</hi>
in manifestation, by <hi>the word,</hi> (for, all these acceptations have convenient. Authors,
and worthy to be followed) God is the Father of lights, of all lights; but so he is of
raine,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 17.</note> and clouds too. And God is the <hi>Father of glory;</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> styles him) of
all glory;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> whether of those beames of glory which he sheds upon us here, in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
and preferments of this life, or that <hi>waight</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> which he reserves for us, in
the life to come. From that inglorious drop of raine, that falls into the dust, and rises
no more, to those glorious Saints who shall rise from the dust, and fall no more, but, as
they arise at once to the fulnesse of <hi>Essentiall</hi> joy, so arise daily in <hi>accidentiall</hi> joyes,
all are the children of God, and all alike of kin to us. And therefore let us not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our avowing, or our countenancing of our kindred, by their measure of honour, or
place, or riches in the world, but let us looke how fast they grow in the root, that is,
in the same worship of the same God, who is ours, and their Father too. He is nearest
of kin to me, that is of the same religion with me; as they are creatures, they are of
kin to me by the Father, but, as they are of the same Church, and religion, by Father
and mother too.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philo</hi> calls all creatures his <hi>sisters,</hi> but all men are his <hi>brothers.</hi> God is the Father of
man in a stronger and more peculiar, and more masculine sense, then of other Creatures.
<hi>Filius particeps &amp; con-dominus cum patre:</hi> as the law calls the Sonne, the partner of
the Father, and <hi>fellow-Lord, joint-Lord</hi> with the Father, of all the possession that is to
descend, so God hath made man his partner, and fellow-Lord of all his other creatures
in <hi>Moses his Dominamini,</hi> when he gives man a power to rule over them, and in <hi>Davids
Omnia subjecisti,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28. Psal. 8. 7.</note> when he imprints there, a naturall disposition in the creature to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of man. So high, so very high a <hi>filiation,</hi> hath God given man, as that, having
another Sonne, by another filiation, a higher filiation then this, by an <hi>eternall generation,</hi>
yet he was content, that that Sonne should become this Sonne, that the Sonne of <hi>God</hi>
should become the Sonne of <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God is the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>all;</hi>

of Israel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 6.</note> otherwise then of all other <hi>men.</hi> For he bought them; and, <hi>is not be thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that hath bought thee?</hi> says God by <hi>Moses.</hi> Not to speake of that purchase,
which he made by the <hi>death of his Sonne,</hi> (for that belongs to all the world) he bought
the Jews in particular, at such a price, such <hi>silver,</hi> and such <hi>gold,</hi> such <hi>temporall,</hi> and
such <hi>spirituall benefits,</hi> such a <hi>Land,</hi> and such a <hi>Church,</hi> such a <hi>Law,</hi> and such a <hi>Religion,</hi>
as, certainly, he might have had all the world at that price. If God would have
manifested himselfe, poured out himselfe to the <hi>Nations,</hi> as hee did to the <hi>Iews,</hi>

It was a Mothers part to give them <hi>suck,</hi> and to feed them with <hi>temporall blessings;</hi>
It was a Fathers part to <hi>instruct</hi> them, and to feed them with <hi>spirituall</hi> things; and God
did both abundantly. Therefore doth God submit himself to the comparison of a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay 49. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Can a woman forget her sucking child?</hi> But then, he stays not
in that inferiour, in that infirmer sex, but returns to a stronger love, then that of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(yes, (says he) <hi>she may forget, yet will not I forget thee.)</hi> And therefore, when <hi>David</hi>
says,<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Blesse the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits; David</hi> expresses that, which
we translate in a generall word, <hi>Benefits,</hi> in this word, <hi>Gamal,</hi> which signifies <hi>Ablactati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones;</hi>
forget not that God nursed thee as a Mother, and then, <hi>Ablactavit, we and thee,</hi>
and provided thee stronger food, out of the care of a father. In one word, all <hi>creatures</hi>
are Gods <hi>children; man</hi> is his <hi>sonne;</hi> but then, <hi>Israel</hi> is his <hi>first-born</hi> son; for that is
the addition,<note place="margin">Exed. 4. 22.</note> which God gives <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh, (Say unto Pharaoh, Israel is
my son, even my first-born.)</hi> Why God adopted <hi>Israel</hi> into this <hi>siliation,</hi> into this <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture,</hi>
before all the people of the world, we can assign no reason, but his love only.
But why he did not before this Text, dis-inherit this adopted son, is a higher degree,
and exercise of his love, then the Adoption it self, if we consider, (which is a usefull
consideration) their manifold provocations to such an <hi>exhaeredation,</hi> and what God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
at their hands.</p>
                     <p>The ordinary causes of Exhaeredation,<note place="margin">Exhaereda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> for which, a man might dis-inherit his son, are
assigned and numbred in the <hi>law,</hi> to be <hi>fourteen.</hi> But divers of them grow out of one
root, <hi>(Vndutifulnesse, Inofficiousnesse</hi> towards the father) and as, by that reason, they
may be extended to more, so they may be contracted to sewer, to two. These two, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,</hi>
and <hi>Irreligion. Vnthankfulnesse,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> were ever just causes of Exhaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
of Dis-inheriting. And with these two, did the Jews more provoke Almighty
God, then any children, any father. Stop we a little our Consideration upon each of
these.</p>
                     <p>He is not always ungratefull,<note place="margin">Ingratitudo.</note> that does not recompense a benefit, but he onely that
would not, though he could make, and though the Benefactor needed a recompense.

that is, without shewing my thankfulnesse by equivalent recompenses: This
which he cals <hi>unthankfulnesse,</hi> was <hi>thankfulnesse</hi> enough. There are men, (says the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

<hi>Acknowledgement</hi> is a good degree of <hi>thankfulnesse.</hi> But, ingratitude at the highest, (and
the <hi>Iews</hi> ingratitude was at the highest) involves even a <hi>concealing,</hi> and a <hi>denying</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and even a hating,<note place="margin">Bern.</note> and injuring of Benefactors. And so, <hi>Res peremptoria ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

says <hi>Bernard</hi> significantly, Ingratitude is a peremptory sin; it does <hi>Perimere,</hi> that
is, destroy, not onely all vertues, but it destroys, that is, overflows all other particular
Vices; no vice can get a name, where ingratitude is; it swallows all, devours all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all; <hi>Ingratum dicas, omnia dixisti,</hi> If you have called a man unthankfull, you have
called him by all the ill names that are: for this complicated, this manifold, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
vice, <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> the holy language, the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> lacks a word. The nearest root
that they can draw Ingratitude into, is <hi>Caphar,</hi> and <hi>Caphar</hi> is but <hi>Tegere,</hi> to hide, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
a benefit; but to <hi>deny</hi> a benefit, or to <hi>hate</hi> or <hi>injure</hi> a Benefactor, they have not a
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:93359:193"/>
word. And therefore, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> found not the word in the Hebrew, so in all Saint
<hi>Hieromes</hi> translation of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> (or in that which is reputed his, the <hi>vulgat</hi>
Edition) you have not that <hi>Latine</hi> word, <hi>Ingratus;</hi> Curious sinners, subtile self-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
they could not name Ingratitude, and in all the steps of Ingratitude, they excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all men, all Nations. From the Ingratitude of <hi>murmuring,</hi> upon which, God lays that
woe,<note place="margin">Isa. 55. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>(Woe unto him that says to his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast

                     <p>Their <hi>Ingratitude</hi> induced <hi>Idolatry</hi> in an instant.<note place="margin">Idololatria. Exod. 32. 1.</note> As soon as they came to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
<hi>murmuring,</hi> (As <hi>for Moses we cannot tell what is become of him)</hi> they came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to say to <hi>Aaron, (Vp and make us Gods that may goe before us)</hi> which is an impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
a leprosie, that derives it self farre, spreads farre, that as soon as our sins induce any
worldly crosse, any clamity upon us, we come to think of <hi>another Church,</hi> another <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and conclude, That that cannot be a good Church, in which we have lived in.
Now, against this impious levity, of facility in changing our Religion, God seemes to
expresse the greatest indignation,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 17.</note> when he says, <hi>They sacrificed unto gods whom they knew
not, to new gods.</hi> Men, amongst us, that have been <hi>baptized,</hi> and <hi>catechized</hi> in the truth,
and in the knowledge thereof, fall into ignorant falshood, and embrace a Religion which
they understand not, nor can understand, because it lies in the breast of <hi>one man,</hi> and is
therefore subject to alterations. <hi>They sacrifice to gods whom they know not,</hi> (says God)
and those gods <hi>new gods</hi> too; The more suspicious, for their <hi>newnesse;</hi> and, (as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
there) <hi>unto gods whom their fathers feared not.</hi> Men, that fall from <hi>us,</hi> (whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were of that Religion) put themselves into more bondage and slavery to the <hi>Court
of Rome</hi> now, then their fathers did to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> then; They sacrifice to gods,
whom they know not, and whom their fathers feared not, so much as they doe. But,
they <hi>have corrupted themselves;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note> (as God charges them farther) They are fallen from
us, whom no <hi>example</hi> of their fathers led that way; fathers have left their former su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
which they were born and bred in, and the sonnes, which were born, and bred
in the truth, have embraced those superstitions; <hi>Their spot is not the spot of children,</hi> (so
it follows in the same place) a weaknesse that might have that excuse, that they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of a reverentiall respect to their fathers, and followed their <hi>example; (for their
fathers have stood, and they are fallen. (Their spot is not the spot of children.)</hi> And, because
<hi>Kings</hi> are pictures of <hi>God,</hi> when they trun upon new <hi>gods,</hi> they turn to new pictures

<hi>Philistims?</hi> from a succession of enemies, at times, and from a league of enemies at
once, <hi>Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods,</hi> says God there; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(to that resolution <hi>God</hi> comes) <hi>Therefore, I will deliver you no more.</hi> And yet,
how often did God deliver them after this? <hi>Ingratitude, Idolatry,</hi> are just causes of
Exhaeredation; <hi>Israel</hi> abounded in both these, and yet, after all these, in this Text, he
cals them <hi>Children, The Children of Israel,</hi> and therefore his children.</p>
                     <p>God is kinde even to the unthankfull,<note place="margin">Dies.</note> saith christ himself, and himself calls Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,<note place="margin">Luc. 6. 35.</note>

Christ doth not disavow, not disinherit those children which gave most just cause of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heredation;
much lesse doth he justify, by his example, finall and totall <hi>disinheriting of
children,</hi> occasioned by single and small faults in the children, and grounded in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,

upon sudden, and passionate, and intemperate, and imaginary vowes, They have
vowed to doe it, therefore they will doe it; for, so they put a pretext of <hi>Religion</hi> upon
their <hi>impiety,</hi> and make <hi>God</hi> accessary to that which he dislikes, and upon colour of a
vow, doe that which is far from a service to God, as the performance of every lawfull,
and discreet vow is. God calls them his <hi>Children,</hi> (which is one) and then, though as a
Father he correct them, yet he shewes them his face, in that correction, (which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beam of his mercy) He calls their calamity, their affliction, <hi>Not a night, but a day,
(many dayes shall the children of Israel suffer this.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We finde these two words often joyned together in the Scriptures, <hi>Dies visitationis,
The day of visitation;</hi> though as it is a <hi>visitation,</hi> it be a sad, a dark contemplation, yet
as it is a <hi>day,</hi> it hath alwayes a cheerfulnesse in it. If it were called a <hi>night,</hi> I might be
afraid, that <hi>this night, They</hi> (I am not told who) <hi>would fetch away my soul;</hi> but,<note place="margin">Luc. 12. 20.</note> being a
<hi>day,</hi> I have assurance, that the Sunne, the Sunne of Righteousnesse will arise to me. <hi>At
the light of thine Arrowes, they went forward,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk.</hi> Though
they be <hi>Arrowes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. 11.</note> yet they are Torches too, though they <hi>burn,</hi> yet they <hi>give light</hi> too;
though God shoot his Arrowes at me, even by them, I shall have light enough to see
that it is God that shoots. As there is a heavy commination in that of <hi>Amos, (I will cause
the Sunne to goe down at noone, and I will darken the earth, in clear day)</hi> so is there a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promise,<note place="margin">8. 9.</note> and a constant practise in God, That he will (as he hath done) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
light of darknesse,</hi> and inable thee to see a clear day, by his presence, in the darkest
night of tribulation. For, truly, such a sense, (I think) belongs to those words in <hi>Hosea,</hi>
That when God had said, <hi>The dayes of visitation are come, the dayes of recompence are
come,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">9. 12.</note> God adds that, as an aggravating of the calamitie; <hi>yea, woe also to them, when I
depart from them;</hi> as though the oppression of the affliction, the peremptorinesse of the
affliction, were not in the affliction it self, hut in Gods <hi>departing</hi> from them, when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
them; they should be visited, but see no day in their visitations, afflicted from
God, but see no light from him, receive no consolation in him. In this place we take
it, (for the exaltation of your devotion) as a particular beam of his mercy) That though
the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were afflicted <hi>many dayes,</hi> yet still he affords them the name of
<hi>Children,</hi> and still their darke and cloudy dayes were accompanied with the light, and
presence of God, still they felt the <hi>Hand</hi> of God under them, the <hi>Face</hi> of God upon
them, the <hi>Heart</hi> of God towards them.</p>
                     <p>Those then,<note place="margin">Non securi.</note> which have this filiation, God doth not easily disinherit; because they
were his Children, after unnaturall disobediencies, he avowes them, and continues that
name to them. But yet, this must not imprint a <hi>security, a presumption;</hi> for, even the
children here, are submitted to heavie and dangerous calamities; when Christ himselfe
saith, <hi>The children of the kingdome shall be cast into utter darknesse,</hi> who can promise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a perpetuall,<note place="margin">Matt. 8. 12.</note> or <hi>unconditioned</hi> station? we have in the Scriptures two especiall Types
of the Church, <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>the Arke.</hi> But, in that Type, the <hi>Arke,</hi> we are principally
instructed, what <hi>the Church in generall</hi> shall doe, and in that in <hi>Paradise,</hi> what <hi>particular
men in the Church</hi> should do. For, we doe not reade, that in the <hi>Arke Noah,</hi> or his
company, did <hi>waigh</hi> any <hi>anchor, hoyst</hi> any <hi>saile, ship</hi> any <hi>oare, steare</hi> any <hi>rudder;</hi> but, the
<hi>Arke,</hi> by the providence of <hi>God,</hi> who onely was <hi>Pilot,</hi> rode safe upon the face of the
waters. The <hi>Church</hi> it selfe, (figured by the <hi>Arke)</hi> cannot shipwrack; though men sleep,
though the Devill wake,<note place="margin">Matt. 16. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>The gates of Hell shall not prevail against the Church.</hi> But in the
other Type of the Church, where every man is instructed in his particular duty therein,
<hi>Paradise, Adam</hi> himself was commanded to <hi>dresse</hi> Paradise, and to <hi>keep</hi> Paradise. And
when he did not that which he was injoyned to doe in that place,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15.</note> he forfeited his interest
in it, and his benefit by it. Though we be born and bred in Gods house, as <hi>Children
Baptized,</hi> and <hi>Catechized</hi> in the true Church, if we slacken our holy industry <hi>in making
fare our salvation,</hi> we, though <hi>Children of the Kingdome,</hi> may <hi>becast out,</hi> and all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
helps, and our proceedings by the benefit of those helps, shall but aggravate our
condemnation. <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> make up the Name of <hi>Christ;</hi> and, <hi>between Alpha</hi>
and <hi>Omega,</hi> are all the letters of the Alphabet included. A <hi>Christian</hi> is made up of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>
and <hi>Omega,</hi> and <hi>all between.</hi> He must <hi>begin well,</hi> (imbrace the true Church) and <hi>live
well</hi> according to the profession of that true Church, and <hi>die well,</hi> according to that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
holy life, and practise. <hi>Truth</hi> in the beginning, <hi>Zeale</hi> all the way, and <hi>Constancie</hi> in
the end make up a Christian. Otherwise for all this filiation, children may be disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:93359:194"/>
or submitted to such calamities as these which are interminated upon the children
of Israel, which constitute our second part, <hi>They shall be without a King, and without a
Prince, and without a Sacrifice, and without an Ephod, and without a Teraphim.</hi>

                     <p>Disobedient children are not cast off;<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> but yet disobedience is not left uncorrected.
Be <hi>mercifull,</hi>

but, just, as your Father in Heaven is just; Hate not the <hi>vice</hi> of a man so, as thereby to
hate the <hi>man</hi> himself. God hath promised to <hi>be an enemy to our enemies, an adversary to
our adversaries;</hi> but, God is no irreconciliable enemy, no implacable, no inexorable
Adversary. For,<note place="margin">Psalm. 139. 22.</note> that hatred which <hi>David</hi> calls <hi>Odium perfectum, (I have hated them
with a perfect hatred)</hi> is not onely a vehement hatred, but (as Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> calls it) <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
religiosum,</hi> a hatred that may consist with religion: That I hate not another man,
for his religion, so as that I lose all religion in my self, by such a hating of him. And
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls it <hi>Odium Charitativum,</hi> a hate that may consist with Charitie; that
I hate no man for his peremptory uncharitablenesse towards my religion, so as to lose
mine own Charity; for, I am come to one point of his religion, if I come to be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
as he. God and Kings are at a near distance, All <hi>gods;</hi> Magistrates, and
inferiour persons are at a near distance, all <hi>dust.</hi> As God proceeds with a King, with <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosaphat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Chro. 19. 2.</note>
in that temper, that moderation, <hi>(Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them
that hate the Lord?)</hi> So men with men, Magistrates with inferiour men, learned men
with ignorant men, should proceed with Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> moderation,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 14.</note> If <hi>any man</hi> obey not
(but be refractary, unconformable) note <hi>that man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>and have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with him,</hi> but <hi>yet count him not as an enemy.</hi> The union of the <hi>two Natures in Christ,</hi>
give us a faire example, that <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> may consist together. No <hi>Religion</hi>
induces <hi>Inhumanity;</hi> no Piety, no Zeal destroyes nature; and since there is <hi>a time to
hate, and a time to love,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 8. 3.</note> then is love most seasonable, when other civill contracts, civill
alliances, civill concurrences, have soupled and intenerated the dispositions of persons,
or nations, formerly farther asunder, to a better possibility, to a fairer probability, to a
nearer propinquity of hearkning to one another,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 16:</note> 
                        <hi>That Christ might reconcile both unto
God, in one body, by the Crosse, having slain the enmity thereby.</hi> Civill Offices may worke
upon religions too; and where that may follow, (That our mildnesse in civill things,
may prevail upon their obduration in religion) there is the time to love. But in cases,
where civill peace and religious foundations are both shaked, that the <hi>State</hi> and the
<hi>Church,</hi> as they are both in one <hi>bottome,</hi> so they are chased by one <hi>Pirate,</hi> I hate not with
a perfect hatred, not perfect <hi>towards God,</hi> except I declare, and urge, and presse home,
the truth of God, against their errours in my Ministery, nor perfect towards man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I advance, in my place, the execution of those Lawes against their practises, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, they are inabled, nay incouraged, nay perswaded, nay intreated to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in those practises. God himself proceeds against his own children so farre, (and
dearer then those children were to God, can no friends be to us, no allies to any Prince)
That <hi>they should be without King, without Prince, without Sacrifice, without Image, without
Ephod, without Teraphim;</hi> that is, without <hi>Temporall,</hi> without <hi>Ecclesiasticall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, then, we presume, we presuppose, (and that necessarily) every peece of this
part of our Text,<note place="margin">Comminatio.</note> to fall under the <hi>Commination;</hi> they were threatned with the losse of
every particular, and therefore they were the worse for every particular losse. Not the
worse onely because they thought themselves the worse, because they had fixed their
love and their delight upon these things, but because they were really the better for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, it was really a curse, a Commination, that they should lose them; as well that
they should lose their <hi>Ephod,</hi> and their <hi>Image,</hi> and their <hi>Teraphim,</hi> as that they should
lose their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> But first,(though that other fall also within the Commination, that
they should be without a <hi>setled form of Religion,</hi> without <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Ephod,</hi> and the
rest) the first thing that the Commination falls upon, is, That they should be without a
<hi>Civill form of government,</hi> without <hi>King,</hi> and without <hi>Prince.</hi> For, though our <hi>Religion</hi>
prepare us to our <hi>Bene esse,</hi> our <hi>well-being,</hi> our everlasting happinesse, yet it is the <hi>State,</hi>
the civill and peaceable government, which preserves our very <hi>Esse,</hi> our very <hi>Being;</hi> and
there cannot be a <hi>Bene esse,</hi> without an <hi>Esse,</hi> a well and a happy Being, except there be
first a Being established. It is the <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> that constitutes Families and Cities,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:93359:194"/>
and Propriety, and Magistracy, and Jurisdiction. The <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> preserves and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

not onely the <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> the <hi>Possessions</hi> of men, but the <hi>Me &amp; Te,</hi> the
very <hi>persons</hi> of men; The Law tels me, not onely whose land I must call every Acre,
but whose son I must call every man. Therefore God made the <hi>Body</hi> before the <hi>Soule;</hi>
Therefore there is in man a <hi>vegetative,</hi> and a <hi>sensitive</hi> soule, before an <hi>immortall,</hi> and
<hi>reasonable</hi> soule enter. Therefore also, in this place, God proposes first the Civil State,
the <hi>temporall Government,</hi> (what it is, to have a King and a Prince) before he proposes
the happinesse of a <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>Religion;</hi> not but that our Religion conduces to the
greater happinesse, but that our Religion cannot be conserved, except the Civil State,
and temporall Government be conserved too.</p>
                     <p>The first thing then that the Commination fals upon,<note place="margin">Sine Rege.</note> is the losse of their <hi>Temporall
State.</hi> But the Commination doth not fall so fully upon the exclusion of <hi>all formes</hi> of
Government, as upon the exclusion of <hi>Monarchy;</hi> It does not so expresly threaten an

                           </gap>rome.</note>
we take the Prophecy of this Text, to be fulfilled in that <hi>Dispersion</hi> which hath
continued upon the Jews, ever since the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Jews have been
so far from having had any <hi>King,</hi> as that they have not had a <hi>Constable</hi> of their owne,
in any part of the world; no interest at all, in any part of the Magistracy and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the world,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 12.</note> any where, but they are a <hi>whole Nation of Cains, fugitives,</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds.</hi>
But howsoever it be, the heat, and the vehemency of this Commination fals
upon this particular, <hi>sine Rege,</hi> they shall be without a King. It was long before God
afforded the Jews a King; and he did not easily doe it, then when he did it. Not, that
he intended not that form of Government for them, but because they would extort it
from him, before his time, and because they asked it onely in that respect, <hi>That they
might be like their neighbours,</hi> to whom God would not have had them too like: And
also, because God, to keep their thankfulnesse still awake, would reserve, and keep back
some better thing, then he had given them yet, to give them at last. For, so he says, (as
the <hi>Coronation</hi> of all his benefits to <hi>Israel,</hi> of which there is a glorious Inventary in that
Chapter) <hi>Thou didst prosper into a Kingdome;</hi> Till the Crown of glory be presented,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 13.</note> in
the comming of the Messias, thou canst not be happier. Those therefore that allow
but a conditionall Soveraignty in a Kingdome, an <hi>arbitrary, a temporary Soveraignty,</hi>
that may be transferred at the pleasure of another, they oppose the <hi>Nolumus hoc,</hi> we
would not have, we would not live under this form of Government, not under a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Monarchy, <hi>Nolumus hoc.</hi> Those that determine Allegiance, and civil obedience
onely by their <hi>own religion,</hi> and think themselves bound to obey none, that is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perswasion, they oppose the <hi>Nolumus hunc, We will not have this man to reign over us;</hi>
and so, make their relations, and fix their dependencies upon forein hopes, <hi>Nolumus
hunc.</hi> Those that fix a <hi>super-Soveraignty</hi> in the <hi>people,</hi> or in a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> they oppose
the <hi>Nolumus sic,</hi> we would not have things carried thus; They pretend to know the
happinesse of living under that form, A Kingdome, and to acknowledge the person of
the King, but they would be governed every man according to his own minde. And
all these, the <hi>Nolumus hoc,</hi> (they that desire not <hi>the continuance</hi> of that form, of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in an Independency, but would have a dependency upon a forein power;) And
the <hi>Nolumus hunc,</hi> (they that are disaffected to <hi>the person</hi> of him that governs for the
present;) And the <hi>Nolumus sic,</hi> (they that will <hi>prescribe</hi> to the King, <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>ways</hi> to
those ends:) all these assist this malediction, this commination, which God intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
here, as the greatest calamity, <hi>sine Rege,</hi> They <hi>shall be without a King;</hi> for this
is to <hi>Canton</hi> out a Monarchy, to <hi>Ravell</hi> out a Kingdome, to <hi>Crumble</hi> out a King.</p>
                     <p>There is another branch in this Part, which is of Temporall calamities,<note place="margin">Sine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe.</note> That they
shall be <hi>sine Principe, Without a King, and without a Prince.</hi> The word in the originall
is <hi>Sar;</hi> and take it, as it sounds most literally in our Translation, The <hi>Prince</hi> is the Kings
Son; so, this very word is used in <hi>Esay; Sar Salem;</hi> The <hi>Son of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 9. 9.</note> is called the <hi>Prince
of Peace.</hi> And so, the commination upon the Jews is thus farre aggravated, That they
shall be <hi>without a Prince,</hi> that is, <hi>without a certain heire;</hi> and <hi>Successor;</hi> which uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(more then any thing else) slackens the industry of all men at home, and sharpens the
malice of all men abroad; fears at home, and hopes abroad, discompose and disorder
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:93359:195"/>
all, where they are <hi>sine Principe,</hi> without a certain heire. But the word enlarges it selfe
farther; for, <hi>Sar</hi> signifies a <hi>Iudge;</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi> rebuked a Malefactor, he replies to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Who made thee a Iudge?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 2. 13.</note> And in many, very many places, <hi>Sar</hi> signifies a <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
in the Warres. So that where the <hi>Iustice</hi> of the State, or the <hi>Military power</hi> of the
State faile, (and they faile, where the men who doe, or should execute those places,
will not, or dare not doe, what appertains to their places) there this Commination fals,
<hi>They are without a Prince,</hi> that is, without future assurance, without present power, or
Justice.</p>
                     <p>But we passe to the <hi>spirituall</hi> Commination;<note place="margin">Damna spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualia.</note> that is, They shall be <hi>without Sacrifice,
without Ephod, without Image, without Teraphim.</hi> It is not that their <hi>understanding</hi> shall
be taken away, no, nor that the tendernesse of their <hi>conscience,</hi> or their <hi>zeale</hi> shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away; It is not that they shall come to any impiety, or ill opinion of God; They
may have religious, and well-disposed <hi>hearts,</hi> and yet be under a curse, if they have not
a <hi>Church,</hi> an outward <hi>Discipline</hi> established amongst them. It is not enough for a man
to beleeve aright, but he must apply himself to some Church, to some outward form of
worshipping God; It is not enough for a Church, to hold no error in <hi>doctrine,</hi> but it
must have <hi>outward assistances</hi> for the devotion of her children, and <hi>outward decency</hi> for
the glory of her God. Both these kindes are intended in the particulars of this Text,
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Ephod, Image</hi> and <hi>Teraphim.</hi>

                     <p>First,<note place="margin">Sine Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio.</note> it is a part of the curse, to be <hi>without Sacrifice.</hi> Now, if according to <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi>
interpretation, this Text be a Prophecy upon the Jews, after <hi>Christs time,</hi> and
that the Malediction consist in this, <hi>That they shall not embrace the Christian Religion,
nor the Christian Church entertain them;</hi> if the Prophet drive to this, They shall bee
without Sacrifices, because they shall not be of the Christian Church, certainly the
Christian Church is not to be <hi>without Sacrifice.</hi> It is a miserable impotency, to be afraid
of <hi>words;</hi> That from a former holy and just detestation of <hi>reall errors,</hi> we should
come to an uncharitable detestation of <hi>persons,</hi> and to a contentious detestation of
<hi>words.</hi> We dare not name <hi>Merit,</hi> nor <hi>Penance,</hi> nor <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> nor <hi>Altar,</hi> because they
have been abused. How should we be disappointed, and disfurnished of many words
in our ordinary conversation, if we should be bound from all words, which blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
men have prophaned, or uncleane men have defiled with their ill use of those
words? There is <hi>Merit,</hi> there is <hi>Penance,</hi> there is <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> there are <hi>Altars,</hi> in that
sense, in which those blessed men, who used those words first, at first used them. The
<hi>Communion Table</hi> is an <hi>Altar;</hi> and in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> there is a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Not onely a
Sacrifice of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> common to all the Congregation, but a <hi>Sacrifice peculiar
to the Priest, though for the People.</hi> There he <hi>offers up</hi> to God the Father, (that is, to the
<hi>remembrance,</hi> to the contemplation of God the Father) the <hi>whole body</hi> of the merits of
<hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and begges of him, that in contemplation of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> so offered, of
that Body of his merits, he would vouchsafe to return, and to apply those merits to
that Congregation. A Sacrifice, as farre from their blasphemous over-boldnesse, who
constitute <hi>a propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as from their over-tendernesse,
who startle at the name of <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> We doe not, (as at <hi>Rome</hi>) first invest the power
of God, and make our selves able to <hi>make</hi> a Christ, and then invest the malice of the
Jews, and <hi>kill that Christ,</hi> whom we have made; for, <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> Immolation, (taken so
properly, and literally as they take it) is a <hi>killing;</hi> But the <hi>whole body</hi> of <hi>Christs
actions</hi> and <hi>passions;</hi> we sacrifice, wee represent, wee offer to God. <hi>Calvin</hi> alone,
hath said enough, <hi>Non possumus,</hi> except we be assisted with outward things, wee cannot
fixe our selves upon God. Therefore is it part of the malediction here, that they shall
be <hi>sine Sacrificio,</hi> without <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> so is it also in inferiour helps, <hi>sine Ephod,</hi> they shall
be without an <hi>Ephod.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ephod</hi> amongst the Jews,<note place="margin">Sine Ephod.</note> was a <hi>garment,</hi> which did not onely distinguish <hi>times,</hi>
(for it was worne onely in time of divine Service) but, even in time of divine Service,
it distinguished <hi>persons</hi> too. For,<note place="margin">Exod. 26. 6.</note> we have a <hi>Pontificall Ephod,</hi> peculiar onely to the high
Priest; And we have a <hi>Leviticall Ephod,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 18.</note> belonging to all the Levites; <hi>(Samuel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linnen Ephod.)</hi> And wee have a
<hi>common Ephod,</hi> which, any man, that assisted in the service of God might weare; That
<hi>linnen Ephod,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 14.</note> which <hi>David</hi> put on, in that <hi>Procession,</hi> when he <hi>daunced before the Ark.</hi>
But all these <hi>Ephods</hi> were bound under certain Laws, to be worn by such <hi>men,</hi> and at
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:93359:195"/>
such times. Christs garment was not divided; nay, the Soldiers were not divided about
it, but agreed in one way; And shall wee, (the Body of Christ) bee divided about
the garment, that is, vary in the garment, by denying a conformity to that Decency
which is prescribed? When Christ devested, or supprest the Majesty of his outward
appearance,<note place="margin">Iob. 20. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

persons in secular habits, lose their respect. Though the very habit bee but a
Ceremony, yet the distinction of habits is rooted in nature, and in morality; And when
the particular habit is enjoyned by lawfull Authority, obedience is rooted in nature,
and in morality too. In a Watch, the string moves nothing, but yet, it conserves the
regularity of the motion of all. Rituall, and Ceremoniall things move not God, but
they exalt that Devotion, and they conserve that Order, which does move him.
Therefore is it also made a part of the Commination, that they shall be <hi>sine Ephod,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
these <hi>outward Rituall,</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall solemnities</hi> of a Church; first, without <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
which are more substantiall and essentiall parts of Religion, (as wee consider
<hi>Religion</hi> to be the <hi>outward worship of God,</hi> and then, <hi>without Ephod,</hi> without those other
assistances, which, though they be not of <hi>Gods Revenue,</hi> yet they are of his <hi>Subsidies,</hi>
and though they be not the <hi>soule,</hi> yet are the <hi>breath</hi> of Religion. And so also is it of things
of a more inferiour nature then Sacrifice or Ephod, that is of <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which
is our next, and last Consideration.</p>
                     <p>Both these words,<note place="margin">Image, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim.</note> (that which is translated, and called <hi>Image,</hi> and that which is
not translated, but kept in the originall word, <hi>Teraphim</hi>) have sometimes a good,
sometimes a bad sense in the Scriptures. In the First, <hi>Image,</hi> there is no difficulty;
good and bad significations of that word, are obvious every where. And for the
other,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 19.</note> though when <hi>Rachel</hi> stole her fathers <hi>Teraphim, (Images)</hi> though when the King
of <hi>Babylon</hi> consulted with <hi>Teraphim, (Images)</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 21. 21.</note> the word <hi>Teraphim</hi> have an ill sense,
yet,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 13.</note> when <hi>Michal, Davids</hi> wife, put an <hi>Image</hi> into his bed, to elude the fury of <hi>Saul,</hi>
there the word hath no ill sense. Accept the words in an Idolatrous sense, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they fall under the commination, and that God threatens it, as a part of their
calamity, that they should bee <hi>without their Idols,</hi> it hath beene, not inconveniently,
argued from this place, that even a <hi>Religion mixt with some Idolatry, and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
is better then none, as in Civill Government a <hi>Tyranny</hi> is better then an <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
And therefore we must not bring the same indisposition, the same disaffection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a person mis-led, and soured with some leaven of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as towards a person
possest with <hi>Atheisme.</hi> And yet, how ordinarily wee see, <hi>zealous men</hi> start, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and troubled at the presence of a <hi>Papist,</hi> and never moved, never forbeare the
society and conversation of an <hi>Atheist:</hi> Which is an argument too evident, that wee
consider <hi>our selves</hi> more then <hi>God,</hi> and that peace which the Papist endangers, more
then the Atheist, (which is, the peace of the State, and a quiet enjoying our ease) above
the glory of God, which the Atheist wounds, and violates more then the Papist; The
Papist withdraws some of the glory of God, in ascribing it to the Saints, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their own merits, but the Atheist leaves no God to be glorified. And this
use we have of these words, <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> if they should have an ill sense in this
place, and signifie <hi>Idols.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and others with him, take these words, in a good sense; to bee
the <hi>Cherubim,</hi> and <hi>Palmes,</hi> and such other representations, as God himselfe had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their Temple; and that the Commination falls upon this, That in some cases,
it may bee some want, to bee without some <hi>Pictures in the Church.</hi> So farre as they
may conduce to a reverend <hi>adoring</hi> of the place, so farre as they may conduce to a
familiar <hi>instructing</hi> of unlettered people, it may be a losse to lack them. For, so much
<hi>Calvin,</hi> out of his religious wisdome,<note place="margin">Institut. 1. 11. 7.</note> is content to acknowledge, <hi>Fateor, ut res se ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
hodiè, &amp;c. I confesse, as the case stands now,</hi> (says hee) (speaking of the beginning
of the Reformation) <hi>there are many that could not bee without those Bookes,</hi> (as hee
calls those Pictures) <hi>because then they had no other way of Instruction; but, that that
might bee supplied, if those things which were delivered in picture, to their eyes, were
delivered in Sermons to their eares.</hi> And this is true, that where there is a frequent
preaching, there is <hi>no necessity</hi> of pictures; but will not every man adde this, That
if the true use of Pictures bee preached unto them, there is <hi>no danger</hi> of an abuse;
and so, <hi>as Remembrancers</hi> of that which hath been taught in the Pulpit, they
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:93359:196"/>
may be retained; And that was one office of the Holy Ghost himselfe, <hi>That he should
bring to their remembrance</hi> those things, which had been formerly taught them. And
since, by being taught the right use of these pictures, in our preaching, no man amongst
us, is any more enclined, or endangered to worship a picture in a Wall or Window of
the Church, then if he saw it in a Gallery, were it onely for a reverent adorning of the
place, they may bee retained here, as they are in the greatest part of the <hi>Reformed</hi>
Church,<note place="margin">1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church, declare the sense of those times, concerning <hi>Images,</hi> yet they are wisely and
godly conceived; for the second is, <hi>That they shall not extoll Images,</hi> (which is not, that
they shall not <hi>set them up</hi>) but, (as it followeth) <hi>They shall declare the abuse thereof.</hi> And
when in the <hi>23 Injunction,</hi> it is said, That <hi>they shall utterly extinct,</hi> and <hi>destroy,</hi> (amongst
other things) <hi>pictures,</hi> yet it is limited to such <hi>things,</hi> and <hi>such pictures, as are monuments
of feigned miracles;</hi> and that Injuction reaches as well to pictures in private houses, as
in Churches, and forbids nothing in the Church, that might be retained in the house.
For those pernicious Errors, which the <hi>Romane Church</hi> hath multiplied in this point, not
onely to make Images of <hi>men,</hi> which never were, but to make those Images of men,
<hi>very men,</hi> to make their Images <hi>speak,</hi> and <hi>move,</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>bleed;</hi> to make Images
of <hi>God</hi> who was never seen, and to make those Images of God, <hi>very gods;</hi> to make their
Images doe daily miracles; to transferre the honour due to God, to the Image, and
then to encumber themselves with such ridiculous riddles, and scornfull distinctions,
as they doe, for justifying unjustifiable, unexcusable, uncolourable enormities, <hi>Va Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolatris,</hi>
woe to such advancers of Images, as would throw down Christ, rather then his
Image: But <hi>Vae Iconeclastis</hi> too, woe to such peremptory abhorrers of Pictures, and to
such uncharitable condemners of all those who admit any use of them, as had rather
throw down a Church, then let a Picture stand. Laying hold upon <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that fals within the <hi>Vae,</hi> the Commination of this Text, to be without those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
those Ephods, those Images, as they are <hi>outward helps</hi> of devotion. And,
laying hold, not upon <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> but upon <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, who is the God of love,
and peace, and unity, yet fals under a heavy, and insupportable <hi>Vae,</hi> to violate the peace
of the Church, for things which concern it not fundamentally. Problematicall things
are our <hi>silver,</hi> but fundamentall, our <hi>gold;</hi> problematicall out <hi>sweat,</hi> but fundamentall
our <hi>blood.</hi> If our Adversaries would be bought in, with our silver, with our sweat,
we should not be difficult in meeting them halfe way, in things, in their nature, <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi>
But if we must pay our Gold, our Blood, our <hi>fundamentall</hi> points of Religion, for
their friendship, A Fortune, a Liberty, a Wife, a Childe, a Father, a Friend, a Master,
a Neighbour, a Benefactor, a Kingdome, a Church, a World, is not worth a dramme
of this Gold, a drop of this Blood. Neither will that man, who is truly rooted in this
foundation, redeeme an Empoverishing, an Emprisoning, a Dis-inheriting, a Confining,
an Excommunicating, a Deposing, with a dramme of this Gold, with a drop of this
Blood, the <hi>fundamentall</hi> Articles of our Religion. Blessed be that God, who, as he is
without change or colour of change, hath kept us without change, or colour of change,
in all our foundations; And he in his time bring our Adversaries to such a moderation
as becomes them, who doe truly desire, that the Church may bee truly <hi>Catholique, one
stock, in one fold, under one Shepherd,</hi> though <hi>not all of one colour,</hi> of one practise in all
outward and disciplinarian points. Amen.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese are such words, as if we were to consider the <hi>words onely,</hi> might
make a <hi>Grammar</hi> Lecture, and a <hi>Logick</hi> Lecture, and a <hi>Rhetorick</hi>
and <hi>Ethick, a Philosophy</hi> Lecture too; And of these foure Elements
might a better Sermon then you are like to heare now, be well
made. Indeed they are words of a large, of an extensive compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.
And because <hi>all the words</hi> of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> are, in a
great measure, so, that invites me to stop a little, as upon a short
first part before the rest, or as upon <hi>a long entrie</hi> into the rest, to consider, not onely the
<hi>powerfulnesse</hi> of the matter, but the <hi>sweetnesse</hi> and elegancy of <hi>the words</hi> of the Word of
God in generall, before I descend to the particular words of this Text, <hi>He that oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the poore, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may justly accommodate those words of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 3. 24.</note> to God the Father, <hi>What God is
there in Heaven, or in Earth, that can doe according to thy workes?</hi> And those words of
<hi>Ieremie,</hi> to God the Sonne, <hi>Behold, and see, if there be any sorrow, like unto my sorrow;</hi>
And those to the Holy Ghost which are in <hi>Esay,<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 12.</note> Loquimini, ad Cor, speake to the heart,

                        <hi>A voyce of Thunder,</hi> and
after, <hi>A voyce of seaven Thunders talking with me:</hi> for, who can <hi>doe,</hi> like the <hi>Father,</hi>
who can suffer like the <hi>Sonne,</hi> who can <hi>speake</hi> like the <hi>Holy Ghost? Eloquia Domini,
eloquia casta,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 12. 6.</note> saith <hi>David, The words of the Lord are chaste words, sincere, pure words,</hi>
no drosse, no profanenesse, no such allay mingled with them; for, as it followeth there,
<hi>They are as silver tried and purified seaven times in the fire.</hi> They are as <hi>that silver,</hi>
that is so tried, and they are as <hi>that fire</hi> that trieth it. It is <hi>Castum,</hi> a <hi>Pure</hi> Word in it
self, and then it is <hi>powerfull</hi> upon the Hearer too; <hi>Ignitum Eloquium tuum vehementer,</hi>
saith he,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 140.</note> Thy word hath the vehement operation of fire; and <hi>therefore, thy servant
loveth it well,</hi> as it followeth there; Therefore, because it <hi>pierces;</hi> But therefore espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
because it carrieth a <hi>sweetnesse</hi> with it. For, the <hi>sting of the Serpent</hi> pierces, and
the <hi>toothe of the Viper</hi> pierces, but they carry <hi>venenosam salivam,</hi> a venimous and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
liquour with them.<note place="margin">103.</note> But <hi>Dulcia faucibus super Mel,</hi> Thy <hi>words are sweeter to
my mouth, then Hony;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 24.</note> then Hony it selfe. For, <hi>verba composita,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> chosen
words, <hi>studied,</hi> premeditated words, <hi>pleasing</hi> words, (so we translate it) are <hi>as a Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe.</hi>
Now, in the Hony combe, the Hony is collected and gathered, and dispensed,
and distributed from the Hony-combe, And of this Hony-combe is wax, wax apt for
<hi>sealing,</hi> derived too. The distribution of this Hony to the Congregation, The sealing
of this Hony to the Conscience, is in the <hi>outward Ordinance of God,</hi> and in the labour of
the <hi>Minister,</hi> and his conscionable fitting of himselfe for so great a service. But the
<hi>Hony-Combe</hi> is not the <hi>Hony,</hi> The gifts of the man, is not the Holy Ghost. <hi>Iacob</hi> laid
this blessing upon his sonne <hi>Naphtali, Dabit Eloquia pulchritudinis;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 21.</note> That he should be
a well-spoken, and a perswasive man. For, of a defect in this kinde, <hi>Moses</hi> complained,
and so did <hi>Esay,</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> did so too, when they were to be imployed in Gods service,
<hi>Moses</hi> that he was of <hi>uncircumcised; Esay</hi> that he was of <hi>unclean</hi> lips, and <hi>Ieremie</hi> that
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:93359:197"/>
he was a <hi>Childe,</hi> and could not speak; and therefore this was a Blessing upon <hi>Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali,</hi>
that hee should bee a well-spoken, and a perswasive man. For so, <hi>Moses,</hi> after
God had farther inabled him,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 1.</note> saith, <hi>Give eare, O yee Heavens, and I will speake;
Heare O Earth, the words of my mouth, My mouth,</hi> saith <hi>Moses;</hi> The Minister of God, that
cometh with convenient gifts, and due preparation, may speak such things, as Earth,
and Heaven it selfe may be content to heare. For,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 10.</note> when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>That to the
Principalities, and Powers in Heavenly places, the manifold wisdome of God, is made
known by the Church,</hi> that is, <hi>by the Ministery,</hi> and <hi>Service of the Church,</hi> and by that
which is done here, wee may congruously and piously beleeve, that even those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
and Powers in Heavenly places, <hi>The Angels of Heaven doe heare our Sermons,</hi>
and hearken how the glory of God is communicated, and accepted, and propagated
through the Congregation; and as they <hi>rejoyce at the conversion of a Sinner,</hi> so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
also at <hi>the means</hi> of their Conversion, the powerfull, and the congruous preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word of God. And therefore, let no man, though an <hi>Angell</hi> of the Church,
though an <hi>Archangell</hi> of the Church,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Archbishop,</hi> refuse to heare a man of ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
place, or inferiour parts to himself; neither let any man be discouraged by the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or meannesse of his Hearers: For, as the Apostle saith, with relation to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained Angels unawares,</hi> so, preach
to all, and that seat that thou thinkest empty, may have <hi>Angels</hi> in it: To them is the
manifold Wisedome of God made knowne by the Church, and Angels are here;
here, for the <hi>augmentation</hi> of <hi>their owne Ioy,</hi> in their fresh knowledge of the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kingdome of God, in this Congregation, and they are <hi>here,</hi> for <hi>their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation</hi>
that <hi>are not here,</hi> but frivolously and causelessely absent, or negligently, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently present, if they be here. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> might say, <hi>Give eare O yee Heavens,
though it bee but I,</hi> that <hi>speake;</hi> And hee might add, as he doth there, <hi>My Doctrine
shall droppe as the rain, and my speech shall distll as the dew.</hi> And why? <hi>Because I will
publish the Name of the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>Moses</hi> there; because I will deliver the Messages
of my God to his People.</p>
                     <p>What though you doe, must this be ascribed unto you? no, <hi>Moses</hi> claimeth not
that; for when hee had said, <hi>Give eare, O yee Heavens,</hi> (let no man thinke himselfe
too high, or too wise to heare me) and called it his Doctrine, and his speech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he published the Name of the Lord, yet he transferreth all upon God himselfe,
He establisheth their attentions with that <hi>Ascribe yee Greatnesse unto our God.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
me to make my selfe as acceptable a messenger as I can, and to infuse the
Word of God into you, as powerfully as I can, but all that I can doe, is but a small
matter, the greatnesse of the worke lieth in your Application, and that must proceed
from the Word of God it selfe, quickned by his Spirit, and therefore <hi>Ascribe all Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
unto our God,</hi> for that is the Hony, whatsoever, or whosoever be the Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe.
Truely, when I reade a Sermon of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> or of <hi>Chrysologus,</hi> or of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
Men, who carry in the very signification of their <hi>Names,</hi> and in their <hi>Histories,</hi>
the attributes of <hi>Hony mouthed,</hi> and <hi>Golden-mouthed Men,</hi> I finde my selfe oftentimes,
more affected, with the very Citation, and Application of <hi>some sentence of Scripture,</hi>
in the middest or end of one of their Sermons, then with any witty, or forcible pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of their owne. And that is it, which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth especially magnifie in
Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> After he had said, <hi>Quotiescunque lego, non verba mihi videor, sed tonitrua
audire,</hi> wheresoever I open Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, it is not a word or a sentence, but a
<hi>clappe of Thunder,</hi> that flieth out; he addeth moreover, <hi>Legatis,</hi> doe but use your selves
to the reading of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, <hi>Videbitis, in testimoniis quae sumit, ex veteri Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamento,
quàm Artifex sit, quàm prudens,</hi> you will easily see how artificially, how dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously,
how cunningly, and how discreetly he makes his use of those places which he
citeth out of the Old Testament; <hi>Videntur verba Innocontis, &amp;
rusticani;</hi> you would
take them saith hee, sometimes for words of some plain Country-man, (as some of
the Prophets were no other;) But before Saint <hi>Paul</hi> have done with those words,
<hi>Fulmina sunt, &amp; capiunt omne quod tangunt,</hi> hee maketh you see, that they are
flashes of lightning, and that they possesse, and melt, affect and dissolve every soul
they touch. And hence it is, Beloved, that I return so often at home in my private Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
that I present so often to Gods People in these Exercises, this Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That there are not so exquisite, so elegant Bookes in the World, as the Scriptures;</hi>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:93359:197"/>
neither is any one place a more pregnant example thereof, for the purity and <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,</hi>
for the force and <hi>power,</hi> for the largenesse and <hi>extention</hi> of the words, then
these which the Holy Ghost hath taken in this Text, <hi>Hee that oppresseth the poore,
reproaches his Master, &amp;c.</hi> And so we passe from this first Consideration, The power
and Elegancy of the whole word of God, in <hi>generall,</hi> to the same consideration in these
<hi>particular</hi> words.</p>
                     <p>The Matter,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> which in the generall is but this, <hi>That the poor must bee relieved,</hi> being
a Doctrine obvious to all; The Manner wil rather be our object, at this time: How
the Holy Ghost, by <hi>Solomons</hi> hand, hath enwrapped this Doctrine, in these words,
How the <hi>Omission</hi> of this Duty is <hi>aggravated,</hi> how the <hi>performance</hi> thereof is <hi>celebrated</hi>
in this Text, and in the force and elegancies thereof. Mans perversenesse hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Gods method; God made man good, but in a <hi>possibility</hi> of being ill; Now, God
findes man ill, but in a possibility of being good. When man was good, and enabled
to continue so, God began with him, with <hi>affirmative Commandements;</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that implied liberty and Soveraignty; such as that, <hi>Subjicite &amp; Dominamini,</hi>
Subdue the Creature, and rule over the Creature; and he comes not till after, to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi>
to <hi>Prohibitive Commandments,</hi> Commandments that imply infirmity, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility;
such as this, <hi>Of this Tree thou shalt not eate,</hi> upon thy life; this life, and the next,
thou shalt not. But now, because God findes man ill, and prone to bee worse, God
is faine to change his method, and to begin, and stop him at <hi>first</hi> with <hi>negative,</hi> and
<hi>prohibitive Commandments.</hi> So he does in the thirty fourth Psalm, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. (which
is also again repeated) first,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Depart from evill,</hi> and then, <hi>Doe good.</hi> For man brings
with him something into the world now, <hi>to forget,</hi> and to unlearn, before he can take
out any <hi>new lesson:</hi> Man is so farre from being good of himselfe, as that he must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
himselfe, devest himselfe, forsake himselfe, before he can be capable of any good.
And such is the method of our Text; Because God sees a naturall declination in man,
to abuse his power, to the oppression of inferiours, hee begins with that Prohibition,
<hi>Oppresse not the poore;</hi> And then when he hath brought them to that moderation, and
that temper, then he carries them farther towards perfection, to an honouring of God
in shewing mercy to the poor.</p>
                     <p>In which method, so disposed into two parts, the <hi>fault</hi> first, and then the <hi>duty,</hi> we
shall proceed by these steps; First, in the first, we shall consider the <hi>fault</hi> it self, <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;</hi>
which, in generall, is an unjust damnifying of others. And secondly, the
specification of the <hi>Persons,</hi> the <hi>Poore;</hi> for others, our <hi>Superiours,</hi> we may unjustly
damnifie too; but that is a fault of another nature; I should rather call it <hi>envy,</hi> or
<hi>emulation,</hi> or <hi>ambition,</hi> or <hi>supplantation,</hi> then oppression; and therefore that second
branch will fairly admit a little disquisition, a short comparison of those two kindes
of sinnes, <hi>Whether emulation of superiours, or oppression of inferiours, bee in the nature,
and roote thereof, the greater sinne.</hi> In which latter sinne, which is properly the sinne
of our Text, that is, <hi>oppression</hi> of the poore, we shall see, (in a third branch) the <hi>iniquity,</hi>
and <hi>hainousnesse</hi> thereof aggravated in this, that it is said to bee a <hi>Reproach,</hi> a
<hi>Contumely;</hi> and Contumely, and Reproach, against whomsoever it bee bent; hath
always a venemous, and a mischievous Nature. But much more here, where it is
bent against God himselfe; and <hi>against God</hi> in that supreme, and primary notion, <hi>as
a Creator,</hi> as a Maker, <hi>He reproaches the Maker;</hi> But then <hi>whose Maker?</hi> If I should
say I cannot tell, the words themselves, and the construction thereof, in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of the Hebrew Grammars, would justifie mine ignorance, for they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to bee easily determined, whether it bee <hi>Factorem ejus,</hi> or <hi>Factorem suum,</hi>
whether he that oppresses the poore, be said to reproach his <hi>Maker</hi> that is made poore,
or his own <hi>Maker:</hi> And therefore we shall make our use of both; for both meet to
aggravate the fault; If I oppresse the poore, I reproach him that made <hi>that poore man,</hi>
and made <hi>that man poore,</hi> and I reproach him that made <hi>me.</hi> And in these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
The fault, <hi>Oppression;</hi> the specification of the Persons, the <hi>Poore;</hi> the Probleme,
the <hi>Comparison</hi> of the two sinnes; the <hi>Aggravation,</hi> as it is a <hi>Reproach,</hi> a reproach
<hi>against</hi> God, and God <hi>as a Creator,</hi> as <hi>his</hi> Creator, as <hi>my</hi> Creator, wee shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
that first part. And when in our order thus proposed, wee shall come
to our second Part, which is the recommendation, and celebration of the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
it selfe, <hi>To honour God,</hi> by <hi>shewing mercy to the poore,</hi> wee shall first consider
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:93359:198"/>
the <hi>persons,</hi> the <hi>poore;</hi> and then <hi>the act, to shew mercy to the poore;</hi> and lastly <hi>the effect,</hi>
and benefit thereof; for, as the omission of the duty was aggravated with that, that it
was a <hi>reproaching</hi> of God, the performance thereof is exalted by this, <hi>That it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of God.</hi> After all which we shall conclude all, with the consideration of that
which is indeed the poorest of all, the sickest, and forest, and saddest, the feeblest and
faintest, the wretchedest, and miserablest thing in the world, <hi>your owne souls;</hi> and lead
you to see, how you do reproach God in oppressing, how you might honour God in
shewing mercy to those poore <hi>souls of yours.</hi> And this will be the <hi>compasse,</hi> in which I
shall lead your devotions for this houre; this will be the <hi>circle,</hi> which from this center,
<hi>reliefe of the poore,</hi> (which is the summe, and resultance of the Text) and by these poles,
the hainousnesse of the fault, the happinesse of the duty, I shall designe unto you.</p>
                     <p>We proposed at first, to consider our two parts,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> the <hi>fault,</hi> and the <hi>duty,</hi> in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of the words chosen by the holy Ghost here, according to their <hi>origination,</hi> and
<hi>extraction,</hi> in the nature of the words, and their <hi>latitude</hi> and <hi>extension,</hi> in their use, in
other places of Scripture. That we shall do; and in that way, our first word is <hi>oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
Gnashak</hi> in the Originall; and <hi>Gnashak,</hi> as it does oftentimes signifie <hi>vim, violence,</hi>
and force, so does it often signifie <hi>dolum, deceit</hi> and fraud also: so that <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
concurre in this oppression. And more then they. For <hi>Solomon</hi> does not depart
from that which he meanes,<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 5.</note> when he sayes here, <hi>He that oppresses the poore, reproaches
his Maker,</hi> when he sayes in <hi>another</hi> place, <hi>He that macks the poore, reproaches his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi>
So that now these three, <hi>violence,</hi> and <hi>deceit,</hi> and <hi>scorne</hi> are the elements, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
that make up this oppression. There is not a more <hi>brutish</hi> thing then vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
amongst beasts all goes by force. There is not a more <hi>devillish</hi> thing then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
the Serpent destroyed us all by that. But man hath raised a degree of oppression,
beyond beasts, and their violence, and beyond the devill, and his falshood, that is, <hi>scorn.</hi>
For, though the devill oppresse man, and hate man, he does <hi>not scorne man;</hi> he findes
man a considerable enemy. For when he hath throwne a man into the world, oppressed
with <hi>originall</hi> sinne, that man is not therefore his; the <hi>Sacrament of Baptisme</hi> frustrates
him of <hi>that</hi> Title. When he hath oppressed him in the world, by <hi>actuall and habituall</hi>
sinnes, that man is not therefore his, for a worthy receiving of <hi>the body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of
Christ Jesus frustrates him of <hi>that</hi> Title. And how weake soever man be in himselfe,
yet, <hi>in Christo omnia possumus,</hi> There is one man (and in that one man are all men, that
is, all mankinde, enwrapped) who lye open to the Serpent onely <hi>in his heele,</hi> and the
Serpent to him, in his head; and in him, <hi>Omnia possumus,</hi> in Christ, the weakest man can
do any thing. The Devill could oppresse <hi>Iob</hi> with <hi>violence;</hi> fire, and sword, and ruine
upon his goods, and cattell, and servants, and children, and himself too. The Devill
could oppresse him with <hi>deceit,</hi> corrupt the wife of his bosome, to tempt him to despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
but he never came to <hi>scorne Iob;</hi> for he saw <hi>Iob</hi> did not serve God for nought;
<hi>Iob</hi> had <hi>good wages,</hi> and God had hedged him, enclosed him, for himself. <hi>Scorne</hi> is an
affection, that implies such a heighth above another, as cannot be justified in any but
<hi>God</hi> himself. Man can oppresse by deceit; <hi>The Kings of the earth take counsell together;</hi>
they study how to circumvent;<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 2.</note> and man can oppresse with violence; there they <hi>breake
bands asunder,</hi> and cast <hi>away cords;</hi> they will be bound by no lawes. But then, it is
onely God, who there <hi>laughs them to scorne,</hi> and <hi>hath them in derision.</hi> Now here, the
oppressor practises the <hi>beasts</hi> part, he comes to violence, and the <hi>Devils</hi> part, he comes
to deceit, and he usurps upon <hi>Gods part,</hi> he comes to that heighth, as to think he may
scorn and contemne. And whom? for that is our next consideration; he oppresseth
the poore, he treads down the poore; him that was <hi>dust</hi> before, he treads into <hi>dirt,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated
with his own sweat, his own tears, his own blood. He oppresses him with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;</hi>
the credulous and confident wretch, who, because he is harmlesse in himself, is
fearelesse of others, he betrayes, he circumvents. And he oppresses with <hi>scorne;</hi> him
whom poverty hath made the subject of pity and of prayers, he makes the anvile of
scorne and of jeasts. For, so far, our first word, <hi>Gnashak,</hi> carries his signification and our
meditation, he oppresses by <hi>violence,</hi> by <hi>deceit,</hi> by <hi>scorne, brutishly, devillishly,</hi> and more,
(which is the <hi>qualification</hi> of the fault, and was our first consideration) and all this <hi>upon
the poore,</hi> (which is the specification <hi>of the persons,</hi> and is our second.)</p>
                     <p>You see <hi>who</hi> this <hi>oppressor</hi> is, and how you may know him; you have his markes;
<hi>Violence, deceit, scorne.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pauper.</note> But who is this <hi>poor man,</hi> and how shall you know him? How
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:93359:198"/>
shall you know, whether he that askes be truly poor or no? Truly, beloved, there is
scarce any one thing, in which our ignorance is more excusable then in this, <hi>To know
whether he to whom we give, be truly poor, or no:</hi> In no case is our inconsideration more
pardonable, then in this. God will never examine me very strictly, why I was no
stricter in examining that mans condition to whom I gave mine almes. If I give to one
that is poor in my sight, I shall finde that almes upon Gods score, amongst them, who
were poor in Gods sight: And my mistaking the man, shall never make God mistake my
meaning. Where I finde undeniable, unresistible evidence to the contrary, when I see a
man able in his <hi>limbes</hi> live in continuall <hi>idlenesse,</hi> when I see a man poore in his meanes,
and oppressed with his charge, spend in continuall <hi>drunkennesse,</hi> in this case, I were the
oppressor of the poor,<note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> if I should give to that man, for this were <hi>to give the childrens
bread to dogs.</hi> And that is not a name too bad for them; for, <hi>foris Canes,</hi> they are
dogs that are without, that is, <hi>without the Church:</hi> And how few of these, who make
beggery an occupation from their infancy, were ever within Church, how few of them
ever <hi>Christned,</hi> or ever <hi>maried? Foris Canes,</hi> they are dogs, that are without; and the
<hi>Childrens bread must not be given to Dogs.</hi> But to pursue our first intention, and so to
finde out these poor in the origination of the words chosen by the holy Ghost here, we
have in this text <hi>two words</hi> for the poor. One is <hi>Ebion;</hi> and <hi>Ebion</hi> is a begger. It was
the name given to one of those <hi>first heretiques</hi> who occasioned the writing of St. <hi>Iohns
Gospell;</hi> he was called <hi>Ebion.</hi> So that it may well be imagined, that those first Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
were <hi>Mendicants:</hi> Men that professed begging, and lived upon the labours, and
sweat of other men. For the <hi>Ebionit</hi> is a begger; not onely he that needs, but he <hi>that
declares his need,</hi> that askes, that craves, that begs: for, the root of <hi>Ebion</hi> is <hi>Ahab;</hi>
which is not onely to <hi>desire,</hi> but to <hi>declare</hi> that desire, to aske, to crave, to beg. Now,
this poor man must be relieved. The charity that God required in <hi>Israel,</hi> was,<note place="margin">Deut. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 22. 16.</note> that no
man should be put to this necessity, but provided for otherwise; <hi>There shall be no begger
amongst you;</hi> for, there is our very word, no <hi>Ebionite;</hi> that is, no poor man shall be put
to beg. But yet in the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that man is well spoken of, that <hi>did good even
to the Ebionit,</hi> to the begger; he that is brought to a necessity of asking, must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
Not that we are not bound to give, till another aske, or never to open our
hand, till another open his mouth; for, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did, in the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
<hi>a man may see a sound,</hi> see a voice. A sad aspect, a pale look, a hollow cheek, a
bloudlesse lip, a sonke eye, a trembling hand, speake so lowd, as that if I will not heare
them from him, God will heare them against me. In many cases, and with many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
it is a greater anguish to aske, then to want; and easier to starve, then to beg;
therefore I must hearken after another voice, and with another organ; I must <hi>hearken</hi>
with mine <hi>eye.</hi> Many times I may see <hi>need</hi> speake, when the <hi>needy man</hi> says nothing,
and <hi>his case</hi> may cry aloud, when he is silent. Therefore I must lay mine eare to the
ground, and hearken after them that lie in the dust, and enquire after the distresses of
such men; for this is an imitation of Gods <hi>preventing grace,</hi> that grace, then which we
can conceive no higher thing in God himselfe, <hi>(that God should be found of them, that
seek him not)</hi> if I relieve that man, that was ashamed to tell me he wanted. The <hi>Ebionit</hi>
the begger, but not he onely, must be relieved: for our word, in this part of the text,
is not <hi>Ebion,</hi> but a word derived from <hi>Dalal;</hi> and <hi>Dalal,</hi> in this word, signifies <hi>Exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,
attenuatum,</hi> a man whose <hi>former estate</hi> is exhausted, and gone, or whose <hi>present
labours</hi> doe not prosper, but that God, for ends best known to himselfe, exercises him
with continuall poverty; the word signifies also a man enfeebled, and <hi>decrepit with age;</hi>
and more then that,<note place="margin">Esay 38. 11.</note> the word signifies <hi>sicknesse</hi> too: for this very word we have in <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi>
mouth, <hi>The Lord will cut me off with sicknesse.</hi> So that now you have the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the person, who is the poor man, that is most properly the object of your
charity, he whose <hi>farmer estate</hi> is wasted, and not by his <hi>vices,</hi> but by the hand of God,
He whose <hi>present industry</hi> does not prosper, He who is overtaken with <hi>Age,</hi> and so the
lesse able to repaire his wants, and in his age, afflicted with <hi>sicknesse,</hi> and so the lesse able
to <hi>indure</hi> his wants. And this poor man, this <hi>labouring</hi> man, this <hi>decayed</hi> man, this
<hi>aged</hi> man, this <hi>sickly</hi> man, this oppressor in our text pursues; and pursues with <hi>violence,</hi>
with <hi>deceit,</hi> with <hi>scorne.</hi> And so have you the qualification of the fault, (which was our
first) and the specification of the persons, which was our second consideration.</p>
                     <p>But before we depart from this branch,<note place="margin">Problema.</note> I remember, I asked leave at first, onely to
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:93359:199"/>
stirre this consideration, onely to propound this Probleme, onely to aske this question,
<hi>whether Envy,</hi> and <hi>Emulation,</hi> and <hi>supplantation of Superiors, or this oppression,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcation</hi>
of <hi>Inferiours in this kinde, were in the nature,</hi> and <hi>root thereof,</hi> the <hi>greater sinne;</hi>
and surely the sentence, and the Judgement will be against this oppressor of the poor.
For, <hi>Envy,</hi> conceived against a man in place, hath evermore some <hi>emulation</hi> of those
gifts, which enable a man for that place. Whosoever labours to supplant another, that
he may succeed, will in some measure endevour to be fit for that succession. So that,
though it be but a <hi>squint-eye,</hi> and not a direct look, yet some eye, some aspect, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
man hath upon <hi>vertue.</hi> Besides, he that envies a higher person, he does not practise
(as the Poet says) <hi>sine talione;</hi> He deales with a man that can be at full even with him,
and can deale as ill with him. But he that oppresses the poor, digs in a dunghill for
wormes; And he departs from that posture, which God, in nature gave him, that is,
<hi>erect,</hi> to look upward; for his eye is always down, upon them, <hi>that lie in the dust,</hi> under
his feet. Certainly, he that seares up himselfe, and makes himselfe insensible of the
cries, and curses of the poor here in this world, does but prepare himselfe for the <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
&amp; <hi>gnashings</hi> of teeth, in the world to come. It is the Serpents taste, the Serpents diet,
<hi>Dust shalt thou eate all the days of thy life;</hi> and he feeds but on dust, that oppresses the poor.
And as there is evidently, more <hi>inhumanity,</hi> more violation of <hi>nature,</hi> in this oppression,
then in emulation, so may there well seem to be more <hi>impiety,</hi> and more violation of
<hi>God</hi> himselfe, by that word, which the holy Ghost chooses in the next place, which is
<hi>Reproach, He that oppresses the poor, reproaches his Maker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This word,<note place="margin">Reproach.</note> which we translate to <hi>Reproach, Theodotion</hi> translates to <hi>Blaspheme:</hi>
And blasphemy is an odious thing, even towards men. For, <hi>men</hi> may be blasphemed.
The servant of God,<note place="margin">Act. 6. 11. 1 Chron. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Moses,</hi> is blasphemed, as well as God: And <hi>Goliah blasphemed
the Israel of God,</hi> as well as the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> and, for the most part, where we read
Reviling, the word is Blaspheming. Our word here, (that we may still pursue our first
way, a reverent consideration of the elegancy of the Scriptures, in the origination of the
words) is <hi>Charak;</hi> and this word <hi>Iob</hi> uses, as it is used in our text, for reproach, <hi>My
heart shall not reproach me, so long as I live.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">27. 6.</note> And this, this reproaching of the heart, is,
in many cases, a Blaspheming, and a strange one, a <hi>self-blaspheming.</hi> When I have had,
by the goodnesse of Gods Spirit, a true <hi>sense</hi> of my sinnes, a true remorse, and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
of those sinnes, true <hi>Absolution</hi> from those sinnes, true <hi>seales of reconciliation</hi> after
those sinnes, true diligence, and preclusion of occasions of <hi>relapsing</hi> into those sinnes,
still to suspect my state in Gods favour, and my full redintegration with him, still to
deny my selfe that peace, which his Spirit, by these meanes, offers me, still to call my
repentance imperfect, and the <hi>Sacramentall seales ineffectuall,</hi> still to accuse my selfe of
sinnes, thus devested, thus repented, this is to reproach, this is to <hi>to blaspheme mine owne
soule.</hi> If I will say with <hi>Iob, My heart shall reproach me of nothing,</hi> this is not, that I will
accuse my selfe of no <hi>sinne,</hi> or say, the elect of God cannot sinne, no, nor that <hi>God sees
not</hi> the sinnes of the elect, nor that <hi>God is not affected,</hi> or angry with those sinnes, and
those sinners, as long as they remaine unrepented, but after I have accused my selfe of
those sinnes, and brought them into Judgement, by way of <hi>Confession,</hi> and received my
pardon under seale, in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and pleaded that pardon, to the Church, by a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<hi>amendment of life,</hi> then <hi>I reproach my selfe of nothing,</hi> for this were a self-blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming,
and a reproaching of mine owne soule. Now, the word of our text, in the
root thereof, <hi>Charak,</hi> is <hi>manifestare; prostituere;</hi> It is to publish the <hi>fault,</hi> or to prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the <hi>fame</hi> of any man, <hi>extrajudicially,</hi> not in a right forme of Judgement, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
those men, who are not to be his Judges. So to fill <hi>itching eares</hi> with rumours,
and whisperings, so to minister matter and fuell to <hi>fiery tongues,</hi> so to lay imputations,
and aspersions upon men, though that which we say, of those men, be true, is a <hi>libelling,</hi>
is a calumny, is a blaspheming and a reproach, in the word of this text: for it is <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festare,
prostituere,</hi> to publish a mans faults, and to prostitute a mans fame, there, where
his faults can receive <hi>no remedy,</hi> if they be <hi>true,</hi> nor his <hi>fame Reparation,</hi> if they be <hi>false.</hi>
It is properly, to speake ill of a man, and not before a competent Judge. And in such a
sense, a man may reproach God himselfe.</p>
                     <p>But is there then a Judge between God and man? <hi>Shall not the Iudge of all the earth
doe right?</hi> is <hi>Abrahams</hi> question;<note place="margin">Deus. Gen. 18. 25.</note> but there, that Judge of all the earth, is God himself.
But is there a Judge of heaven too? A Judge between God and man, for Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:93359:199"/>
there? There is. The <hi>Scripture</hi> is a Judge, by which God himself will be tryed.
As the Law is our Judge, and the Judge does but declare what is Law, so the Scripture
is our Judge, and God proceeds with us according to those promises and Judgements,
which he hath laid down in the Scripture.<note place="margin">Esay 9. 3.</note> When God says in <hi>Esay, Iudge betweene
me and my Vineyard,</hi> certainly, God means that there is something extant, some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
some covenant, something that hath the nature of a Law, some visible, some le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
thing, to judge by. And Christ tels us what that is; <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> says
hee; for, by them wee must bee tryed for our lives. So then, if I come to thinke that
God will call me in question for my life, for my eternall life, by any way that hath not
the Nature of a <hi>Law,</hi> (And, by the way, it is of the Nature and Essence of a Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it come to bind, that it be <hi>published</hi>) if I think that God will condemn me, by any
<hi>unrevealed will,</hi> any <hi>reserved purpose</hi> in <hi>himself,</hi> this is to reproach God, in the word of
this Text, for it is <hi>prostituere,</hi> to prostitute, to exhibit God, otherwise then he hath exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
himselfe, and to charge God with a proceeding upon secret and <hi>unrevealed purposes,</hi>
and not rest in his <hi>Scriptures.</hi> God will try us at last, God himself will be tryed all the
way by his Scriptures; And to charge God with the damnation of men, otherwise then
by his <hi>Tantummodo Crede,</hi> I have commanded thee to beleeve, and thou hast not done
that, And by his <hi>Fac hoc &amp; vives,</hi> I have commanded thee, to live well, and thou hast
not done that, which are conditions evidently laid downe in the Scriptures, and not
grounded upon any <hi>secret purpose,</hi> is a reproaching of God, in the word of this Text.</p>
                     <p>This,<note place="margin">Factorem.</note> this Oppressor of the poor is said to doe here; He <hi>reproaches the Maker;</hi> God,
in that notion, as he is the Creator. Now this is the clearest notion, and fastest appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
and first handle that God puts out to man, to lay hold upon him by, as hee is
<hi>The Creator.</hi> For though God did <hi>elect</hi> mee, before hee did actually create mee, yet
God did not <hi>mean</hi> to elect mee, before hee meant to create mee; when his purpose was
upon me, to elect me, surely his purpose had passed upon me, to create mee; for when
he elected me, <hi>I</hi> was <hi>I.</hi> So that this is our first notion of God towards us, as he is The
Creator. The <hi>School</hi> will receive a pregnant child from his parents, and work upon
him; The <hi>Vniversity</hi> will receive a grounded Scholar from the School, and work upon
him; The <hi>State,</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> will receive a qualified person from the University, and
worke by him. But still the State, and the Church, and the University, and the first
School it self, had something to work upon; But God, in the Creation, had nothing
at all: He called us when we were not, as though we had been. Now, here is this
world, <hi>we make our selves;</hi> that is, we make one another: <hi>Kings</hi> make <hi>Iudges,</hi> and
<hi>Iudges</hi> make <hi>Officers: Bishops</hi> make <hi>Parsons,</hi> and <hi>Parsons</hi> make <hi>Curats:</hi> But when wee
consider our Creation, <hi>It is he that hath made us,</hi> and <hi>not we our selves;</hi> we did not onely
<hi>not doe</hi> any thing, but we could not doe so much as <hi>wish</hi> any thing to be done, towards
our Creation, till wee were created. In the <hi>Application</hi> of that great worke, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of mankinde, that is, in the conversion of a sinner, and the first act of that
conversion, though the grace of God work all, yet there is <hi>a faculty</hi> in man, a <hi>will</hi> in
man, which is in no creature but man, for that grace of God to worke upon; But in
the Creation there was nothing at all. I honour my Physician, upon the reasons that
the Wise man assignes;<note place="margin">Ecclus. 38. 7.</note> because he assists my <hi>health,</hi> and my <hi>well-beeing;</hi> But I honour
not my Physician with the same honour as my Father, who gave me my very <hi>Beeing.</hi>
I honour my God in all those notions, in which he hath vouchsafed to manifest himselfe
to me; Every particular blessing of his is a Remembrancer; but my Creation is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wonder, and a mysterious amazement. And therefore, as <hi>David,</hi> the Father, wraps
up all stubborn ignorance of God, in that, <hi>The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God;</hi>
so <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Son,<note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 1.</note> wraps up all knowledge of God in that, <hi>Remember thy Creator;</hi> still
contemplate God in that notion, as he made thee of nothing, for, upon that, all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
additions depend. And when thou comest to any <hi>post-Creations,</hi> any after-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
in this world, to be made <hi>rich,</hi> made <hi>wise,</hi> made <hi>great, Praise thou the Lord, blesse
him, and magnifie him for ever,</hi> for those <hi>Additions,</hi> and blesse him for having made
thee <hi>capable</hi> of those Additions, by something conferred upon thee before, That he gave
thee a <hi>patrimony</hi> from thy parents, and thine <hi>industry</hi> working upon that, made thee
rich; That he raised thee to Riches, and the Eye of the State looking upon that, made
thee <hi>Honourable;</hi> But still return to thy first making, thy Creation, as thou wast made
of nothing, <hi>nothing;</hi> so low, as that not sin it self, not sin against the holy Ghost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:93359:200"/>
can cast thee so low again; nothing can make thee nothing; nothing that thou
canst <hi>doe</hi> here, nothing that thou canst suffer hereafter, can reduce thee to nothing. And
in this notion, this supreme, and Majesticall notion, does this oppressor of the poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
God; He reproaches the Maker. But then, whose Maker? for that is also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
branch, another Disquisition.</p>
                     <p>Here we accept willingly,<note place="margin">Ejus.</note> and entertain usefully their doubt, that will not resolve, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our <hi>Gnoshehu</hi> in the Text, be <hi>Factore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ejus,</hi> or <hi>Factore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Suum;</hi> whether this oppressor
of the poor be said here to reproach his Maker, that is made poor, or his own Maker.
Let them enjoy their doubt; Be it either; Be it both. First, let it be <hi>the poor Mans Maker,</hi>
And then, does this oppressor consider, that it is God that hath made that poor man, or
that hath made that man poor, and will he oppresse him then? If a man of those times,
had heard a <hi>song of Nero's</hi> making, &amp; had been told that it was his, (as that Emperour
delighted in compositions of that kind) he would not, he durst not have said, that it was a
harsh, an untunable song. If a man saw a <hi>Clock</hi> or a <hi>Picture</hi> of his <hi>Princes making,</hi> (as some
Princes have delighted themselves with such manufactures) hee would not, he durst not
say, it was a disorderly Clock, or a disproportioned picture. Wise Fathers have foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
children, and beautifull, deformed; yet we doe not oppresse, nor despise those chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
if we loved their parents; nor will we any poor man, if we truly love that God,
that made him poor; And, if his poverty be not of Gods making, but of the Devils,
induced by his riot and wastfulnesse, howsoever the <hi>poverty</hi> may be the <hi>Devils,</hi> still the
<hi>Man</hi> is of <hi>Gods</hi> making.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Probris afficit factorem ejus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Suum.</note> He reproaches Him that made that man poore, and
<hi>Probris afficit factorem suum,</hi> Hee reproaches that God who made him rich, his owne
Maker. Now, doth he consider, that the Devill hath super-induced a <hi>half-lycantro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi>
upon him, The Devill hath made him half a <hi>wolfe,</hi> so much a wolfe as that he
would tear all that fall into his power, And half a <hi>spider,</hi> so much a spider, as that hee
would entangle all that come near him, And half a <hi>Viper,</hi> so much a Viper, as that he
would envenome all that any way provoke him. Does hee consider that the Devill
hath made him half a wolfe, halfe a spider, half a viper, and doth hee not consider that
that God that is his Maker, could have made him a <hi>whole Wolfe,</hi> a whole Spider, a
whole Viper, and left him in that rank of ignoble, and contemptible, and mischievous
creatures? Does he not consider, that that God that made him richer then others, can
make him a prey to others, &amp; raise up enemies, that shall bring him to confusion, though
he had no other crimes, Therefore, because he is so rich? God can make his very riches
the occasion of his ruine here, and the occasion of his everlasting ruine hereafter, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
those <hi>riches snares</hi> and occasions of sin. God who hath made him, could have left
him <hi>unmade;</hi> or made him what he would; and he reproaches God, as though God could
have done nothing lesse for him, then he hath done, nor could not undone him now. But,
before we depart from this branch, consider we wherein this offender, this oppressor, sins
so very hainously, as to deserve so high an increpation, as to be said to <hi>Reproach,</hi> and to
<hi>Reproach God,</hi> and God in that supream <hi>Notion, A Maker, His Maker,</hi> and his <hi>own Maker.</hi>
If his fault be but neglecting or oppressing a poor man, why should it deserve all this?
In all these respects.</p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">In Orphanis.</note> The poor are immediately in Gods <hi>protection.</hi> Rich and poore are in Gods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
in his government, in his providence; But the poor are immediately in his
protection. <hi>Tibi derelictus est pauper,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 10. 14.</note> says <hi>David,</hi> The poor commits himself unto thee.
They are <hi>Orphans, Wards,</hi> delivered over to his tuition, to his protection. Princes have
a care of all their Allies, but a more especiall care of those that are in their protection.
And the poor are such; And therefore God more sensible in their behalfe. And so, hee
that oppresses the poor, Reproaches God, God in his <hi>Orphans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again,<note place="margin">In Imagine.</note> rich and poor are Images, Pictures of God; but, (as <hi>Clement of Alexandria</hi> says
wittily and strongly) The poor is <hi>Nuda Imago,</hi> a naked picture of God, a picture without
any drapery, any clothes about it. And it is much a harder thing, &amp; there is much more
art showed in making a <hi>naked picture,</hi> then in all the rich attire that can be put upon it.
And howsoever the rich man, that is invested in Power, and Greatnesse, may be a better
picture of God, of God considered <hi>in himself,</hi> who is all Greatnes, all Power, yet, of God
considered in <hi>Christ,</hi> (which is the contemplation that concerns us most) the poor man is
the better picture, and most resembles Christ who liv'd in continual poverty. And so, he
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:93359:200"/>
that oppresses the poor, reproaches God, God in his <hi>Orphans,</hi> God in his <hi>Picture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> carries this consideration farther,<note place="margin">In Corpore.</note> then that the poore is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
Gods Orphan, and more perfectly his picture, That he is more properly a
member of himself, of his body. For, contemplating that head, which was not so
much crowned as hedged with thorns, that head, of which, he whose it was, sayes, <hi>The
Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 19.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayes, <hi>Ecce caput Panperum,</hi>
Behold that head, to which, the poore make up the body, <hi>Ob eam tantùm causam vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiles,</hi>
sayes that Father, Therefore venerable, therefore honourable, because they are
members sutable to that head. And so, all that place, where the Apostle sayes, <hi>That
upon those members of the body, which we think to be lesse honourable, we bestow most honour,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 23.</note>
that Father applies to the poore, that therefore most respect and honour should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them, because the poore are more sutable members to their head Christ Jesus,
then the rich are. And so also, he that oppresses the poore reproaches God, God in
his <hi>Orphans,</hi> God in his <hi>Image,</hi> God in the <hi>Members</hi> of his owne body.</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> carries this consideration farther then this of Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi>
That whereas every creature hath <hi>filiationem vestigii,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Haeredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> that because God hath imparted
a being, an essence, from himselfe, who is the roote, and the fountaine of all essence,
and all being, therefore every creature hath a filiation from God, and is the Sonne of
God so, as we read in <hi>Iob,</hi> God is <hi>the father of the raine;</hi> and whereas every man hath
<hi>filiationem imaginis,</hi> as well <hi>Pagan</hi> as <hi>Christian,</hi> hath the Image of God imprinted in
his soule, and so hath a filiation from God, and is the Sonne of God, as he is made in
his likenesse; and whereas every Christian hath <hi>filiationem Pacti,</hi> by being taken into the
Covenant made by God, with the Elect, and with their seed, he hath a filiation from
God, and is the Sonne of God, as he is incorporated into his Sonne Christ Jesus, by
the <hi>Seals of the Christian Church;</hi> besides these filiations, of being in all creatures, of
the Image in all men, of the Covenant in all Christians, The poore, sayes that Father,
are not onely <hi>filii,</hi> but <hi>Haeredes,</hi> and <hi>Primogeniti,</hi> Sonnes and eldest Sonnes, Sonnes,
and Sonnes and Heires. And to that purpose he makes use of those words in St. <hi>Iames,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. 5.</note>
                        <hi>Hearken, my beloved brethren, hath not God chosen the poore of this world, rich in faith, and
Heirs of that Kingdome?</hi> Heirs,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 3.</note> for, <hi>Ipsorum est,</hi> sayes Christ himself, <hi>Theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven;</hi> And upon those words of Christ, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> comments thus,
<hi>Divites ejus regnitantum habent, quantum à pauperibus, eleemosynis coemerunt,</hi> The rich
have no more of that Kingdome of heaven, then they have purchased of the poore,
by their almes, and other erogations to pious uses. And so he that oppresses the poore
reproaches God, God in his <hi>Orphans,</hi> God in his <hi>Image,</hi> God in the <hi>Members</hi> of his own
Body, God in his Sonnes, and Heires of his Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>But then Christ himself carries his consideration,<note place="margin">In Seipso.
Mat. 25. 40.</note> beyond all these resemblances,
and conformities, not to a <hi>proximity</hi> onely, but to an <hi>identity,</hi> The poore are He. <hi>In as
much as you did it unto these, you did it unto me;</hi> and, <hi>In as much as you did it not unto
these, you did it not unto me.</hi> And after his ascension, and establishing in glory, still he
avowed them, not onely to be his, but to be He, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi>
The poore are He, He is the poore. And so, he that oppresseth the poore, reproaches
God, God in his <hi>Orphans,</hi> God in his <hi>Image,</hi> God in the <hi>Members</hi> of his owne Body,
God in the <hi>Heirs</hi> of his Kingdome, God in <hi>himself,</hi> in his own person. And so we have
done with all those peeces, which constitute our first part, the hainousnesse of the fault,
in the elegancy of the words chosen by the holy Ghost, in which you have seen, The
fault it self, <hi>Oppression,</hi> and the qualification thereof, by the marks, Violence, Deceit, and
Scorne. And then the specification of the <hi>persons,</hi> The poore, as he is the <hi>Eb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>onite,</hi> the
very <hi>vocall begger,</hi> and as the word is <hi>Dalal,</hi> a <hi>decayed,</hi> an <hi>aged,</hi> a <hi>sickly</hi> man; And in
that branch, you have also had that Probleme, Whether aemulation of higher, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of lower, be the greater sinne: And then, the aggravation of this sinne, in
those weights, That it is a reproach, a reproach of God, of God as The Maker, as His
Maker whom he oppresses, and as his own Maker; And lastly, in what respects especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
this increpation is laid upon him. And farther we have no occasion to carry that
first part, the fault.</p>
                     <p>In passing from that first part, the fault, to the duty, and the celebration thereof,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> in
those words of choice elegancy, <hi>He that hath mercy on the poore, honours God,</hi> though
we be to looke upon the persons, the <hi>poore,</hi> and the act, <hi>shewing mercy</hi> to the poore,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:93359:201"/>
and the benefit, <hi>honouring of God,</hi> yet, of the persons, (who are still the same poore,
poore, made poore by God, rather then by themselves) more needs not be said, then hath
been said already. And of the act, <hi>showing of mercy to the poore,</hi> onely thus much more
needs be said, that the word, in which, the holy Ghost expresses this act here, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same word,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 19.</note> in which, he expresses the free mercy of God himself, <hi>Miserebor cujus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serebor,
I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show mercy to whom I will show
mercy.</hi> So that God hath made the charitable man partaker with himself, in his own grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
attribute, his power of <hi>showing mercy.</hi> And then, left any man should thinke, that he
had no interest in this great dignity, that God had given him no meanes to partake of
this attribute of God, this power of shewing mercy to the poor, because he had left him
poor too, and given him nothing to give, the same word, which the holy Ghost uses in
this text,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 8.</note> and in <hi>Exodus,</hi> for mercy, which is <hi>Canan,</hi> he uses in other places, particularly
in the dedication of the <hi>Temple,</hi> for <hi>prayer.</hi> So that he, who being destitute of other
meanes to relieve the poore, <hi>prayes</hi> for the poore, is thereby made partaker of this great
attribute of Gods, this power of showing mercy. He hath showed mercy to the poore,
if, having nothing to give, he have given <hi>mild and confortable words,</hi> and have prayed
to his abundant, and inexhaustible God, to relieve that poor man, whom he hath not
made him able to relieve.</p>
                     <p>So then,<note place="margin">Honorat
Detem.</note> no more being needfull to be said, of the persons, the poor, nor of the Act,
showing of mercy to the poor, there remaines no more in this last part, but according
to our way, all the way, to consider the origination and latitude of this last word, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>had,</hi>
this <hi>honouring of God.</hi> The word does properly signifie <hi>Augere, ampliare,</hi> To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
God, to amplifie, to dilate God; to make infinite God, shall I dare to say, more
<hi>God?</hi> certainely, <hi>God to more,</hi> then he was before. O who can expresse this abundant,
this superabundant largenesse of Gods goodnesse to man, that there is a power put into
mans hands, to enlarge God, to dilate, to propagate, to amplifie God himselfe! <hi>I will
multiply this people,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 30. 19.</note> says God, <hi>and they shall not be few, I will glorifie them, and they shall
not be small;</hi> there's the word of our text. God enables me to glorifie him, to amplifie
him, to encrease him, by my mercy, my almes. For this is not onely that encrease, that
Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> intends, that he that hath pity on the poor, <hi>Foeneratur Domino, he lends
upon use to the Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 17.</note> for, this, though it be an encrease, is but an encrease to <hi>himselfe;</hi> but
he that showes mercy to the poore, <hi>encreases God,</hi> says our text, dilates, enlarges God.
How?<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Corpus aptasti mihi;</hi> when Christ comes into the world, (says Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) he says
to his Father, <hi>Thou hast prepared and fitted a body for me.</hi> That was his <hi>naturall body,</hi>
that body which he assumed in the bowels of the blessed Virgin. They that pretend to
enlarge this body by multiplication, by making millions of these bodies in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
by the way of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> they doe not honour this body, whose honour
is to sit in the same dimensions, and circumscriptions, at the right hand of God. But
then, as at his comming into this world, God had fitted him a body, so in the world, he
had fitted himselfe another body, a <hi>Mysticall body,</hi> a Church purchased with his bloud.
Now this body, this Mysticall body I feed, I enlarge, I dilate, and amplifie, by my
mercy,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 1.</note> and my charity. For, as God says to <hi>Ierusalem, Thou wast in thy bloud, thou wast
not salted, nor swadled, no eye pityed thee, but thou wast cast out into the open field, and I loved
thee, I washed thee, I apparelled and adorned thee, &amp; prosperataes in regnum, I never gave
thee over, till I saw thee an established kingdome:</hi> so may all those Saints of God say to
God himselfe, to the Sonne of God invested in this body, this mysticall body, the
Church, thou was cast out into the open field, all the world persecuted thee, and then
we gave thee suck with our bloud, we clothed thee with our bodies, we built thee houses
and adorned and endowed those houses to thine honour, <hi>&amp; prosperatus es in regnum,</hi> we
never gave over spending, and doing, and suffering for thy glory, till thou hadst an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
kingdome, over all the earth. And so thou, thy body, thy mysticall body, the
Church, is honoured, that is, amplified, dilated, enlarged, by our mercy. <hi>Magnificat
Anima mea Dominum,</hi> was the exultation of the blessed Virgin; <hi>My soule doth magnifie
the Lord.</hi> When the meditations of my heart, digested into writing, or preaching, or
any other declaration of Gods glory, carry, or advance the knowledge of God, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, then <hi>My soule doth magnifie the Lord,</hi> enlarge, dilate, amplifie God. But when
I relieve any poor wretch, of the houshold of the faithfull, with mine almes, then my
<hi>mercy magnifies the Lord,</hi> occasions him that receives, to magnifie the Lord by this thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:93359:201"/>
and them that see it to magnifie the Lord by their imitation, in the like works
of mercy. And so far, doe these two elegant words chosen here by the holy Ghost,
carry our meditation: in the first, <hi>Canan,</hi> God makes the charitable man partaker of his
own highest power, mercy; and in the other <hi>Cabad,</hi> God enables us, by this mercy, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him so far, as to dilate, to enlarge, to amplifie him, that is that body, which he
in his Sonne, hath invested by purchase, his Church.</p>
                     <p>We have done;<note place="margin">Conclusic.</note> If you will but claspe up all this in your owne bosomes, if you will
but lay it to your owne hearts, you may goe. A poorer thing is not in the world, nor
a sicker, (which you may remember to have been one signification of this word poore)
then <hi>thine own soule.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Chalde paraphrase</hi> renders this text thus, <hi>He that
oppresses the poore reproaches his owne soule;</hi> for, his owne soule is as poore, as any whom
he can oppresse. To a begger, that needs, and askes but bodily things, thou wilt say,
<hi>Alasse poore soule;</hi> and wilt thou never say <hi>Alasse poore soule</hi> to thy self, that needest spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things? If thy affections, thy pleasures, thy delights, beg of thee, and importune thee
so farre, to bestow upon them, say unto them, <hi>I have those that are nearer me then you,</hi>
Wife and Children, and I must not empoverith them, to give unto you, I must not
sterve my family, to feed my pleasures. But if this Wife and Children begge, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune

all the Congregation about thee is melted into holy tears; Be not as <hi>Gideons fleece</hi> dry,
when all else is wet, nor as that fleece, <hi>wet when all about it was dry:</hi> Be not jealous of
God, stand not here as a person unconcerned, disinteressed; as though those gracious
promises, which God is pleased to shed down upon the whole Congregation, from
this place, appertained not to thee, but that all those Judgements denounced here, over
which, they that stand by thee, are able, by a faithfull and cheerfull laying hold of
Gods offers, though they stand guilty of the same sinnes that thou doest, to lift up their
heads, must still necessarily overflow and surround thee. Oppresse not that soule, by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
by Fraud, nor by Scorne, which was the other signification of this word Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.

Damnation is a serious thing, and this aggravates it, that we slight and make jests at
that which should save us, the Scriptures, and the Ordinances of God. For by this
oppression of thy poore soule, by this Violence, this Fraud, this Scorne, thou
wilt come to Reproach thy Maker, to impute that losse of thy soule, which
thou hast incurred by often breach of Lawes evidently manifested to thee; to
his <hi>secret purpose,</hi> and <hi>un-revealed</hi> will; then which, thou canst not put a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reproach, a greater Contumely, a greater Blasphemy upon God. For,
God cannot bee God, if hee bee not innocent, nor innocent if hee draw bloud
of mee, for his owne Act. But if thou show mercy to this soule, mercy in
that signification of the word, as it denotes an actuall <hi>performance</hi> of those
things that are necessary for the making sure of thy salvation, or, if thou canst
not yet attaine to those degrees of Sanctification, mercy in that signification of
the word, as the word denotes hearty and earnest <hi>Prayer,</hi> that thou couldest,
<hi>Lord I beleeve, Lord help mine unbeliefe,</hi> Lord I stand yet, yet Lord raise mee
when I fall, <hi>Honorabis Deum,</hi> thou shalt honour God, in the sense of
the word in this Text, thou shalt enlarge God, amplifie, dilate God, that
is, the Body of God, the Church, both here, and hereafter. For, thou
shalt adde a figure to the <hi>number of his</hi> Saints, and there shall bee a Saint the

They shall have one occasion of rejoycing the more from thee: Thou shalt adde a

Resurrection, for, Thou shalt adde a step to the Resurrection it selfe, by having brought
it so much nearer, as to have done thy part for the filling up of the number of the
Saints, upon which fulnesse the Resurrection shall follow. And thou shalt adde a

out the Book it selfe in the number.<note place="margin">Castro.</note> But one of their own <hi>Iesuits,</hi> though some,
(whom in that Canon they seeme to follow) make this Booke of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> but
an Appendix to the Prophecy of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> determines, for all that Canon, that it is
a <hi>distinct Book.</hi> Indeed, if it were not, the first Chapter would have been called,
the 53 of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and not the <hi>first of the Lamentations.</hi> But that which gives
most assurednesse, is, That in divers <hi>Hebrew Bibles,</hi> it is placed otherwise, then
wee place it, and not presently, and immediately after the Prophecy of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
but discontinued from him, though hee were never doubted to be the Author
thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Booke is certainly the <hi>Prophet Ieremies,</hi> and certainly a <hi>distinct booke,</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Book be a <hi>history,</hi> or a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> whether <hi>Ieremy</hi> lament that which hee had
<hi>seen,</hi> or that which he <hi>foresees,</hi> calamities past, or future calamities, things done, or
things to be done, is a question which hath exercised, and busied divers Expositors. But,
as we say of the <hi>Parable of Dives,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that it is a <hi>Historicall parable,</hi> and a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall history,</hi> some such persons there were, and some such things were really done,
but some other things were figuratively, symbolically, parabolically added: So wee say
of <hi>Ieremies Lamentation,</hi> It is a <hi>Propheticall history,</hi> and a <hi>Historicall prophecy;</hi> Some of
the sad occasions of these Lamentations were past, when he writ, and some were to come
after: for, we may not despise the testimony of the <hi>Chalde Paraphrasts,</hi> who were the
first that illustrated the Bible, in that Nation, nor of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> who was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with the Bible, and with that Nation, nor of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who had justly so much
estimation in that Nation, nor of those later <hi>Rabbins,</hi> who were the learnedest of that
Nation; who are all of opinion, that <hi>Ieremy</hi> writ these Lamentations, after hee saw
some declinations in that State, in the <hi>death of Iosiah,</hi> and so the Book is <hi>Historicall,</hi> but
when he onely foresaw their transportation into <hi>Babylon,</hi> before that calamity fell upon
them, and so it is <hi>Propheticall.</hi> Or, if we take the exposition of the others, That the
whole Booke was written after their transportation into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to be, in all parts,
Historicall, yet it is Propheticall still; for the Prophet laments a greater Desolation
then that, in the utter ruine, and devastation of the City, and Nation, which was to fall
upon them, after the death of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> Neither is any peece of this Booke, the
lesse fit to be our Text, this day, because it is both Historicall, and Propheticall, for,
they, from whom, God, in his mercy, gave us a Deliverance, this day, are our <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
Enemies,</hi> and our <hi>Propheticall Enemies;</hi> historically wee know, they <hi>have</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
our ruine heretofore, and prophetically wee may bee <hi>sure,</hi> they <hi>will doe so
againe,</hi> whensoever any new occasion provokes them, or sufficient power enables
them.</p>
                        <p>The Text then is as the Booke presented to <hi>Ezckiel;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Divisio.</hi> Ezck. 2. 20.</note> In it are written <hi>Lamentations,</hi>
and <hi>Mournings,</hi> and <hi>Woe;</hi> and all they are written <hi>within,</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> says the Text
there; <hi>within,</hi> as they concern the <hi>Iews, without,</hi> as they are appliable to <hi>us:</hi> And they
concern the <hi>Iews, Historically</hi> (attempts upon that State <hi>Ieremy</hi> had certainly <hi>seen,</hi>)
and they concern them <hi>prophetically,</hi> for farther attempts <hi>Ieremy</hi> did certainly <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see.</hi>
They are appliable to us both ways too: <hi>Historically,</hi> because wee have seen,
what they <hi>would have done,</hi> And <hi>Prophetically,</hi> because wee foresee what they <hi>would
doe.</hi> So that here is but a difference of the Computation; here is <hi>stilo veteri,</hi> and <hi>stilo nove;</hi> here is the <hi>Iews Calendar,</hi> and the <hi>Papists Calendar;</hi> In the Jews
Calendar, <hi>one Babylon,</hi> wrought upon the people of God, and in the Papists Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,
<hi>another Babylon: Stilo veteri,</hi> in the Jews Calendar, 700 yeare before
Christ came, there were <hi>pits made, and the breath of their nostrils, The anointed
of the Lord, was taken in their pits: Stilo nove,</hi> in the Papists Calendar, 1600
yeare after Christ came in all fulnesse, in all clearnesse, <hi>There were pits made</hi>
againe, and <hi>The breath of our nostrils, The anointed of the Lord, was almost taken in
those pits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is then <hi>Ieremies,</hi> and it is a <hi>distinct</hi> Book; It concernes the <hi>Iews,</hi> and it concerns
<hi>us</hi> too; And it concernes us both, <hi>both wages, Historically,</hi> and <hi>Prophetically.</hi>

Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and many of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and many of the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselves take it,

Ieremy lamented for Iosiah, and all the people speake of him, in their Lamentations,</hi>) Or
whether he lament the transportation and the misery of an ill King, of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> (as is
more ordinarily, and more probably held by the Expositours) we argue not, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
now; we imbrace that which arises from both<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> That both good Kings, and bad
Kings, <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> are the <hi>anointed</hi> of the Lord, and the <hi>breath of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strills,</hi>
that is, The life of the people; and therefore both to be lamented, when they fall
into dangers, and consequently both to be preserved by all means, by <hi>Prayer</hi> from them
who are private persons, by <hi>counsell</hi> from them, who have that great honour and that
great charge, to be near them in that kinde, and by <hi>support</hi> and <hi>supplly,</hi> from all, of all
sorts, from falling into such dangers.</p>
                        <p>These considerations will, I thinke, have the better impression in you, if we proceed
in the handling of them thus: First, the main cause of the Lamentation was the Ruine,
or the dangerous declination of the Kingdome of that great and glorious State,
<hi>The Kingdome;</hi> But then they did not seditiously sever the King, and the Kingdome,
as though the Kingdome could doe well, and the King ill, <hi>That</hi> safe, and <hi>he</hi> in danger,
for they see cause to lament, because misery was fallen upon <hi>the Person</hi> of <hi>the King;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
upon <hi>Iosiah,</hi> a good, a religious King; perchance but upon <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> a worse
King; yet which soever it be, they acknowledge him to be <hi>Vnctus Domini, The anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Lord,</hi> and to be <hi>Spiritus narium, The breath of their nostrills:</hi> When this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
therefore, was fallen into the pits of the Enemy, the Subject laments; but this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
because he <hi>was fallen,</hi> implies a deliverance, a restitution, he was <hi>fallen,</hi> but he
did <hi>not ly</hi> there: so the Text, which is as yet but of <hi>Lamentation,</hi> will grow an houre
hence to be of <hi>Congratulation;</hi> and then we shall see, That whosoever, in rectified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
hath lamented a <hi>danger,</hi> and then congratulated a <hi>deliverance,</hi> he will provide
against a <hi>relapse,</hi> a falling again into that or any other danger, by all means of sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kingdome and the King, in safety and in honour.</p>
                        <p>Our first step then in this Royall progresse,<note place="margin">1. Regnum.</note> is, That the cause of this Lamentation,
was, the declination, the diminution of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> If the Center of the world should
be moved but one inch out of the place, it cannot be reckoned, how many miles, this
Island, or any building in it, would be thrown out of their places; A declination in the
Kingdome of the Jewes, in the body of the Kingdome, in the soul of the State, in the
<hi>form of Government,</hi> was such an Earth-quake, as could leave nothing standing. Of all
things that are, there <hi>was</hi> an <hi>Idea</hi> in God; there was a modell, a platform, an examplar
of every thing, which God produced and created in Time, in the mind and purpose of
God before: Of all things God <hi>had</hi> and <hi>Idea,</hi> a preconception; but of Monarchy, of
Kingdome, God, who is but one, <hi>is</hi> the <hi>Idea;</hi> God himselfe, in his Unity, <hi>

He <hi>is</hi> the Type of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> He made but one World; for, this, and the next, are
not <hi>two Worlds;</hi> This is but the <hi>Morning,</hi> and that the <hi>everlasting Noon,</hi> of one and the same
Day, which shall have no Night: They are not <hi>two Houses;</hi> This is the <hi>Gallery,</hi> and that
the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> of one, and the same Palace, which shall feel no ruine. He made this
one World, but <hi>one Eye, The Sunne;</hi> The <hi>Moone</hi> is not another Eye, but a Glasse; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, the Sunne reflects. He made this one World, but <hi>one Eare, The Church;</hi>

Church he doth. There is <hi>One God, One Faith, One Baptisme,</hi> and these lead us to the

then the other forms are: Wee are sure <hi>Women</hi> have Soules as well as <hi>Men,</hi>
but yet it is not so expressed, <hi>that God breathed a Soule into Woman,</hi> as hee did
into Man; All formes of Government have this Soule, but yet God infuseth it
more manifestly, and more effectually, in that forme, in a <hi>Kingdome:</hi> All

so far they were in their way, for this was no popular, no seditious Assembly of light

were in their right way too, for they held no counsels apart, but came to the right place,
for redresse of grievances, to their then highest Governour, to <hi>Samuel:</hi> When they
were thus lawfully met, they forbeare not to lay open unto him, the injustice of his
greatest Officers, though it concerned the very <hi>Sonnes of Samuel;</hi> and thus farre they
kept within their convenient limits; But when they would presse <hi>Samuel</hi> to a new way
of remedy, to an inconvenient way, to a present way, to their own way, and referre
nothing to him, what care soever they pretended of the good of the State, it is evident,
that they had no good opinion of <hi>Samuel</hi> himself, and even that displeased God, That
they were ill affected to that person, whom he had set over them. To sever the King,
and the Kingdome, and pretend the weale of the one, without the other, is to shake
and discompose Gods building.</p>

                        <p>Our errand is to day, to apply all these branches to the day; Those men who intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, this cause of lamentation this day, in the destruction of <hi>our Iosiah,</hi> spared him
not, because he was so, because so, because he was a <hi>Iosiah,</hi> because he was <hi>good;</hi> no, not because he
was <hi>good to them,</hi> his benefits to them, had not mollified them, towards him: for that is
not their way; Both the <hi>French Henries</hi> were their own, and good to them; but did that
rescue either of them, from the <hi>knife?</hi> And was not that <hi>Emperour,</hi> whom they <hi>poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> their own, and good to them? and yet was that, any <hi>Antidote</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their poison? To so reprobate a sense hath God given them over herein, as that,
though in their <hi>Books,</hi> they ly heaviest upon Princes of our Religion, yet truly they
have destroyed more of their own, then of ours. Thus it is Historically in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
past: And Prophetically it can be but thus, since no King is good, in their sense,
if he agree not to <hi>all points of Doctrine</hi> with them: And when that is done, not good
yet, except he agree in <hi>all points of Iurisdiction too;</hi> and that, no King can doe, that
will not be their Farmer of his Kingdome. Their Authours have disputed <hi>Auferibilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
Papae,</hi> whether the Church of God might not be without a <hi>pope,</hi> they have made a
problematicall, a disputable matter, and some of their Authours have diverted towards
an affirmation of it; but <hi>Aufleribilitas potestatis,</hi> to imagine a King without Kingly So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
never came into probleme, into disputation. We all lamented, and bitterly,
and justly, the losse of our <hi>Deborah,</hi> though then we saw a <hi>Iosiah</hi> succeeding: but if they

or <hi>who,</hi> or <hi>what</hi> had been an object of Consolation to us?</p>
                        <p>The cause of lamentation in the losse of a <hi>good King,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rex malus.</note> is certainly great, and so it was,

Thus evill was <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> irreligious to God, treacherous to man,

<hi>He is an ill King;</hi> he must know his <hi>Office</hi> well, and his <hi>actions</hi> well, and the actions of

not beleeve him, without wearing; Many times a Prince departs from the exact rule
of his duty, not out of his own indisposition to truth, and clearnesse, but to countermine
underminers.<note place="margin">Vers. 26.</note> That which <hi>David</hi> sayes in the eighteenth Psalme, <hi>David</hi> speaks, not of
man, but of <hi>God</hi> himself; <hi>Cum perverso perveriêris, With the froward, thou wilt show thy

and <hi>non-residencies,</hi> with an <hi>Omnes faciunt,</hi> I do, but as other men of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
do? Allow a King but that, <hi>That he does but as other Kings do,</hi> Nay, but this,
<hi>He does but as other Kings put him to a necessity to do,</hi> and you will not hastily call a King
an ill King. When <hi>God gives his people for old shoes,</hi> and <hi>sells them for nothing,</hi> and, at
the same time, gives his and their enemies abundance, when God commands <hi>Abraham,</hi>
to sacrifice his own and onely Sonne, and his enemies have <hi>Children at their pleasure,</hi>
as <hi>David</hi> speaks, To give your selves the liberty of humane affection, you would think
God an ill God; but yet, for all this, his children are to him, a <hi>Royall Priesthood,</hi> and <hi>a
holy Nation;</hi> and all <hi>their tears</hi> are <hi>in his bottles,</hi> and <hi>registred in his booke,</hi> for all this.
When Princes pretermit in some things, the present benefit of their Subjects, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
favours upon others give your selves the liberty to judge of Princes actions, with the
affections of private men, and you may think a King an ill King: But yet, we are to him,
as <hi>David</hi> sayes,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>His brethren, his bone, his flesh,</hi> and so reputed by him. God himselfe
cannot stand upright in a <hi>naturall</hi> mans interpretation, nor any King in a <hi>private</hi> mans.
But then, how soone our adversaries come to call Kings, ill Kings, we see historically,
when they boast of having deposed Kings, <hi>Quia minus utiles,</hi> Because some other hath
seemed to them, fitter for the Government; and we see it prophetically, by their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those Indictments, and Attainders of Kings, which stand in their books <hi>De Syndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catu,</hi>
That that King which neglects the duties of his place (and they must prescribe the
duty, and judge the negligence too) That King that exercises his Prerogative, without
just cause (and they must prescribe the Prerogative, and judge the cause,) That that
King that vexes his Subjects, That that King that gives himselfe to <hi>intemperate hunting</hi>
(for in that very particular they instance) that in such cases, (and they multiply these
cases infinitely) Kings are in their mercy, and subject to their censures, and corrections.
We proceed not so, in censuring the actions of Kings; we say, with St. <hi>Cyrill, Impium
est dicere Regi, Iniquè agis; It is an impious thing,</hi> (in him, who is onely a private man,
and hath no other obligations upon him) <hi>to say to the King,</hi> or <hi>of the King, He governs
not as a King is bound to do:</hi> we remit the judgement of those their actions, which are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
to God; and when they are evident, and bad, yet we must endevour to preserve
their persons; for there is a danger in the losse, and a lamentation due to the losse, even
of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> for even such are <hi>uniti Domini, The anoynted of the Lord, and the breath of
our nostrils.</hi>

Trinity, whose Office it is to convay, to insinuate, to apply to us the Mercies of
the Father, and the Merits of the Sonne: He is called by this Name, by the word of

us <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> The truth of his Gospel, which is our earnest of Heaven, and
the abundance of the Earth, a fruitfull Land; but then he, who is the Spirit of the Lord,
he who is the breath of our nostrills, <hi>Incubat aquis,</hi> (as it is said there in the Creation)
he moves upon <hi>the waters,</hi> by his royall and warlike <hi>Navy at Sea,</hi> (in which he hath
expressed a speciall and particular care) And by the breath and influence of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
throughout the Land, he preserves, he applies, he makes usefull those blessings
unto us.</p>
                        <p>If this breath, that is, this power, be at any time sourd in the passage, and contract an
il savor by the pipes that convay it, so, as that his good intentions are ill executed by
inferiour Ministers, this must not be imputed to him; That breath that comes from the

in the West: Princes purpose some things for ease to the people, (and as such, they
are sometimes presented to them) and if they prove grievances, they tooke their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction
in the way, that is, their corruption, from corrupt executors of good and
wholesome intentions; The thing was good in the roote, and the ill cannot be removed
in an instant.</p>
                        <p>But then,<note place="margin">Spiritus sermo.</note> we carry not this word <hi>Ruach,</hi> Spirit, so high; though since God hath said
that Kings are Gods, the Attribute of the Holy Ghost and his Office, which is, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to man the goodnesse of God, belongs to Kings also; for, God gives, but they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
all blessings to us. But here, we take the word literally, as it is in the Text; <hi>Ruach,
spirit,</hi> is <hi>the Breath</hi> that <hi>we breathe,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> that <hi>we live;</hi> The King is that <hi>Breath,</hi> that
<hi>Life,</hi> and therefore that belongs to him. First our <hi>Breath,</hi> that is, <hi>serme,</hi> our <hi>speech</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to him; <hi>Be faithfull unto him, and speake good of his Name,</hi> is commanded by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
of God. To Gods Anointed, we are not <hi>faithfull,</hi> if we doe not speake good of
his Name. First, there is an <hi>internall,</hi> speech in the <hi>heart,</hi> and God lookes to that; <hi>the
foole hath said in his heart, there is no God;</hi> though he say it but in his heart, yet he is a
foole: for, as wise as a Politician would thinke him, for saying it in his heart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
no further, yet even that is an overt act with God, for God seeth the heart. It is
the foole that saith in his heart, there is no God, and it is the foole that saith in his heart,
I would there were no <hi>King.</hi> That enormous, that infamous Tragedy of the <hi>Levites</hi>
Concubins, and her murder, of which it is said there,<note place="margin">Iud. 19. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>There was no such thing seen, nor

Consider of it, advise, and say your minde, hath this addition too, <hi>In those dayes
there was no King in Israel;</hi> If there had beene any King, but a <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> it could not
have been so:<note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 20.</note> 
                           <hi>Curse not the King, not in thy thoughts:</hi> for, they are sinnes that tread
upon the heels of one another, and that induce one another, to conceive ill of Gods
Lievtenant, and of God himselfe; for so the Prophet joyneth them, <hi>They shall fret
themselves,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Esay 8. 21.</note> 
                           <hi>and curse their King, and their God:</hi> He that beginneth with the one, will
proceed to the other.</p>
                        <p>Thus then he is our Breath; <hi>our Breath is his; our speech</hi> must be contained, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in his dishonour; not in misinterpretations of his Actions; jealousies have often
made women ill; incredulitie, suspiciousnesse, jealousie in the Subject, hath wrought ill
effects upon Princes, otherwise not ill. We must <hi>not speake ill;</hi> but our duty is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in that abstinence, we must <hi>speake well:</hi> And in those things, which will not
admit a good interpretation, we must be apt to remove the perversenesse and obliquity
of the act from him, who is the first mover to those who are <hi>inferiour instruments.</hi> In
these divers opinions which are ventilated in the Schoole, <hi>how God concurreth to the
working of second and subordinate causes,</hi> that opinion is I think, the most antient, that
denies that God <hi>workes in</hi> the second cause, but hath onely <hi>communicated</hi> to it, a power
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:93359:210"/>
of working, and rest himselfe. This is not true; God does work in every Organ, and
in every particular action; but yet though he doe work in all, yet hee is no cause of
the obliquity, of the perversenesse of any action. Now, earthly Princes are not equall
to God; They doe not so much as work in particular actions of instruments; many
times, they communicate power to others, and rest wholly themselves; and then, the
<hi>power</hi> is from them, but the <hi>perversenesse</hi> of the action is not. God does work in
ill actions, and yet is not guilty, but Princes doe not so much as worke therein,
and so may bee excusable; at least, for any cooperation in the evill of the action,
though not for countenancing, and authorising an evill instrument; but that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
case.</p>
                        <p>They are our breath then; <hi>Our breath is theirs,</hi> in good <hi>interpretations</hi> of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1.</note>
and it is theirs especially, <hi>in our prayers</hi> to Almighty God, for them. The
Apostle exhorts us to pray; for whom? first, <hi>for all men</hi> in generall; but in the first
particular, that hee descends to, <hi>for Kings.</hi> And both <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi>
make that the onely reason, why the Apostle did not name Kings first, <hi>Vt non videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
adulari,</hi> lest hee should seeme to flatter Kings: Whether mankinde it selfe, or
Kings, by whom mankinde is happy here, be to be preferred in prayer, you see both
<hi>Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> make it a probleme. And those prayers, there enjoyned,
were for <hi>Infidel Kings,</hi> and for <hi>persecuting Kings;</hi> for even such Kings, were the breath
of their nostrils; their breath, their speech, their prayers were due to them. But
then, beloved, a man may convey a <hi>Satir</hi> into a <hi>Prayer;</hi> a man may make a prayer a
<hi>Libell;</hi> If the intention of the prayer be not so much, to incline God to give those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the King, as to tell the world, that the King wants those graces, it is a Libell.
We say sometimes in scorn to a man, <hi>God help you,</hi> and <hi>God send you wit;</hi> and therein,
though it have the sound of a prayer, wee call him foole. So wee have seen of late,
some in obscure Conventicles, institute certain prayers, <hi>That God would keep the King,</hi>
and <hi>the Prince in the true Religion;</hi> The prayer is always good, always usefull; but
when that prayer is accompanied with circumstances, as though the King and the Prince
were declining from that Religion, then even the prayer it selfe is libellous, and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in that former place, apparels a Subjects prayer well, when hee
sayes, <hi>Let prayers bee given with thanks;</hi> Let our prayers bee for continuance of
the blessings, which wee have, and let our acknowledgement of present blessings,
bee an inducement for future: pray, and praise together; pray thankfully, pray not
suspiciously: for, beloved in the bowels of Christ Jesus, before whose face I stand
now, and before whose face, I shall not be able to stand amongst the righteous, at the
last day, if I lie now, and make this Pulpit my Shop, to vent sophisticate Wares,
In the presence of you, a holy part, I hope, of the Militant Church, of which I

                        <p>As then the Breath of our nostrils, our breath, is his, that is, <hi>our speech,</hi> first, in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>

the continuing thereof, as imply a thankfull acknowledgement of the present blessings,
spirituall and temporall, which we enjoy now by him; So farre, <hi>Breath is speech;</hi> but
<hi>Breath is life too,</hi> and so <hi>our life is his.</hi> How willingly his Subjects would give their

these ways, which his wisdome hath chosen for the procuring of peace, have kept
off much occasion of triall, of that, how willingly his Subjects would have given their

                        <p>As then the breath of our nostrils,<note place="margin">Animd. Gen. 2. 7.</note> is expressed by this word in this Text, <hi>Ruach,
spiritus, speech,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> so it is his. When the breath of life was first breathed into
man, there is called by another word, <hi>Neshamah,</hi> and that is the <hi>soule,</hi> the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
soule: And is the King the breath of that life? Is hee the soule of his Subjects
so, as that their <hi>soules</hi> are <hi>his;</hi> so, as that they must sinne <hi>towards men,</hi> in doing
unjust actions, or sinne <hi>towards God,</hi> in forsaking, and dishonouring him, if the King
will have them? If I had the honour to aske this question, in his royall presence, I
know he would bee the first man, that would say <hi>No, No;</hi> your souls are not mine,
so. And, as hee is a most perfect Text-man, in the Booke of God, (and by the
way, I should not easily feare his being a <hi>Papist,</hi> that is a good <hi>Text-man</hi>) I know hee
would cite <hi>Daniel,</hi> saying, <hi>Though our God doe not deliver us, yet know, O King, that we
will not worship thy Gods;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 5. 29.</note> And I know hee would cite S. <hi>Peter,</hi> We <hi>ought to obey God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then men;</hi> And he would cite <hi>Christ</hi> himself, <hi>Feare not them,</hi> (for the soule) <hi>that
cannot hurt the soule.</hi> He claimes not your souls so: It is <hi>Ruach</hi> here, it is not <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamah;</hi>
your life is his, your soule is not his, in that sense. But yet, beloved, these
two words are promiscuously used in the Scriptures; <hi>Ruach</hi> is often the <hi>soule; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamah;</hi>
is often the temporall life; And thus farre, the one, as well as the other, is the
Kings, That hee must <hi>answer for your soules;</hi> so <hi>they are his;</hi> for hee is not a King of
<hi>bodies,</hi> but a King of <hi>men,</hi> bodies and soules; nor a King of men onely, but of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
men;</hi> so your <hi>Religion,</hi> so your soules are <hi>his;</hi> his, that is, appertaining to <hi>his
care, and his account.</hi> And therefore, though you owe no obedience to any power
under heaven, so as to decline you from the true God, or the true worship of that
God, and the fundamentall things thereof, yet in those things, which are, in their
nature but circumstantiall, and may therefore, according to times, and places,
and persons, admit alterations, in those things, though they bee things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to Religion, submit your selves to his directions; for here, the two words
meet, <hi>Ruach,</hi> and <hi>Neshamah,</hi> your lives are his, and your souls are his too; His end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to advance Gods truth, he is to be trusted much, in matters of <hi>indifferent</hi> nature, by
the way.</p>
                        <p>He is the word of our Text, <hi>Spiritus,</hi> as <hi>Spiritus</hi> is the Holy Ghost, so farre, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
as that he is Gods instrument to convey blessings upon us; and as <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus</hi>
is our <hi>breath,</hi> of <hi>speech,</hi> and as it is <hi>our life,</hi> and as it is <hi>our soule</hi> too, so farre, as that
in those temporall things which concern spirituall, (as <hi>Times</hi> of meeting, and much of
the <hi>manner</hi> of proceeding when we are met) we are to receive directions from him: So
he is the <hi>breath</hi> of our <hi>nostrils,</hi> our <hi>speech,</hi> our <hi>lives,</hi> our <hi>soules,</hi> in that limited sense,
are his.</p>
                        <p>But then, did those subjects of his (And I charge none but his <hi>subjects,</hi> with this plot,
for, <hi>I judge not them who are without</hi>) from whom God deliverd us this day, did they
think so of him, That he was the breath of our nostrils? If the breath be soure, if it
bee tainted and corrupt, (as they would needs thinke, in this case) is it good Physick
for an ill breath, to cut off the head, or to suffocate it, to smother, to strangle, to
murder that man? Hee is the breath of their nostrils; They owe him their <hi>speech,</hi>
their <hi>thanks,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iob 30. 1.</note> their <hi>prayers,</hi> and how have these <hi>children of fooles made him their
song, and their by-word?</hi> How have these Drunkards, (men drunke with the
Babylonian Cup) made Libels against him?<note place="margin">Act. 17. 18.</note> How have those <hi>Seminatores verborum,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:93359:211"/>
word-scatterers,</hi> defamed him, even with contrary defamations. Heretofore, that he
<hi>persecuted their</hi> Religion, when he did not; now, that he hath <hi>left his own</hi> Religion.
He is their breath, they owe him their <hi>tongues,</hi> and how foully do they speak; and they
owe him their <hi>lives,</hi> and how prodigally do they give away their lives to others, that
they might take away His? He is their breath, (as breath is the soule) that is, <hi>Accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
for their soules,</hi> and how have they raised themselves out of his Audit, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
themselves from his Allegiance? This they have done historically, and to say
prophetically, what they would do, first, their <hi>Extenuation</hi> of this fact, when they call
it an enterprise of a few unfortunate Gentlemen. And then their <hi>Exaltation</hi> of this fact,
when they make the principall person in it, a <hi>Martyr,</hi> this is prophecy enough, that since
they are not ashamed of the Originall, they will not be afraid to copy it often, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the same practises, to the same end.</p>
                        <p>Let it be <hi>Iosiah</hi> then,<note place="margin">Vnctus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> let it be <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> he was the Breath, the life of his Subjects,
(and that was the first attribute) and he was <hi>The Anoynted of the Lord,</hi> which is the
other. Vnction it self alwayes separated that which was anoynted from prophane,
and secular use; unction was a religious distinction. It had that signification in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
before any Law was given for it; when <hi>Iacob</hi> had had that vision upon the
stone,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 18.</note> which made him see, that <hi>that place was the house of God, and the gate of
heaven,</hi> then he tooke up that stone which he had stept upon, and set it up for
a pillar, and anoynted it. This was the <hi>practise in nature;</hi> and then the <hi>precept in
the Law,</hi> was, as for the Altar it self, so for many other things. belonging to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God in the Temple,<note place="margin">Exod 29. 36.</note> 
                           <hi>Thou shalt anoynt them, to sanctifie them.</hi> Thus it was
for <hi>things;</hi> and then, if we consider <hi>persons,</hi> we see the dignity that anoynting gave;
for it was given but to three <hi>sorts</hi> of persons, to <hi>Kings,</hi> to <hi>priests,</hi> and to <hi>Prophets:
Kings,</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> had it, to testifie their ordinary, and permanent, and indelible ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
their power is laid on <hi>in Oyle;</hi> And <hi>Prophets</hi> had it, because they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
raised to denounce, and to execute Gods Judgements, upon persons
that were anoynted, upon Priests, and upon Kings too, in those cases, for which,
they were then particularly imployed. Thus then it is, anoynted things could not be
touched, but by anoynted persons, and then anoynted persons could not be touched,
but by persons anoynted; The <hi>Priest</hi> not directed, but by the <hi>King;</hi> The King, as King,
not corrected, but by the <hi>prophet:</hi> And this was the State, that they lamented so
compassionately, That their King, thus <hi>anoynted,</hi> thus <hi>exempted,</hi> was taken prisoner,
saw his Sonnes slaine in his presence, and then had his owne eyes pulled out, was
bound in chains, and carried to <hi>Babell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And lesse then this, in himself, and in his Sonne, and in all, was not intended this day,

<hi>pits,</hi> and taken in <hi>their pits,</hi> are so many staires, so many descents, so many gradations
(rather degradations) in this calamity. Let it bee <hi>Iosiah,</hi> let it bee <hi>Zedekiah; They
were taken;</hi> taken, and never returned; Let it bee our <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and will it hold in that
application? Was hee taken? Hee was plotted for, but was hee <hi>Taken?</hi> When hee
himselfe takes publique knowledge, that both at home and abroad, those of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
persuasion, assured themselves, of some especiall worke, for the advancement of
their cause, at that time, when they had taken that assurance, hee was so taken, taken
in that their assurance, infallibly taken in their opinion; so, as this kingdome was taken
in their opinion, who thought their <hi>Navy invincible;</hi> so this King was taken in their
assurance, who thought this plot infallible.</p>
                        <p>Hee was taken,<note place="margin">Fovea.</note> and <hi>in fovea, in a pit,</hi> says the Text; If our first translation would

was a pit, a <hi>Grave;</hi> in <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> case, it was a pit, a <hi>prison:</hi> in our <hi>Iosiahs</hi> case, it was

                        <p>And then it was <hi>in foveis Illorum,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Illorum.</note> in <hi>their pits,</hi> says the Text; but the Text does
not tell us, in whose; in the verse before, it is said, <hi>our persecutors did this,</hi> and
this, then it followes, <hi>Hee was taken in their pits;</hi> In the persecutors pits cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely;
but yet,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 35. 23.</note> who are they? If it were <hi>Iosiah</hi> that was taken, the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
was <hi>Necho,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for from his army, <hi>Iosiah</hi> received his deaths wound:
If it were <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the persecutor was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> for hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> into captivity. Certainly the holy Ghost knew well enough, and
could have spoken plaine, whose these pits were, but it pleased him to forbeare <hi>names.</hi>
Certainly <hi>our Iosiah</hi> knowes well enough, whose, those pits, which were digged for
him, were; but, according to his naturall sweetnesse, to decline the drawing of more
bloud, then necessarily hee must, or the laying of imputations and aspersions upon
more, then necessarily hee must, hee hath forborne names. The holy Ghost knowes
better then all the expositors, in all our Libraries, who digged those pits, our <hi>Iosiah</hi>
knowes, better then all wee, who come but to celebrate, and solemnize the deliverance,
whose hands, and whose counsails were in the digging of these pits too. <hi>Hee was taken,</hi>
says our Text: <hi>fuit,</hi> hee <hi>Was.</hi> Fix that in <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who was taken, and never taken back:
fix it in <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who was taken, and never taken back; they both perished; in both
them, there is just cause, of perpetuall, and permanent lamentation, and no roome
left, for the exercise of any other affection. But transfer it <hi>to our Iosiah,</hi> and then,
<hi>Hee was taken,</hi> is, <hi>Hee was but taken; God did not suffer his holy one to see Correction,</hi>
nor God did not suffer his Anointed, to perish in this taking; And so the <hi>lamentation</hi>
is become (as wee said at first) a <hi>Congratulation,</hi> so our <hi>Vae</hi> is an <hi>Euge,</hi> our excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
turned to acclamation; and so our <hi>De profundis,</hi> is a <hi>Gloria in excelsis,</hi>
The pit, the vault is become a hill, from whence we may behold the power of our
great God; this <hi>Sepher kinoth,</hi> the book of Lamentations, is become <hi>Sepher tehillim,</hi>
the book of Psalmes, and thanksgivings; And <hi>Davids Bonus es omnibus, Lord thou art
good to all,</hi> is come to <hi>Moses non taliter, Lord thou hast not done so well, with any nation,</hi> as
with us; for when we might have fear'd a <hi>dereliquisti,</hi> that God had forsaken us, we had S.

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:93359:212"/>
knew not our danger, and therefore knew not his speciall Protection. It was one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
degree of his mercy, to proceed so: As it is an ease to a man, not to heare of
his friends sicknesse, till he heare it, by hearing of his recovery, so God did not shake
us, with the knowledge of the danger, till he established us, with the deliverance:
And by making his servant, and our Soveraigne, the blessed means of that discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that deliverance, he hath directed us, in all apprehensions of dangers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon that <hi>Wisdome,</hi> in civill affaires, affaires of State, and upon that <hi>Zeale,</hi> in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Religion, which he hath imprinted in that soule. Historically, God hath done
great things for us, by him; Prophetically, God hath great things to doe for us, and
all the Christian world, and will make him, his Instrument to doe them.</p>
                        <p>Now,<note place="margin">Auxilia.</note> we reserved at first, for the last gaspe, and for the knot to tie up all, this
Consideration: That he that was truely affected in the sad sense of such a danger, and
the pious sense of such a deliverance, would also use all means in his power, to secure
the future, that that Kingdome, in that King, might alwayes bee safe, from the like
dangers. No doubt, our <hi>Iosiah</hi> doth that, in that which appertaineth unto him;
and <hi>all,</hi> that is, The <hi>care of all,</hi> appertaineth unto him. If God had made him his
<hi>Rod,</hi> to scourge others with Warres and Armies, we might be affraid, that when
God had done his worke by him, he would <hi>cast the rod in the fire,</hi> God doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
blesse those Instruments, who love blood, though they pretend his Glory. But since God hath made him <hi>his Dove,</hi> to flie over the world, with the Olive branch, with
indevours of Peace, in all places, as the Dove did, so he shall ever bring his Olive
branch to the Arke, that is, endevour onely such peace, as may advance the Church
of God, and establish peace of Conscience in himself.</p>
                        <p>That care,<note place="margin">Ne pecce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> on his part, shall preserve him: And for his preservation, and ours in
him, these things are to be done on our part: First, let us returne to God, so, as God
may looke upon us, clothed in the righteousnesse of Christ; who will not be put on,

                           <note place="margin">1 Reg. 12. 11.</note> This way hath a part, in the Kings safetie,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:93359:212"/>
and in our safety, to hold in our selves, and to convay to strangers, a good estimation
of that happy government, which is truly good in it self.</p>
                        <p>And then a third,<note place="margin">Subsidia.</note> and very important way towards his preservation, is, a cheerful
disposition, to supply, and to support, and to assist him, with such things as are necessary
for his outward dignity. When God himselfe was the immediate King of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
and governed them, by himself, he took it ill, that they would depart from him,
who needed nothing of theirs, for there could be no other King, but must necessarily be
supplyed by them: And yet, consider, Beloved, what God, who needed nothing, took:
The <hi>sacrifices</hi> of the Jews,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 35.</note> were such, as would have kept divers Royall houses: Take
a bill of them, but in one Passeover, that <hi>Iosiah</hi> kept, and compare that and other the
like, with the smalness of the land, that they possessed, and you will see, that that they
gave, was a very great proportion. Now, it is the service of God, to contribute to <hi>the
King</hi> as well as to <hi>the Priest:</hi> He that gives to a Prophet, shall have a Prophets reward;
he that gives to the King, shall have a Kings reward, a Crown: in those cases, where to
give to your King, is to give to <hi>God,</hi> that is, where the peace of the State, and the glory of
God in his Gospel depends much, upon the sustentation of the estimation, and outward
honour and splendour of the King: preserve him so, and he shall the lesse be subject to
these dangers, of such falling into their pits.</p>
                        <p>But lastly,<note place="margin">Religio.</note> and especially, let us preserve him, by preserving God amongst us, in the
true, and sincere profession of our Religion. Let not a mis-grounded, and disloyall
imagination of coolness in him,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 3.</note> cool you, in your own families. <hi>Omnis spiritus, qui
solvit Iesum,</hi> says the Apostle, in the <hi>Vulgat,</hi> every spirit that <hi>dissolves</hi> Jesus, that <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
not Iesus intirely, All Iesus,</hi> and <hi>All his, All his Truth,</hi> and <hi>all that suffer for that
Truth, is not of God.</hi> Doe not say, I will hold as much of Jesus, as shall be necessary,
so much as shall distinguish me from a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Iew,</hi> but if I may be the better, for
parting with some of the rest, why should I not? Doe not say, I will hold All, my
self, but let my wife, or my son, or one of my sons, goe the other way, as though <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi>
and Papist were two severall callings; and, as you would make one son a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
another a Merchant, you will make one son a Papist, another a Protestant. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
not your own levity, with so high a dishonor to the Prince; when have you heard,
that ever he thanked any man, for becoming a Papist? Leave his dores to himselfe;
The dores into his kingdome, <hi>The Ports,</hi> and the dores in his kingdome, The <hi>prisons;</hi>
Let him open and shut his dores, as God shall put into his minde: look thou seriously
to thine own dores, to thine own family, and keep all right there. A Thief that is let
out of New-gate is not therefore let into thy house; A Priest that is let out of prison,
is not therefore let into thy house neither: still it may be felony, to harbour him, though
there were mercy in letting him out. Cities are built of families, and so are Churches
too; Every man keeps his owne family, and then every Pastor shall keep his flock,
and so the Church shall be free from schisme, and the State from sedition, and our <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
preserved, Prophetically for ever, as he was Historically this day, from them, in
whose pits, the breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord, was taken. <hi>Amen.</hi>

(and there is no other object of true love, but <hi>Blessednesse</hi>) establish your selves in mee,

                     </p>
                     <p>The words have in them an Injunction,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> and a Remuneration; A Precept, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
The Way, and the End of a Christian. The Injunction, The Precept, The way
is, As you love blessedness, <hi>be not offended in me,</hi> Be satisfied with mee, and mine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances;
It is an Acquiescence in the Gospel of Christ Jesus: And the Remuneration,
the Promise, the End, is <hi>Blessedness;</hi> That, which, in it self, hath no end, That, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of which, all other things are to no end, Blessedness, everlasting Blessedness, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is he, whosoever is not scandalized, not offended in me.</hi> In the first, Christ gives them
first, if not an Increpation, yet an Intimation of our facility in falling into the <hi>Passive
scandall,</hi> the mis-interpreting of the words or actions of other men, which is that which
our Saviour intends, by being offended in <hi>another;</hi> And Blessed are they, in generall, who
are not apt to fall into this <hi>Passive scandall,</hi> not subject to this facility of mis-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
other men. In a second branch in this first part, Christ appropriates this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
Blessed is he, whosoever is not scandalized, not offended <hi>in me;</hi> In which branch,
we shall see, that the generall scandall, and offence that the world took at Christ, and
his Gospel, was, that he induced a Religion that opposed the <hi>Honours,</hi> and the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
and the <hi>Profit</hi> of this world: And these three being the <hi>Triangle within our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
the three corners, into which Satan, that compasses the world, leads us, (all is
<hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> or <hi>Profit</hi>) because the Christian Religion seemed to the world to
withdraw mens affections from these, the world was scandalized, offended in Christ.
But then, in a third consideration, wee shall see, that Christ discerned in these two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
these Disciples of <hi>Iohn,</hi> a Passive scandall of another kinde; Not that Christs
Gospel, and the Religion that he induced, was too low, too base, too contemptible, as
the world thought, but that it was not low enough, not humble enough, and therefore
<hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples would doe more then Christs Disciples, and bind themselves to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>strictness</hi> and <hi>austerity</hi> of life, then Christ in his Gospel required. In which third
branch, wee shall take knowledge of <hi>some Disciples</hi> of <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples, in the world yet;
and, (as for the most part it fals out in <hi>Sectaries</hi>) of divers kinds and ways; for, wee shall
finde some, who in an over-valuation of their owne <hi>purity,</hi> condemne, and contemne
other men, as unpardonable <hi>Reprobates;</hi> And these are scandalized, and offended in
Christ, that is, not satisfied with his Gospel, in that they will not see, that it is as well
a part of the Gospel of Christ, to rely upon his <hi>Mercy,</hi> if I have departed from that
purity, which his Gospel enjoyned mee, as it is, to have endevoured to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that purity; And a part of his Gospel, as well to assist with my <hi>prayers,</hi> and
my <hi>counsell,</hi> and with all <hi>mildeness,</hi> that poore soul that hath strayed from that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as it is to love the <hi>Communion of those Saints,</hi> that have in a better measure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it; Not to beleeve the <hi>Mercy of God</hi> in Christ, <hi>after</hi> a sinne, to be a part of the
Gospel, as well as the <hi>Grace of God</hi> for <hi>prevention</hi> before, not to give favourable
constructions, and conceive charitable hopes of him, who is falne into some sinne,
which I may have escaped, this is <hi>to bee scandalized, to bee offended in Christ,</hi> not to
bee satisfied with his Gospel; And this is one Sect of the off-spring of <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples.
And the other is this, that other men thinking the Gospel of Christ to be too large a
Gospel, a Religion of too much liberty, will needs undertake to doe more, then Christ,
or his Disciples practised, or his Gospel prescribed: for, this is <hi>to be offended in Christ,</hi>
not to beleeve the meanes of salvation ordained by him, to bee sufficient for that end,
which they were ordained to, that is, salvation. And then, after all this, in a fourth
branch we shall see, the way, which our Saviour takes to reclaime them, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
them of this Passive scandall, which hindred their Blessednesse, which was, to
call them to the contemplation of his <hi>good works,</hi> and of good works in the highest
kind, his <hi>Miracles;</hi> for in the verse immediately before the text, (which verse induces the
Text) hee sayes to them, you see the blinde receive their sight, the lame goe, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
are cleansed, the deafe heare, the dead are raised to life. Christ does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
at least, hee does not put all, upon that <hi>externall purity,</hi> and <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sterity</hi> of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:93359:213"/>
life, in which, these Disciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> pretended to exceed all others, but upon <hi>doing
good to others; the blinde see, the deaf heare, the lame walk.</hi> Which miracles, and great
works of his, our blessed Saviour summes up with that, which therefore seemes
the greatest of all, <hi>Pauperes Evangelizantur, The poore have the Gospell preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</hi> Beloved, the greatest good that we, (we to whom the dispensation of
the word of reconciliation is committed) can do, is, to preach the Gospell to <hi>the
poore,</hi> to assist the poore, to apply our selves by all wayes, to them, whether they
be poore in <hi>estate,</hi> and <hi>fortune,</hi> or poore in <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>capacity,</hi> or poore
in their accounts and dis-estimation of themselves, poore and dejected <hi>in spirit.</hi>
And all these considerations, which, as you see, are many, and important, (first our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
easinesse to fall into the passive scandall, to be offended in <hi>others,</hi> to mis-interpret
others; And then the generall passive scandall and offence that the world took at <hi>Christ,</hi>
That he induced a Religion incapable of the honours, or the pleasures, or profits of
this world; And thirdly, the particular passive scandall that dis-affected these Disciples
of <hi>Iohn</hi> towards Christ, which was, That his Gospell enjoyned not enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would do more, in which kinde, we finde two sects in the world yet, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
and Disciples of those Disciples; And then lastly, the way that Christ tooke to
reclaime and satisfie them, which was, by <hi>good works,</hi> and the best works that they that
did them, could do, (for in himself it was by doing miracles, for the good of others)
and preferring in his good and great works, the assisting of the poor) All these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
I say, will fall into our first part, As you love blessednesse, be not scandalized,
be not offended in me, which is the injunction, the precept, the way. And, when in our
due order, we shall come to our second part, The remuneration, the promise, the end,
<hi>Blessednesse,</hi> everlasting blessednesse, I may be glad, that the time will give me some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
some excuse of saying little of that, as I can foresee already, by this distribution,
that we shall be forced to thrust that part into a narrow conclusion. For, if I had <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusalems
yeers,</hi> and his yeers multiplyed by the minutes of his yeers, (which were a
faire terme) if I could speak till the Angels Trumpets blew, and you had the patience
of Martyrs, and could be content to heare me, till you heard the <hi>Surgite M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were called to meet <hi>the Lord Iesus in the clouds,</hi> all that time would not make up one
minute, all those words would not make up one syllable, towards this <hi>Eternity,</hi> the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of this blessednesse. Reserving our selves therefore for that, to those few minutes
which may be left, or borrowed, when we come to the handling thereof, pursue we first,
those con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iderations which fall more naturally into our comprehension, the severall
branches of our first part; As you love blessednesse, <hi>Be not scandalized, be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First then our Saviours answer to these Disciples of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Part.</note> gives us occasion to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our inclination,<note place="margin">Scandalum Passivum.</note> our propensenesse to the <hi>passive scandall,</hi> to be offended in others, to
mis-interpret the words and actions of others, and to lament that our infirmity, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse,
in the words of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat 18. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Vae Mundo à scandalis, Wo to the world by reason
of scandals,</hi> of offences: For, that is both a <hi>Vae Dolentis,</hi> The voyce of our Saviour la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
that perversenesse of ours, and <hi>Vae Minantis,</hi> his voyce threatning punishments
for that perversenesse. For, <hi>Parum distat scandalizare, &amp; scandalizari,</hi> sayes St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
excellently; It is almost all one to be scandalized by another, as to scandalize ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
almost as great a sin, to be shaked in our constancy, in our selves, or in our charity
towards others, as to offer a scandall to others. For, this <hi>Vae,</hi> this intermination of wo
from our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 32.</note> is bent upon us, from three batteries; for, it is <hi>Vae quia Illusiones for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
wo, because scandals are so strong in their nature, as that they shall seduce, if it be
possible, the Elect; And then, <hi>Vae quia infirmi vos,</hi> Woe because you are so weak in your
nature, as that,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 21.</note> though you receive the word, and receive it with joy, yet <hi>Temporales

continuò, scandalizamini,</hi> Instantly, presently, you are scandalized, offended; But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Vae quia Praevaricatores,</hi> Woe be unto you, not because the scandals are so strong,
not because you are so weake, but because you prevaricate against your own souls,
because you betray your selves, and make your selves weaker than you are, you
open your selves too easily to a scandall, you assist a scandall, create a scandall,
by your aptnesse to mis-interpret other mens proceedings. <hi>Great peace have they
that love thy Law,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 165.</note> sayes <hi>David:</hi> Wherein consists this great peace? In this,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:93359:214"/>
                        <hi>Non est illis scandalum,</hi> nothing scandalises, nothing offends them, nothing puts them
off from their Kings, their <hi>Constancy</hi> in themselves, their <hi>Charity</hi> towards others. And
therefore upon that prayer of <hi>David, Liberet te Deus ab Homine malo, The Lord deliver
thee from the evill man,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> retires himselfe into himselfe, he sends every man
home into himselfe, and says, <hi>Liberette Deus à te, ne sis tibi homo malus,</hi> the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
thee from thy selfe, that thou be not that evill man to thy selfe; <hi>God blesse me
from my selfe,</hi> that I lead not my selfe into tentation, by a wilfull misinterpreting of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, especially my superiours; that I cast not aspersions or imputations upon the
<hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>State,</hi> by my mistakings. And thus much being said of this <hi>generall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility</hi> of falling into the Passive scandall, and being offended in others, (which is a great
interruption of blessednesse, for <hi>Blessed is he, and he onely,</hi> that <hi>is not so scandalised,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
so) passe we now to the second branch of this first part, our Saviours, appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
of this more particularly to himselfe, <hi>Blessed is he, whosoever is not scandalised, not
offended in me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Christ <hi>Crucified,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In me.</note> that is, the Gospell of Christ, is said by the Apostle, to be <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Iudaeis,<note place="margin">1 cor. 1. 23.</note> a scandal, a stumbling block to the Iews,</hi> but <hi>Graecis stultitia,</hi> to the Grecians,
to the Gentiles, <hi>meer foolishness.</hi> So that one scandall &amp; offence that was taken at Christ,
&amp; his Gospel, was by the <hi>wisemen,</hi> the <hi>learned,</hi> the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of the world; they thoght
that Christ induced a religion improbable to Reason, a silly and a foolish religion. But
these learned men, these Philosophers, were sooner convinced &amp; satisfied, then others.
For, when we have considered <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and some things of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> &amp; perchance one or two more, we have
done with those Fathers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 20.</note> that did any thing against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their Philosophers,
and may soon come to that question of the Apostle, <hi>Vbi sapiens,</hi> where <hi>is the wiseman,</hi>
where <hi>is the Philosopher,</hi> where <hi>is the disputer of the world?</hi> Indeed, al that the Fathers writ
against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would not amount to so much, as may be found at one mart, of <hi>papists</hi> against
<hi>Protestants,</hi> or of Protestants, <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> against one another. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, <hi>Reason</hi> will be satisfied, <hi>Passion</hi> will not. And therefore, when it came to that
issue between the <hi>Christian</hi> and the <hi>Naturall</hi> man, which <hi>Religion</hi> was <hi>most comfortable
to Reason,</hi> it soon resolved into these two, whether it were more conformable to Reason
to beleeve <hi>One God,</hi> as the Christian does, or <hi>many,</hi> as the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and then, being
brought to the beliefe of one God, whether it were more conformable to reason, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<hi>three Persons in that one God,</hi> as we, or but one, as they doe. Now, for the first
of these, the <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of Gods, it involved so many, so evident, so ridiculous absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
as not onely those few Fathers soon disputed them, but some of themselves, such
as <hi>Lucian,</hi> soon laughed them, out of it; and so reason prevailed soon for the unity of
the Godhead, that there is but one God, and that question was not long in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
nor agitation. And for the other, three persons in this one God, <hi>the Trinity,</hi>
though we cannot so immediately prove that by <hi>Reason,</hi> nor so intirely, altogether, yet,
by these steppes we can: first, that there is nothing in the doctrine of the Trinity <hi>against
Reason;</hi> the doctrine of the Trinity implies no <hi>contradiction;</hi> It may be so; and then,
that it is so, if we have the word of God, for it, Reason it selfe will conclude, that we
have Reason on our side; And that we have the word of God for it, we proceed thus,
that for this Book, which we call <hi>the Bible,</hi> which book delivers us the Doctrine of
the Trinity, we have far better reasons, and stronger arguments to satisfie any naturall
man, <hi>that this book is the word of God,</hi> then the <hi>Turke,</hi> or any professors of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
have, that those books which they pretend to be so, are so. So that positively for
the first, that there is but <hi>one</hi> God, &amp; <hi>Comparatively</hi> for the other, that there are <hi>three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
Reason it selfe, (if we were bound to submit all Religion to Reason) may receive a
satisfaction, a calme, and peaceable acquiescence. And so, the scandall that the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi> took, was, with no great difficulty, overcome. But then the scandals that <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>carnall</hi> men tooke, lasted longer. They were offended in Christ, that he indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
an inglorious, a contemptible Religion, a Religion that opposed the <hi>Honours</hi> of this
world; and a sooty, and <hi>Melancholique</hi> Religion, a Religion that opposed the <hi>Pleasures,</hi>
and delights of this world; and a fordid, and beggerly Religion, a Religion that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the <hi>Gaine,</hi> and the Profit of this world. But <hi>were this enough</hi> to condemne
the Christian Religion, <hi>if it did oppose</hi> worldly honour, or pleasure, or profit? <hi>Or does
our Religion doe that?</hi> Be pleased to stop a little upon both these Problems; whether
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:93359:214"/>
that were enough to their ends, if it were so, and then, whether there be any such thing
in our Religion; and begin wee with their first offence at Christ, The point of
Honour.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle speaks of an <hi>Eternall weight of Glory;<note place="margin">Honor.</note> Glory, A weight of Glory,</hi> An <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
weight of Glory;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 17.</note> But where? In heaven, not in this world. The Honours of this
world, are farre from being <hi>weights,</hi> or <hi>fraights,</hi> or <hi>ballast</hi> to carry us steady; they are
but light <hi>froths,</hi> but leaven, but fermentation, that puffes and swells us up. And they
are as farre from being <hi>eternall;</hi> for, in every family, we know, in which father, or grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
the Honour began, and wee know not how soon, or how ignominiously it may
end; but such ends of worldly Honours, we see every day. When a Lord meets a man
that <hi>honours</hi> him, makes him curtesie, and curses him withall, what hath his Lordship
got by that Honour? when popular acclamations cast him into insolent actions, and
into the net of the Law, where is the ease, the benefit, the consolation of his Honour?
But especially, if worldly Honour must be had upon those conditions here, as shall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my eternall weight of Glory hereafter, I should honour any dishonour, glorifie any
inglorious state, embrace any Dunghill, call any poverty Treasure, rather then bring
the Honours of this world into the <hi>Balance,</hi> into competition, into comparison with that
eternall weight of Glory in heaven. So that if the Christian Religion did oppose world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Honour, it were not to be opposed for that: But it is farre from that; for, as no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
imprints more honour, more reverence, <hi>more subjection</hi> in the hearts of men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their <hi>Superiours</hi> of all sorts, <hi>Naturall,</hi> or <hi>Civill,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall, Parents,</hi> or <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,</hi>
or <hi>Prelates,</hi> then the Christian Religion does (for, we binde even the <hi>conscience</hi> it
self) so never was there any form of Religion upon the face of the earth, in which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were capable of greater Titles, and styles of dignity, then in the Christian Church.
Never any <hi>Moscovite,</hi> any <hi>Turk,</hi> received such titles, as the world hath, and does give to
the <hi>Bishop of Rome;</hi> so great, as that some of the greatest later Emperours, have had an
ambition of that dignity, and endevoured to have been elected <hi>Popes</hi> too, being Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
If Religion opposed Honour, that should not diminish it; but it does not that, nor
<hi>Pleasure</hi> neither, which was another thing, in which, the world was offended in Christ.</p>
                     <p>As when we compared the Honour of this world,<note place="margin">Voluptas.</note> with the Glory of Heaven, we
found it nothing, so should we doe the Pleasures of this world, if we compared them
with the Joys of heaven. And therefore if my religion did enwrap me in a continuall
cloud, damp me in a continuall vapour, smoke me in a continuall sourenesse, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
in this life, yet I have an abundant recompense in that Reversion, which the
Lord,<note place="margin">Ps. 36. 28.</note> the righteous Judge hath laid up for me, That I shall drink <hi>è torrente valuptatis,
of the Rivers of his pleasures; pleasures, His</hi> pleasures, <hi>Rivers,</hi> ever-flowing, overflowing
Rivers of his pleasures. So that if my Religion denied me pleasure here, I would not
deny my Religion, nor be displeased with my Religion for that; But it does not that;
for what Christian is denied a care of his <hi>health,</hi> or of a good habitude of body, or the
use of those things, which may give a chearfulnesse to his <hi>heart,</hi> or a chearfulnesse to his
<hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ntenance?</hi> What Christian is denied such <hi>Garments,</hi> or such <hi>Ornaments,</hi> as his own
rank, and condition, in particular requires, or as the Nationall and generall custome of
his times hath induced and authorised? What Christian is denied <hi>Conversation,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,</hi>
or honest Relaxation of Body or Spirit? Excesse of these pleasures, as well in
the Heathen, as in the Christian, fals under <hi>Solomons Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Vexation of spirit.</hi> But
with the right use of these pleasures, the Christian hath that, which none but hee,
hath,<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 8.</note> That <hi>the Lord puts gladnesse into my heart,</hi> That the Lord enables me to <hi>lay mee
downe in peace, and sleepe,</hi> That the Lord assures mee that <hi>he will keep mee in safety.</hi>
If Religion excluded worldly pleasure, that were no cause of scandall or offence; but
it does not that; no nor <hi>Profit</hi> neither, which is a third consideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What is a man profited,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lucrum.</note> says our Saviour, (he saw all the world was carried upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and he goes along with them, that way) <hi>What is a man profited,</hi>

                        <hi>if he gain the whole
world, and lose his own soule?</hi> If a man have an answer to that question, that question
of Confusion,<note place="margin">Luc. 12. 10.</note> and Consternation, that Christ asks, <hi>Cujue erunt, foole this night</hi> they
<hi>shall fetch away thy soule,</hi> and then, <hi>Cuju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hast provided? if a man can answer, <hi>Haeredis erunt,</hi> They shall be <hi>mine heires,</hi> mine heire
shall have them; Besides that, though thy bell <hi>toll</hi> first, his may <hi>ring</hi> out first; though
thou beest old, and crasie, and sickly, <hi>Though they doe fetch away thy soule this night,</hi> they
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:93359:215"/>
may fetch away his before thine, thine heir may die before thee, and there's that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
disappointed; If thine heir doe enjoy all this, will all that distill one drop of cold
water upon thy tongue in hell? And <hi>so is he,</hi> (sayes Christ, in the conclusion of that
parable) <hi>that layeth up riches for himself, and is not rich towards God.</hi> So that if Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
might not consist with Religion, it would not hurt our cause; but they may, they doe.
<hi>Godliness hath the promise of this life,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> and of the next;</hi> of both, but of <hi>this first. The
seed of the righteous,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. 112. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>shall be mighty upon earth, and wealth and riches shall be in his house.</hi>
Many places of Scripture tell us that the wicked <hi>may be</hi> rich, and that they <hi>are</hi> rich; but
in no place does God promise that they <hi>shall be</hi> rich. So says <hi>Davids</hi> sonne, <hi>Solomon,</hi>
too,<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>The Crown of the wise is their riches;</hi> we all know what men <hi>Solomon</hi> means by <hi>wise
men;</hi> Godly men, Religious men; And <hi>their Crown is Riches.</hi> Beloved, there is an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ioy,</hi> there is an <hi>outward dignity</hi> and reverence, that accompanies <hi>Riches,</hi> and the
<hi>Godly,</hi> the righteous man is not incapable of these; Nay, they belong rather to him,
then to the ungodly:<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Non decent stultum divitiae,</hi> (as the Vulgat reades that place)
<hi>Riches doe not become a fool.</hi> But because, for all that, though Riches doe not <hi>become</hi>
a fool, yet <hi>fools doe become rich;</hi> our Translations read that place thus: <hi>joy, pleasure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
is not seemly for a fool;</hi> Though the fool, the ungodly man, may bee rich, yet a
right joy, a holy delight in riches, belongs onely to the wise, to the righteous. The
Patriarchs in the Old Testament, many examples in the New, are testimonies to us of
the compatibility of riches, and righteousnesse; that they may, that they have often
met in one person. For, is fraud, and circumvention so sure a way, of attaining Gods
blessings, as industry, and conscientiousnesse is? Or is God so likely to concurre with
the fraudulent, the deceitfull man, as with the laborious, and religious? Was not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias,</hi>
with his disguises, more suddenly destroyed, then <hi>Iob,</hi> and more irrecoverably?
And cannot a <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> or an <hi>Exchequer,</hi> leave an ungodly man as poor, as a <hi>storm
at sea,</hi> in a ship-wracke, or a <hi>fire at land,</hi> in a lightning, can doe the godly? Murmure
not, be not scandalized, nor offended in him, if God, for reasons reserved to himselfe,
keep thee in <hi>poverty;</hi> but know, that God hath exposed the riches of this world, as well,
rather to the godly, then the wicked. And so have you the second branch of this first
part, The scandals which, for the most part, were taken at Christ, and his Gospel, by the
Philosophers, that it was a Religion contrary to <hi>Reason,</hi> by <hi>worldly,</hi> and carnall men,
that it was a Religion contrary to the <hi>honours,</hi> to the <hi>pleasures,</hi> to the <hi>profits</hi> of this
world; which, if it were so, were no impeachment to it, but it is not: And so wee are
come to the third branch, The <hi>particular passive scandall,</hi> which our Saviour depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in these <hi>two Disciples of Iohn,</hi> diverse from the rest.</p>
                     <p>That,<note place="margin">Discipuli Ioannis.</note> which mis-affected them towards Christ, was not that he induced a Religion
too low, too sordid, too humble, but <hi>not low enough,</hi> not humble enough; and therefore
they would out-bid Christ, and undertake more, then his Disciples practised, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
prescribed. Their Master, <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> discerned this distemper in them, then
when they said to him,<note place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Rabbi, He that was with thee beyond Iordan, baptizes as fast as
thou, and all the world comes to him. Iohn Baptist</hi> deals plainly with them, and he tels
them, that they must not be offended in that, for so it must be, <hi>He must increase,</hi> and <hi>I
must decrease.</hi> This troubled them; and because it did so, <hi>Iohn</hi> sends them personally
to Christ, to receive farther satisfaction. When they come at first to him, they say,
<hi>Sir,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 14.</note> we fast,</hi> and, <hi>even the Pharisees fast, why doe not you, and your Disciples fast too?</hi>
And then our blessed Saviour enlarges himselfe to them, in that point of <hi>fasting,</hi> and
they goe home satisfied. Now they returne againe, and they continue their wonder,
that Christ should continue his greatnesse, and his estimation in the world, they excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

make God the more beholden to them; To <hi>merit,</hi> and over-merit; To <hi>satisfie,</hi> and
super-satisfie the justice of God for their own, and for others sins. Now, God will
be served with <hi>all our power;</hi> But, say they, wee may serve God, with more then all our
power. How? Because I may have more power, more grace, more help, <hi>to day,</hi> then
I had <hi>yesterday?</hi> But does not the same Commandement, of serving God, with all my

lesse grace, lesse help, all was but <hi>Duty</hi> and service that could be done, is it the lesse
a service and a duty now, because God hath enlarged my capacity with more grace,
and more helps then before? Doe I owe God the lesse, because hee hath given me
more? All that my Saviour hath taught me, in this, to pray for, is but this, <hi>Dimitte
debita,</hi> Lord forgive mee the not-endevouring to keep thy Commandements: But for
<hi>not doing more</hi> then thy Commandements, I ask no forgiveness, by any prayer, or

And farther wee extend not this third consideration, The particular passive scandall,
which Christ found in these Disciples of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and which wee have noted in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny,
and off-spring but goe on to the fourth, The way that Christ took to devest them
thereof, by calling them to the contemplation of his works, Consider what you have
seen done, <hi>The blinde see, The lame goe, The deafe hear,</hi> and then you will not endanger
your <hi>blessednesse,</hi> by <hi>being offended in me.</hi>

                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:93359:216"/>The evidence that Christ produces,<note place="margin">Opera.</note> and presses, is good works; for, if a man offer
me the roote of a tree to taste, I cannot say this is such a Pear, or Apple, or Plum; but
if I <hi>see the fruit,</hi> I can. If a man pretend <hi>Faith</hi> to me, I must say to him, with Saint <hi>Iames,
Can his Faith save him?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. 14.</note> such a Faith, as that the Apostle declares himself to mean, A
<hi>dead Faith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">17.</note> as all Faith is that is inoperative, and workes not. But if I see <hi>his workes,</hi> I
proceed the right way in Judicature, I judge <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> according to
my evidence: And if any man will say, those workes may be <hi>hypocriticall,</hi> I may say of
any witnesse, He may be perjured; but as long as I have no particular cause to think so,
it is good evidence to me,<note place="margin">Hilar.</note> as to hear that mans Oath, so to see this mans workes. <hi>Cum
in Coelis sedentem in Crucem agere non possum,</hi> Though I cannot crucifie Christ, being
now set at the right hand of his Father in Heaven, yet there is <hi>Odium impietatis,</hi> saith
that Father, A crucifying by <hi>ungodlinesse;</hi> An ungodly life in them that professe Christ,
is a daily crucifying of Christ. Therefore here Christ refers to good works; And there
is more in this then so: It is not onely good works, but good works in the highest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
The <hi>best</hi> works, that he that doth them, can doe: Therefore, in his own case he
appeals to <hi>Miracles.</hi> For if <hi>fasting</hi> were all, or <hi>wearing of Camells haire,</hi> all, or to have
done some good to some men, by <hi>Baptizing</hi> them, were all, these Disciples and their
Master might have had as much to plead as Christ. Therefore he calls them to the
consideration of works of a higher nature, of <hi>Miracles;</hi> for, God never subscribes nor

doe not rest in that, That those are not the words of one that hath a Devill, but
proceed to that, <hi>Can the Devill open the eyes of the blinde?</hi> He doth more then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
can doe; They appeal to his works, to his good workes, to his great works, to his
<hi>Miracles.</hi> But <hi>doth he put us to doe miracles?</hi> no; Though, in truth those sumptuous
and magnificent buildings, and endowments, which some have given for the sustentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

rich as they, have dropped, and crumbled out; Truely, he that doth <hi>as much as he can,</hi>
is almost a <hi>Miracle;</hi> And when Christ appeals to his <hi>Miracles</hi> he calls us therein, to the
best works we can doe. God will be loved <hi>with the whole heart,</hi> and God will have
that love declared with our whole substance. I must not thinke I have done enough, if
I have built an <hi>Almes-house;</hi> As long as I am able to doe more, I have done nothing.
This Christ intimates in producing his greatest works, <hi>Miracles;</hi> which <hi>Miracles</hi> he
closeth up with that, as with the greatest, <hi>Pauperes evangelizantur, The poore have the
Gospell preached unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this our Blessed Saviour doth not onely give an instruction to <hi>Iohns Disciples,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Paupores.</note> but
therein also derives and conveyes a precept upon us, upon us, who as we have received
mercy,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> have received the <hi>Ministery,</hi> and indeed, upon all you, whom he hath made <hi>Regale
Sacerdotium, A royall Priesthood,</hi> and <hi>Reges &amp; Sacerdotes,</hi> Kings and Priests unto your
God,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 10.</note> and bound you therby, as well as us to preach the Gospell to the poore, you, by
an <hi>exemplar life,</hi> and a Catechizing conversation, as well as us, by our words and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Now beloved, there are Poore, that are literally poore, <hi>poore</hi> in estate and
<hi>fortune;</hi> and <hi>poore,</hi> that are <hi>naturally</hi> poore, poore in <hi>capacity,</hi> and understanding; and
poore, that are <hi>spiritually poore,</hi> dejected in spirit, and insensible of the comforts, which
the Holy Ghost offers unto them; and to all these poore, are we all bound to preach the
Gospell. First then for them which are literally poore, <hi>poore in estate,</hi> how much doe they
want of this means of salvation, <hi>Preaching,</hi> which the rich have? They cannot maintain
Chaplains in their houses; They cannot forbear the necessary labours of their calling,
to hear extraordinary Sermons; They cannot have seats in Churches, whensoever they
come; They must <hi>stay,</hi> they must <hi>stand,</hi> they must <hi>thrust,</hi> they must overcome that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> makes an impossibility, that is, for any man to receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by that Sermon, that he hears with pain: They must take pains to hear. To these
poore therefore, the Lord and his Spirit hath sent me to preach the Gospell; That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
<hi>The Lord knoweth thy povertie,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 9.</note> but thou art rich;</hi> That Gospell, <hi>Be content with
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:93359:216"/>
such things as thou hast,<note place="margin">Hob. 13. 5.</note> for the Lord hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee;</hi>
And that Gospell, <hi>God hath chosen the poore of this world, rich in faith, heires of that
Kingdome, which he hath promised to them that love him;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">I. vnes 2. 5.</note> And this is the Gospell of
those poore, literally poore, poore in estate. To those that are <hi>naturally poore,</hi> poore in
<hi>understanding,</hi> the Lord and his Spirit hath sent me to preach the Gospell too; That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,
<hi>If any man lacke wisedome,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 5.</note> let him aske it of God; Solomon</hi> himselfe had none, till
he asked it there.<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 1.</note> And that Gospell where <hi>Iohn</hi> went bitterly, because there <hi>was a
Booke preseated,</hi> but <hi>no man could open it,</hi> It were a sad consideration, if now, when the
Booke of God, the Scripture is afforded to us, we could not open that Booke, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
those Scriptures. But there is the Gospell of those poore; That <hi>Lambe,</hi>
which is spoken of there, That <hi>Lambe,</hi> which in the same place is called a <hi>Lion</hi> too,
That Lambe-Lion hath opened the Booke for us. The humility of the Lambe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
the strength of the Lion; come humbly to the reading and hearing of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and thou shalt have strength of understanding. The Scriptures were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for a few, nor are to be reserved for a few; All they that were present at this Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lions
opening of the Book, that is, All they that come with modesty and humility, to
the search of the Scriptures, All they, (and they are no small number, for there they
are said to be <hi>ten thousand times ten thousand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">verse 11.</note> 
                        <hi>and thousands of thousands</hi>) All they say
there, <hi>We are all made Kings and Priests unto our God.</hi> Begin a <hi>Lambe,</hi> and thou will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Lion;</hi> Reade the Scriptures modestly, humbly, and thou shalt understand them
strongly,<note place="margin">Homil. 2. in Gen. &amp; 3. in 2 Thess.</note> powerfully; for hence is it that Saint <hi>Chrys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Gregory</hi> after him, meet in that expression, That the Scriptures are a Sea, in which a
<hi>Lambe</hi> may wade, and an <hi>Elephant</hi> may swimme. And this is the Gospell of those
poore, poore in understanding. To those that are <hi>spiritually poore,</hi> wrung in their souls,
stung in their Consciences, fretted, galled, exulcerated viscerally, even in the bowells
of their Spirit, insensible, inapprehensive of the mercies of God in Christ, the Lord
and his Spirit hath sent me to preach the Gospell also,<note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> That Gospell, <hi>Blessed are the
poore in Spirit, for theirs it the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> and to recollect, and redintegrate
that broken and scattered heart, by enabling him to expostulate, and chide his owne
soule, with those words of comfort, which the Holy Ghost offereth him, once, and
again, and again, <hi>Why art thou cast downe, O my soule, and why art thou disquieted in
me? Hope thou in God;<note place="margin">Psal 42. 5. 11.</note> and, yet praise him for the light of his countenance.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 43. 5.</note> Words of
inexpresible comfort, <hi>yet praise him for the light of his countenance;</hi> Though thou
<hi>sit in darknesse,</hi> and <hi>in the shadow of death,</hi> yet praise him for the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Whatsoever <hi>thy darknesse</hi> be, put not out that candle, <hi>The light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
Maintain that light, discerne that light, and whatsoever thy darknesse seemed,
it shall prove to be but an <hi>over shadowing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And so beloved, if you have
sufficiently considered, first, our generall easinesse of falling into the Passive scandall,
of being offended in others, by misinterpreting their proceedings, and then the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
scandals which the world tooke at Christ, and his Gospell, The Philosophers,
that it was an ignorant religion, (where you saw, <hi>That the learneder the adversary is,
the sooner he is satisfied</hi>) And the worldly and carnall man, that it was a dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
an unpleasurable, an unprofitable Religion, (where you saw, that it were no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
to our Religion, if it were all that, but it is none of it) If you have also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the particular passive scandall that Christ deprehended in those two Disciples
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> That they would doe more then Christ practised or prescribed, (where you
saw also the distemper of those, that are derived from them, both those that thinke there
are some sinners whom Christ cannot save, and those who thinke there are no sinners
whom they cannot save, by their <hi>Supererogations</hi>) And considered lastly, the way that
Christ tooke, to devest these men of this offence, and passive scandall, which was to
call them to the consideration <hi>of good workes,</hi> and of the <hi>best workes,</hi> which he that doth
them, can doe, (where you have also seen, that Christ makes that our best work, <hi>To
preach the Gospell to the poore,</hi> both because the poore are destitute of other comforts,
and because their very poverty hath soupled them, and mellowed them, and macerated,
and matured, and disposed them, by corrections to instructions) If you have received
all this, you have received all that we proposed for the first part the injunction, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
the way, <hi>Be not sandalized, be not offended in me.</hi> And now, that which I suspected at
first, is faln upon me, that is to thrust our other part into a narrow conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though it be
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:93359:217"/>
                        <hi>blessednesse</hi> it selfe, everlasting blessednesse; so we must; so we shall; <hi>blessed is he,</hi> (there's
the remuneration, the promise, the end) <hi>whosoever is not offended in me. Blessed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Heathen,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Part,</hi> Blessed.</note> who saw by the light of nature, that they could have no Beeing, if
there were no God, (for it is from one of themselves, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>in him we
live,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> and move, and have our Beeing,</hi> and <hi>Genus cjus su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>us,</hi> we are the off-spring of God)
saw also by the same light of nature, that they could have no well-being, if there were no
Blessednesse. And therefore, as the Heathen multiplied Gods to themselves, so did they
also multiply blessednesse. They brought their <hi>Iupiters</hi> to <hi>three hundred,</hi> says <hi>Varro;</hi>
And from the same author, from <hi>Varro,</hi> does Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> collect almost <hi>three
hundred severall opinions of Blessednesse.</hi> But, <hi>In multitudine nullitas,</hi> says <hi>Tertullian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently;
as where there are many Gods, there is no God, so where there are many
blessednesses imagined, there is no blessednesse possessed. Not but that, as the <hi>Sunne</hi>
which moves onely in his owne Spheare in heaven, does yet cast downe beames and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
into this world, so that blessednesse which is truly, onely in heaven, does also
cast downe <hi>beames</hi> and <hi>influences</hi> hither, and gild, and enamell, yea inanimate the
blessings of God here, with the true name, the true nature of blessednesse.<note place="margin">Psal.144.15.</note> For, though
the vulgat edition doe read that place, thus, <hi>Beatum dixerant populum,</hi> the world thought
that people blessed that were so, that is, Temporally blessed, as though that were but
an imaginary, and not a true blessednesse; and howsoever it have seemed good to our
Translators, to insert into that verse a <hi>discretive particle,</hi> a particle of difference, Yea,
(<hi>Blessed are</hi> the <hi>people</hi> that <hi>are</hi> so,) that is, Temporally blessed, <hi>Yea, blessed</hi> are <hi>the people
whose God is the Lord,</hi> yet in truth, in the <hi>Originall,</hi> there is <hi>no such discretive</hi> particle,
no word of difference, no <hi>yea,</hi> in the text, but both the clauses of that verse are carried
in one and the same tenor, <hi>Blessed are the people that are so, Blessed are the people whose
God is the Lord;</hi> that is, that people whom the Lord hath blessed so, with <hi>Temporall</hi>
blessings, is bound to beleeve those temporall blessings, to be seales and evidences to
them that the Lord is their God. So then there is a <hi>Viatory,</hi> a preparatory, an initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
an inchoative blessednesse in this life. What is that? All agree in this definition,
that blessednesse is that <hi>in quo quiescit animus,</hi> in which the minde, the heart, the desire
of man hath settled, and rested, in which it found a <hi>Centricall</hi> reposednesse, an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence,
a contentment. Not that which might satisfie any <hi>particular</hi> man; for, so
the object would be infinitely various; but that, beyond which no man could propose
any thing;<note place="margin">August.</note> And is there such ablessednesse in this life? There is. <hi>Fecisti nos Domine
ad te, &amp; inquietum est Cor nostrum, donec quiescat in te;</hi> Lord thou hast made us for
thy selfe, and our heart cannot rest, till it get to thee. But can we come to God here?
We cannot. Where's then our viatory, our preparatory, our initiatory, our in choative
blessednesse. Beloved, though we cannot come to God here, here <hi>God comes to us;</hi>
Here, in the <hi>prayers</hi> of the Congregation God comes to us; here, in his Ordinance of
<hi>Preaching,</hi> God delivers himselfe to us; here in the administration of his <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
he seals, ratifies, confirmes all unto us; And to rest in these his seals and means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
to him, this is not to <hi>be scandalised, not to be offended in him;</hi> and, not to be
offended in him, <hi>not to suspect</hi> him or these meanes which he hath ordained, this is our
viatory, our preparatory, our initiatory and inchoative Blessednesse, beyond which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be proposed in this life. And therefore, as the <hi>Needle</hi> of a <hi>Sea-compasse,</hi>
though it shake long, yet will rest at last, and though it do not look directly, exactly to
the North Pole, but have some <hi>variation,</hi> yet, for all that variation, will rest, so, though
thy heart have some variations, some deviations, some aberrations from that direct
point, upon which it should be bent, which is an absolute conformity of thy will to the
will of God, yet, though thou lack something of that, afford thy soule rest: settle thy
soule in such an <hi>infallibility,</hi> as this present condition can admit, and beleeve, that God
receives glory as well in thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> as in thine <hi>Innocence,</hi> and that the mercy of
God in Christ, is as good a pillow to rest thy soule upon <hi>after</hi> a sinne, as the <hi>grace</hi> of
God in Christ is a shield, and protection for thy soule, before. In a word, this is our
viatory, our preparatory, our initiatory, and inchoative blessedness, beyond which there
can bee no blessedness proposed here, first to receive a satisfaction, an acquiescence,
that there are certaine and constant meanes ordained by Christ, for our reconciliation
to God in him, in all cases, in which a Christian soule can bee distressed, that such
a treasure there is deposited by him, in the Church, And then, the testimony
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:93359:217"/>
of a rectified Conscience, that thou hast sincerely applied those generall helpes
to thy particular soule. Come so farre, and then, as the <hi>Suburbs</hi> touch the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and <hi>the Porch</hi> the Church, and deliver thee into it, so shall this Viatory, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory,
this initiatory and inchoative blessednesse deliver thee over to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
blessednesse of the Kingdome of heaven. Of which everlasting blessednesse,
I would ask leave, not so much of you; (yet of you too, for with you, I would
not be over-bold) but I would aske leave of the Angels of heaven, leave of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost himself, to venture to say a little, of this everlasting blessednesse: The
tongues of Angels cannot, the tongues of the holy Ghost, the Authors of the books
of Scripture have not told us, what this blessednesse is; And what then shall we say,
but this?</p>
                     <p>Blessednesse it self,<note place="margin">In Caelis.</note> is God himselfe; our blessednesse is our possession; our union
with God. In what consists this? A great limbe of the Schoole with their <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
place this blessednesse, this union with God, <hi>In visione,</hi> in this, That in heaven
<hi>I shall see God,</hi> see God essentially, <hi>God face to face,</hi> God as he is. We do not see
one another so, in this world; In this world we see but outsides; In heaven I shall see
God, and God essentially. But then another great branch of the Schoole, with their
<hi>Scotus,</hi> place this blessednesse, this union with God, <hi>in Amore,</hi> in this, that in heaven,
I shall love God.<note place="margin">August.</note> Now love presumes knowledge; for, <hi>Amari nisi nota new possunt,</hi>
we can love nothing, but that which we do, or think we do understand. There, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I shall <hi>know</hi> God, so, as that I shall be admitted, not onely to an <hi>Adoration</hi> of God,
to an <hi>admiration</hi> of God, to a <hi>prosternation,</hi> and reverence before God, but to an <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
to an office, of more familiarity towards God, of more equality with God, I
shall <hi>love</hi> God. But even love it selfe, as noble a passion as it is, is but a paine,
except we enjoy that we love; and therefore another branch of the Schoole, with
their <hi>Aureolus,</hi> place this blessednesse, this union of our souls with God, <hi>in Gaudio,</hi> in
our joy, that is, in our enjoying of God. In this world we enjoy nothing; enjoying
presumes perpetuity; and here, all things are fluid, transitory: There I shall enjoy, and
possesse for ever, God himself. But yet, every one of these, to <hi>see</hi> God, or to <hi>love</hi>
God, or to <hi>enjoy</hi> God, have seemed to some too narrow to comprehend this blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
beyond which, nothing can be proposed; and therefore another limbe of the
Schoole, with their <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> place this blessednesse <hi>in all these</hi> together. And truly,
if any of those did exclude any of these, so, as that I might <hi>see</hi> God, and not <hi>love</hi>
him, or love God, and not <hi>enjoy</hi> him, it could not well be called <hi>blessednesse;</hi> but he
that hath any one of these, hath every one, all: And therefore the greatest part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
and safely, <hi>In visione,</hi> That vision is <hi>beatification,</hi> to see God, as he is, is that
blessednesse.</p>
                     <p>There then, in heaven, I shall have <hi>continuitatem Intuendi;</hi> It is not onely <hi>vision,</hi> but
<hi>Intuition,</hi> not onely a seeing, but a beholding, a contemplating of God, and that <hi>in
Continuitate,</hi> I shall have an un-interrupted, an un-intermitted, an un-discontinued sight
of God, I shall looke, and never looke off; not looke, and looke againe, as here, but

next day after that, which is the day of judgement, <hi>Veniet dies, quae me mihi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velabit;</hi>
comes that day that shall show me to my selfe; here I never saw my selfe,
but in disguises: There, Then, I shall see my selfe, and see God too. <hi>Totam lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,

There I shal see God intirely, all God, <hi>totam lutem,</hi> and <hi>totus lax,</hi> I my self shal be al light
to see that light by. Here, I have one faculty enlightned, and another left in darknesse:
mine <hi>uuderstanding</hi> sometimes cleared, my <hi>will,</hi> at the same time perverted. There,
I shall be all light, no shadow upon me; my soule invested in the <hi>light of joy,</hi> and my
body in the <hi>light of glory.</hi> How glorious is God, as he looks down upon us, through
the Sunne? How glorious in that glasse of his? How glorious is God, as he looks
out amongst us through <hi>the king?</hi> How glorious in that Image of his? How glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is God, as he calls up our eyes to him, in the beauty, and splendor, and service of
the Church? How glorious in that spoufe of his? But how glorious shall I conceive
this light to be, <hi>cum sub loco viderim,</hi> when I shall see it, in his owne place. In that
Spheare, which though a Spheare, is a Center too; In that place, which, though a
place, is all, and every where. I shall see it, in the face of that God, who is all face,
all manifestration,<note place="margin">August.</note> all all Innotescence to me, (for, <hi>facies Deiest, qua Deus nobis innotescit,</hi>
that's Gods face to us, by which God manifests himselfe to us) I shall see this light
in his face, who is all face, and yet all hand, all application, and communication, and
delivery of all himselfe to all his Saints. This is <hi>Beatitudo in Auge,</hi> blessednesse in the
Meridionall height, blessednesse in the South point, in a perpetuall Sommer solstice,
beyond which nothing can be proposed, to see God so, Then, There. And yet the
farmers of heaven and hell, the merchants of soules, <hi>the Romane Church,</hi> make this
blessednesse, but an under degree, but a kinde of apprentiship; after they have beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
declared a man to be blessed in the fruition of God in heaven, if that man, in
that inferiour state doe good service to that Church, that they see much profit will
rise, by the devotion, and concurrence of men, to the worship; of that person, then they
will proceed to a <hi>Canonization;</hi> and so, he that in his <hi>Novitiat,</hi> and years of probation
was but blessed <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and blessed <hi>Xavier,</hi> is lately become Saint <hi>Xavier,</hi> aud Saint
<hi>Ignatius.</hi> And so they pervert the right order, and method, which is first to come
to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and then to <hi>Beatification,</hi> first to holinesse, and then to blessednesse.
And in this method, our blessed God bee pleased to proceed with us, by the operation
of his holy Spirit, to bring us to <hi>Sanctification</hi> here, and by the merits and intercession
of his glorious Sonne, to <hi>Beatification</hi> hereafter. That so not being offended in him,
but resting in those meanes and seales, of reconciliation, which thou hast instituted in
thy Church, wee may have life, and life more abundantly, life of grace here, and life
of glory there, in that kingdome, which thy Sonne, our Saviour Christ Jesus hath
purchased for us, with the inestimable price of his incorruptible bloud. <hi>Amen.</hi>

hee is named <hi>plurally, Creavit Dit, Gods,</hi> Gods in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
Created Heaven and Earth. God, which is but <hi>one,</hi>
would not appeare, nor bee presented so <hi>alone,</hi> but that hee
would also manifest more persons. As the <hi>Creator</hi> was not <hi>Singular,</hi> so neither
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:93359:218"/>
were the <hi>creatures;</hi> First, he created <hi>heaven and earth;</hi> both together; which were to
be the generall parents, and out of which were to bee produced all other creatures;
and then, he made all those other creatures plurally too; <hi>Male, and female created hee
them;</hi> And when he came to make <hi>him,</hi> for whose sake (next to his own glory) he made
the whole world, <hi>Adam,</hi> he left not <hi>Adam alone,</hi> but joyned an <hi>Eve</hi> to him; Now, when
they were <hi>maried,</hi> we know, but wee know not when they were <hi>divorced;</hi> we heare
when <hi>Eve</hi> was made, but not when shee <hi>dyed;</hi> The husbands death is recorded at last,
the wives is not at all. So much detestation hath God himselfe, and so little me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
would hee have kept of any singularity, of being alone. The union of Christ
to the whole Church is not expressed by any metaphore, by any figure, so oft in the
Scripture, as by this of <hi>Mariage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> and there is in that union with Christ to the whole
Church, neither husband, nor wife can ever die; Christ is immortall as hee is
<hi>himselfe,</hi> and immortall, as hee is the <hi>head</hi> of the Church, the <hi>Husband</hi> of that wife:
for that wife, the Church is immortall too; for as a Prince is the same Prince, when
he fights a battaile, and when hee triumphs after the victory: so the militant, and
the triumphant Church is the same Church. There can bee no <hi>widower,</hi> There
can bee no <hi>Dowager,</hi> in that case; <hi>Hee</hi> cannot, <hi>shee</hi> cannot die. But then this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphore,
this spirituall Mariage, holds not onely betweene Christ and the whole
Church, in which case thee can be no Widow, but in the union between Christs
<hi>particular Ministers,</hi> and <hi>particular Churches;</hi> and there, in that case, the husband of
that wife may die; The present Minister may die, and so that Church be a Widow;
And in that case, and for provision of such Widows, wee consider the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
of this Law. If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and
have no childe, the wife of the dead shall not mary without, unto a stranger,
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This law was but a <hi>permissive</hi> law; rather a <hi>dispensation,</hi> then a <hi>law:</hi> as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of <hi>usury</hi> to bee taken of strangers, and the permitting of <hi>divorces</hi> in so
many cases, were. At most it was but a <hi>Iudiciall</hi> law, and therefore layes no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
upon any other nation, then <hi>them,</hi> to whom it was given, the <hi>Iews.</hi> And
therefore wee enquire not the <hi>reasons</hi> of that law, (the <hi>reasons</hi> were determined in
that <hi>people</hi>) wee examine not the <hi>conveniences</hi> of the law; (the <hi>conveniences</hi> were
determined in those <hi>times</hi>) wee lay hold onely upon the <hi>Typique signification,</hi> and
appliablenesse of the law, as that <hi>secular Mariage</hi> there spoken of, may be appliable
to this <hi>spirituall Mariage,</hi> the Mariage of the Minister to the Church: <hi>If brethren
dwell together, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From these words then, wee shall make our approaches, and application,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> to
the present occasion, by these steps; First, there is a mariage, in the case. The
taking, and leaving of a Church, is not an indifferent, an arbitrary thing; It is
a <hi>Mariage,</hi> and Mariage implies, <hi>Honour:</hi> It is an honourable estate, and that
implies <hi>charge,</hi> it is a burdensome state; There is <hi>Honos,</hi> and <hi>Onus,</hi> Honour,
and labour, in Mariage; You must bee content to afford the <hi>honour,</hi> wee must
bee content to endure the <hi>labour.</hi> And so in that point, as our <hi>Incumbencie</hi>
upon a Church, is our <hi>Mariage</hi> to that Church, wee shall as farre, as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
admits, see what mariage includes, and what it excludes; what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
what it forbids. It is a mariage, and a mariage after the death of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
<hi>If one dye,</hi> sayes the Text; Howsoever the <hi>Romane Church</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their <hi>Tyranny,</hi> have forbidden Church-men to mary, then when they
have <hi>orders,</hi> and forbidden <hi>orders</hi> to bee given to any, who have formerly
beene maried, if they maried <hi>Widowes,</hi> God is pleased here, to afford us,
some intimation, some adumbration, a <hi>Typicall</hi> and exemplar knowledge of
the lawfulnesse of such mariages, hee maries after the death of a former hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and then farther, a brother maries the wife of his deceased brother;
Now into the <hi>reasons</hi> of the law, literally given, and literally accepted, wee
looke not; It is enough, that <hi>God</hi> hath a care of the preservation of <hi>names</hi>
and <hi>families</hi> and <hi>inheritances</hi> in those distinctions, and in those <hi>Tribes;</hi>
where hee layd them then; but for the accommodation of the law to
our present application, it must bee a <hi>brother, a spirituall brother, a professor</hi> of the <hi>same
faith,</hi> that succeeds in this mariage, in this possession, and this government of that wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:93359:219"/>
Church. It must be a brother, and <hi>Frater c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>habitans,</hi> says our Text, a brother
that dwelt together, with the former husband; he must be of <hi>the same houshold of the
faithfull,</hi> as well as professe the same faith; he must dwell in the house of God, not <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
himselfe, or encourage others to doe so, for matter of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>discipline;
Idolaters</hi> must not, <hi>Separaists</hi> must not be admitted to these mariages, to these widow
churches. And then it is a surrendring to a brother <hi>dead without children:</hi> In this
<hi>spirituall procreation</hi> of children, we all dye without children <hi>of our own;</hi> Though by
our labours, when God blesses them, you become children, yet you are <hi>Gods children,</hi>
not <hi>ours;</hi> we <hi>nurse</hi> you by his word, but his <hi>Spirit begets you by the same word;</hi> we
must not challenge to <hi>us,</hi> that which God onely can doe. And then being thus maried
to this widow, taking the charge of this Church, he must, says our text, <hi>performe the
duty of a husbands brother. He must,</hi> it is a <hi>personall service,</hi> not to be done always by
<hi>Proxy,</hi> and <hi>Delegates; He must;</hi> and he must <hi>performe;</hi> not <hi>begin</hi> well, and not <hi>persist,
commence</hi> and not <hi>consummate,</hi> but <hi>performe</hi> the worke, and performe the worke, as it
is a <hi>duty;</hi> It is a meer <hi>mercy</hi> in God, to send us to you, but it is a <hi>duty</hi> in us, to doe that
which we are sent for, by his <hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> to establish you in his holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and his rich, and honourable service. And then our duty consists in both these,
that we behave our selves, <hi>as your husband,</hi> which implies a <hi>power,</hi> an <hi>authority;</hi> but a
power and authority rooted in <hi>love,</hi> and exercised with love; and then that we doe all as
<hi>brothers to the former husband,</hi> that as one intentation of this law was, that <hi>inheritances,</hi> and
<hi>temporall proprieties</hi> might be preserved, so our care might be through predecessor, and
successor, and all, that all rights might be preserved to all men, that nothing not due, or
due onely in rigor, be extorted from the people, nothing that is in truth, or in equity
due, be with-held from the <hi>Minister;</hi> but that the true <hi>right</hi> of <hi>people,</hi> and <hi>Pastor,</hi> and
<hi>Patron</hi> be preserved, to the preservation of love, and peace, and good opinion of one
another.</p>
                     <p>First then, that which we take upon us, is a <hi>Mariage.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</note> Amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> it was almost
an ignominious, an infamous thing, to die unmaried, at least to die without children, being
maried. Amongst the <hi>gentiles</hi> it was so too all well governed States ever enlarged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in giving places of command and profit, to <hi>maried men.</hi> Indeed such men are most
properly said to keep <hi>this world</hi> in reparations, that provide a succession of children;
and for the <hi>next world,</hi> though all that are borne into this world, doe not enter into
the number of Gods Saints, in heaven, yet the Saints of heaven can be made out of
no other materialls, but men borne into this world. Every stone in the quarry is not
sure to be imployed in the building of the church, but the Church must be built out of
those stones; and therefore they keep this world, they keep heaven it selfe in reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>mary</hi> in the feare of God, and in the same feare bring up the children of such a
mariage. But I presse not this too literally, nor over perswasively, that every man is
bound to <hi>Mary; God is no accepter of persons,</hi> nor of <hi>conditions.</hi> But being to use these
words in their figurative application, I say, every man is bound to marry himselfe to a
profession, to a calling: God hath brought him from being <hi>nothing,</hi> by creating him,
but he resolves himselfe into nothing againe, if he take no calling upon him. In our
<hi>Baptisme</hi> we make our contract with <hi>God,</hi> that we will believe all those <hi>Articles</hi> there
recited; there's our contract with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and then, pursuing this contract, in the <hi>other
Sacrament,</hi> when we take his body and his blood, we are <hi>maried</hi> to him. So at the same
time, at our <hi>Baptisme,</hi> we make a contract in the presence of God, and his congregation
with the <hi>world;</hi> that we wil forsake the covetous desires of the world, that is, the covetous
proprieting of all things to our selves, the covetous living onely for our selves, there's
our contract with the world, that we will mutually assist, and serve our brethren in the
world; and then, when we take <hi>particular callings,</hi> by which we are enabled to perform
that former contract, then we are maried to the world; so every man is duly <hi>contracted</hi>
to the world, in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and lawfully <hi>maried</hi> to the world in accepting a <hi>profession.</hi>
And so this service of ours to the Church is our mariage.</p>
                     <p>Now in a Matrioniall state,<note place="margin">Onus.</note> there is <hi>onus</hi> and <hi>Honos,</hi> a burden to be born, an <hi>Honour</hi>
to be received. The burden of the sinnes of the <hi>whole world,</hi> was a burden onely for
<hi>Christs</hi> shoulders; but the sinnes of <hi>this Parish,</hi> willly upon my shoulders, if I be <hi>silent,</hi> or
if I be <hi>indulgent,</hi> and denounce not Gods Judgement upon those sinnes. It will be a
burden to us, if we doe not, and God knowes it is a burden to us, when be do denounce
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:93359:219"/>
those Judgements. <hi>Esay</hi> felt, and groned under this burden, when he cried <hi>Onus Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonis
Onus Moab,</hi> and <hi>Onus Damasci, O the burden of Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>burden of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mscus,</hi>
and so the other Prophets grone often under this burden, in contemplation of
other places: It burdened, it troubled, it grieved the holy Prophets of God, that they
must denounce Gods judgements, though upon Gods enemies. We reade of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
<hi>Generall,</hi> that looking upon his great Army, from a hill, fell into a bitter weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon this consideration, that in fiftie or sixtie years hence, there will not be a man
of these that fight now, alive upon the earth. What Sea could furnish mine eyes with
teares enough, to poure out, if I should think, that of all this Congregation, which
lookes me in the face now, I should not meet one, at the Resurrection, at the right hand
of God! And for so much as concerns me, it is all one, if none of you be saved, as if
none of you be saved by <hi>my help,</hi> my means, my assistance, my preaching. If I put you
upon miraculous wayes, to be saved without hearing, or upon extraordinary wayes to
be saved by <hi>hearing others,</hi> this shall aggravate my condemnation, though you be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
How much more heavy must my burden be, if by my negligence both I and you
perish too? So then this calling, this marriage, is a burden every way. When at any
midnight I heare a bell toll from this steeple, must not I say to my selfe, what have I
done at any time for the instructing or rectifying of that mans Conscience, who lieth
there now ready to deliver up his own account, and my account to Almighty God? If
he be not able to make a good account, he and I are in danger, because I have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him; and though he be for himself able, that delivers not me, if I have been no
instrument for the doing of it. Many, many burdens lie upon this calling, upon this
marriage; but our <hi>recompense</hi> is, that marriage is as well an honourable as a painefull
calling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If be a Father, where is mine Honour,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Honos. Malac. 1. 6.</note> faith God: If you can answer <hi>God, why, you
have it in your Prophets, They have it, that</hi> satisfieth <hi>him, that dischargeth you.</hi> For, <hi>he
that receiveth them, receiveth him:</hi> But if Christ, who repeats that complaint, in every
one of <hi>us,</hi> That <hi>a Prophet hath no honour in his own Countrie,</hi> that a <hi>Pastor</hi> is least respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of his <hi>own stock,</hi> you have not your <hi>Quctus est,</hi> for the honour due to God; God
never discharges the honour due to him, if it be not paid into their hands, whom he sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for it, to them upon whom he hath directed it. Would the King believe that man, to
honour him, that violateth his <hi>Image,</hi> or that calumniateth his <hi>Ambassadour?</hi> Every
man is the <hi>Image</hi> of God; every <hi>Creature</hi> is the <hi>Ambassadour</hi> of God; <hi>The Heavens,</hi>
(and as well as the Heavens, the Earth) <hi>declare the glory of God;</hi> but the <hi>Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>
and the <hi>Spirituall Paster,</hi> who have married the <hi>two Daughters of God,</hi> The <hi>state
and the</hi> Church, <hi>are the</hi> Images and <hi>Ambassadours of God,</hi> in a higher and more peculiar
sense, and for that marriage are to be honoured. And then Honour implieth <hi>that,</hi> by
which Honour subsisteth, <hi>maintenance;</hi> and they which withdraw <hi>that injuriously,</hi> or
with-hold <hi>that contentiously,</hi> dishonour God, in the dishonour of his servants, and so
make this marriage, this calling onely burdensome and not honourable.</p>
                     <p>So then the interest of your <hi>particular Minister,</hi> and the particular Church, being such
as between <hi>Man and Wife, a marriage,</hi> we consider the uses of marriage in Gods first
intention, and apply them to this marriage. Gods first intentions in marriage were
two. <hi>In adjutorium,</hi> for mutuall helpers, and <hi>in prolem,</hi> for procreation, and education
of Children. For both these are we made Husbands of Churches; <hi>in prolem, to assist</hi>
in the <hi>regeneration of Children,</hi> for the inheritance of Heaven; and <hi>in adjutorium,</hi> to be
helpers to one another. And therefore if the husband, the Pastor, put the wife, his flock
in a <hi>circumcision,</hi> to pare themselves to the quick, to take from their necessary means
to sustain their families, to satisfie him; the wife will say as <hi>Zipporah</hi> said to <hi>Moses, spon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
sus sanguinum, a bloudy husband art thou,</hi> that exactest and extortest more then is due,
In that case the Husband is no helper. But if we be alwayes ready to help your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
over the threshold, (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calls Baptisme, Limen Ecclesiae) alwayes
ready to <hi>Baptize</hi> the Children; if we be alwayes ready to help you in all your <hi>spirituall
diseases,</hi> to that <hi>Cordiall,</hi> that <hi>Balsamum,</hi> the <hi>body and bloud of Christ Iesus;</hi> If we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ready to help you in all your <hi>bodily distresses,</hi> ready even at your last gasp to open
your eyes then, when your best friends are ready to close them; ready to deliver your
souls into the hands of God, when all the rest about you are ready to receive into their
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:93359:220"/>
hands, that which you leave behinde you, and then ready to lay up the <hi>garments</hi> of
your <hi>soules,</hi> your bodies, in the <hi>wardrobe</hi> the <hi>grave,</hi> till you call for them, and put them
on again, in the resurrection, then are we truely <hi>helpers,</hi> true husbands; and then if the
Wife will say, as <hi>Iobs</hi> wife to the husband, <hi>Curse God and die,</hi> be sorry, that thou hast
taken this <hi>Profession</hi> upon thee, and live in penury, and die in povertie. In a word, if he
presse too much, if she withdraw too much, this frustrates Gods purpose in making that
a marriage; they are not mutuall helpers to one another. These were Gods two principall
intentions in marriage, <hi>in adjutorium, in prolem.</hi> But then mans fall induced a third, <hi>in
remedium,</hi> That for a remedy against burning, and to avoid fornication, every man
should have his own wife, every woman her own husband. And so <hi>in remedium,</hi> for a
remedy against <hi>spirituall fornication,</hi> of running after <hi>other men</hi> in other places, out of
disaffection to their own Pastor, or over affecting another, God hath given every wife,
her own husband, Every Church her own Pastor. And to all these purposes, our fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a marriage.</p>
                     <p>It is a marriage,<note place="margin">Defuncti.</note> it deserves the honour, it undertakes the burden of that state; and
then it is a marriage <hi>of a widow,</hi>

                        <hi>of a Church left in widow-hood by the death of her former
husband.</hi> In the Law literally God forbad the <hi>High Priest</hi> to <hi>marry a widdow.</hi> The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Church continues that literally, and more; they extend it; that which was in
<hi>figure,</hi> enjoined to the <hi>High Priest</hi> onely, they in <hi>fact</hi> extend to all Priests; no man
that ever married a widow, may be a priest, though she be dead, when he desires orders.
There is no question but there is a more <hi>exemplary sanctity</hi> required in the Priest, then
in other persons, and more in those, who are in high places in the Church, then in those
of inferiour Jurisdictions, and the name and title of <hi>Virginity,</hi> hath ever been exhibited
as an Embleme, as a Type of especiall Sanctity. And as such the Apostle uses it when
he saith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>That he would present the Church of Corinth, as a chaste Virgine to Christ;</hi> That is,
as chaste as a Virgin, though married, for so he saith in the words immediately before,
<hi>That he had espoused them to a husband:</hi> As marriage is an honourable state, though in
poverty, so is the <hi>bed undefiled</hi> with strange lust, a chaste bed even in marriage. And in
the accommodation of the <hi>Figure</hi> to the present occasion, our marriage to severall
Churches, If we might marry no <hi>widowes,</hi> (no Churches, which had been wives to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
husbands) we should finde few <hi>Virgins,</hi> that is, Churches newly erected for us. But
when the wife of a former husband is left a widow, <hi>Nubat in Domino,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. ult.</note> 
                        <hi>In Gods name let her marry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the former husband must be <hi>dead:</hi> The husbands <hi>absence</hi> makes not the wife a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
nor doth the necessary, and lawfull absence of the Pastor, make the Church <hi>vacant.</hi>
The <hi>sicknesse</hi> of the husband makes not a widow; The <hi>bodily weaknesse nay the spirituall
weaknes</hi> of the Pastor in case that his parts and abilities, and faculties, be grown but weak,
do not make his Church vacant. If the Pastor be <hi>suspended,</hi> or otherwise censured, this
is but as a separation, or as a <hi>divorce;</hi> and as the wife is not a widow, upon a divorce, so
neither is the Church vacant, upon such censures. And therefore for them that take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
upon the weaknesses, or upon the <hi>disgrace,</hi> or upon the <hi>povertie</hi> of any such
<hi>incumbent,</hi> and so insinuate themselves into his Church, this is <hi>intrusion,</hi> this is <hi>spirituall
adultery,</hi> for the husband is not <hi>dead,</hi> though he be sick. Nay if they would remove
him by way of <hi>preferment,</hi>

few cases are put when a wife becomes as a widow, her husband living; but regularly
it is by death. In some few cases, Churches may otherwise be vacant, but regularly it
is by death. And then <hi>Esto vidua in Dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He must be a brother,<note place="margin">Cohabitans.</note> and <hi>Frater Cohabitans, a brother dwelling with the former brother.</hi>
As he is a brother, we consider the <hi>unity of faith:</hi> As he dwels in the same house, we
consider the <hi>unity of discipline;</hi> That as he beleeves, and professes the same articles of
faith, so by his own obedience, and by his instructing of others, hee establish the same
government; A <hi>Schismatique</hi> is no more a brother to this purpose, then an <hi>Heretique.</hi>
If we look well, we shall see, that Christ provided better for his garments, then for his
flesh; he suffered his flesh to be torn, but not his seamlesse garment. There may bee, in
many cases, more mischief, in disobeying the uniformity of the discipline of the Church
then in mistaking in opinion, some doctrine of the Church. Wee see in Gods institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>cunning in the songs of the Church,</hi> they are called <hi>brethren;</hi> To oppose the orders of
the Church solemnly ordained, or customarily admitted, for the advancement of Gods

all these:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13. 3. 6.</note> wee have no children to beget of our own: <hi>Paul was not crucified for you, nor
were you baptized in the name of Paul,</hi> sayes <hi>Paul</hi> himself; as he sayes again, <hi>who is Paul?
but a Minister by whom ye beleeved,</hi> and that also not by him, but <hi>as the Lord gave to every

Lord gave to every man; <hi>I have planted,</hi> says he, it is true, but <hi>he that planteth is nothing,</hi>
says he also; Only they that proceed, as they proceed in the Romane Church <hi>Ex opere
operato,</hi> to tye the grace of God, to the action of the man, will venter to call Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>their</hi> children in that sense. My prayer shal be against that commination, That God
will not <hi>give us a miscarrying womb,</hi> nor <hi>dry breasts;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hose. 9. 14.</note> that you may always suck pure milk
from us, and then not cast it up, but digest it, to your spirituall growth; And I shall
call upon God with a holy passion,<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note> as vehement as <hi>Rachels</hi> to <hi>Iacob, Da mihi liberos,
give me children, or I die:</hi> That God would give <hi>me</hi> children, but <hi>his</hi> children; that <hi>he</hi>
by his Spirit, may give you an <hi>inward regeneration,</hi> as <hi>I,</hi> by his ordinance shall present
to you, the <hi>outward means,</hi> that so being begot by himselfe, the father of life, and of
light, you may be <hi>nursed,</hi> and brought up, in his service by <hi>me.</hi> That so, not attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the work to <hi>any man,</hi> but to Gods Ordinances, you doe not tye the power of God,
nor the breath of life, to any one mans lips, as though there were no regeneration, no
begetting, but by <hi>him;</hi> but acknowledging the other to be but an <hi>instrument,</hi> and the
weakest to be <hi>that,</hi> you may remember also, That though a man can cut deeper with
an Axe, then with a knife, with a heavy, then with a lighter instrument; yet God can
pierce as far into a conscience, by a plain, as by an exquisite speaker.</p>
                     <p>Now this widow being thus maried, This Church thus undertaken, <hi>He must perform
the duty of a husbands brother:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ille.</note> First, it is a <hi>personall office,</hi> he must doe it <hi>himself.</hi> When
Christ shall say, at the Judgement, <hi>I was naked, and ye cloathed me not, sick, and ye visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                        <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 43.</note> it shall be no excuse to say, <hi>When saw we thee naked, when saw we thee sick?</hi> for
wee might have seen it, wee should have seen it. When we shall come to our accompt,
and see <hi>them,</hi> whose salvation was committed to <hi>us,</hi> perish, because they were uninstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and ignorant, dare we say then, <hi>we never saw them,</hi> show their ignorance, wee never
heard of it? That is the greatest part of our fault, the heaviest weight upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
that we saw so little, heard so little, conversed so little amongst them, because
we were made watchmen, and bound to see, and bound to hear, and bound to be heard;
not by <hi>others,</hi> but by our <hi>selves;</hi> My sheep may be saved by others; but <hi>I</hi> save them not,
that are save so, nor shall <hi>I</hi> my self be saved by <hi>their</hi> labour, where <hi>mine</hi> was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
required.</p>
                     <p>The office is <hi>personall, I</hi> must doe it, and it is <hi>perpetuall,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Perpetuall.</note> I must <hi>perform</hi> it, sayes the
text, goe through with it. <hi>Lots</hi> wife looked backe, and God never gave her leave to
look forward again.<note place="margin">Luke 9. 62. 3. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>That man who hath put his hand to the plow,</hi> and <hi>looks back,</hi> Christ
disables him for the kingdome of God. The <hi>Galatians</hi> who had begun in the spirit,
and then <hi>relapsed,</hi> before <hi>whose eyes Christ Iesus had been evidently set forth,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaks, fall under that reproach of the Apostle, to bee called, and called againe,
<hi>fooles,</hi> and <hi>men bewitched.</hi> If I beginne to preach, amongst you, and proceed not, I
shall fall under that heavy increpation from my God, <hi>you beganne,</hi> that you might for
your owne glory, shew that you were in some measure, able to serve the Church, and
when you had done enough for your <hi>own glory,</hi> you gave over <hi>my glory,</hi> and the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their souls, to whom I sent you. God hath set our eyes in our foreheads, to
look forward, not backward, not to be proud of that which we have done, but diligent
in that which we are to doe. In the Creation, if God had given over his worke, the
third, or fift day, where had man been? If I give over my prayers, due to the Church
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:93359:221"/>
of God, as long as God enables me to doe it service, I lose my thanks, nay, I lose the
testimony of mine own conscience for all. My office is <hi>personall,</hi> and it is <hi>perpetuall,</hi>
and then it is <hi>a duty.<note place="margin">Duty.</note> He must perform the duty of a husbands brother unto her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not of <hi>curtesie,</hi> that we preach, but it is a <hi>duty,</hi> it is not a <hi>bounty</hi> given, but it
is a <hi>debt</hi> paid: for, <hi>though I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to glory of, for a necessity
is laid upon me,</hi> sayes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself. It is true,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> that as there is <hi>Vae si non, Wo be
unto mee, if I doe not preach the Gospel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note> so there is an <hi>Euge bone serve, Well done, good
and faithfull servant,</hi> to them that doe. But the <hi>Vae,</hi> is of <hi>Iustice,</hi> the <hi>Euge</hi> is of
<hi>Mercy;</hi> If doe it <hi>not,</hi> I deserve <hi>condemnation</hi> from God; but if, I <hi>doe it,</hi> I deserve not
<hi>thanks</hi> from him. Nay, it is a debt, not onely to God, but to <hi>Gods people,</hi> to <hi>you:</hi> and
indeed there is more due to you, then you can claime, or can take knowledge of. For
the people can claime but according to the <hi>laws</hi> of that State, and the <hi>Canons</hi> of that
Church, in which God hath placed them; such preaching, as those Laws, and those
Canons enjoyn, is a debt which they can call for: but the Pastor himself hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Court, another Barre in himselfe, by which hee tries himselfe, and must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne himselfe, if hee pay not this debt, performe not this duty, as often, as himself,
knowes himselfe, to bee fit, and able to doe it.</p>
                     <p>It is a duty, and it is the <hi>duty of an husbands brother.</hi> Now the husband hath <hi>power,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mariti.</note>
and <hi>authority</hi> over the wife.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>The head of the woman is the Man;</hi> and when the office of
this spirituall husband is particularly expressed,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 3.</note> thus, Reprove, <hi>Rebuke, Exhort,</hi> you see,
for one word of familiarity, that is, <hi>Exhort,</hi> there are two of authority, <hi>Reprove,</hi> and
<hi>Rebuke.</hi> But yet, all the authority of the husband, secular, or ecclesiasticall, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
or spirituall husband, is grounded, rooted in <hi>love:</hi> for, the Apostle seemes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
himself, in the repeating of that Commandement, to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and to the
<hi>Colossians, Husbands love your wives. Moses</hi> extends himselfe no farther, in expressing
all the happinesses, that <hi>Isaak</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> enjoyed in one another, but this, <hi>shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his wife, and he loved her.</hi> If shee had not beene his wife, <hi>Moses</hi> would never
have proposed that love for an example; for so it is also betweene <hi>Elkanah,</hi> and his
wife <hi>Hannah.</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 5.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Vnto Hannah he gave a double portion, for</hi> (sayes the Text)
<hi>hee loved Hannah.</hi> If the Pastor <hi>love,</hi> there will bee a <hi>double labour;</hi> if the People
<hi>love,</hi> there will bee double respect. But being so, hee thought hee said all, when
he said <hi>they loved one another;</hi> For where the Congregation loves the Pastor, hee
will forbeare bitter reproofes, and wounding increpations, and where the Pastor
loves his Congregation, his <hi>Rebukes,</hi> because they proceed our of <hi>love,</hi> will bee
acceptable, and well interpreted by them.</p>
                     <p>It is a <hi>duty,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fratris</note> and <hi>personall,</hi> and <hi>perpetuall;</hi> a duty, of <hi>a husband,</hi> and lastly, of <hi>a
husband that is brother to the former husband;</hi> In which last circumstance, we have
time to mark but this one note, that the <hi>reason</hi> of that law, which drew the brother
to this <hi>mariage,</hi> was the <hi>preservation</hi> of the <hi>temporall inheritance,</hi> in that family. Even
in our spirituall mariages to widow Churches, we must have a care to preserve the
<hi>temporall rights</hi> of all persons; That the Parish be not oppressed with heavy <hi>extortions,</hi>
nor the Pastor defrauded with unjust <hi>substraction,</hi> nor the Patron damnified by <hi>usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,</hi>
nor the <hi>Ordinary</hi> neglected by <hi>disobediences;</hi> but that people, and Pastor,

the <hi>root</hi> of all, the <hi>fruit</hi> of all may be peace, <hi>love</hi> being the <hi>soul</hi> of all, the <hi>body</hi> of

                        <note place="margin">19. 14.</note> so Christ himself pursues the same way, <hi>Suffer little children, and forbid them
not, to come unto me, for of such is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Of <hi>such;</hi> not onely of those
who were truly, literally children, (children in <hi>age</hi>) but of <hi>such</hi> as those, (<hi>Talium est re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum
coelorum</hi>) such as come in such a disposition, in the humility, in the simplicity, in
the singlenesse of heart, as children do. An habituall sinner is always in <hi>minority,</hi> always
an <hi>Infant;</hi> an Infant to this purpose, All his <hi>acts,</hi> all the <hi>bands</hi> of an Infant, are void all
the <hi>outward</hi> religious actions, even the band and contract of <hi>Baptism</hi> in an habituall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is void, and ineffectuall. He that is in the house, and favour of God, though he be a
<hi>child,</hi> (a child to this purpose, simple, supple, tractable, single-hearted) is, as <hi>Adam</hi> was
in the state of Innocency, a <hi>man</hi> the first minute, able to stand upright in the sight of God.
And out of one place of <hi>Esay,<note place="margin">Esay 65. 20.</note> our</hi> Expositors have drawn, conveniently enough, both
these conclusions; <hi>A child shall die 100 years old,</hi> says the Prophet; that is, (say some) a
sinner though he live 100 years, yet he dies a child, in <hi>ignorance;</hi> And then, (say others,
and both truly) He that comes willingly, when God cals, though he die a child in age, he
hath the <hi>wisdome</hi> of 100 years upon him. There is not a graver thing, then to be such a
child; to conform his will to the will of God. Whether you consider temporall or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, you are Gods children. For, for <hi>temporall,</hi> if God should take off his hand,
withdraw his hand of <hi>sustentation,</hi> all those things, which assist us temporally, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse
to the first feeble, and childish estate, and come to their first <hi>nothing.</hi> Armies would
be but Hospitals, without all strength; Councell-tables but Bedlams, without all sense;
and Schools and Universities, but the wrangling of children, if God, and his Spirit did
not inanimate our Schools, and Armies, and Councels. His adoption makes us <hi>men,</hi>
therefore, because it makes us his <hi>children.</hi> But we are his children in this consideration
especially, as we are his <hi>spirituall children,</hi> as he hath nursed us, fed us with his <hi>word.</hi> In
which sense, the Apostle speaks of those who had embraced the true Religion, (in the
same words that the Prophet had spoken before) <hi>Behold,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 13.</note> I, and the children that God hath
given me;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay 2. 6.</note> And in the same sense, the same Prophet, in the same place, says of them
who had fallen away from the true Religion, <hi>They please themselves in the children of
strangers,</hi> In those men, who have derived their <hi>Orders,</hi> and their <hi>Doctrine</hi> from a <hi>forein</hi>
Jurisdiction. In that State where <hi>Adoptions</hi> were so frequent, (in old <hi>Rome</hi>) a <hi>Plebeian</hi>
could not adopt a <hi>Patrician,</hi> a <hi>Yeoman</hi> could not adopt a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> nor a <hi>young</hi> man
could not adopt an <hi>old.</hi> In the new <hi>Rome,</hi> that endevours to adopt <hi>all,</hi> in an imaginary
<hi>filiation,</hi> you that have the perfect freedome of Gods service, be not adopted into the
slavery, and bondage of <hi>mens traditions;</hi> you that are in possession of the ancient
Religion, of Christ, and his Apostles, be not adopted into a yonger Religion. <hi>Religio
à religando;</hi> That is Religion, that <hi>binds; that</hi> binds, that is necessary to salvation. That
which <hi>we</hi> affirm, our adversaries deny not; that which <hi>we</hi> professe, they confesse was
always necessary to salvation. They will not say, that all that they say <hi>now,</hi> was <hi>always</hi>
necessary; That a man could not be saved without beleeving the Articles of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Trent,</hi> a week before that Councell shut up. You are his children, as children are
<hi>servants;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Malach.</note> and, <hi>If he be your Lord, where is his fear?</hi> you are his children, as he hath <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

For, beloved, it is not so absurd a prayer, as it is conceived, if <hi>Luther</hi> did say
upon his death bed, <hi>Oremus pro Domino nostro Iesu Christo, Let us pray for out Lord and
Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi> Had we not need pray for him? If he complaine that <hi>Saul</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutes

to divide the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>kingdome;</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> for the one, and leave out the
other, is seditiously done. If the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> need thy prayers, and thy assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>Christ</hi> needs it; If the <hi>Body</hi> need it, the <hi>Head</hi> needs it; If thou must pray for
his Gospell, thou must pray for <hi>him;</hi> Nay, thou canst not pray for <hi>thy selfe,</hi> but thou

in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> wast persecuted, Christ cryed out, <hi>why persecutest thou
me?</hi> Christ made <hi>thy</hi> case <hi>his,</hi> because thou wast of his bowells. When Christ is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seised,
and dispossest, his truth profligated, and thrown out of a nation, that professed
it before, when Christ is wounded by the <hi>blasphemies</hi> of others, and crucified by thee,

nor in his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> by thy feeble <hi>halfe repentances.</hi> But in the <hi>duty</hi> of a child,
as thou art a servant, in the simplicity of a child, as thou hast sucked from him, in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi>
and <hi>inheritance</hi> of a child, as thou art the Son of his bowells, in all these capacities,
(and with all these we have done) God calls thee, <hi>come ye children;</hi> and that is our next
step, the Action, <hi>Come.</hi>

                        <hi>Come,</hi> we must aske first, <hi>what</hi> this
<hi>comming</hi> is? The whole mystery of our redemption is expressed by the Apostle in this
word,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>venit, that Christ Iesus is come into the world.</hi> All that thou hast to do, is to <hi>come</hi>
to, and to meet him. Where is he? At home; in his own house, in the <hi>Church.</hi> Which is
his house, <hi>which is</hi> his Church? That to <hi>thee,</hi> in which he hath given <hi>thee</hi> thy <hi>Baptisme,</hi> if
<hi>that</hi> do still afford thee, as much as is necessary for thy salvation. Come thither, to the
participation of his ordinances, to the exercises of Religion there. The gates of heaven
shall be opened to you, at last in that word, <hi>Venite benedicti, come ye blessed,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> to
those gates is opened to you now, in the same word, <hi>Venite filii,</hi> come ye children, <hi>come.</hi>
Christ can come, and does often, into thy <hi>bed-chamber,</hi> in the visitation of his private
Spirit, but, here, he calls <hi>thee</hi> out into the congregation, into the communion of Saints.
And then the Church celebrates Christs coming in the flesh, a moneth before he comes,
in <hi>four Sundays of Advent,</hi> before <hi>Christmas.</hi> When thou comest to meet him in the
Congregation, come not occasionally, come not casually, not indifferently, not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally;
come not as to an entertainment, a show, a spectacle, or company, come solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with preparation, with meditation. He shall have the lesse profit, by the prayer of
the Congregation, that hath not been at his private prayer before he came. Much of
the mystery of our Religion lay in the <hi>venturus,</hi> that Christ was to come, all that the
law and Prophets undertooke for, was <hi>that venturus,</hi> that Christ was to come; but the
consummation of all, the end of the law and the Prophets, is in the <hi>venit,</hi> he <hi>is come.</hi> Do
not clogge thy coming with future conditions, and contingencies, thou wilt come, <hi>if
thou canst wake,</hi> if thou <hi>canst rise, if thou canst be ready,</hi> if thou <hi>like the company,</hi> the <hi>weather,</hi>

because they are naturall, they need nor bee <hi>untaught</hi> us, they need not be forbidden,

this fear, thought but imprinted in nature, is <hi>Timor Domini,</hi> Tha fear of the Lord,
because the Lord is the Lord of <hi>Nature,</hi> He is the <hi>Nature of Narture,</hi> Lord of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and impressions in Nature. And therefore, though for this naturall feare,

and ordered, or as it is deserted, and abandoned, by the Spirit of the Lord; And
therefore you ae called hither, <hi>Come,</hi> that you may learne the fear of the Lord, that
is, the <hi>right use of naturall fear,</hi> and <hi>naturall affections, from the Law of God;</hi> For, as it is
a wretched condition, to be <hi>without naturall</hi> a <hi>affections,</hi> so is it a dangerous dereliction, if
our naturall affections be left to themselves, and not regulated, not inanimated by the

my naturall fear; that whereas the naturall object of my naturall fear is <hi>malum,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that I apprehend <hi>sub ratione mali,</hi> as it is <hi>ill</hi> for <hi>me,</hi> (for, if I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

to discusse this cloud, and attenuate this damp, by the light and heat of <hi>Grace,</hi> and the
illustration of the Spirit of God, breathing in his word, I change my <hi>object,</hi> or at least,
I look upon it in <hi>another line,</hi> in <hi>another angle,</hi> I look not upon that evill which my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
fear presented me, of an affliction, or a calamity, but I look upon the glory that
God receives by my Christian constancy in that afflicton, but I look upon that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
blessednes, which I should have lost, if God had not laid that affliction upon
me. So that though fear look upon evill, (for affliction is <hi>malum poenae,</hi> evill as it hath
the nature of <hi>punishment</hi>) yet when the feare of the Lord is entred into my naturall
feare, my feare is more conversant, more exercised upon the contemplation of
<hi>Good,</hi> then <hi>Evill,</hi> more upon the glory of God, and the joys of heaven, then upon
the afflictions of this life, how malignant, how manifold soever. And therefore,
that this feare, and all your <hi>naturall affections,</hi> (which seem weaknesse in man, and
are so indeed, if they bee left to themselves, now in our corrupt and depraved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state)
may advance your <hi>salvation,</hi> (which is the end <hi>why</hi> God hath planted them in

                     <p>There is a fear,<note place="margin">Timor semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalis.</note> which grows out of a second nature, <hi>Custome,</hi> and so is <hi>half-naturall,</hi>

or of the <hi>company</hi> we live in. <hi>Topical</hi> customes of such a place, <hi>Chronical</hi> customes of such

power have advanced, &amp; drawn into fashion and reputation, some <hi>vices,</hi> &amp; such men as

prosper. And, because as amongst <hi>Merchants,</hi> men trade halfe upon <hi>stock,</hi> and halfe
upon <hi>credit,</hi> so, in all other courses, because men rise according to the <hi>opinion</hi> &amp; <hi>estimation</hi>

which person in power have of them, as well as by <hi>reall goodnesse,</hi> therefore to build
up, or to keep up this opinion and estimation in <hi>them</hi> upon whom they depend, they
are afraid to crosse the vices of the Time, so far, as by being vertuous in their owne
paticular. They are afraid it will be called a <hi>singularity,</hi> and a <hi>schismaticall</hi> and <hi>sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
disposition, and taken for a <hi>Reproach,</hi> and a <hi>Rebuke</hi> laid upon their <hi>betters,</hi> if they be
not content to be as <hi>ill,</hi> as those their <hi>betters</hi> are, Now, the fear of the Lord brings the
<hi>Quo Warranto</hi> against all these priviledged sins, and priviledged places, and persons, and
overthrows all these Customes, and Prescriptions. The fear of the Lord is not a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall,
not a Chronicall, ot a Personall, but a <hi>Catholique,</hi> a <hi>Canonicall,</hi> a <hi>Circular,</hi> an
<hi>Vniversall</hi> fear; It goes through all, and over all; and when this <hi>halfe-naturall</hi> feare,
this feare grown out of <hi>Custome,</hi> suggests to me, That if I be thus tender-conscienced,
if I startle at an <hi>oath,</hi> if I be sick at a <hi>Health,</hi> if I cannot conform my selfe to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my betters, I shall lose my Master, my Patron, my Benefactor, This feare of
the Lord enters, and presents the infallible losse of a farre greater Master, and Patron,

false serpents, so doth true fear all false fear. There is nothing so contrary to God, as
false fear; neither in his own nature, nor in his love to <hi>us.</hi> Therefore Gods first Name
in the Bible, and the Name which he sticks to, in all the worke of the Creation, is his
Name of Power, <hi>Elohim; El,</hi> is <hi>fortis Deus,</hi> The God of Power; and it is that
Name in the plurall, multiplied power, All Power; And what can he feare? God
descends to many other humane affections; you shall read that God was Angry, and
sory. and weary; But <hi>non timuit Deus,</hi> God was never afraid. Neither would God
that man should be. So his first blessing upon man, was to fill the earth, and to <hi>subdue

and manacled them,<note place="margin">2. 25.</note> (for they were loose, and walked in the furnace) so our <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscencies,</hi>

salvation shall be surer by occasion of temptations.<note place="margin">August.</note> We may prevent <hi>mortem mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi>
everlasting death, by a disciplinary life. <hi>Mori, ne moriamur,</hi> is <hi>his</hi> rule too, To die
to the fires of lust here, lest wee die in unquenchable fires hereafter; to <hi>die daily,</hi> (as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of himself) lest we die at the last day. To end this, this is the working of
the fear of the Lord, it devours all other fears; God will have no <hi>half-affections,</hi> God
will have no partners; He that fears God fears nothing else.</p>
                     <p>This then is the operation of the feare of the Lord,<note place="margin">Quid iste Timor.</note> this is his working;
remaines onely to consider what this feare of the Lord is: And, beloved in him,
be not afraid of it; for, this <hi>fear</hi> of God, is the <hi>love</hi> of God. And, howsoever there may
be some amongst us, whom the heighth of birth, or of place, or of spirit hath kept from
<hi>fear,</hi> They never feared any thing, yet, I think, there is none, that never <hi>loved</hi> any thing.
Obligations of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> or of <hi>friendship,</hi> or of <hi>blood,</hi> or of <hi>alliance,</hi> or of <hi>conversation,</hi>
hath given every one of us, no doubt, some sense in our selves, what it is to <hi>love,</hi> and to
enjoy that which we doe love; And the <hi>fear</hi> of God, is the <hi>love</hi> of God. <hi>The love of
the Lord passeth all things,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ecclus. 25. 11.</note> saith the Wise man: The love, what is that to fear? It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>The fear of the Lord, is the beginning of his love.</hi> As they that build Arches, place
centers under the Arch, to beare up the work, till it bee dried, and setled, but, after,
all is Arch, and there is no more center, no more support; so to lie at the Lords feet
a while delivers us into his arms, to accustome our selves to his fear, establishes us in his
love. Be content to stop a little, even at the lowest fear, the <hi>fear of hell.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi>
was upon an expedition,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 11. 7.</note> and did not finde himself well followed, he took a yoke of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
and hewed them in pieces, and proclaimed, that whosoever came not to the supply,
all his Oxen should be so served; and upon this, (says the Text there) <hi>The fear of the
Lord fell upon all the people, and they came out, as one man, three hundred and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</hi>
If <hi>Sauls</hi> threatning of their <hi>worldly goods,</hi> wrought so; let Gods threatning of thy
selfe, thine inwardest self, thy soul, with <hi>hell,</hi> make thee to stop even upon thy fear of
the Lord, the fear of <hi>Torment.</hi> Stop upon the second fear too, the fear of <hi>privation,</hi> and
losse of the sight of God in heaven; That when all wee have disputed, with a modest
boldnesse, and wondred with a holy wonder, what kinde of sight of God we shall have
in heaven, then when thou shouldst come to an end, and to an answer of all these doubts,
in an experimentall triall, how he shall be seen, (seen thus) thou shalt see then that thou
shalt never see him. After thou hast used to hear, all thy life, blessednesse summed up into
that one act, <hi>We shall see God,</hi> thou shalt never come nearer to that knowledge, thou shalt
never see him; fear the Lord therefore in this second fear, fear of <hi>privation.</hi> And fear
him in a third fear, the fear of the <hi>losse of his grace</hi> here in this world, though thou have
it now. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> serves himself and us, with an ordinary comparison, A Tyler is
upon the top of the house, but he looks to his footing, he is afraid of falling. A righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man is in a high place in Gods favour, but hee may lose that place. Who is
higher then <hi>Adam,</hi> higher then the <hi>Angels?</hi> and whither fell they. Make not thou
then thy assurance of standing, our of their arguments, that say it is <hi>impossible</hi> for the
righteous to fall, The sins of the righteous are <hi>no sins</hi> in the sight of God; but built thy
assurance upon the testimony of a good conscience, that thou usest all diligence, and
holy industry, that thou maist continue in Gods favour, and fearest to lose it; for, hee
that hath no fear of losing, hath no care of keeping. Accustome thy self to these fears,
and these fears will flow into a love. As <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>jealousie</hi> may bee the same thing, so
the <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God will be all one;<note place="margin">August.</note> for, jealousie is but a fear of losing. <hi>Brevissima
differentia Testamentorum, Timor &amp; Amor;</hi> This distinguishes the two Testaments, The
Old is a Testament of <hi>fear,</hi> the New of <hi>love;</hi> yet in this they grow all one, That we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Old Testament, in the New, and that we prove the New Testament by the
Old; for, but by the Old, we should not know, that there was to bee a New, nor, but
for the New, that there was an Old; so the two testaments grow <hi>one Bible;</hi> so in these
two Affections, if there were not a <hi>jealousie,</hi> a fear of losing God, we could not love him;
nor can we fear to lose him, except we doe love him. Place the affection, (by what
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:93359:226"/>
name soever) upon the right object, God, and I have, in some measure, done that which
this Text directed, (<hi>Taught you the fear of the Lord</hi>) if I send you away in either disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Timorous;</hi> or <hi>amorous,</hi> possessed with either, the fear, or the love of God; for, this
fear is inchoative love, and this love is consummative fear; The love of God begins in
fear, and the fear of God ends in love; and that love can never end, for God is love.</p>

Region, in the Store-house of all plenty, he must starve; This is
the Serpents perpetuall fast, his everlasting Lent, (<hi>Dust shalt thou
eat all the dayes of thy life.</hi>) There is a generation derived from
this Serpent, <hi>Progenies viperarum,</hi> a generation of Vipers, that
will needs in a great, and unnecessary measure, keep this Serpents
Lent, and binde themselves to performe his fact; for, the Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
will eat no flesh, (and yet, I never saw better bodied men, men of better habitudes
and constitution, howsoever they recompense their abstinence from flesh) and the Fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illans
will eat neither flesh nor fish, but roots, and fallets, (and yet amongst them,
amongst men so enfeebled by roots, was bred up that man, who was both malicious
courage, and bodily strength, to kill the last King, who was killed amongst them) They
will be above others in their fasts, Fish, and Roots will they eat, all the dayes of their

                     <p>It is <hi>Luthers</hi> observation upon this place, That in all <hi>Moses</hi> his Books, God never
spoke so long, so much together, as here, upon this occasion. Indeed the occasion was
great; It was the arraignment of all the world, and more; of mankinde, and of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
too; of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> (and there were no more of them) and then of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and of Satan in that, and of all the fallen Angels in him. For the sentence which
God, as Judge gave upon them, upon all these Malefactors, of that part which fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the woman, all our mothers are experimentall witnesses; they brought forth us in
sorrow and in travaile. Of that part of the sentence which fell upon man, every one
of us is an experimentall witnesse, for in every calling, in the sweat of our face, we eat
our bread. And of that part of the Judgement, which was inflicted upon the Serpent,
and Satan in him, this dead brother of ours who lyes in this consecrated earth, is an
experimentall witnesse, who being by death reduced to the state of dust, for so much
of him, as is dust, that is, for his dead body, and then, for so long time, as he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in that state of dust, is in the portion, and jurisdiction, and possession of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
that is, in the state which the Serpent hath induced upon man, and dust must he
eat all the dayes of his life.</p>
                     <p>In passing thorough these words,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> we shall make but these two steps; first, What
the Serpent lost, by this judgement inflicted upon him; and secondly, What man
gained by it; for these two considerations imbrace much, involve much; first,
That Gods anger is so intensive, and so extensive, so spreading, and so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that in his Justice, he would not spare the Serpent, who had no volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
no innate, no naturall ill disposition towards man, but was onely made the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Satan, in the overthrow of man. And then, that Gods mercy is so large,
so overflowing, so super-abundant, as that even in his Judgement upon the Serpent,
he would provide mercy for man. For, as it is a great waight of judgement upon the
Serpent, that the Serpent must eat dust, so is it a great degree of mercy to man, that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:93359:227"/>
the Serpent must eate but dust, because mans best part is not subject to be served in at
his table, the soule cannot become dust, (and dust must he eate all the dayes of his life.
O, in what little sinne, though but a sinne of omission, though but a sinne of ignorance,
in what circumstance of sinne, may I hope to scape Judgement, if God punished the
Serpent who was violently, and involuntarily transported in this action? And in what
depth, in what height, in what hainousnesse, in what multiplicity of sin can I doubt of
the mercy of my God, who makes judgement it self the instrument, the engin, the Chariot
of his mercy? What room is there left for presumption, if the Serpent, the passive Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
were punished? What room for desperation, if in the punishment, there be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of mercy? The Serpent must eate dust, that is his condemnation, but he
shall eate no better meat, he shall eate but dust, there is mans consolation.</p>
                     <p>First then,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> as it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living God, so is it an
impossible thing to scape it.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 31.</note> God is not ashamed of being jealous; he does not onely
pronounce that he is a jealous God, but he desires to be known by none other name,
(The Lord whose name is jealous is a jealous God) so jealous,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 14.</note> as that he will not have
his name uttered in vaine; not onely not blasphemed, not sworne by, but not used
indifferently, transitorily, not Proverbially, occasionally, not in vaine. And if it be,
what then? Even for this, he will visite to the third, and fourth generation; and three
and foure are seven, and seven is infinite. So jealous, as that in the case of the Angels,
not for looking upon any other Creatures, or trusting in them, (for, when they fell, (as
it is ordinarily received) there were no other creatures made) but for not looking immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
directly upon God, but reflecting upon themselves, and trusting in their own
naturall parts, God threw those Angels into so irrecoverable, and bottomelesse a depth,
as that the merits of Christ Jesus, though of infinite, super-infinite value, doe not boye
them up; so jealous a God, is God, so jealous, as that in <hi>Adams</hi> case, for over-loving his own
wife, for his over tender compassion of her, foreating the forbidden fruit, <hi>ne contristaretur
delicias suas,</hi> (as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> layes his fault) left he should deject her into an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and desperate malancholy, and so make her incapable of Gods mercy, God threw
the first man, and in him, all, out of Paradise, out of both Paradises, out of that of rest,
and plenty here,<note place="margin">Numb. 22. 5. 20. 11.</note> and that of Joy, and Glory hereafter. Consider <hi>Balaams</hi> sin about
cursing Gods people, or <hi>Moses</hi> sinne about striking the rock, and wouldst not thou be
glad to change sinnes, with either of them? Are not thy sinnes greater, heavier sinnes;
And yet, wouldest thou not be sorry, to undergoe their punishments? are not thy punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
lesse?<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 16.</note> Hast thou found hony, says the holy Ghost in <hi>Solomon;</hi> and, he says it

<hi>Ionathan</hi> must die. Any man might eate enough, He did but taste, and he must die.
If the Angels, if <hi>Adam,</hi> if <hi>Balaam,</hi> if <hi>Moses,</hi> if <hi>Ionathan</hi> did, if the Serpent in the text,
could consider this, how much cheaper God hath made sinne to thee, then to them,

men have been drawn into danger, because they were too rich? How many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
into solicatation, and tentation, because they were too beautifull? Content thy
selfe with such a mediocrity in these things, as may make thee fit to serve God, and to
assist thy neighbour, in a calling, and be not ambitious of extraordinary excellency in
any kinde; It is a dangerous thing, to have a capacity to do evill. God would do a great
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:93359:227"/>
work;<note place="margin">Num. 28. 22.</note> and he used the simplicity of the Asse; he made <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse speak; But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
makes use of the subtilty, of the craft of the Serpent; The Serpent is his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
no more but so, but so much he is, his instrument. And then, says S. <hi>Chrysostome,
Pater noster execuratur gladium,</hi> as a naturall father would, so our heavenly father does
hate, that which was the instrument of the ruine of his children. Wherein hath he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
that hate? not to binde our selves to <hi>Iosephus</hi> his opinion, (though some of
the ancients in the Christian Church have seconded that opinion, too) that at that time
the Serpent could goe upright, and speak, and understand, and knew what he did, and
so concurred actually and willingly to the temptation and destruction of man, though
he were but anothers instrument, he became odious to God. Our bodies, of themselves,
if they had no souls, have no disposition to any evill; yet, these bodies which are but
instruments, must burn in hell. The earth was accursed for mans sin, though the earth
had not been so much as an instrument of his sin; Onely because it was, after, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the punishment of his children, it was accursed, God withdrew his love from it.
And in the law,<note place="margin">Lev. 20. 15.</note> those beasts with which men committed bestiality, were to be stoned, as
well as the men. How poor a plea will it be, to say, at the last day, I got nothing by such
an extortion, to mine own purse, it was for my master; I made no use of that woman
whom I had corrupted, it was for a friend. Miserable instrument of sin, that hadst not
the profit, nor the pleasure, and must have the damnation! As the Prophet cals them,
that help us towards heaven,<note place="margin">Obad. v. 21.</note> Saviours, (<hi>Saviours shall come up on Mount Sion</hi>) so are all
that concurre instrumentally to the damnation of others, Devils. And, at the last day,
we shall see many sinners saved, and their instruments perish. <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> both God
interrogated, and, gave them time, to meditate and to deprecate; To <hi>Adam,</hi> he says, <hi>Where
art thou,</hi> and, <hi>who told thee that thou wast naked?</hi> And to <hi>Eve, What is this that thou hast
done?</hi> But to the Serpent no such breathing; The first words is, <hi>Quia fecisti;</hi> no calling
for evidence whether he had done it or no, but, <hi>Because thou hast done it, thou art accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
Sin is Treason against God; and in Treason there is no Accessory; The instrument
is the Principall.</p>
                     <p>We passe from that first Part,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> the consideration of heavy Judgements upon faults, in
appearance but small, derived from the punishment of the Serpent, though but an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Let no man set a low value upon any sin; let no man think it a little matter to sin
some one sin, and no more; or that one sin but once, and no oftner; or that once but a
little way in that sin, and no father; or all this, to do another a pleasure, though he take
none in it himself (as though there were charity in the society of sin, and that it were an
Alms to help a man to the means of sinning.) The least sin cost the blood of the Son
of God, and the least sinner may lose the benefit of it, if he presume of it. No man may
cast himself from a Pinnacle, because an Angel may support him; no man may kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
because there is a Resurrection of the body; nor wound his soul to death by sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there may be a resurrection of that, by grace. Here is no roome for presumption
upon God; but, as little for desperation in God; for, in the punishment of the Serpent,
we shall see, that his Mercy, and Justice are inseparable; that, as all the Attributes of
God, make up but one God (Goodnesse, and Wisdome, and Power are but one God)
so Mercy and Justice make up but one act; they doe not onely duly suceed, and second
one another, they doe not onely accompany one another, they are not onely together,
but they are all one. As Manna, though it tasted to one man like one thing, to another
like another, (for it tasted to every man like that, that that man liked best) yet still was
the same Manna; so, for Gods corrections, they have a different taste in different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and howsoever the Serpent found nothing but Judgement, yet we find mercy even
in that Judgement. <hi>The evening and the morning make up the day,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 5.</note> says <hi>Moses;</hi> as soon as
he had named evening comes in morning, no interposing of the mention of a dark, and
sad night between. As soon as I hear of a Judgement, I apprehend Mercy, no interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of any dark or sad suspition, or diffidence, or distrust in God, and his mercy; and
to that purpose we consider the Serpents punishment, and espcially as it is heightned,
and aggravated in this Text, <hi>Dust shalt thou eate all the days of thy life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are three degrees in the Serpents punishment;<note place="margin">Super pectus.</note> First, <hi>Super pectus, He must creep
upon his belly;</hi> And secondly, <hi>Inimicitias ponam, I will put enmity,</hi> God will raise him an
enemy. And thirdly, <hi>Pulverem comedes, Dust shalt thou eate all the days of thy life.</hi> And,
in all these three, though they aggravate the judgement upon the Serpent, there is mercy
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:93359:228"/>
to us; For, for the first, that the Serpent now does but creep upon his belly, S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
and S. <hi>Gregory</hi> understands this belly to be the seat of our affections, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscencies;
That the Serpent hath no power upon our heart, nor upon our brain, for,
if we bring a tentation to consideration, to deliberation, that we stop at it, think of it,
study it, and forsee the consequences, this frustrates the tentation. Our nobler fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
are always assisted with the grace of God to resist him, though the belly, the
bowels of sin, in sudden surprisals, and ebullitions, and foamings of our concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
be subject to him: for, though it may seem, that if that be the meaning, (which,
from S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory</hi> we have given you) That the Serpent hath this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over our affections, and that is intended by that, The belly, it should rather have
been said, <hi>super pectus vestrum,</hi> Hee shall creep upon your belly, then upon his owne,
yet, indeed, all that is his own, which we have submitted and surrendred to him, and hee
is upon his own, because we make our selves his; (for, <hi>to whom ye yeeld your servants to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
his servants you are.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 18.</note>) So that if he be <hi>super pectus nostrum,</hi> if he be upon our belly,
he is upon his own. But he does but creep; He does not fly; He is not presently upon
you, in a present possession of you; you may discern the beginning of sin, and the ways
of sin, in the approaches of the Serpent, if you will. The Serpent leaves a slime that
discovers him, where he creeps; At least behinde him, after a sin, you may easily see oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of remorse, and detestation of that sinne, and thereby prevent relapses, if you
have not watched him well enough in his creeping upon you. When hee is a Lion,
he does not devoure all whom he findes;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>He seeks whom he may devoure;</hi> He may not
devoure all, nor any but those, who cast themselves into his jaws, by exposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to tentations to sin.</p>
                     <p>He does but creep;<note place="margin">An forma mutata.</note> why, did he any more before? was his forme changed in this
punishment? Many of the Ancients think literally that it was; and that before the
Serpent did goe upon feet; we are not sure of that; nor is it much probable. That
may well be true, which <hi>Luther</hi> says, <hi>fuit suavissima bestiola,</hi> till then it was a creature
more lovely, more sociable, more conversable with man, and, (as <hi>Calvin</hi> expresses
the same) <hi>Minus odiosus,</hi> man did lesse abhor the Serpent before, then after. Beloved,
it is a degree of mercy, if God bring that, which was formerly a tentation to mee,
to a lesse power over me, then formerly it had; If deformity, if sicknesse, if age, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
if satiety, if inconstancy, if any thing have worn out a tentation in that face, that
transported me heretofore, it is a degree of mercy. Though the Serpent be the same
Serpent, yet if he be not so acceptable, so welcome to me, as heretofore, it is a happy, a
blessed change. And so, in that respect, there was mercy.</p>
                     <p>It was a punishment to the Serpent,<note place="margin">Inimicitias ponam.</note> that, though he were the same still as before, yet
he was not able to insinuate himself as before, because hee was not so welcome to us.
So, the having of the same form, which he had, might be a punishment, as naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was to man after his fall; He was naked before, but he saw it not, he felt it not, he
needed no cloathes before; Now, nakednesse brings shame, and infirmities with it. So,
God was so sparing towards the Serpent, as that he made him not worse in nature, then
before, and so mercifull to us, as that hee made us more jealous of him, and thereby
more safe against him, then before. Which is also intimated pregnantly, in the next
step of his punishment, <hi>Inimicitias ponam,</hi> That God hath kindled a war between him
and us. Peace is a blessed state, but it must be the peace of God; for, <hi>simeon</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi>
are brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 5.</note> they agree well enough together; but they are instruments of evill;
and, in that case, the better agreement, the worse. So, war is a fearfull state; but not
so, if it be the war of God, undertaken for his cause, or by his Word. Many times, a State
suffers by the security of a Peace, and gains by the watchfulness of a War. Wo be to
that man is so at peace, as that the spirit fights not against the flesh in him; and
wo to them too, who would make them friends, or reconcile them, betweene whom,
God hath perpetuated an everlasting war, The seed of the woman, and the seed of the
Serpent, Christ and <hi>Beliall,</hi> Truth and Superstition. Till God proclaimed a warre
between them, the Serpent did easily overthrow them, but therefore God brought it
to a war, that man might stand upon his guard. And so it was a Mercy.</p>
                     <p>But the greatest mercy is in the last,<note place="margin">Pulverem comedes.</note> and that which belongs most directly, (though
all conduce pertinently and usefully) to our present occasion;) <hi>Dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life.</hi> He must eat dust, that is, our bodies, and carnall affections; Hee was
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:93359:228"/>
at a richer diet, he was in better pasture before; before, he fed upon souls too; But for
that his head was bruised, in the promise of a Messias, who delivers our souls from his
tyranny; But the dust, the body, that body, which for all the precious ransome, and the
rich, and large mercy of the Messias, must die, that dust is left to the Serpent, to Satan,
that is, to that dissolution, and that putrefaction, which he hath induced upon man, in
death. He eats but our dust, in our death, when he hath brought us to that; that is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
nay he eats up our dust before our death, which is a greater mercy; our carnal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
our concupiscencies are eaten up, and devoured by him; and so, even his eating is a
sweeping, a deansing, a purging of us. Many times we are the better for his tentations.
My discerning a storm, makes me put on a cloak. My discerning a tentation, makes me
see my weaknesse, and fly to my strength. Nay, I am somtimes the safer, and the readier
for a victory, by having been overcome by him. The sense, and the remorse of a sin, after
I have fallen into it, puts me into a better state, and establishes better conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and me then were before, when I felt no tentations to sin. He shall eat up my
dust, so, as that it shall fly into mine eys; that is, so work upon my carnall affections, as
that they shall not make me blinde, nor unable to discern that it is he that works. It is
said of one kinde of Serpent, that because they know,<note place="margin">Stellio</note> by an instinct they have, that their
skin is good for the use of man, (for the falling sickness) out of Envy, they hide their
skin, when they cast it. The Serpent is loth we should have any benefit by him; but we
have; even his tentations arm us, and the very falling exalts us, when after a sin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
we come to a true, and scrutiny of our conscience. So he
hath nothing to eat but our dust, and he eats up our dust so, as that he contributes to
our glory,<note place="margin">Ion. 1. 17.</note> by his malice. The Whale was <hi>Ionas</hi> Pilot; The Crows were <hi>Elias</hi> caters;
The Lions were <hi>Daniels</hi> sentinels;<note place="margin">1 Reg. 7. 6.</note> The Viper was <hi>Pauls</hi> advocate; it pleaded for him, &amp;

was <hi>a murderer,</hi> to cry that he was <hi>a god.</hi> Though at any time, the Serpent having brought
me to a sin, cry out, <hi>Thou art a murderer,</hi> that is, bring me to a desperate sense of having
murdred mine own soul, yet in that darkness I shal see light, &amp; by a present repentance, &amp;
effectual application of the merits of my Savior, I shall make the Serpent see, I am a God,
thus far a God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> that by my adhering to Christ, I am made partaker of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For, that which S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> says of Baptism; is true too in the second Baptism, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>Deposui terram, &amp; coelum indui;</hi> then I may say to the Serpent, Your meat is

                     <p>So then,<note place="margin">Totâ vitâ.</note> the Prophecy of <hi>Esay</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay 65. 25.</note> fulfils it self, That when Christ shall reign powerfully
over us, <hi>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, (Saul</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> shall meet in a house,
(as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> expounds that) and <hi>Ananias</hi> not be afraid of a Persecutor.) <hi>The Lion
shall eate straw like the Bullock,</hi> says that Prophet in that place, <hi>Tradent se rusticitati
Scripturarum,</hi> says the same Father, The strongest understandings shall content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the homelinesse of the Scriptures, and feed upon plain places, and not stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
new dishes, by subtilties, and perplexities, and then, <hi>Dust shall be the Serpents meat,</hi>
says the Prophet there, The power of Satan shall reach but to the body, and touch
a soul wrapt up in Christ. But then, it is <hi>Totâ vitâ, all his life.</hi> His diet is impaired,
but it is not taken away; He eats but dust, but he shall not lack that, as long as
hee lives. And how long lives the Serpent, this Serpent? The life of this
Serpent is to seduce man, to practise upon man, to prevaile upon man, as farre,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:93359:229"/>
and as long as man is dust. And therefore wee are not onely his dust, whilst wee live
(all which time we serve in our carnall affections, for him to feed upon) but when we are
dead, we are his dust still. Man was made in that state, as that he should not resolve to dust,
but should have passed from this world to the next, without corruption, or resolution
of the body.<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 18.</note> That which God said to <hi>Adam, Dust thou art,</hi> belonged to all, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
he, and all we were to be of dust, in his best integrity; but that which God adds
there, <hi>&amp; in terram revertêris, (dust thou art, and to it thou shalt returne</hi>) that the Serpent
brought in, that was induced upon man by him, and his tentation. So that when we
are living dust here he eats us, and when we are dead dust too, in the grave, he feeds
upon us, because it proceeds from him both that we die, and that we are detained in the
state of exinanition, and ingloriousnesse, in the dust of the earth, and not translated
immediately to the joyes of heaven, as but for him, we should have been. But as, though
he do feed upon our living dust, that is, induce sicknesses, and hunger, and labour, and
cold, and paine upon our bodies here, God raises even that dust out of his hands, and
redeemes it from his jaws, in affording us a deliverance, or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>itution from those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
calamities here, as he did abundantly to his servant, and our example <hi>Iob,</hi> so,
though he feed upon our dead dust and detain our bodies in the disconsolate state of
the grave, yet, as the Godhead, the divine nature did not depart from the body of Christ
when it lay dead in the grave, so neither doth the love and power of God, depart from
the body of a Christian, though resolved to dust in the grave, but, in his due time, shall
recollect that dust, and recompact that body, and reunite that soul, in everlasting joy
and glory. And till then, the Serpent lives; till the Judgement, Satan hath power upon
that part of man; and that's the Serpents life, first to practise our death, and then to
hold us in the state of the dead. Till then we attend with hope, and with prayers Gods
holy pleasure upon us, and then begins the unchangeable state in our life, in body and
soul together, then we beginne to live, and then ends the Serpents life, that is, his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
practise upon us in our life, and his faint triumph in continuing over our dust. That
time,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 28.</note> (the time of the generall Resurrection) being not yet come, the devills thought
themselves wronged, and complained that Christ came before the time to torment
them; and therefore Christ yeelded so much to their importunity, as to give them leave
to enter into the swine. And therefore, let not us murmur nor over-mourne for that,
which as we have induced it upon our selves, so God shall deliver us from, at last, that
is, both death, and corruption after death, and captivity in that comfortlesse state, but
for the resurection. For, so long we are to be dust, and so long lasts the Serpents life,
Satans power over man; <hi>dust must he eate all the days of his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the meane time,<note place="margin">Conclusio.</note> (for our comfort in the way) when this Serpent becomes a
Lyon,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 5.</note> yet there is a Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that is too strong for him. so, if he
who is <hi>Serpens serpens humi,</hi> the Serpent condemned to creep upon the ground, doe
transforme himselfe into a flying Serpent, and attempt our nobler faculties, there is
<hi>Serpens exaltatus,</hi> a Serpent lifted up in the wildernesse,<note place="margin">Numb. 12. 18.</note> to recover all them that are
stung, and feel that they are stung with this Serpent, this flying Serpent, that is, these
high and continued sinnes. The creeping Serpent, the groveling Serpent, is Craft; the
exalted Serpent, the crucified Serpent, is Wisdome. All you worldly cares, all your
crafty bargaines all your subtill matches, all your diggings into other means estates, all
your hedgings, in of debts, all your planting of children in great allyances; all these dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
and hedgings and plantings savour of the earth, and of the craft of that Serpent,
that creeps upon the earth: But crucifie this craft of yours, bring all your worldly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
under the Crosse of Christ Jesus, husband your farmes so, as you may give a
good account to him, presse your debts so, as you would be pressed by him, market
and bargaine so, as that you would give all, to buy that field, in which his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and his pearle is hid, and then you have changed the Serpent, from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of perdition creeping upon the earth, to the Serpent of salvation exalted in the
wildernesse. Creeping wisedome, that still looks downward, is but craft; Crucified
wisedome, that looks upward, is truly wisedome. Between you and that ground Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
God hath kindled a war; and the nearer you come to a peace with him, the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye go from God, and the more ye exaspetate the Lord of Hosts, and you whet his
sword against your own souls. A truce with that Serpent, is too near a peace; to condition
with your conscience for a time, that you may continue in such a sin, till you have paid
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:93359:229"/>
for such a purchase, married such a daughter, bought such an annuity. undermined and
eaten out such an unthrift, this truce, (though you mean to end it before you die) is too
near a peace with that Serpent, between whom and you, God hath kindled an everlasting
war. A cessation of Arms, that is, not to watch all his attempts and tentations, not to
examine all your particular actions, A Treaty of Peace, that is, to dispute and debate in
the behalf and favour of a sin, to palliate, to disguise, to extenuate that sin, this is too
near a peace with this Serpent, this creeping Serpent. But in the other Serpent, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Serpent, God hath reconciled to himself, all things in heaven, and earth, and hell.
You have peace in the assistance of the Angels of heaven, Peace in the contribution of
the powerfull prayers, and of the holy examples of the Saints upon earth, peace in the
victory and triumph over the power of hell, peace from sins towards men, peace of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in your selves, peace of conscience towards God. From your childhood you have
been called upon to hold your peace; To be content is to hold your peace; murmure
not at God, in any corrections of his, and you doe hold this peace. That creeping Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
Satan, is war, and should be so; The crucified Serpent Christ Jesus is peace, and
shall be so for ever. The creeping Serpent eats our dust, the strength of our bodies, in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and our glory in the dust of the grave: The crucified Serpent hath taken our
flesh,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 14.</note> and our blood, and given us his flesh, and his blood for it; And therefore, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
when he was thought base, for his holy freedome in dancing before the Ark, said he
would be more base; so, since we are all made of <hi>red earth,</hi> let him that is red, be more
red; Let him that is red with the blood of his own soul, be red again in blushing for that
rednesse, and more red in the Communion of the blood of Christ Jesus; whom we shall
eat all the days of our life, and be mystically, and mysteriously, and spiritually, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally
united to him in this life, and gloriously in the next.</p>
                     <p>In this state of dust, and so in the territory of the Serpent, the Tyrant of the dead, lies
this dead brother of ours, and hath lien some years, who occasions our meeting now, and
yearly upon this day, and whose soul, we doubt not, is in the hands of God, who is the
God of the living. And having gathered a good <hi>Gomer</hi> of Manna, a good measure of
temporall blessings in this life, and derived a fair measure thereof, upon them, whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and law directed it upon, (and in whom we beseech God to blesse it) hath also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
something to the poor of this Parish, yearly, this day, and something to a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the conserving of neighbourly love, and something for this exercise. In which,
no doubt, his intention was not so much to be yearly remembred himself, as that his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and his neighbours might be yearly remembred to doe as he had done. For, this
is truly to glorifie God in his Saints, to sanctifie our selves in their examples; To cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
them, is to imitate them. For, as it is probably conceived, and agreeably to Gods
Justice, that they that write wanton books, or make wanton pictures, have additions of
torment, as often as other men are corrupted with their books, or their pictures: so may
they, who have left permanent examples of good works, well be beleeved, to receive ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of glory and joy, when others are led by that to do the like: And so, they who are
extracted, and derived from him, and they who dwelt about him, may assist their own
happiness, and enlarge his, by following his good example in good proportions. Amen.</p>

his eternall generation in the bosome of his Father, had now cast a cloud of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
and earthly generation in the wombe of his mother, that man, who, as he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wombe of his first mother, the blessed Virgin, by a supernaturall way, by the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vershadowing
of the holy Ghost,</hi> so he vouchsafed to enter into the wombe of her, whom
he had accepted for his second mother, the <hi>earth,</hi> by an unnaturall way, not by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
but by a violent, and bitter death, that man so torne and mangled, wounded
with thornes, oppressed with scornes and contumelies, <hi>Pilite</hi> presents and exhibits
so, <hi>Ecce homo, Behold the man,</hi> But in all this depression of his, in all his exinanition,
and evacuation yet he had a <hi>Crown</hi> on, yet he had a <hi>purple garment</hi> on, the emblems, the
Characters of majesty were always upon him. And these two considerations, the <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
that exhaust, and evacuate, and annihilate man in this life, and yet, those sparkes,
and seeds of <hi>morality,</hi> that lie in the bosome, that still he is a man, the affilictions that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
and smother, that suffocate and strangle their spirits in thier bosomes, and yet
that unsmotherable, that unquenchable <hi>Spirit of Adoption, by which we cry Abba Father,</hi>
that still he is a Christian, these <hi>Thornes,</hi> and yet these <hi>Crownes,</hi> these <hi>contumelies,</hi> and
yet this <hi>Purple,</hi> are the two parts of this text, <hi>I am the man, that hath seen affliction by the rod
of his wrath.</hi> For, here is an <hi>Ecce, behold; Ieremy</hi> presents a map, a manifestation of
as great affliction, as the rod of Gods wrath could infflict; But yet it is <hi>Ecce homo, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

but that he is still a man; God preserves his children from departing from the
dignity of <hi>men,</hi> and from the soveraigne dignity of <hi>Christian men,</hi> in the deluge, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
of all afflictions.</p>
                     <p>And these two things, so considerable in that <hi>Ecce homo,</hi> in the exhibiting of Christ,
that <hi>then</hi> when he was under those scornes, and Crosses, he had his <hi>Crownes,</hi> his <hi>purples,</hi>
ensignes of majesty upon him, may well be parts of this text; for, when we come to
consider <hi>who</hi> is the person of whom <hi>Ieremy</hi> says, <hi>I am the man,</hi> we finde many of the
ancient Expositors take these words <hi>prophetically</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> himself; and that Christ
himselfe who says,<note place="margin">1. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold and see if there be any sorrow, like unto my sorrow,</hi> says here also,
<hi>I am the man, that hath seen affliction, by the rod of his wrath.</hi> But because there are
some other passages in the Chapter, that are not conveniently appliable to Christ, (it
is not likely that Christ would say of himself;<note place="margin">verse 8.</note> 
                        <hi>That his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shut out his prayer, even

                        <note place="margin">17.</note> not likely that Christ
would say of himselfe, <hi>That his Father had removed his soul far from peace</hi>) therfore this
chapter, and this person cannot be so well understood of Christ. Others therefore have
understood if of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it selfe; but then it would not be expressed in that <hi>Sex,</hi> it
would not be said of <hi>Ierusalem, I am the man.</hi> Others understand if of any <hi>particular
man,</hi> that had his part, in that calamity, in that captivity; that the affliction was so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
upon all of that nation of what condition soever, that <hi>every man</hi> might justly say,

and still, where we can, it becomes, it behooves us to, maintain a <hi>literall sense</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of all Scriptures. And <hi>that</hi> we shall best do in this place, if we understand
these words literally of <hi>Iermy himselfe,</hi> that the <hi>Minister</hi> of God, the Preacher of God,
the Prophet of God, <hi>Ieremy</hi> himself, was <hi>the man;</hi> the Preacher is the text, <hi>Ego vir, I am

<hi>Refreshing,</hi> the sea of afflictions that overflow, and surround us all and then our emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and lifting up our head above that sea. In the first we shall consider, first, the <hi>Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of afflictions; and that first in their own nature, And then secondly in that <hi>name</hi> of man.
upon whom they fall here, <hi>Gheber, Ego vir, I am the man,</hi> which is that name of man,
by which the strongest, the powerfullest of men are denoted in the Scriptures;
They, the strongest, the mightiest, they that thought themselves safest,
and sorrow-proofe, are afflicted. And lastly, in the person, upon whom
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:93359:230"/>
these afflictions are fastned here, <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet, of whom literally we understand
this place:
The dearliest beloved of God, and those of whose service God may have
use in his Church, they are subject to be retarded in their service, by these afflictions.
Nothing makes a man so great amongst men, nothing makes a man so necessary to God,
as that he can escape afflictions. And when we shall have thus considered the <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
thereof, these three wayes, In the nature of affliction it selfe, In the signification of
that name of exaltation <hi>Gheber,</hi> And in the person of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> we shall passe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the vehemency and intensnesse thereof, in those circumstances that are
laid down in our Text, First, that these afflictions are <hi>Ejus, His, The Lords,</hi> And then they
are <hi>in virga, in his rod,</hi> And again, <hi>In virga irae, in the rod of his wrath.</hi> And in these two
branches, the extent and the weight of afflictions, and in these few circumstances, that
illustrate both, we shall determine our first part, the burden, the discomfort. When we
shall come at last, to our last part, of comfort, we shall finde that also to grow out into 2
branches; for, first, <hi>Vidit, he saw</hi> his affliction, (<hi>I am the Man that hath seen affliction</hi>) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
did not blinde him, not stupefie him, affliction did not make him unsensible of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
(which is a frequent, but a desperate condition) <hi>vidit,</hi> he saw it; that is first;
And then, <hi>Ego vir, I am the man that saw it,</hi> he maintained the dignity of his station,
still he played the man, still he survived to glorifie God, and to be an example to other
men, of patience under Gods corrections, and of thankfulnesse in Gods deliverance.
In which last part, we shall also see, that all those particular that did aggravate the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
in the former part, (That they were <hi>from the Lord, from his Rod,</hi> from the <hi>Rod
of his wrath</hi>) doe all exalt our comfort in this, That it is a particular comfort that our
afflictions are <hi>from the Lord,</hi> Another that they are <hi>from his Rod,</hi> and another also, that
they are <hi>from the Rod of his wrath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First then in our first art,<note place="margin">1 Part.</note> and the first branch thereof, <hi>The Generality</hi> of affliction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in the <hi>nature thereof:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Generalitas.</note> We met <hi>all</hi> generally, in the first <hi>Treason</hi> against our selves;
without exception <hi>all;</hi> In <hi>Adams</hi> rebellion, who was not in his loins? And in a <hi>second Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
we met all too; in the Treason <hi>against Christ Iesus,</hi> we met <hi>all;</hi> All our sins were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his shoulders. In those two Treasons we have had no exception, no exemption. The
penalty for our first Treason, in <hi>Adam,</hi> in a great part, we doe all undergoe; we doe <hi>all
die,</hi> though not without a lothnesse and colluctation at the time, yet without a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
desire to live in this world for ever. How loth soever any man be to die, when death
comes, yet I thinke, there is no man that ever formed a deliberate Prayer, or wish, that
he might never die. That penalty for our first Treason in <hi>Adam,</hi> we do bear. And would
any be excepted from bearing any thing deduced from his <hi>second Treason,</hi> his conspiracy
against Christ, from <hi>imitation of his Passion,</hi> and <hi>fulfilling his sufferings in his body,</hi> in
bearing cheerfully the afflictions and tribulations of this life?<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 12.</note>

that <hi>Filiation,</hi> that Patrimony and Inheritance, rather then admit patiently his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chastisements in the afflictions and tribulations in this life?<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> Beloved, the death of
Christ is given to us, as a <hi>Hand-writing:</hi> for, when Christ naild that <hi>Chirographum,</hi> that
first hand-writing, that had passed between the Devill and us, to his Crosse, he did not
leave us out of debt, nor absolutely discharged, but he laid another <hi>Chirographum</hi> upon
us, another Obligation arising out of his death. His death is delivered to us, as a <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
but not a writing onely in the nature of a peece of <hi>Evidence,</hi> to plead our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by, but a writing in the nature of a Copy, to learne by; It is not onely given
us to reade, but to write over, and practise; Not onely to tell us <hi>what he</hi> did, but <hi>how
we</hi> should do so too.</p>
                     <p>All the evills and mischiefes that light upon us in this world, come (for the most
part) from this, <hi>Quia fruimur utendis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> because we thinke to injoy those things which God
hath given us onely to <hi>use.</hi> God hath given us a <hi>use</hi> of things, and we set our hearts
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:93359:231"/>
upon them. And this hath a proportion, an assimilation, an accommodation in the death
of Christ. God hath proposed <hi>that</hi> for our <hi>use,</hi> in this world, and we think to enjoy it;
God would have us doe it over again, and we think it enough to know that Christ hath
done it already; God would have us <hi>write</hi> it, and we doe onely <hi>read</hi> it; God would
have us <hi>practise</hi> the death of Christ, and we do but <hi>understand</hi> it. The <hi>fruition,</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
of the death of Christ, is reserved for the next life; To this life belongs the <hi>use</hi> of
it; that use of it, to <hi>fulfill his sufferings in our bodies,</hi> by bearing the afflictions and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of this life.<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> For, <hi>Priùs Trophaeum Crucis erexit, deinde Martyribus tradidit erigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum;</hi>
first Christ set up the victorious Trophee of his Crosse himself, and then he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it over to his Martyrs to do as he had done. Nor are they onely his <hi>Martyrs</hi> that
have <hi>actually</hi> died for him, but into the signification of that name, which signifies a
<hi>Witnesse,</hi> fall all those, who have glorified him, in a patient and constant bearing the
afflictions and tribulations of this life. All being guilty of Christs death, there lies an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon us all, to fulfill his sufferings. And this is the <hi>generality</hi> of afflictions, as
we consider them in their own nature.</p>
                     <p>Now,<note place="margin">Gheber. Vir.</note> this generality is next expressed, in this word of exaltation, <hi>Gheber, Ego vir, I
am the man;</hi> It was that man, that is denoted and signified in that name, that hath lien
under affliction, and therefore no kinde of man was likely to scape. There are in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
Scriptures, <hi>four words,</hi> by which man is called; four names of man; and any of
the others, (if we consider the origination of the words) might better admit afflictions
to insult upon him, then this, <hi>Gheber, vir, I am the man.</hi> At first, man is called <hi>Ishe;</hi> a
word, which their Grammarians derive <hi>à sonitu,</hi> from a sound, from a voice. Whether
mans excellency be in <hi>that,</hi> that he can <hi>speak,</hi> which no other creature can doe; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans impotency be in <hi>that,</hi> that he comes into the world <hi>Crying,</hi> in this denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in this word, man is but a <hi>sound,</hi> but a <hi>voyce,</hi> and that is no great matter. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
name of man is <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> is no more but <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>red earth,</hi> aud the word
is often used for <hi>blushing.</hi> When the name of man imports no more but so, no more
but the frailty of the earth, and the bashfull acknowledgement and confession of that
frailty, in infinite infirmities, there is no great hope of scaping afflictions in this name,
<hi>Adam.</hi> Lesse in his third name, <hi>Enosh:</hi> for <hi>Enosh</hi> signifies <hi>aegrum, calamitosum,</hi> a person
naturally subject to, and actually possest with all kindes of infirmities. So that this
name of man, <hi>Enosh,</hi> is so farre from exempting him, as that it involves him, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows
him in afflictions: He hath a miserable name, as well as a miserable nature, <hi>Put
them in fear,<note place="margin">Ps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> 9. 20.</note> O Lord,</hi> (says <hi>David) that they may know they are but men;</hi> but such men,
as are denoted in that name of man, <hi>Enosh,</hi> (for there that name is expressed) weak and
miserable men. Now, (to collect these) as man is nothing but a frivolous, an empty,
a transitory sound, or but a sad and lamentable voice, (he is no more in his first name <hi>Ishe)</hi>
As man is nothing but <hi>red earth,</hi> a moldring clod of infirmities, and then, <hi>blushing,</hi>
that is, guilty, sensible, and ashamed of his own miserable condition, (and man is no
more, as hee is but <hi>Adam)</hi> As man is nothing but a receptacle of diseases in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
of crosses in his estate, of immoderate griefes for those crosses in his minde,
(and man is no more as hee is but <hi>Enosh)</hi> so there is no wonder, why man in generall
should be under affliction, for these names import, these names inforce it: As <hi>Adam</hi>
gave names to the creatures according to their natures, so God hath given names
to man, according to his nature, miserable names, to miserable wretches. But when
man is presented in this Text, in this fourth and great name, <hi>Gheber,</hi> which denotes
excellency, Excellency in <hi>virtue,</hi> (his minde rectified) Excellency in <hi>wealth,</hi> (his estate
enlarged) Excellency in <hi>power,</hi> (his authority extended) Excellency in <hi>favour,</hi> (all seas
calm on the top, and foordable at the bottome to him) when man is expressed in that
word,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 29.</note> which <hi>Isaac</hi> used to <hi>Iacob,</hi> in his abundant blessing, <hi>Be Lord over thy brethren,
and let thy mothers sonnes bow down to thee:</hi> And then, in this heighth, this heighth of
vertue and merit, of wealth and treasure, of command and power, of favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
is thrown down into the pit of misery, and submitted to all afflictions, what
man can hope to be exempted? Man carries the spawn and seed and egges of affliction
in his own flesh, and his own thoughts make haste to hatch them, and to bring them up.
We make all our worms snakes, all our snakes vipers, all our vipers dragons, by our
murmuring. And so have you this generality of affliction, considered in this name of
Exaltation <hi>Gheber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="449" facs="tcp:93359:231"/>
Now,<note place="margin">Ieremy.</note> in our third consideration of this extent of affliction, in that this person, this
<hi>Prophet Ieremy,</hi> (for, of <hi>him</hi> literally we understand these words, <hi>Ego vir, I am the
man)</hi> is thus submitted to these extraordinary afflictions,<note place="margin">Nemo necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Deo.</note> we see first, that no man is so
necessary to God, as that God cannot come to his ends without that man; God can
lack, and leave out any man in his service. If Christ had revealed to his Apostles, before
he called them to be Apostles, or qualified them for that service, that he had a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to subdue and convert the whole world, by the labour and the meanes of <hi>twelve
men,</hi> would it ever have faln or entred into their imaginations, that any of <hi>them,</hi> should
have been any of those twelve? Men of low rank, and estimation, men disfurnished,
not onely of all helps of learning, but of all experience in <hi>Civill</hi> or in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs?
And as Christ infused new abilities into these men that had none, so can he effect
his purposes without <hi>them,</hi> who think they have all. And therefore, when he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
his twelve Apostles, and had endowed and qualified them for that service, when in
their sight some of his Disciples forsook him, because he preached <hi>Duros sermones,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
hard to flesh and bloud,<note place="margin">Iob. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>7.</note> Christ was not afraid to say to the twelve, <hi>Numquid
&amp; vos vultis abire, Will ye also goe away?</hi> Hee says it to the twelve; and hee does not
say, <hi>Will any of you, but will you, you twelve, all, goe away?</hi> I can doe my work without
you. And therefore let no man goe about to promove or advance his own fancies, his
own singularities, his own <hi>Schismaticall</hi> opinions, because he hath done God service
before, because he hath possessed himself of the love of that <hi>Congregation,</hi> because no
mans preaching is so acceptable there, as <hi>his,</hi> and that the Church cannot be without
him; for, no man hath made God beholden to him, so far, as that he should be afraid to
offend him. So also let no man be disheartned nor discouraged, if hee have brought a
good conscience, and faithfull labour to the service of God. Let him not thinke his
wages the worse paid, if God doe mingle bodily <hi>sicknesse,</hi> temporall <hi>losses,</hi> personall <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces,</hi>
with his labours; Let him not think that God should not doe thus to <hi>them</hi> that
wear out themselves in his service; for the best part of our wages is <hi>adversity,</hi> because
that gives us a true fast, and a right value of our prosperity. <hi>Ieremy</hi> had it; the best of
his rank must.</p>
                     <p>In his example,<note place="margin">Non excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samur à fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis per praeterita. 1 Reg. 19. 4.</note> we have thus much more, that no man is excused of subsequent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
by precedent, nor of falling into more, by having born some already. <hi>Elias</hi>
reckoned too hastily, when he told God, <hi>Satis est, now it is enough, Lord take away my
life;</hi> God had more to lay upon him. A <hi>last years fever</hi> prevents not this, nor a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the <hi>fall,</hi> another in the <hi>Spring.</hi> Men are not as such <hi>Copises,</hi> as being felled now,
stand safe from the Axe for a dozen year after; But our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are as beggers, they
tell others, and send more after them; <hi>Sicknesse</hi> does but usher in <hi>poverty,</hi> and poverty
<hi>contempt,</hi> and contempt <hi>dejection of spirit,</hi> And <hi>a broken spirit who can bear?</hi> No man
may refuse <hi>a privy seal,</hi> because he hath lent before. And, though Afflictions be not of
<hi>Gods revenue,</hi> for, Afflictions are not reall services to God) yet they are of his <hi>Subsidies,</hi>
and he hath additionall glory out of our Afflictions; and, the more, the more. <hi>Ieremy</hi> had
been scornfully and despitefully put in the stocks by <hi>Pashur,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 20. 1. 32. 2. 38. 9.</note> before; He had been impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in the Kings house, before; He had been put in the dungeon, &amp; almost starved in
the mire, before; And yet he was reserved to this farther calamity. Affliction is truly a
part of our patrimony, of our portion. If, as the prodigall did, we wast our portion, (that
is, make no use of our former affliction) it is not the least part of Gods bounty and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
towards us, if he give us a new stock, a new feeling of new calamities, that we may
be better emproved by them, then by the former; <hi>Ieremies</hi> former afflictions were
but preparatives for more; no more are ours.</p>
                     <p>And,<note place="margin">Publicavit.</note> in his example wee have this one note more, That when the hand of God had
been upon him, he declared, he published Gods hand-writing: not onely to his owne
conscience, by acknowledging that all these afflictions were for his sins, but by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
to the world, that God had laid such and such afflictions upon him. There is
not a neerer step to obduration, nor a worse defrauding of God of his glory, then to
be loth to let the world know, what God hath laid upon us. Say to your selves, <hi>These
afflictions are for my sins,</hi> and say to one another, <hi>Ego vir,</hi> I am the man whom God
hath thus, and thus afflicted. For, as <hi>Executions</hi> in <hi>Criminall justice,</hi> are done as much
for <hi>example</hi> of others, as for <hi>punishment</hi> of delinquents, so would God faine proceed
that cheap way, to make those afflictions which he lays upon <hi>thee,</hi> serve <hi>another</hi> too;
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:93359:232"/>
as they will, if thou be content to glorifie God, in letting others know, how he hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>thee.</hi> Shut we up this first branch of this first part (The extent and <hi>universality</hi> of
afflictions) which we have considered first in the <hi>nature</hi> of the case, (we have all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the afflictions of Christ, and therefore must all <hi>fulfill his sufferings in our flesh)</hi>
And then secondly, in this <hi>name of Exaltation, Gheber,</hi> (man, in the highest considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man, is the subject of affliction) And lastly, in the person of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> in whom we
have made our use of those three observations; First, That no man is so necessary to
God, as that God cannot be without him, Then, That no man is excused of future ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
by former, And lastly, That he whom God hath exercised with afflictions, is
bound to glorifie God in the declaration thereof; shut wee up this branch, with that
story of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who, in a journey from <hi>Milan</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> passing sometime in the
evening with his <hi>Host,</hi> and hearing him brag that he had never had any crosse in his
life, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> presently removed from thence to another house, with that protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That either <hi>that</hi> man was very unthankfull to God, that would not take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his corrections, or that Gods measure was by this time full, and hee would
surely, and soundly, and suddenly poure down all together. And so we passe to our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
branch of this first part, from the extent and generality of afflictions, to the <hi>weight</hi>
and <hi>vehemence</hi> of them, expressed in three heavy circumstances, That they <hi>are His,</hi>
the Lords, That they are <hi>from his Rod,</hi> That they are from <hi>the Rod of his wrath: I am
the man, that have seen afflictions, by the rod of his mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">Ejus.</note> they are aggravated in that they are <hi>Ejus, His,</hi> The Lords. It is ordinary in
the Scriptures, that when the Holy Ghost would expresse a superlative, or the highest
degree of any thing, to expresse it, by adding to it, the name of God. So, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>fortitudo Domini,</hi> and <hi>timor Domini,</hi> The power of the Lord, and the fear of the
Lord, doe not import that power which is in the Lord, nor that fear which is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by us of the Lord, but the power of the Lord, and the fear of the Lord denote
the greatest power, and the greatest fear that can be conceived. As in particular, when
<hi>Saul</hi> and his company were in such a dead sleep, as that <hi>David</hi> could enter in upon
them, and take his speare, and his pot of water from under his head, this is there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>sopor Domini,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 22.</note> the sleep of the Lord was upon him,</hi> the heaviest, the deadliest sleep that
could be imagined. so may these Afflictions in our Text be conceived to bee exalted
to a <hi>superlative</hi> heighth, by this addition, that <hi>They,</hi> and <hi>the Rod,</hi> and <hi>the wrath,</hi> are
said to <hi>be His, The Lords.</hi> But this cannot well be the sense, nor the direct proceeding,
and purpose of the Holy Ghost, in this place, because where the addition of the
name of God constitutes a superlative, that name is evidently and literally expressed
in that place, as <hi>fortitudo Det, sopor Dei,</hi> and the rest; But here, the name of God is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by implication, by illation, by consequence; All necessary, but yet but <hi>illation,</hi> but
<hi>implication,</hi> but <hi>consequence.</hi> For, there is no name of God in this verse; but, because in
the last verse of the former chapter, <hi>the Lord</hi> is expresly named, and the <hi>Lords Anger,</hi>
and then, this which is the first verse of this chapter, and connected to that, refers these
afflictions, and rods, and wrath to <hi>Him, (The rod of his wrath)</hi> it must necessarily bee
to <hi>him</hi> who was last spoken of, The <hi>Lord,</hi> They are <hi>Ejus, His,</hi> and therefore
heavy.</p>
                     <p>Then is an Affliction properly <hi>Gods Affliction,</hi> when thou in thy <hi>Conscience</hi> canst
impute it to none but God. When thou disorderest thy body with a <hi>surfeit,</hi> nature
will submit to sicknesse; When thou wearest out thy selfe with <hi>licentiousnesse,</hi> the sin
it self will induce infirmities; when thou transgressest any law of the State, the <hi>Iustice
of the State</hi> will lay hold upon thee. And for the Afflictions that fall upon thee in
these cases, thou art able to say to thy selfe, that they would have falne upon thee,
though there had been <hi>no God,</hi> or though God had had <hi>no rod</hi> about him, no anger
in him; Thou knowest in particular, <hi>why,</hi> and <hi>by whose,</hi> or <hi>by what means,</hi> these Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
light upon thee. But when thou shalt have thy Conscience clear towards such
and such <hi>men,</hi> and yet those men shall goe about to oppresse thee, when thou labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
uprightly in thy calling, and yet doest not prosper, when thou studiest the
Scriptures, hearkenest to Sermons, observest Sabbaths, desirest conferences, and
yet receivest not satisfaction, but still remainest under the torture of scruples and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xieties,
when thou art in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> case, <hi>Nihili conscius,</hi> That thou knowest nothing
by thy selfe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4.</note> and yet canst not give thy selfe peace, Though all Afflictions
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:93359:232"/>
upon Gods Children, be from <hi>him,</hi> yet, take knowledge that <hi>this</hi> is from <hi>him,</hi> more
intirely, and more immediately, and that God remembers something in thee, that
thou hast forgot; And, as that fit of an Ague, or that pang of the Gout, which may
take thee to day, is not necessarily occasioned by that which thou hast eaten to day,
but may be the effect of some former disorder, so the affliction which lights upon thee
in thine age, may be inflicted for the sinnes of thy youth. Thy affliction is <hi>his,</hi> The
Lords; And the Lord is infinite, and comprehends all at once, and ever finds some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in thee to correct, something that thou hast done, or something that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
have done, if the blessing of that correction had not restrained thee. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when thou canst not pitch thy affliction upon any <hi>particular sinne,</hi> yet make not
thy selfe so just,<note place="margin">August.</note> as that thou make God unjust, whose Judgements may be unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but they cannot be unjust.</p>
                     <p>This then is the first weight that is laid upon our afflictions,<note place="margin">In Virga.</note> that they <hi>are His, The
Lords;</hi> and this weight consists in this, That because they <hi>are his,</hi> they are <hi>inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
they cannot be avoyded, And because they are <hi>His,</hi> they are certainly <hi>just,</hi> and
cannot be <hi>pleaded</hi> against, nor can we ease our selves with any imagination of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
as though they were <hi>undeserved.</hi> And the next weight that is laid upon
them, is that they <hi>are, In virga ejus, in his rod.</hi> For, though this Metaphore, <hi>the
Rod,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 13.</note> may seeme to present but an easie correction, such as that, <hi>If thou beat thy
childe with a rod, be shall not dye,</hi> (It will not kill him) yet there is more weight then
so in this Rod;<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 20.</note> for the word here is <hi>Shebet,</hi> and <hi>Shebet</hi> is such a Rod as may kill; <hi>If
a man smite his servant with a Rod, so that he dye under his hand, he shall be surely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</hi>
Beloved, whether Gods Rod, and his correction, shall have the <hi>savour
of life unto life,</hi> or <hi>of death unto death,</hi> consists much in the <hi>hand,</hi> that is to receive
it, and in the stomach that is to digest it. As in Gods <hi>Temporall blessings</hi> that he
raines downe upon us, it is much in our gathering, and inning, and spending them,
whether it shall be <hi>frumenti,</hi> or <hi>laqueorum,</hi> whether this shall prove such a <hi>shoure,</hi> as
shall nourish our soule spiritually, in thankfulnesse to God, and in charitable workes
towards his needy Servants,<note place="margin">Psal. 11. 6.</note> or whether it shall prove <hi>a shoure of snares,</hi> to minister
occasions of <hi>tentations;</hi> so when he raines afflictions upon us, it is much in our gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether it shall be <hi>Roris,</hi> or <hi>Grandinis,</hi> whether it shall be a <hi>shoure of fatning
dew</hi> upon us, or a shoure of <hi>Fgyptian haile-stones,</hi> to batter us in peeces, <hi>as a Potters
Vessell,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ierem. 19. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>that cannot be renewed.</hi> Our murmuring makes a <hi>rod</hi> a <hi>staffe,</hi> and a <hi>staffe a
sword,</hi> and that which God presented for <hi>physick, poyson.</hi> The double effect and
operation of Gods Rod, and Corrections, is usefully and appliably expressed in the
Prophet <hi>Zachary:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">11. 7.</note> where God complaines, <hi>That he had fed the sheep of slaughter,</hi>
that he had been carefull for them, who would needs dye, say he what he could.
Therefore he was forced to come to the <hi>Rod,</hi> to correction. So he does; <hi>And I tooke
unto me,</hi> sayes he there, <hi>two Staves, the one I called Beauty, the oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r Bands;</hi> Two
wayes of correction, a milder, and a more vehement. When his milder way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
not, Then said I, <hi>I will not feed you;</hi> I will take no more care of you; <hi>That
which dyeth let it dye,</hi> (sayes he) and <hi>that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off;</hi> And <hi>I
tooke my staffe of Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might breake my Covenant, which I
had made with them.</hi> Beloved, God hath made no such Covenant with any State,
any Church, any soule, but that, being provoked, he is at liberty to break it. But
then, upon this, when the stubborne, and the refractory, the stiff-necked and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
were cut off, <hi>The poore of the sheep</hi> (sayes God) <hi>that waited upon me, knew
that it was the word of the Lord.</hi> It is not every mans case, to mend by Gods corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
onely <hi>the poore of the sheep,</hi> the broken hearted, the contrite spirit, the discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his owne poverty and infirmity, could make that good use of affliction, as to
finde <hi>Gods hand,</hi> and then <hi>Gods purpose</hi> in it. For, this Rod of God, this <hi>Shebet,</hi>
can kill; Affliction can harden, as well as mollifie, and entender the heart. And
there is so much the more danger, that it should worke that effect, that obduration,
because it is <hi>Virga Irae, The rod of his wrath,</hi> which is the other weight that aggravates
our afflictions.</p>
                     <p>In all afflictions that fall upon us from other instruments,<note place="margin">Virga Irae.</note> there is <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi>
The finger of God leads their hand that afflicts us; Though it be <hi>sicknesse,</hi> by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
though it be <hi>poverty,</hi> by our wastfulnesse, though it be <hi>oppression,</hi> by the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:93359:233"/>
malice, or by our exasperation of potent persons, yet still <hi>the finger of God</hi> is in all
these. But in the afflictions which we speake of <hi>here,</hi> such as fall upon us, when we
thinke our selves at peace with God, and in state of grace, it is not <hi>Digitus,</hi> but
<hi>Manus Dei,</hi> the whole worke is his, and man hath no part in it. Whensoever he takes
the Rod in hand, there is a correction towards; but yet, it may be but his <hi>Rod of
Beauty,</hi> of his <hi>Correction,</hi> not <hi>Destruction.</hi> But, if he take his <hi>Rod in anger,</hi> the case
is more dangerous; for, though there be properly no anger in God, yet then is God
said to do a thing in anger, when he does it so, as an angry man would do it. Upon
those words of <hi>David,<note place="margin">Psal. 6. 1.</note> O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
that <hi>David</hi> knew Gods rebukes and corrections were but for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but yet, <hi>In Ira corrigi noluit, in Ira emendari noluit, David</hi> was loth, that
God should go about to mend him in anger; afraid to have any thing to do with
God, till his anger were over-passed. Beloved, to a true anger, and wrath, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
towards his children, God never comes; but he comes so neare it, as that
they cannot discerne, whether it be anger, or no. A Father takes a Rod, and looks
as angerly, as though he would kill his childe, but means nothing but good to him.
So God brings a soule to a sad sense of an angry countenance in God, to a sad
apprehension of an angry absence, to a sad jealousie and suspition that God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
returne to it againe; And this is a heavy affliction, whilst it lasts. Our Saviour
Christ, in that case, came to expostulate it, to dispute it with his Father, <hi>Vt quid
dereliquisti, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Do but tell me <hi>why.</hi> Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,
if God be pleased to tell us, <hi>why</hi> he is angry, his anger is well allayd, and we have a
faire overture towards our restitution. But, in our infirmity, wee get not easily so
farre; we apprehend God to be angry; we cannot finde <hi>the cause,</hi> and we sinke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burden; we leave the disease to <hi>concoct</hi> it self, and we take no Physick. And
this is truly the highest extent, and exaltation of affliction, That in our afflictions
we take God to be angryer then he is. For, then is God said to take his Rod in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when he suffers us to thinke that he does so, and when he suffers us to decline, and
sinke so low towards diffidence, and desperation, that we dare not looke towards him,
because we beleeve him to be so angry. And so have you all those peeces which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
both the branches of this first part, The generality and extent of afflictions,
considered in the nature of the <hi>thing,</hi> in the nature of the <hi>word,</hi> this name of <hi>man,
Gheber,</hi> and in the <hi>person of Ieremy,</hi> the Prophet of God, And then the intensene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e,
and weight and <hi>vehemency</hi> of afflictions, considered in these three particulars, That
they <hi>are His,</hi> The Lords, That they are <hi>from His Rod,</hi> And from <hi>the Rod of his anger.</hi>
But to weigh down all these, we have comforts ministred unto us, in our Text, which
constitute our other part.</p>
                     <p>Of these the first is <hi>Vidi,<note place="margin">2 Part. <hi>Vidi.</hi>
                           </note> I have seen these afflictions,</hi> for <hi>this</hi> is an act of particular
grace and mercy, when God enables us to <hi>see</hi> them: for, naturally this is the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of our spirituall senses,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 18. 4. 18.</note> that when the eyes of our understanding should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
our understanding is so darkened, as that we can neither see prosperity,
nor adversity, for, in prosperity our light is too great, and we are <hi>dazeled,</hi> in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
too little, none at all, and we are <hi>benighted,</hi> we do not see our afflictions. There
is no doubt, but that the literall sense of this phrase, To see afflictions, is to feele, to
suffer afflictions.<note place="margin">Psal. 89. 48. 16. 10.</note> As, when <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see
death,</hi> and when Christ sayes, <hi>Thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption,</hi> to see
death, and to see corruption, is to <hi>suffer</hi> them. But then, the literall sense being thus
duly preserved, That the children of God shall certainly <hi>see,</hi> that is, certainly <hi>suffer</hi>
afflictions, receive we also that sweet odour and fragrancy which the word breaths out,
That they shall <hi>see it,</hi> that is, <hi>understand</hi> it, <hi>consider</hi> it: For, as when the wicked come
to say,<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord does not see it,</hi> it is presently added, <hi>Neither doth the God of Iacob re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it,</hi> (It is a <hi>seeing</hi> that induces a <hi>regarding</hi>) so when the godly come to see their
afflictions, they come to <hi>regard</hi> them, to regard Gods <hi>purpose</hi> in them. <hi>Vidisti Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,

                        <note place="margin">35. 22.</note> sayes David, <hi>All this thou hast seen, O Lord, Lord do not hold thy peace.
David</hi> presumed, that if God <hi>saw</hi> his afflictions, he would stirre in them; when we come
to <hi>see</hi> them, we <hi>stir,</hi> we wake, we rise, we looke about us, from <hi>whence,</hi> and <hi>why</hi> these
afflictions come; and therein lyes this comfort, <hi>Vidi, I have seen</hi> afflictions, I have
been content to look upon them, to consider them.</p>

                        <pb n="453" facs="tcp:93359:233"/>
The Prophets in the Old Testament, doe often call those sights, and those prenoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which they had of the misery and destruction of others, <hi>Onus visionis, Onus verbi
Domini, O the burden of this sight, O the burden of this message of God.</hi> It was a burden to
them, to see Gods judgements directed upon others; how much more is it a burden to
a man, to see his own affliction, and that in the cause thereof? But this must be done,
we must see our affliction in the <hi>Cause thereof.</hi> No man is so blinde, so stupid, as that
he doth not <hi>see</hi> his affliction, that is, <hi>feele</hi> it; but we must see it so, as to <hi>see through</hi> it,
see it to be <hi>such</hi> as it is, so qualified, so conditioned, so circumstanced, as he that sends
it, intends it. We must leave out the <hi>malice</hi> of others in our oppressions, and forgive
<hi>that;</hi> leave out the <hi>severity</hi> of the Law in our punishments, and submit to <hi>that;</hi> and
looke intirely upon the certainty of Gods judgement, who hath the whole body of our
sins written together before him, and picks out what sin it pleaseth him, and punisheth
now an old, now a yesterdayes sin, as he findeth it most to conduce to his glory, and
our amendment,<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 51.</note> and the edification of others, We must <hi>see the hand of God upon the
wall</hi> as <hi>Belshazzar</hi> did, (for even <hi>that was the hand of God</hi>) though wee cannot read that
writing, no more then <hi>Belshazzar</hi> could. Wee must see the affliction, so as we must see
it to be the <hi>hand of God,</hi> though wee cannot presently see, <hi>for what sinne it is, nor what
will be the issue of it.</hi> And then when we have seen that, then we must turn to the study
of those other particulars, for, till we see the affliction to come from God, we see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
There is no other light in that darknesse, but <hi>he.</hi> If thou see thy affliction, thy
sicknesse, in that glasse, in the consideration of thine own former <hi>licentiousnesse,</hi> thou
shalt have no other answer, but that soure remorse, and increpation, <hi>you might have
lived honestly.</hi> If thou see thy affliction, thy poverty, in that glasse, in the malice &amp; oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of potent adversaries, thou wilt get no farther, then to that froward and churlish
answer,<note place="margin">Psal. 55. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>The Law is open, mend your selfe as you can.</hi> But <hi>Iactate super Dominum,</hi> saith
<hi>David, Lay all thy burden upon the Lord, and hee will apply to thee that Collyrium, that

And see from <hi>whence it commeth, (from him,</hi> who, <hi>as hee liveth, would not the death of a
sinner</hi>) And see why it commeth, (<hi>that thou mightest see and taste the goodnesse of God
thy selfe, and declare his loving kindnesse to the Children of Men.</hi>) And this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
deduced from this word <hi>Vidi, I have seen affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this leadeth us to our other Comfort,<note place="margin">Ego vir.</note> That though these Afflictions have
wrought deepe upon thee, yet thou canst say to thy soule, <hi>Ego vir, I am that man;
Thy Morality,<note place="margin">vers. 22.</note> thy Christianity</hi> is not shaked in thee. <hi>It is the Mercy of God, that wee
are not conumed,</hi> saith <hi>Ieremy</hi> here; And it is a great degree of his mercy, to let us
<hi>feele</hi> that wee are not consumed, to give us this sense, that our case is not desperate, but
that <hi>Ego vir, I am the man,</hi> that there remaineth still strength enough to gather more;
That still thou remainest <hi>a man, a reasonable man,</hi> and so art able to apply to thy selfe;
all those medicines and reliefs, which Philosophy and naturall reason can afford. For,
even these helps, deduced from <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>naturall reason,</hi> are strong enough against
afflictions of this world, as long as we can use them, as long as these helps of reason
and learning are alive, and awake, and actuated in us, they are able to sustain us from
sinking under the afflictions of this world, for, they have sustained many a <hi>Plato,</hi> and
<hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> in such cases. But when part of the affliction shall be, that God
worketh upon <hi>the Spirit</hi> it selfe, and damps that, enfeebles that, that he casts a sooty
Cloud upon the <hi>understanding,</hi> and darkens that, that he doth <hi>Exuere hominem,</hi> devest,
strip the man of the man, <hi>Eximere hominem,</hi> take the man out of the man, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
and frustrate his naturall understanding so, as that, to this purpose, he is no man,
yet even in this case, God may mend thee, in marring thee, hee may build thee up in
dejecring thee, hee may infuse another, <hi>Ego vir,</hi> another Manhood into thee, and
though thou canst not say <hi>Ego vir, I am that Morall man,</hi> safe in my <hi>Naturall Reason</hi>
and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that is spent, yet <hi>Ego vir,</hi> I am that <hi>Christian man,</hi> who have seen this
affliction in the <hi>Cause</hi> thereof, so farre off, as in my <hi>sinne in Adam,</hi> and the <hi>remedy</hi> of

I doe halt, become infirm with manifold afflictions, yet they shall be so many seals of my
infallibility in him. Now this comfort hath three gradations in our text, three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
which, as they aggravated the discomfort in the former, so they exalt
the comfort in this part, That they are <hi>His, The Lords,</hi> That they are <hi>from his rod,</hi>
That they are <hi>from the rod of his wrath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may compare our afflictions that come immediately from <hi>God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ejus.</note> with those that
come instrumentally from <hi>others,</hi> by considering the choice and election which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
made, and the choice which <hi>Susanna</hi> made in her case. The Prophet <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d</hi> offers
<hi>David</hi> his choice of three afflictions,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>War, Famine,</hi> or <hi>pestilence.</hi> It does not appeare,
it is not expressed, that <hi>David</hi> determined himself, or declared his choice of any of
the three.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 13.</note> Hee might conceive a hope, that God would forbear all three. As, when
another Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him, <hi>The childe shall surely die,</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> said, for
all that determined assurance, <hi>Who can tell whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that
the child may live,</hi> and he fasted a fast, and mourned and prayed for the childes life;
Beloved, no commination of God, is unconditioned, or irrevocable. But in this case
<hi>David</hi> intimates some kinde of election, <hi>Let me fall into the hands of the Lord, for his
mercies are exceeding great, and not into the hands of men. Susanna,</hi> when shee was
surprised, (and in a straight too, though of another kind) she resolves that it is better
for her to fall into the hands of <hi>men,</hi> (let men defame her, let men accuse her, condemn
her, execute her) rather then sin in the sight of God, and so fall into his hands. So
that, if wee compare offences, wee were better offend all the Princes of the earth,
then offend God, because he is able to cast body and soul into hell fire. But when
the offence is done, for the <hi>punishment</hi> which follows, God forgives a <hi>treason,</hi> sooner
then thy neighbour will a <hi>trespasse;</hi> God seales thee a <hi>Quietus est,</hi> in the bloud of his
Son, sooner then a <hi>Creditor</hi> will renue a bond, or withdraw an Action; and a <hi>Scandalum
magnatum,</hi> will lie longer upon thee here, then a <hi>blasphem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> against God, in <hi>that</hi> Court.
And therefore, as it is one degree of <hi>good husbandry,</hi> in ill husbands, to bring all their
debts into one hand, so doest thou husband thy afflictions well, if thou put them all
upon thy debts to God, and leave out the consideration of <hi>Instruments;</hi> And he shall
deale with thee,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 18.</note> as hee did with <hi>David</hi> there, that plague, which was threatned for
three days, he will end in <hi>one;</hi> In that trouble, which, if men had had their will upon
thee, would have consumed thee, thou shalt stand unconsumed. For, if a man
wound thee, it is not in his power, though hee be never so sorry for it, whether that
wound shall kill thee, or no; but if the Lord wound thee to death, he is the life, he can
redeem thee from death, and if hee doe not, he is thy resurrection, and recompenses
thee with another, and a better life. And so lies our first comfort, that it is <hi>Ejus, His,</hi>
The Lords, And a second is, that it is <hi>In virga ejus, In his rod.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iob</hi> would fain have come to a cessation of arms,<note place="margin">In Virga. 9. 34.</note> before hee came to a treaty with
God; <hi>Let the Lord take away his rod from me,</hi> sayes he, <hi>and let not his fear terrifie
me; Them would I speak.</hi> As long as his rod was upon him, and his fears terrified him,
it was otherwise; he durst not. But truly his feares should not terrifie us, though his
rod be upon us; for herein lies our comfort, That all Gods rods are bound up with
that mercy, which accompanied that rod that God threatned <hi>David,</hi> to exercise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his son <hi>Solemon,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 14.</note> If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men;</hi> (I will

a rod) And he shall threaten more, offer at more (he shall lift up his staffe) where then
is the peoples reliefe,<note place="margin">V. 26.</note> and comfort? In this; <hi>The Lord of Hosts shall stir up a scourge

his enemies, and the enemies of his friends, with a scourge upon them, against
their rod upon us. Gods own rods are bound up in mercy, (they end in mercy) And,
for the rods of other men, God cuts them in pieces, and their owners, with his sword.

Gods owne rods, even towards his owne Children, are sometimes, as that rod which
he put into <hi>Moses</hi> hand was,<note place="margin">Exod. 7. 12.</note> chang'd into <hi>Serpents.</hi> Gods owne rods have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a sting, and a bitternesse in them; but then, they are chang'd from their owne
nature; Naturally Gods roddes towards us, are gentle, and harmlesse: When
Gods rod in <hi>Moses</hi> hand, was changed to a Serpent, it did no harme, that did but
devoure the other Serpents: when Gods rods are heaviest upon us, if they devoure
other rods, that is, enable us to put off the consideration of the malice and oppression
of other Men, and all displeasure towards them, and lay all upon God, for our sinnes,
these <hi>serpentine rods</hi> have wrought a good effect: When <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
yet it return'd quickly to a Rod againe; how bitter so ever Gods corrections
be, they returne soone to their naturall sweetnesse, and though the correction continue,
the bitternesse does not: with this Rod <hi>Moses</hi> tam'd the Sea, and divided that; but he
drowned none in that Sea, but the Aegyptians. Gods rod will cut, and divide between
thy soule, and spirit, but he will destroy nothing in thee, not thy <hi>Morality,</hi> not thy <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
but onely thine owne <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> thy Persecutors, thy <hi>concupiscencies.</hi>

                     <p>But all this while,<note place="margin">Quia Virga.</note> we have but deduced a comfort out of thy Word, <hi>Quia Virga,</hi>
though that be a rod; but this is a comfort <hi>Quia Virga,</hi> therefore, because that is a
Rod: for, this word which is here a Rod, is also, in other places of Scriptures, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
not of <hi>correction,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mich. 7. 14.</note> but <hi>direction: Feed thy sheep with thy Rod,</hi> saies God; and
there it is a <hi>Pastorall Rod,</hi> the direction of the Church; <hi>Virga rectitudinis virgaregni

                        <note place="margin">Psal. 45. 7.</note> saies <hi>David; The Scepter of thy kingdome is a right Scepter;</hi> and there its a <hi>royall
rod,</hi> the protection of the state: so that all comforts that are deriv'd upon us, by the
<hi>direction</hi> of the Church, and by the <hi>protection</hi> of the State, are recommended to us, and
conferr'd upon us in this <hi>His Rod.</hi> Nor is it onely a Rod of <hi>comfort,</hi> by implication,
and consequence;<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 4.</note> but expresly and literally it is so: <hi>Though I should walke thorough
the valley of the shadow of death, I will feare no evill; Thy rod, and thy staffe, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me.</hi> He had not onely a comfort, though he had the rod, but he had not had
so much comfort, except he had had it; we have not so good evidence of the joyes of
the next life, except we have the sorrowes of this.</p>
                     <p>The discomfort then lies not in this,<note place="margin">Virga Irae.</note> That the affliction is <hi>ejus, his,</hi> the Lords, (for
we have an ease in that) nor, that it is <hi>In Virga ejus, in his rod,</hi> (for we have a benefit by
that) but it is <hi>In virga irae,</hi> in that it is the rod of his wrath, of his anger. But truely,
beloved, there is a blessed comfort ministred unto us, even in that word; for that word

                        <hi>Gnabar,</hi> which we translate <hi>Anger, wrath,</hi> hath another ordinary signification in
Scripture, which, though that may seem to be an easier, would prove a heavier sense
for us to beare, than this of <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>anger;</hi> this is, <hi>preteritio, conniventia,</hi> Gods
forbearing to take knowledge of our transgressions; when God shall say of us, as he
does of <hi>Israel,<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 5.</note> Why should ye be smitten any more?</hi> when God leaves us to our selves,
and studies our recovery no farther, by any more corrections; for, in this case, there is
the lesse comfort, because there is the lesse <hi>anger</hi> show'd. And therefore S. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
who was heartily afraid of this sense of our word, heartily afraid of this preterition,
that God should forget him, leave him out, affectionately, passionately embraces this
sense of the word in our Text, <hi>Anger;</hi> and he sayes, <hi>Irascaris mihi Domine, Domine
mihi irascaris, Be angry with me ô Lord, O Lord be angry with me, lest I perish!</hi> for, till
we have a sense of such an anger in God, towards us, as Children have from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
that not onely they correct them, but deny them some things that they aske,
and keep them some time from their sight and presence, till we be made Partakers of
this blessed anger of God, (for we doe not pray, that God would not be angry, but
that <hi>he would not be angry with us for ever)</hi> till <hi>then</hi> we come not to see an affliction,
that is, to discerne, <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>whence,</hi> and <hi>why</hi> that comes: Nor we see that not like
Men, like such Men, like Christian Men, not with a faithfull and constant assurance,
that all will have an end in him who suffered infinitely more for us, than he hath layd
upon us.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the place where <hi>Circumcision</hi> began, and this is the <hi>Day,</hi>
when <hi>Circumcision</hi> ended; in this Scripture it was Instituted, in
the person of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and upon this <hi>Day</hi> it was perfected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated
in the person of <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> for, though Circumcision
were admitted in a few cases, in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time, <hi>after</hi> Christ, yet
that was, as <hi>dead berbs</hi> are re-admitted into <hi>medicines</hi> in the <hi>winter,</hi>
when fresh and green herbs cannot be had of that kind: So Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was sometimes admitted for <hi>peace,</hi> and to avoid <hi>scandall,</hi> and the better to
propagate the Church,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> after the vertue thereof was extinguished in Christ. In the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
thereof in this Text, we will consider <hi>Abrahams</hi> ready, and exact obedience:
In the <hi>Consummation</hi> thereof, in the person of <hi>Christ,</hi> we will consider <hi>that,</hi> to which,
this Circumcision had relation, that is, the <hi>spirituall Circumcision</hi> of our hearts. It is
a <hi>Text</hi> well handled, and it is a <hi>Day</hi> well spent, if the <hi>Text</hi> teach us to obey God
readily, and immediately, what inconveniences soever present themselves in the way,
and if the celebration of the <hi>Day,</hi> teach us to come this Day, to <hi>that</hi> which is the true
Circumcision, the <hi>Circumcision</hi> of <hi>the Heart.</hi> In the first, in <hi>Abraham's</hi> example, we
shall passe by these steps: First, that though there be allowed to us an <hi>Omnia Probate,</hi>
a <hi>Triall of all things,</hi> and a spirit to <hi>discerne spirits;</hi> yet when once it appeares to us,
to be a comman dement of God, there's <hi>a fine leavied,</hi> all Titles concluded, no more
claime to be made by our <hi>under standing,</hi> our <hi>reason,</hi> but a present, and an exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
must be given to it. Secondly, that in particular Men, and in particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
there may arise tentations, objections, reasons, why a Man might forbeare alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or at least differ the execution of such a commandement, as there may have
done in <hi>Abraham's</hi> case, as we shall see anon. Thirdly, that though such tentations
doe arise in us out of our infirmities, yet God gives his Children strength to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
those difficulties, and to oppose stronger reasons against those reasons, and so
to come to a willing obedience to his will. And then lastly, the <hi>triumph</hi> that belongs
to this <hi>victory;</hi> which we shall find, in considering what <hi>benefit Abraham</hi> received by
this obedience in his Circumcision: And these will be the branches of out first part,
rising out of the <hi>Institution</hi> of Circumcision, in the person of <hi>Abraham</hi> at that great
age, First, that Gods <hi>manifest will</hi> must not be disputed, nor reasoned upon: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that Mans <hi>corrupt nature</hi> will offer reasons against it: Thirdly, that God will give
the <hi>issue with the tentation,</hi> reason above that reason: And lastly, he will accompany
that victory, with other blessings too.</p>

                        </note> for our <hi>exact obedience</hi> to that which God exacts of us, it is well said by
<hi>Luther, Depuerascendum est, cum agitur de obedientia Dei:</hi> when the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this, or this be commanded by God or no, when <hi>traditions</hi> and additions of <hi>men,</hi>
are imposed upon us, as commandements of <hi>God,</hi> here's no <hi>Depuerascendum</hi> in this
case, this is no Childs-play; then <hi>viriliter agendum,</hi> (as the Apostle speaks) we must
<hi>quit our selves like men,</hi> we must <hi>dispute</hi> like Men, (like <hi>learned</hi> men) <hi>preach</hi> like Men,
(<hi>like Zealous</hi> Men) <hi>pray</hi> like Men (like <hi>devout</hi> Men) <hi>resist</hi> like Men, (like <hi>valiant</hi> Men)
or at least, (in cases where we may not resist) <hi>suffer</hi> like Men, (like <hi>constant</hi> Christian
Men.) But when the question is, <hi>De obedientia Dei,</hi> that this is agreed to be the will
of God, and all the question is, whether God might not be content to accept an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to some part of it, or to all of that hereafter, but not now, whether God would
not forgive the debt, or at least give day for the payment of it; either when we are

                        <hi>old,</hi> or by legacies to <hi>pious uses,</hi> when we die, when this is the question, <hi>Depuerascendum
est,</hi> we must grow <hi>Children</hi> again; we must not onely, not argue, not dispute against it
(which are acts of <hi>men,</hi> of strong &amp; able understandings) but we must return to the first
weaknesse of Children, to be <hi>speechlesse,</hi> to be <hi>thoughtlesse;</hi> we must not utter a word,
not conceive a thought against it, <hi>Periculosa &amp; pestilens quaestio, Quare;</hi> saies <hi>Luther</hi>
also, It is a Dangerous and Infectious <hi>Monasillable, How</hi> or <hi>Why:</hi> If I will aske a
<hi>reason,</hi> why God commands such a thing; <hi>first, Periculosum est,</hi> It is Dangerous; for,
I have nothing to answer me, but mine owne <hi>reason,</hi> and that affords not Lead enough,
nor Line enough, to sound the depth of Gods proceedings, nor length enough, nor
strength enough to reach so farre, and therefore I may mistake the reason, and goe
upon false grounds. So, <hi>Periculosum est,</hi> It is a Dangerous question, and a lost que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
because I can have no certaine answer; and it is an <hi>infectious</hi> question too, for
here is one coale of the Devils fire, of his pride, kindled in me; as the Devil said, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis
ere Altissimo, I will be like the Highest,</hi> and see whether I may not stand by my
selfe, without any Influence from God, without any Dependance upon God: so, in
our case, I will be so farre equall to God, as that I will measure his actions by my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and nor doe his Commandements till I know <hi>why</hi> he commanded them: And
then, when the infection is got into a House, who can say, it shall end here in this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and kill no more; or it shall end this weeke, and last no longer? So if that <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
inquisition,</hi> that <hi>Quare,</hi> (<hi>Why</hi> should God command this or this perticular? be
entred into me, all my <hi>Humilitie</hi> is presently infected, and I shall looke for a reason,
why God made a world, or why he made a world no sooner then 6000. yeares agoe,
and why he sayes <hi>some,</hi> and why <hi>but</hi> some, and I shall examine God upon all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories</hi>
that I can frame, upon the <hi>Creed</hi> (why I should believe a Sonne of a Virgin
without a Man, or believe the Sonne of God to descend into Hell) Or frame upon the
<hi>Pater Noster,</hi> (why I should worship such a God, that must be prayed to, <hi>not to leade
me into tentation)</hi> Or frame upon the <hi>Ten Commandements,</hi> why after all is done and
heapt, for any sinfull action, yet I should be guilty of all, for covering in my heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mans horse or house. And therfore <hi>Luther</hi> pursues it farther, with words of
more vehemence, <hi>Odiosa &amp; exitialis vocule, Quare,</hi> It is an Execrable and Damnable
Monasillable, <hi>Why;</hi> it exasperates God, it ruines us: For, when we come to aske a
reason of his actions, either we doubt of the <hi>goodnesse</hi> of God, that he is not so carefull
of us, as we would be; or of his <hi>power,</hi> that he cannot provide for us, so well as we
could doe; or of his <hi>wisdome,</hi> that he hath not grounded his Commandements so
well as we could have advised him: whereas Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saies justly, <hi>Qui ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
quaerit voluntatis Dei, aliquid majus Deo quaerit,</hi> He that seekes a reason of the will
of God, seekes for something greater then God. It was the Devill that opened our
eies in Paradise, it is our parts to shut them so farre, as not to gaze upon Gods secret
purposes. God guided his Children as well by a <hi>Pillar of Cloud,</hi> as by a <hi>Pillar of Fire,</hi>
and both, Cloud and Fire, were equally Pillars: There is as much strength in, and as
safe relying upon some ignorances, as some knowledges; for God provided for his
people, as well in <hi>this,</hi> that he <hi>did Moses body</hi> from them, as that he revealed other
Mysteries to them, by him. All is well summ'd and collected by Saint <hi>Augustine,
Dominus cur jusserit, viderit; faciendum est à serviente, quod jusserit: Why</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
any thing, God himselfe knowes; our part is, not to enquire <hi>why,</hi> by to doe
<hi>what</hi> he commands.</p>
                     <p>This is the Rule:<note place="margin">Tamen tema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> 'Tis true, there should not be: but yet is there not sometimes, in
the minds and mouths of good and godly men, a <hi>Quare,</hi> a reasoning, a disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>that</hi> which God hath commanded or done? The murmuring of the Children
in the Desert, had still this <hi>Quare, Quare eduxisti, Wherefore have you brought us hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <note place="margin">Num. 20.</note> in this miserable place, <hi>where there is no Seed, no Figges, no Vines, no
Pomegrantes, no Water? Saul had this Quare,</hi> this rebellious inquisition, upon that
Commandement of God against the <hi>Amalekites,<note place="margin">1 Sum. 4.</note> Slay both Man and Woman, Infant and
Suckling, Oxe and Sheepe, Camell and Asse:</hi> And from this <hi>Quare,</hi> from this disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his, arose that conclusion, That it were better to spare some for Sacrifice, then
to destroy all: But though his pretence had a religious colour, <hi>that</hi> would not justifie
a slacknesse in obeying the manifested will of God; for, for <hi>this,</hi> God repented that
he made him <hi>King,</hi> and told him that he had more pleasure in <hi>Obedience,</hi> then in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
                        <pb n="458" facs="tcp:93359:236"/>
But, to come to better men then the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wildernesse, or <hi>Saul</hi> in his
Government, <hi>Iob,</hi> though <hi>he,</hi> and his Friends held out long, <hi>(They sate upon the ground
even daies and seven nights, and none spoke a word)</hi> yet at last fell into these <hi>Quares,
Why did I not die in the birth? or, why sucked I the breast? Peter</hi> himselfe had this
reluctation; and though that were out of piety, yet he was chidden for it, <hi>Quare la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,</hi>

                        <hi>Lord, doest thou wash my feet? thou shalt never wash my feet:</hi> till Christ

                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this common infirmitie; inherent in the best men that may (and not unlikely)
be, that when God commanded <hi>Abraham,</hi> at that great age to circumcise himselfe,
there might arise such <hi>Quares,</hi> such scruples and doubts, as there, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> minde,
(for, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saies of himselfe, <hi>If any man thinke he hath whereof to trust in the
flesh,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> much more I, Circumcised, an Hebrew, an Israelite, a Pharisee, a Zealous Servant in
the persecution, and in righteousnesse unblameable:</hi> So if any man might have taken
this libertie to have disputed with God, upon his precepts, <hi>Abraham</hi> might have done
it; for, when God called him out to <hi>number the Starres,</hi> (which was, even to <hi>Art,</hi>
impossible) and promised him,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note> that his seed should equall them, (which was, in <hi>Nature,</hi>
incredible) for all this <hi>Incredibilitie</hi> and <hi>Impossibilitie, Abraham believed, and this was
accounted to him for Righteousnesse:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> And <hi>Abraham</hi> had declared his easie, and forward,
and <hi>implicit faith</hi> in God, when God called him, and he went out, not knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went: And therefore when God offered him a new seale, <hi>Circumcision, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
might have said, <hi>Quare sigillum?</hi> What needs a seale betweene thee and me?
I have used to take thy word before, and thou hast tried me before: But <hi>Abraham</hi>
knew that <hi>Obedience</hi> was better then <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>disputation;</hi> for, though <hi>Obedience</hi> and
good <hi>works,</hi> do not <hi>beget faith,</hi> yet they <hi>nurse</hi> it; <hi>Per ea augescit fidei, &amp; pinguescit,</hi> saies
<hi>Luther,</hi> Our faith grows into a better state, and into a better liking, by our good works.</p>
                     <p>Againe, when <hi>Abraham</hi> considered, that it was, <hi>Mandatum in re turpi,</hi> That this
Circumcision, in it selfe, was too frivolous a thing; and, in that part of the Bodie, too
obscene a thing, to be brought into the fancy of so many Women, so many young
Men, so many Strangers to other Nations, as might bring the Promise and Covenant
it selfe into scorne, and into suspicion, that should require such a seale to it as that was,
he might have come to this, <hi>Quare tam turpe, quare tam sordidum?</hi> why does God
command me so base and uncleane a thing, so scornfull and mis-interpretable a thing,
as Circumcision, and Circumcision in that part? Againe, when he considered, that
to Circumcise <hi>all his family in one day,</hi> (as by the Commandement he must) which
could not be (in likelyhood) of lesse then 400. (for he went out before, to the rescue of
<hi>Lot,</hi> with 318. borne and brought up in his House) he must make his House a <hi>Spittle</hi>
of so many impotent Persons, unable to helpe one another for many daies, (for such
was the effect of Circumcision,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> as we see in their Story, when <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> came
upon the <hi>Sichemites</hi> three daies after they had beene, by their perswasion, circumcised,
the <hi>Sichemites</hi> were unable to resist or defend themselves,<note place="margin">Gen. 34.</note> and so were slaine: Yea the
sorenesse and incommodity upon Circumcision was so great, as that the very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
it selfe of Circumcision, was forborne in the Wildernesse, because they
were then put to suddaine removes, which presently after a Circumcision, they could
not have perform'd) Might not <hi>Abraham</hi> have come to his <hi>Quare tam molestum?</hi>
Why will God command me so troublesome and incommodious a thing as this?
And (to contract this) when he considered, That one principall reason of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of Circumcision, was, that that marke might be alwaies a remembrance
to them against <hi>intemperance</hi> and <hi>incontinency.</hi> Might not <hi>Abraham</hi> have come to his
<hi>Quare mihi?</hi> What use is there of this, in my Body, which is now dried up and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by 99. yeares? What <hi>Quares,</hi> what reluctations <hi>Abraham</hi> had, or whether he
had any or no, is not expressed; but very religious and good men, sometimes, out of
humane infirmities, have them: But then, God brings them quickly about to Christ's
<hi>Veruntamen, Yet not my will, but thine be done;</hi> and he delivers them from the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and brings them to an intire obedience to his will, which is that which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for the next Branch in this part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tu qui vas figuli,</hi> sayes the Apostle; whensoever any disputation against a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement

Rebellion with that, <hi>Tu qui vas figuli,</hi> wilt thou who art but the vessell, dispute with

the potter, that fashioned thee? If <hi>Abraham</hi> had any such doubts, of a <hi>frivolousnesse</hi>
in so base a seale, of an <hi>obscenity</hi> in so foule a seale, of an <hi>incommodiousnesse</hi> in so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
a seale, of a <hi>needlesnesse</hi> in so impertinent a seale; if he had these doubts, no
doubt but his forwardnesse in obeying God, did quickly oppose these reasons to
those, and overcome them: That <hi>that</hi> part of the body is the most rebellious part;
and that therefore, onely that part <hi>Adam</hi> covered, out of shame, for all the other parts
he could rule: <hi>Ad hominis inobedientiam redarguendam, suâ inobedientiâ quodammodo
caro testimonium perhibet,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> to reproach Mans rebellion to <hi>God, God</hi> hath left one part
of Mans body, to rebell against him; for though the seeds of this rebellion be dispersed
through all the body, yet, <hi>In illa parte magis regnat additamentum Leviathan,</hi> sayes
Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> the spawns of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the seed of sinne, the leven of the Devil,
abound and reignes most in that part of the body; it is <hi>sentiva peccati,</hi> saies the same
Father, the <hi>Sewar</hi> of all sinne; not onely because all sinne is deriv'd upon us, by <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
and so implyed, and involv'd in <hi>originall sinne;</hi> but because, almost all other
sinnes have relation to <hi>this:</hi> for, <hi>Gluttony</hi> is a preparation to this sinne in our selves;
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>excesse</hi> is a preparation to it, in others, whom we would enveigle and assure,
by our bravery; <hi>Anger</hi> and malice inclines us to pursue this sinfull and inordinate
love, quarrelsomly, so, as, that <hi>then,</hi> we doe not quarrell for wayes, and walls in the
street, but we quarrell for our way to the Devil; and when we cannot go fast enough
to the Devil, by wantonnesse in the chamber, we will quarrell with him, who hinders
us of our Damnation, and find a way, to go faster in the field, by <hi>Duells,</hi> and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>Murder,</hi> in so foule a cause, as unlawfull lust. In this rebellious part, is the root
of all sinne, and therefore did that part need this stigmaticall marke of Circumcision,
to be imprinted upon it. Besides, (for the Jewes in particular) they were a Nation
prone to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and most, upon this occasion, if they mingled themselves with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of other Nations: And therefore, <hi>Dedit eft signum, ut admoverentnr de genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
pura,</hi> saies Saint <hi>Chrysostome, God</hi> would be at the cost even of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> (which
is the greatest thing that passes between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> next to his <hi>Word)</hi> to defend
them thereby against dangerous alliances, which might turne their hearts from <hi>God;
God</hi> imprinted a marke in that part, to keep them still in mind of that law, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade
them <hi>foraigne Marriages,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Theodor.</note> or any company of <hi>strange Women: Custodia pietati
servandae, ne macularent paternam Nobilitatem,</hi> left they should degenerate from the
Nobility of their race, <hi>God</hi> would have them carry this memoriall about them, in their
flesh. And <hi>God</hi> foresaw that extreme Idolatry, that grosse Idolatry, which that
Nation would come to, and did come to, when <hi>Maachah</hi> the Mother of <hi>Asa</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that Idol,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 15. 13.</note> which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> calls <hi>Belphegor,</hi> and is not fit to be nam'd by us;
and therefore, in foresight of that Idolatry, <hi>God</hi> gave this marke, and this mutilation
upon this part. If <hi>Abraham</hi> were surprized with any suggestions, any <hi>half reasons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this commandement, he might quickly recollect himself, and see, that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
was first, <hi>Signum memorativum, &amp; monimentum isti faederis,</hi> it was a signe of
the <hi>Covenant</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> the <hi>Covenant</hi> was the <hi>Messias,</hi> who being to
come, by a carnall continuance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> race, the signe and seale was convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
placed in that part. And that was, secondly, <hi>Signum representativum,</hi> it represented
<hi>Baptisme, In Christ you are circumcised,</hi> saies the Apostle, <hi>in that you are buried with
him,<note place="margin">Colos. 2.</note> through Baptisme:</hi> And then, that was <hi>Signum Distinctivum;</hi> for, besides that
it kept them from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as the Greeks called all Nations, whom they despised,
<hi>Barbares, Barbarians,</hi> so did the Jewes, <hi>Incircumcisos, Uncircumcised:</hi> And that was
a great threatning in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Ezek. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou shalt die the death of the Uncircumcised;</hi> that is,
without any part in the everlasting promise, and Covenant. But yet, the principall
dignity of this Circumcision, was, that it was <hi>Signum figurativum,</hi> it prefigured,
it directed to that Circumcision of the heart; <hi>Circumcise the foreskin of your heart,
for the Lord your;<note place="margin">Deut. 10.</note> God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords.</hi> And for all the other reasons
that could be assigned, of <hi>Remembrance,</hi> of <hi>Representation,</hi> of <hi>Distinction, Caret ubique
ratione Iudaica carnis Circumcisio,</hi> (sayes <hi>Lactantius) Nisi quod est Circumcisionis figura,
quae est Cor Mundum:</hi> The Jewish Circumcision were an absurd and unreasonable
thing, if it did not intimate and figure the Circumcision of the heart: And that is
our Second part of this Exercise: But before we come to that, we are to say a word
of the fourth branch of this part, That as there is no <hi>Quaere</hi> to be made nor admitted
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:93359:237"/>
against God, (which was our first part) If Man, out of his infirmity, doe fall into <hi>that,</hi>
(which was our Second) God provides and furnishes them with Reasons against
those Reasons, (which was our third.) And then, <hi>God</hi> rewards their fighting of that
battaile, (which is his owne worke) with victories, and crownes, and blessings here;
(which must be our fourth branch.)</p>
                     <p>Of Examples of this,<note place="margin">Retributio.</note> the Booke of <hi>God</hi> is full: but we contract our selves onely to
<hi>that,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> did to <hi>Abraham</hi> at this time, in contemplation of this obedience. We
consider <hi>Abraham</hi> at the end of one Age, he was almost <hi>one hundred, ninety nine
when he was Circumcised;</hi> and now was entring into another age, (for he liv'd <hi>seventy
five yeares</hi> after this:) this therefore was as the Eve of his <hi>New-years-day,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
him thus many <hi>New-years-gifts:</hi> First, he gives him a <hi>new Name;</hi> in which
change of his Name, from <hi>Abram,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> (besides that he was chang'd from
<hi>Pater Magnus,</hi> to <hi>Pater Multudinis,</hi> from the Father of a <hi>great possession</hi> and <hi>family,</hi>
to the Father of <hi>a great successession</hi> and <hi>posterity,</hi> for that diminishes any Greatnesse,
to have no posterity to leave that to) this also arises to be noted, that <hi>Gods</hi> Name
<hi>Iehovah,</hi> having in that two Letters of one kind, two <hi>H H, God</hi> divides with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<hi>God</hi> affords one of those letters to the dignifying of <hi>Abrahams</hi> name, he adds an
<hi>H</hi> of his owne Name to his: <hi>Iehovah</hi> is his <hi>essentiall name;</hi> and in communicating
any beame of that Essence, any letter of that Name, we become <hi>semen Dei,</hi> the seed of
God; and <hi>filii Dei,</hi> the Sonnes of God; and <hi>participes divinae naturae,</hi> Partakers of the
Divine nature; and <hi>idem spiritus cum Domino,</hi> the same spirit with the Lord; and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of that voice; <hi>Ego dixi Dii estis,</hi> I have said you are Gods: If we were carefull
to answer our old name, the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> in our conformity to Christ, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of Christianly duties, that were well, and other Names needed not, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers
unto us: But God does give us <hi>new Names</hi> and <hi>additions</hi> of <hi>Offices,</hi>
and <hi>Titles</hi> in <hi>Schoole,</hi> or <hi>Court,</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as new testimonies of his love, and
<hi>rebukes</hi> of our former negligences, and <hi>Remembrancers</hi> of our present Duties in those
places, and Encouragers to a more carefull proceeding in them. Secondly, God
gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a <hi>new Wife:</hi> in which, the blessing was, that he tooke not from him
that virtuous and obedient Wife which he had before, <hi>Sara,</hi> but now he made her <hi>a
Wife</hi> unto him, and he supplied <hi>that</hi> onely defect which was in her, <hi>Barrennesse,</hi> and
so made her fully a Wife, <hi>a Mother.</hi> Thirdly, he gave him a <hi>new Sonne;</hi> for, God
who purposed to blesse all Nations in <hi>Abraham's</hi> seed, would not onely repaire and
furnish his <hi>old house,</hi> (that is, blesse <hi>Ismael</hi> with temporall blessings) but he would
build him a <hi>new house,</hi> raise him up a new Sonne, <hi>Isaac:</hi> He would not onely fulfill
that petition of <hi>Abrahams, Oh that Ismael might live in thy sight!</hi> not onely preserve
<hi>Ismael,</hi> which signifies, <hi>Exauditionem Domini,</hi> that the Lord had heard that prayer, in
the behalf of <hi>Ismael;</hi> but he would give him an <hi>Isaac,</hi> which signifies, <hi>Risum, laetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
that is, he would give him a new, and true occasion of <hi>joy.</hi> Fourthly, he gave
him a <hi>new promise;</hi> that as in <hi>Adam</hi> he had promised a <hi>Messias, in semine mulieris,
in the seed of the Woman;</hi> now he contracts that promise to <hi>Abraham, in semine tuo,
in thy seed shall all Nations be blessed;</hi> and so makes <hi>Abraham,</hi> not onely a <hi>Partner</hi>
with his other Children, in the Salvation of that <hi>Messias,</hi> but he makes <hi>Abraham a
meanes</hi> to derive that Salvation upon others also, <hi>In semine tuo, thou</hi> shalt not onely
be blessed <hi>in the Seed of the Woman,</hi> but all Nations shall be blessed in <hi>thy seed.</hi> And
lastly, he gives him <hi>a new seale;</hi> not onely <hi>that</hi> seale, under which he was wont to deale
with him, not onely an <hi>inward</hi> seale in his <hi>heart,</hi> but he gives him a new seale, a <hi>visible</hi>
seale, the seale of <hi>Circumcision.</hi> This being then the Dignity of Gods precepts, that
they require a present, and an exact obedience, without any counter-disputing; this
being the infirmity of mans nature, that he is ever ready to object and oppose reasons,
according to flesh and blood, against Gods precepts; this being the overflowing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Gods mercy to his Children, to give them the issue with the tentation; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
above that Reason, victory at last, and alacrity in the performance of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
and this being his infinite bounty, to give us such rewards and retributions for
those victories, of which, onely his goodnesse, and his strength, was the Author in us,
when we doe performe those duties, (all which we have seen in <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience to
a fleshly Circumcision) <hi>that</hi> Circumcision being come to an end in the Circumcision
of <hi>Christ,</hi> performed this day: Let us come to <hi>this</hi> Circumcision, of which, that was
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:93359:237"/>
but a <hi>Figure,</hi> a <hi>Spirituall Circumcision,</hi> the <hi>Circumcision of the heart,</hi> and God shall
give us <hi>new Names</hi> (new Demonstrations, that our names are written in the Booke of
life) and <hi>new Marriages</hi> (refresh his promise in the Prophet, that <hi>he will marry himselfe
to us for ever)</hi> and <hi>new Sonnes,</hi> new <hi>Isaacks</hi> (assurance of <hi>new Ioyes, Essentiall</hi> and <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall,</hi>
in the Kingdome of Heaven, and <hi>inchoative</hi> here in the way) and <hi>new promises,</hi>
and <hi>new seales</hi> (new obligations of his Blessed Spirit) that that <hi>Infallibility</hi> of salvation
which we have conceived, is well grounded.</p>
                     <p>We have done with our first part,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> with that which was occasioned by the <hi>Institution</hi>
of Circumcision in <hi>Abraham;</hi> we passe to that, which is occasioned by the celebrating
of this Day, in which this legall Circumcision taking an end, in the Person of Christ,
we come aptly to consider <hi>Spirituall Circumcision,</hi> by which onely we can be made
conformable to our patterne and example,<note place="margin">Divisio.</note> 
                        <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> In which, we will charge
your memory but with these two considerations; First, <hi>Quid sit, what</hi> this spirituall
Circumcision is, (for in that is implyed the <hi>Quomodo, how</hi> this Circumcision is to be
wrought and effected) And Secondly, the <hi>Ubi, what part</hi> of a Man is to be circumcised
in this Circumcision, for that implyes <hi>Integritatem,</hi> that it is the whole Man in every
part.</p>
                     <p>Briefly then,<note place="margin">Quid.</note> Spirituall Circumcision is to <hi>walke in the spirit; for then,</hi> saies the
Apostle,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh;</hi> no Circumcision can bring us to this,
that we shall not <hi>have</hi> them, for they are borne in us, and they will live in us, whilst we
live; but this is this Circumcision, not to <hi>fulfill</hi> them. Neither was <hi>Abraham's</hi> race,
which was to be circumcised, more numerous, more plentifull, more manifold, then is
this issue of the flesh, <hi>Sinne:</hi> How suddaine, and how large a pedigree! A Child, at
the first minute, when the soule enters, is <hi>as good a Sinner,</hi> that is, as absolute a Sinner,
and hath as good title to Damnation, by being conceived in sinne, as the eldest man;
nay, he is <hi>as old a Sinner</hi> as the eldest man that <hi>is;</hi> nay, as the eldest man that <hi>ever
was;</hi> for, he sinn'd in <hi>Adam,</hi> and, though conceived but this night, sinn'd 6000 yeares
agoe. In young Men, vanity begets excesse; excesse; licentiousnesse; licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
envy, hatred, quarrels, murders; so that here is generation upon generation, here
are risen <hi>Grandfather</hi> and <hi>Great-grandfather-sinnes</hi> quickly, a forward generation: And
then they grow suddainly to be <hi>habits,</hi> and they come to prescribe in us: <hi>Prescription</hi>
is, when there is no memory to the contrary; and we cannot remember when that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
custome begun in us: yea, our sinnes come to be reverenced in us, and by us; our
sinnes contract a majestie, and a state, and they grow <hi>sacred</hi> to us; we dare not trouble
a sinne, we dare not displace it, nor displease it; we dare not dispute the prerogative
of our sinne, but we come to thinke it a kinde of sedition, a kinde of innovation, and a
troubling of the state, if we begin to question our Conscience, or change that security
of sinne which we sleepe in, and we thinke it an easier Reformation to repent a sinne
once a yeare, at <hi>Easter,</hi> when we must needs Receive, then to watch a sinne every
Day.</p>
                     <p>There is scarce any sinne, but that in that place of the Apostle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> it
comes within the name of <hi>workes of the flesh;</hi> for, though he names divers sinnes,
which are litterally and properly workes of the flesh, (as <hi>Adultery, fornication, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wantonnesse)</hi> yet those sinnes that are against a mans owne selfe, (as <hi>Gluttony</hi> and
<hi>Drunkennesse)</hi> those that are against other men, (as <hi>Contentions</hi> and <hi>Murders)</hi> those that
are directed upon <hi>new Gods</hi> (as <hi>Idolatry)</hi> those that are Contracts with the <hi>Devil</hi> (as
<hi>Witchcraft)</hi> those that are offences to the <hi>Church</hi> (as <hi>Heresy)</hi> are all called by Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
in that place, <hi>workes of the flesh:</hi> So that the object of this <hi>Spirituall Circumcision</hi> is all
that concernes the <hi>flesh,</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>man,</hi> or the <hi>Church;</hi> in every
one of these we may finde somewhat to circumcise. But because abundance and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity
begets these workes of the flesh, (for though vve carry the <hi>Serpent</hi> about us,
yet he does not sting, nor hisse, till he be <hi>warme:</hi> As long as poverty and vvretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
freezes our <hi>Concupiscences,</hi> they are not so violent) therefore spirituall Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
is vvell expressed by Saint <hi>Bernard; Moralis Circumcisio est, victum &amp; vestitum
habentem, esse contentum;</hi> A cutting off of these superfluities, is this morall, that is,
this spirituall Circumcision.</p>
                     <p>Novv for some understanding of these superfluities,<note place="margin">Medus.</note> vve must consider, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a poore man, that hath no superfluity in his <hi>estate,</hi> is yet vvastfull in his <hi>minde,</hi>
                        <pb n="462" facs="tcp:93359:238"/>
and puts himselfe to superfluous expences, in his diet, in his apparell, and in all things
of outvvard shevv and ostentation: And on the other side, a covetous man, that hath
a superfluous estate, yet starves him selfe, and denies himselfe all conveniences for this
life: Here's a <hi>superfluous confidence</hi> in the one, that he cannot vvant, though he throvv
avvay money; and here's a <hi>superfluous feare</hi> in the other, that he shall vvant, if he give
himselfe bread; and here's vvorke for this spirituall Circumcision on both sides: But
then the Circumcision is not necessarily to be applied to the riches of the rich man, so
as that every rich man must necessarily cast away his riches (a Godly man may
be rich) nor necessarily applied so to all outward expences of the free and liberall
minded man, as that he should shut up dores, and weare ragges; for, a Godly man
may fare in his diet, and appeare in his garments, according to that <hi>Degree</hi> which he
holds in that state: But the <hi>superfluity</hi> is, and (consequently the <hi>Circumcision</hi> is to be)
in the <hi>Affection,</hi> in our <hi>Confidence,</hi> that whatsoever we wast, by one meanes or other,
we shall have more; or in our <hi>diffidence,</hi> that if we lay not up <hi>all,</hi> we shall never have
<hi>enough.</hi> These be the inordinate affections that must be Circumcised: But how? for
that's intended in this part. We need enquire no farther, for the meanes of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Circumcision, then to the very word which the Holy Ghost hath chosen for
<hi>Circumcision</hi> here, which is <hi>Mul</hi> and <hi>Namal;</hi> for that word hath in other places of
Scripture, <hi>three</hi> significations, that expresse much of the <hi>manner,</hi> how this Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to be wrought: It signifies, <hi>Purgare,</hi> to purge, to discharge the <hi>Conscience:</hi> (and
that is, by <hi>Confession</hi> of our sinnes) It signifies, <hi>Mundare,</hi> to cleanse and purify the
Conscience: (and that is, by <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Detestation</hi> of that sinne) And it signifies,
<hi>Succidere,</hi> to cut downe, to weed and root out whatsoever remaines in our possession,
that is unjustly got (and that is) by <hi>Destitution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the first of these,<note place="margin">Putgare.</note> the <hi>purging;</hi> the proper use and working of <hi>purging
Physick,</hi> is, not that that Medicine pierces into those parts of the Body, where the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
humour lies, and from which parts, Nature, of her selfe, is not able to expell it:
the substance of the Medicine does not goe thither, but the Physick lies still, and draws
those peccant humours together; and being then so come to an unsupportable Masse,
and burden, Nature her selfe, and their owne waight expels them out. Now, that
which <hi>Nature</hi> does in a naturall body, <hi>Grace</hi> does in a regenerate soule, for <hi>Grace</hi> is
the <hi>nature</hi> and the <hi>life</hi> of a regenerate man. As therefore the bodily Physick goes not
to that part of the body that is affected; we must not stay till out <hi>Spirituall Physick</hi>
(the <hi>Iudgements</hi> of God) worke upon that particular sinne, that transports us: That
God should weaken me with a <hi>violent sicknesse,</hi> before I will purge my selfe of my
<hi>licentiousnesse;</hi> Or strike me with poverty, and losse of my stocke, before I will purge
my selfe of my usury; or lay me flat with disgraces and dis-favours of great Persons,
before I will purge my selfe of my <hi>Ambition;</hi> or evict my land from me, by some
<hi>false title,</hi> that God, in his just Judgement, may give way to, to punish my sinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will purge my selfe of my <hi>oppression,</hi> and racking of Tenants: But before these
violent Medicines come, if thou canst take Gods ordinary Physick, administred in the
Word and Sacraments; if thou canst but endure that qualme of calling thy selfe to an
<hi>account,</hi> and an <hi>examination;</hi> if thou canst draw all thy sinnes together, and present
them to thine owne Conscience, <hi>then</hi> their owne waight will finde a vent, and thou
wilt utter them in a full and free <hi>Confession</hi> to thy God, and that is <hi>Circumcision;</hi> as
Circumcision consists in the <hi>purging</hi> of the Conscience, to be mov'd upon hearing the
<hi>Word preached,</hi> and the denouncing of his <hi>Iudgements</hi> in his Ordinance, before those
Judgements surprize thee, to recollect thy sinnes in thine owne <hi>memory,</hi> and poure
them out in a true <hi>Confession.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next step in this Circumcision,<note place="margin">Mundare.</note> (as they are intimated in that word, which the
Holy Ghost uses here) is <hi>Mundare,</hi> to cleanse; and this is a <hi>Contrition</hi> for those sinnes,
and a <hi>Detestation</hi> of those sinnes, which I have thus gathered in my Memory, and
poured out in my Confession. A house is not clean, though all the Dust be swept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
if it lie still in a corner, within Dores; A Conscience is not clean, by having
recollected all her sinnes in the <hi>Memory,</hi> for they may fester there, and <hi>Gangreen</hi> even
to <hi>Desperation,</hi> till she have emptied them in the bottomlesse Sea of the bloud of Christ
Jesus: and the mercy of his Father, by <hi>this</hi> way of <hi>Confession.</hi> But a house is not
clean neither, though the Dust be thrown out, if there hang <hi>Cobwebs</hi> about the Walls,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:93359:238"/>
in how dark corners soever. A Conscience is not clean, though the sins, brought to
our memory by this Examination, be cast upon Gods mercy, and the merits of his
Sonne, by <hi>Confession,</hi> if there remaine in me, but a <hi>Cobweb,</hi> a little, but a sinfull de
light in the <hi>Memory</hi> of those sins, which I had formerly committed. How many men
sinne over the sinnes of their youth again, in their age, by a sinfull <hi>Delight</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
those sinnes, and a sinfull <hi>Desire,</hi> that their Bodies were not past them? How
many men sin over some sins, but <hi>imaginarily,</hi> (and yet <hi>Damnably)</hi> a hundred times,
which they <hi>never sinned actually</hi> at all, by filling their <hi>Imaginations,</hi> with such
thoughts as these, How would I be revenged of such an Enemy, if I were in such a
place of Authority? How easily could I overthrow such a wastfull young Man, and
compasse his Land, if I had but Money, to seed his humours? Those sinnes which
we have never been able to doe <hi>actually,</hi> to the harme of others, we doe as hurtfully to
our owne Souls, by a sinfull <hi>Desire</hi> of them, and a sinfull <hi>Delight</hi> in them. Therefore
is there a <hi>cleansing</hi> required in this Circumcision; such a cleansing as God promises,
<hi>I will cleanse their bloud,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joel 3.</note> that is, the fountaine, the work of all corrupt <hi>Desires,</hi> and
sinfull <hi>Delights.</hi> Now there is no clensing of <hi>our</hi> bloud, but by <hi>his</hi> bloud; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and application of his bloud, is in the seale of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> so that that soule
onely is so clensed, as is required in this spirituall circumcision, that preserves it selfe
alwayes, or returnes speedily, to a disposition of a worthy receiving of that holy and
blessed Sacrament: He that is now in that disposition, as that, in a rectified Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he durst meet his Saviour at that <hi>Table,</hi> and receive him there, (which cannot be
done without <hi>Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Detestation</hi> of former sins) hath admitted this spirituall
Circumcision, so far, as is intended in the second signification of this word, which is,
<hi>To clense.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then there is a third action,<note place="margin">Succidere.</note> which is, <hi>succidere,</hi> to <hi>cut up,</hi> to <hi>root out all,</hi> from
whence this sinne may grow up againe, as the word is used in <hi>Iob 18. His root shall be
dryed beneath, and all his branches shall be cut downe.</hi> In this Circumcision, we must cut
the <hi>root,</hi> the <hi>mother-sinne,</hi> that nourishes all our sinnes, and the <hi>branches</hi> too, that if
one sinne have begot another, there be a fall of all our woods, of our <hi>timber</hi> wood,
(our growne and <hi>habituall</hi> sinnes) and of our <hi>under-woods,</hi> (those <hi>lesser</hi> sinnes which
grow out of them.) It is a <hi>cutting downe,</hi> and a <hi>stubbing up,</hi> which is not done, till we
have shak'd off all, that we have gotten by those Sinnes: It is not the Circumcision of
an <hi>Excessive</hi> use of that sinne, that will serve our turne, but such a Circumcision, as
amounts to an <hi>Excession,</hi> a cutting off the <hi>root,</hi> and <hi>branch,</hi> the <hi>sinne,</hi> and the <hi>fruits,</hi>
the <hi>profits</hi> of that sinne. I must not think to <hi>bribe</hi> God, by giving him some of the
profit of my sinne, to let me enjoy the rest: for, was God a <hi>venturer</hi> with me in my
sinne? Or did God set me to Sea, that is, put me into this world, to see what I could
get by <hi>Usury,</hi> by <hi>Oppression,</hi> by <hi>Extortion,</hi> and then give him a part to <hi>charitable uses?</hi>
As this word signifies <hi>Excedere,</hi> to cut of all that is grown out of sinne, so from this
word <hi>Namal,</hi> comes <hi>Nemâla,</hi> which is <hi>Formicae, an Ant,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from this word, out of this reason, That as an Ant doth gnaw all the Corne it
layes up, upon one side, so that it may never grow againe, so this spirituall Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
must provide, that that sinne take no new roote: but as long as thou makest
profit, or takest pleasure in any thing sinfully gotten, thy sinne growes; so that this
Circumcision is not perfected but by <hi>restitution</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> of all formerly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
These then be all the waies that are presented in these significations and use
of this word,<note place="margin">Ubi</note> which the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> hath chosen here, purging by <hi>Consideration</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,</hi>
clensing by <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Detesting,</hi> preventing of future growth by <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
in <hi>Restoring.</hi> A little remains to be said (though it be also implyed in that which
hath been said) of the <hi>Ubi,</hi> the place where this Circumcision is to be applyed. The
Scripture speaks of <hi>uncircumcised hearts,</hi> and <hi>uncircumcised lips,</hi> and <hi>uncircumcised
eares;</hi> And our <hi>eyes</hi> in looking, and coveting, and our <hi>hands</hi> in reaching to <hi>that</hi> which
is not <hi>ours,</hi> are as farre <hi>uncircumcised</hi> as <hi>eares,</hi> or <hi>lips,</hi> or <hi>hearts:</hi> Therefore we are to
carry this Circumcision all over; we must Circumcise, sayes Saint <hi>Bernard, In carne,
peccatum,</hi> the flesh, the body, the substance of the sinne, <hi>in cute, operimentum,</hi> in the
skin, all covers, and palliations, and disguises, and extenuations of the sinne; and, <hi>in
sanguine incentivum,</hi> in the blood all somentations and provocations to that sinne:
the sinne it self, the <hi>circumstances</hi> of the sinne, the <hi>relapses</hi> to or towards that sin must
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:93359:239"/>
be circumcised: <hi>Iudaeus ut parvulus, congruum accepit mandatum, exiguae Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis,</hi>
saies the same Father, The Jew was but in an infancy, in a minority, and God
did not looke for so strong a proceeding from the <hi>Iew,</hi> as from <hi>us,</hi> but led him by the
armes, by the helpe of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and accordingly required but a <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
in <hi>one</hi> part of the body: but God lookes for more, at the hands of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to whom he hath fully manifested and applied himselfe. As Christ said to the
Jewes, <hi>Except your righteousnesse exeeed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees,
it is nothing:</hi> So except <hi>our</hi> righteousnesse exceed them that exceeded the Scribes, it
is nothing; and therefore, <hi>Toto corpore baptizamur</hi> (saies <hi>Bernard) quia totius hominis
integra Circumcisio;</hi> to shew, that it is the whole man that is to be circumcised; we
are baptized, we are washed all over, (for <hi>so long, even to Bernards time,</hi> it seemes, that
<hi>manner of Baptizing,</hi> by <hi>Immersion</hi> of the whole body, and not by <hi>Aspersion</hi> upon the
face onely, continued in the generall practice of the Church.) So that if it be not an
<hi>entire</hi> Circumcision of the <hi>whole</hi> man, that will fall upon us, which God threatens in
the Prophet,<note place="margin">Jer. 9. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>I will visit all them which are circumcised, with them which are not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised;</hi>
If we circumcise in part, leave some sinnes, and cleave to others, we shall be, in
the sight of God, altogether uncircumcised; <hi>Adam</hi> was not the lesse naked in Gods
sight, for his <hi>Figge-leafe; halfe-repentances</hi> are no repentances; either we are in a
<hi>privation,</hi> or in a <hi>habit;</hi> covered over with righteousnesse, or naked.</p>
                     <p>When therefore the Lord and his Spirit cals thee to this spirituall Circumcision,
remember that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not say when he was call'd, Lord, I have followed thy
voyce, in leaving my Country; Lord, I have built thee an Altar, what needs more
demonstration of my obedience? Say not thou, Lord, I have built an <hi>Hospitall;</hi>
Lord, I have <hi>fed the poore</hi> at <hi>Christmas;</hi> Lord, I have made peace amongst thy people
at home; I have endowed an <hi>Almes-house;</hi> but persevere in doing good <hi>still,</hi> for, God
takes not the Tree, where it <hi>growes,</hi> but where it <hi>fals;</hi> for the most part, the death of a
man is such, as his life was; but certainly the life of a man, that is, his everlasting life,
is such as his death is. Againe, <hi>Abraham</hi> did not say of this, that it was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
in a flight, and frivolous, and uncivill matter; doe not thou say, that it
is an impertinent thing in this spirituall Circumcision, to watch thy eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and all such <hi>indifferent actions,</hi> and to see that all they be done to the glory of
God; for, as the Apostle saies, <hi>That the foolishnesse of God is wiser then the wisdome of
man;</hi> so we may piously say, that the <hi>levity</hi> of God is graver then the <hi>gravity</hi> of all
the Philosophers and Doctors of the world; as we may see in all his <hi>Ceremontall
Lawes,</hi> where the <hi>matter</hi> seemes very light in many places, but yet the <hi>signification</hi> very
important; and therefore apply this Circumcision, even in thy least, and most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
action. So also <hi>Abraham</hi> was not diverted from obeying God, by the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of having <hi>all</hi> his family diseas'd at <hi>once;</hi> he did not say, I am content to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
my Sonne, but would spare my Servants yet, for necessary uses; doe not thou
say, thou art content to circumcise thine eldest Sonne, to abate somewhat of that
sinne which thou beganst with in thy youth, but wouldst faine spare some serviceable
and profitable sinnes for a time, and circumcise them hereafter. To pursue this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>Abraham</hi> did not say, <hi>Cras Domine,</hi> Lord, I will doe all this to morrow; but,
as the Commandement was given in that phrase of expedition, <hi>Circumcidendo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,
In Circumcising thou shalt circumcise;</hi> which denoted a diligent and a present
dispatch; so <hi>Abraham</hi> did dispatch it diligently and presently that day. Doe not
thou say, <hi>Cras Domine,</hi> to morrow, some other day, in the day of mine <hi>age,</hi> or of my
<hi>Death,</hi> or of <hi>affliction</hi> and <hi>tribulation;</hi> I will circumcise all, for age, and sicknesse, and

                        </gap>ibulations, are Circumcisions of themselves; a <hi>Feaver</hi> circumcises thee then, or an
<hi>Apoplexy,</hi> and not thy <hi>Devotion;</hi> and <hi>incapacity</hi> of sinning is not <hi>sanctification:</hi> If
any man put off his Repentance till death, <hi>Fateor non negamus quod petit,</hi> saies Saint
<hi>Augustine,</hi> I dare not deny that man, whatsoever God may be pleased to grant him;
<hi>Sed non presumimus, quod bene erit;</hi> I dare not presume to say, that that man died
well, <hi>Non presumo, non vas fallo, non presumo,</hi> saies that Father, with some vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
I dare not warrant him, let me not deceive you with saying that I dare, for I dare
not: And, Beloved, that is but a suspicious state in any man, in which another Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath just reason to doubt of his salvation, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth shrewdly doubt
of these late Repenters, <hi>Sicut ejus damnatio inoerta, it a remissio dubia;</hi> As I am not sure
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:93359:239"/>
he is damned, so I am not sure he is saved, no more sure of one then of the other. It is
true, we have the example of the <hi>Crucified Thiefe,</hi> but it is but a hard case, when a
<hi>Thiefe</hi> must guide us and be our Example; we suspect <hi>wills</hi> that are made of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
goods in that state, at the last gaspe, and shall we think a Man to be <hi>compos men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
of a perfect understanding for the bequeathing of his Soule at his last gaspe? <hi>non
presumo, non nos fallo, non presumo,</hi> I should deceive you, if I should say it, I dare not say
it, sayes that Father. Come therefore to this Circumcision betimes, come to it, <hi>this
Day,</hi> come <hi>this Minute:</hi> This Day thy Savior was Circumcised in the flesh, for
thee; this Day Circumcise thy heart to him, and all thy <hi>senses,</hi> and all <hi>thy affections.</hi>
It is not an utter <hi>destroying</hi> of thy senses, and of thy affections, that is enjoyned thee;
but,<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 11.</note> as when a Man had taken a beautifull Woman captive in the warres, he was not
bound to kill her, but he must <hi>shave her head, and pare her nailes, and change her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
before he might marry her; so captivate, subdue, change thy affections, and
that's the Destruction which makes up this Circumcision: change thy <hi>choler</hi> into
<hi>Zeale,</hi> change thy <hi>amorousnesse</hi> into <hi>devotion,</hi> change thy <hi>wastfulnesse</hi> into <hi>Almes</hi> to the
poore, and then thou hast circumcised thy <hi>affections,</hi> and mayest retaine them, and
mayest confidently say with the Apostle,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>we are the Circumcision, which worship God in
the spirit, and rejoyce in Christ Iesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</hi> Doe this to
day; as God this day gives thee a <hi>New yeare,</hi> and hath not surpriz'd thee, nor taken
thee away in the sinnes of last yeare; as he gives thee a new yeare, doe thou give him
a <hi>New-years-gift, Cor novum,</hi> a new and a Circumcised heart, and <hi>Canticum novum,</hi>
a new Song, a delight to magnifie his name, and speak of his glory, and declare his
wondrous works to the Sonnes of men, and be assured that whether <hi>I,</hi> or any other of
the same Ministry, shall speake to you from this place, this day twelve month, and
shall aske your consciences then, whether those things which you heard now, have
brought you to this Circumcision, and made you better this yeare than you were the
last, and find you under the same uncircumcision still, be assured that God will not,
God cannot be mocked, but as he wil receive us, with an <hi>Euge bone serve, Well done
my good and faithfull Servant;</hi> so he will say to you, <hi>Perditio tua ex te, Your destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is from your selves:</hi> Enough hath been done for you by me, enough hath been said
to you by my Servants, <hi>Quare moriemini, Why will you die ô house of Israel?</hi> And
after a long despising of his graces, he will come to a finall separation; you shall
come to say, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare,</hi> we will not have Christ Jesus to reigne over us;
and Christ Jesus shall come to say, <hi>Nescio vos,</hi> I know you not, nor whence you are.
<hi>Hodie si vocem ejus,</hi> If you wil heare his voice this day, <hi>Hodie eritis, This day you shall
be with him in Paradise,</hi> and dwell in it all the yeare, and all the yeares of an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

It is not, <hi>Gaudebitis,</hi> you shall Rejoyce, by way of Comfort, but it is, <hi>Gaudete,</hi> Rejoyce,
see that you doe Rejoyce, by way of Commandement, and that shall be our first part.
<hi>Cadit sub praecepto;</hi> It hath the nature of a commandement. Angels passe not from
extreame to extreame, but by the way betweene; Man passes not from the miseries
of this life, to the joyes of Heaven, but by joy in this life too; for he that feeles no joy
here, shall finde none hereafter. And when we passe from the substance of the precept,
to the extent thereof (which will be our second part) from the first word, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> to
the other, <hi>Rejoyce alwaies;</hi> we shall cleave that into two periods, <hi>Gaudete in bonis,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in your prosperitie, and <hi>Gaudete in malis,</hi> Rejoyce in your adversitie too. But
because it is <hi>in sempiternum,</hi> that must be <hi>in sempiterno,</hi> because it is alway, it must be
in him who is alwaies, yesterday and to day, and the same for ever, Joy in God, Joy in
the Holy Ghost, which will be another branch in that second part; of which Joy,
though there be a preparatory, and inchoative participation and possession in this life,
yet the consummation being reserved to our entrance into our Masters Joy, not onely
the Joy which he gives, that's here, but the Joy which he is, that's onely there, we shall
end in that, beyond which none can goe, no not in his thoughts, in some dimme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and in some faint representation of the Joyes of Heaven, and in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation we shall dismisse you.</p>

Joy. And therefore saies <hi>Solomon, It is the joy of the just to doe judgment;</hi> to have lyen
still, and done no wrong occasions, is not this Joy; Joy is not such a Rest, as the Rest of
the Earth, that never mov'd; but as the <hi>Sunne rejoyceth to runne his race, and his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
is unto the end of heaven;</hi> so this Joy is the rest and testimony of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that we have done those things which belong to our calling, that we have mov'd
in our Sphere. For, if men of our profession, whose Function it is, to attend the service
of God, delight our selves in having gathered much in this world; if a Souldier shall
have delighted himselfe, in giving rules of Agriculture, or a Architecture; if a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour
of State, who should assist with his counsell upon present emergencies, delight
himself in writing Books of good counsell for posterity, all this occasions not this joy;
because though there have been motion, and though there be Rest, yet that is not Rest
after the Motion proper to them. A Man that hath been out of his way all the day,
may be glad to find a good Inne at night; but yet 'tis not properly Joy, because he is
never the neerer home. Joy is peace for having done that which we ought to have
done:<note place="margin">Banner <hi>ibid.</hi>
                        </note> And therefore it is well expressed, <hi>Optima conjectura an homo sit in gratia est
gaudere;</hi> The best evidence that a Man is at peace, and in favour with God, is, that he
can rejoyce. To trie whether I be able by Argument and disputation to prove all, that
I believe, or to convince the Adversary, this is <hi>Academia animae,</hi> the soules University,
where some are Graduats, and all are not: To trie whether I be able to endure Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome
for my beliefe, this is <hi>Gehenna animae,</hi> the rack, the torture of the Soule, and
some are able to hold it out, and all are not: But to trie whether I can rejoyce in the
peace, which I have with God, this is but <hi>Catechismus animae,</hi> the Catechisme of the
Soule, and every Man may examine him selfe, and every Man must; for it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<hi>Gaudete semper,</hi> Rejoyce evermore.</p>
                     <p>It is, we cannot say the Office, but the Essence of God to doe good; and when he
does that,<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 9. Zeph. 3. 17.</note> he is said to rejoyce: <hi>The Lord thy God will make thee plenteous;</hi> (there is his
goodnesse) and he will <hi>Rejoyce again over thee for good, as he rejoyced over thy Fathers.</hi>
The Lord will love thee, there is his goodnesse; and rejoyce in thee, and he will rest
in his love. Such a joy as is a rest, a complacency in that good which he hath done,
we see is placed in God himselfe. It is in Angels too: Their office is to minister to
Men, (for by nature they are Spirits, but by office they are Angels) and when they see
so good effect of their service,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 10.</note> as that a Sinner is converted, <hi>There is joy in the presence
of the Angels of God.</hi> Christ himselfe had a spirituall office and employment, <hi>To give
light to the blind, and to inflict blindnesse upon those who thought they saw all.</hi> And when

Saint <hi>Basil</hi> makes a round answer to a short question. <hi>An in Universum ridere
non licet?</hi> May a Man laugh in no case? <hi>Admodum perspicuum est,</hi> It is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that a Man may not, because Christ saies, <hi>Vae vobis,</hi> Wo be unto you that laugh;
And yet Saint <hi>Basil</hi> himselfe in another place sayes (which we are rather to take in
explanation,<note place="margin">Homil. de gratiar. actione.</note> than in contradiction, of himselfe) that that woe of Christ is cast <hi>in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streperum
Sonum, non in sinceram hilaritatem:</hi> upon a dissolute and undecent, and
immoderate laughting, not upon true inward joy, howsoever outwardly expressed.
At the promise of a Son,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Abraham fell on his face and laughed;</hi> a religious Man, and a
grave Man, 100 yeares old, expressed this joy of his heart, by this outward declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Hierome's</hi> Translation reads it, <hi>Risit in Corde,</hi> he laughed within himselfe,
because Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> thought that was a weaknesse, a declination towards unbeliefe,
to laugh at Gods promise, as he thinks <hi>Abraham</hi> did. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is a better Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in his behalf;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Amo.</note> 
                        <hi>Against hope he believed in hope;</hi> he was not weake in faith; he
staggered not at the promise of God, through unbelief. <hi>Quòd risit, non incredulitatis,
sed exultation is indicium fuit,</hi> his laughing was no ebbe of faith, but a flood of joy. It
is not as S.<note place="margin">Hier.</note> 
                        <hi>Hierome</hi> takes it, <hi>Risit in Corde putans celare deum, apertè ridere non ausus;</hi>
                        <pb n="468" facs="tcp:93359:241"/>
he kept-in his laughing, and durst not laugh out; But as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> says well, <hi>Risus
non irrisio diffidentis, sed exultatio gratulantis;</hi> he laughed not in a doubtfull scorne of
Gods promise, but in an overflowing of his own joy: It is well expressed, and, well
concluded,<note place="margin">Rupertus.</note> 
                        <hi>O virum aeterno risu vere dignum, &amp; sempiternae jueunditati bene praeparatum,</hi>
This was good evidence, that he was a man well disposed for the joyes of heaven; that
he could conceive joy in the temporall blessings of God, and that he thought nothing
mis-becomming him, that was an outward declaration of this joy. It is a dangerous
weaknesse, to forbeare outward declarations of our sense of Gods goodnesse, for feare
of mis-interpretations; to smother our present thankfulnesse, for fear that some should
say it was a levity to thank God so soon, till God had done the whole work. For God
does sometimes leave half his work undone, because he was not thanked for it. When
<hi>David danced and leaped,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 14.</note> and shouted before the Arke;</hi> if he laughed too, it mis-became
him not. Not to feele joy is an argument against religious tendernesse, not to show that
joy, is an argument against thankfulnesse of the heart: that is a stupidity, this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
<hi>A merry heart maketh a cheerfull countenance.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 13.</note> If it be within, it will be without

                     </p>
                     <p>Joy for Gods blessings to us, joy for Gods glory to himself, may come <hi>ad Risum,</hi>
and farther: Not onely <hi>ad Ridendum,</hi> but <hi>ad Irridendum,</hi> not onely to laugh in our own
prosperity, but to laugh them to scorne that would have impeached it. They are put
both together in God himself, <hi>Ridebo,</hi> and <hi>Irridebo, I will laugh at your calamities, and
I will mock when your feare cometh.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 26.</note> And this being in that place intended of God, is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the person of Wisdome; It mis-becomes not wisdome and gravity to laugh in

when it is carried so high as to <hi>the Kings of the Earth,<note place="margin">Psal 2. 2.</note> and the Rulers that take
counsell against the Lord, and against his Anoynted,</hi> we may come <hi>Ad Gaudium,</hi> to joy in
Gods goodnesse, but because their place, and persons are sacred, we leave the <hi>Ridere</hi>
and the <hi>Irridere</hi> to God:<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> who says, ver. 4. <hi>That he will laugh at them, and hold them in
derision.</hi> But at lower instruments, lower persons may laugh, when they fill the world
with the Doctrine of killing of Kings, and meane that that should animate men against
such Kings as they call Heretiques, and then finde in experience that this hath wrought
onely to the killing of Kings of their own Religion, we lament justly the event, but yet
we forbeare our <hi>Ridere</hi> and our <hi>Irridere,</hi> at the crossing and the frustrating of their plots
and practises. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Army was drowned, <hi>Et Cecinit Moses, Moses</hi> sung, <hi>Sisera</hi> was
slaine <hi>Et Cecinit Deborah, Deborah</hi> sung. Thus in the disappointing of Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Gods servants come to outward manifest signes of joy. Not by a libellous
and scurrill prophanation of persons that are sacred, but in fitting Psalmes and
Sermons, and Prayers, and publique Writings to the occasion, to proceed to a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere</hi>
and <hi>Irridere,</hi> and as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> reades that place of the <hi>Proverbs, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perridere,</hi>
to laugh Gods Enemies into a confusion to see their Plots so often,
so often, so often frustrated. For so farre extends <hi>Gaudete, Rejoyce evermore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Joy then, and cheerefulnesse, is <hi>Sub praecepto,</hi> it hath the nature of a commandment,
and so he departs from a commandment that departs, and abandons himself into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
sadnesse.<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 5.</note> And therefore <hi>David</hi> chides his soule, <hi>Why art thou cast down, O my soul,
why art thou disquiesed within me?</hi> And though he come after to dispute against this sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the soul, which he had let in, <hi>Hope yet in God, and yet the Lord will command his
loving kindnesse, and my prayer shall be unto the God of my life,</hi> yet he could not put it off,
but he imagines that he heares his enemies say, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> and when he hath
wrestled himself weary, he falls back again in the last verse, to his first faintnesse, <hi>Why art
thou cast down, O my soule, why art thou disquieted within me?</hi> For, <hi>As he that taketh away
a garment in cold weather,<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 20.</note> so is he that singeth Songs to a heavy heart:</hi> That heavinesse
makes him uncapable of Naturall, of Morall, of Civill, of Spirituall comforts,
charme the Charmer never so wisely. <hi>Heli</hi> heard that the Battell was lost, and
that his Sonnes were slaine, and admitted so much sorrow for those, that when
the last was added,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>The Arke was taken by the Enemy,</hi> he was too weake for that,
and fell down and brake his neck. It was his daughter in Lawes case too; shee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
her soul with sadnesse for her husbands death, and her fathers death, and when
the report of the Arke came, she fell into labour and died; and though the women told
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:93359:241"/>
her, <hi>Feare not, thou hast born a Sonne, yet shee answered not.</hi> Though the Arke of God,
the worship of his Name, bee at any time transferred from where it was, despaire not
thou of Gods reducing it; for this despairing of others, may bring thee to despaire in
some accident to thy self: Accustome thy selfe to keepe up the consideration of Gods
mercy at the highest, lodge not a sad suspition in any publique, in any private businesse,
that Gods powerfull mercy can goe but thus farre: hee that determineth Gods
Power and his Mercy, and faith here it must end, is as much an Atheist, as hee that
denieth it altogether. The Key of <hi>David</hi> openeth and no man shutteth; The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Comfort shineth upon us, and would not be blown out. Monasterie, and Ermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage,

                        </hi> with those
plurall words <hi>Concio, Coetus, Ecclesia, Synagoga &amp; Congregatio,</hi> in which words God
delivereth himselfe to us. A Church is a Company, Religion is Religation, a bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men together in one manner of Worship; and Worship is an exteriour service;
and that exteriour service is the <hi>Venite exultemus,</hi> to come and rejoyce in the presence
of God.</p>
                     <p>If in any of these wayes God cast a Cloud upon our former joyes, yet to receive good
at Gods hand, and not to receive evill; to rejoice in the calme, and not in the storme;
this is to breake at least halfe of the Commandement, which is, <hi>Gaudete semper.</hi> And
so from the first part, which is the substance which we have passed by these steps, That
this rejoycing hath the nature of a Commandement, it must bee maintained, And that
inward joy must be outwardly expressed, even to the disgrace and confusion of Gods
enemies, and to the upholding of a joyfull constancy in our selves: We passe now to the
extent of the Commandement, <hi>Gaude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Did God mean that we should rejoyce alwayes;<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> when he made sixe dayes for labour,
and but one for rest?<note place="margin">Semper.</note> Certainly he did. <hi>Sixe dayes we are to labour, and to doe all that we
have to doe:</hi> And part of that which we have to doe, is to rejoyce in our labour. <hi>Adam</hi>
in the state of Innocency had abundant occasion of continuall rejoycing; but yet even
in that joyfull state he was <hi>to labour,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15. 3. 19.</note> to dresse and to keep the Garden.</hi> After the fall, when
God made the labour of man more heavie <hi>in sudore vultus, that he should not eat, but in
the sweat of his browe,</hi> yet God gave him not that penalty, that occasion of sadnesse, till
he had first imprinted the roote of true Joy, the promise of a <hi>Messias;</hi> that promise he
made before he came to denounce the penalty, first came the <hi>Ipse conteret,</hi> and then in
<hi>sudore vultus:</hi> upon those words, <hi>Thou shalt eat the labour of thy hand; Debuit dicere fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,
non laborem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal 128. 2. August.</note> saith <hi>Augustine, David</hi> should have said, he shall eate the fruit, not the
labour of his hands. <hi>Sed ipsi labores non sunt sine gaudio,</hi> but the very labours, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
afflictions of good men, have joy in them. <hi>Si labor potest manducari &amp; jucundari,
manducatus fructus laboris qualis erit?</hi> And if labour it self, affliction it self, minister
Joy, what a manner, what a measure of joy is in the full possession thereof in Heaven?
And as the consideration of the words immediately after the Text, hath made more
then one of the Fathers say, <hi>Etiam Somnia justorum preces sunt,</hi> Even the sleep of the
righteous is a service to God, and their very Dreams are Prayers and Meditations, so
much more properly, may wee call the sleep, and the bodily rest, nay, the bodily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the righteous, joye, rejoycing. So that neither weeke day, nor Sabbath day
nor night, labour nor rest interrupteth this continuall Joy: Wee may, wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
evermore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gaudete in bonis,</hi> Rejoyce when God giveth you the good things of this world;
First,<note place="margin">In bonis Temporalibus.</note> in <hi>Temporalibus</hi> when God giveth you the good Temporall things of this
world. <hi>Gaudete in Terra,</hi> Rejoyce that God hath placed you in so fertill, in so fruitfull
a Land. <hi>Gaudete in pace,</hi> Rejoyce that God hath afforded you peace to till the Land,
<hi>Gaudete de Temporibus,</hi> Rejoyce that God giveth good seasons, that the Earth may give
her increase, and that Man may ioy in the increase of the Earth: And <hi>Gaudete de amicitiis,</hi>
Rejoyce that God giveth you friendship with such Nations, as may take of your super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities,
and return things necessary to you. There is a joy required for Temporall
things; for hee that is not joyfull in a benefit, is not thankefull. Next to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
assertion (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth it) That God made any man to
to damn him, it is the perversest assertion, That God gives man temporall things to
ensnare him.<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 20.</note> Was that Gods primary intention in prospering <hi>Noahs</hi> Vineyard, That
<hi>Noah</hi> should be drunken? God forbid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="470" facs="tcp:93359:242"/>
Doth God give any man honour or place, <hi>Vt glorietur in malo, qui potens est,</hi> that
his power might be an occasion of mischief and oppression? God forbid. God made
light at first; but wee know not what that light was: but God gathered all light
into the Sun, and all the world sees it. God infuses grace and spirituall blessings into
a mans heart, and no man sees that, but the Spirit that is in that man; but the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the great Seale, that he pleads in the Eye of the world, is Gods temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
When <hi>Assuerus</hi> put the Royall Vesture and Ring, and Crown upon <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
it was to shew that hee was in his favour; in the same intention proceeds God
too, when he gives riches, or honour, or favour, or command; hee would have that
soul rejoyce in these, as in testimonies of his favour. God loves <hi>hilarem datorem,</hi> a
cheerfull giver, but he that is not a cheerfull receiver, is a worse natur'd man, and more
dishonours, nay, reproaches his benefactor. They then disobey this Commandment,
of rejoycing in temporall things, that employ not their industry, that use not all good
means to attaine them. Every man is therefore planted in the world, that hee may
grow in the world, and as venomous hearbs delight in the shade, so a sullen retiring ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
a murmuring and venomous disposition; To contemn Gods temporall blessings,
or to neglect or undervalue those instruments, those persons, by whom God sheds such
blessings upon us, is to break that branch of this Commandement <hi>Gaudete semper,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
evermore; for he does not rejoyce in <hi>bonis temporalibus.</hi> So is it also, as not to
seek them before, so not to use them when we have them. When in a feare of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poore, makes us think God to be poor too, that if we spend this, God can give
us no more, when for feare of lacking at our end, we lack all the way, when we abound
and yet will pay no debts, not to our own bellies, our own backs, our own respect, and
the decency that belongs to our rank, these men so sordid, so penurious, &amp; suspitious
of Gods Providence, breake this branch of this Commandement too, because they
doe not rejoyce in <hi>bonis temporalibus.</hi> And as the not-seeker, and the not-user, so
the abuser of these temporall blessings is in the same transgression. Hee that thinkes
all the world as one Jewell, and himselfe the Cabinet, that all was made for him,
and hee for none, forgets his owne office, his Stewardship, by which he is enabled and
bound to the necessities of others: to collect, hee that seeks not, hee that denies all
to himself, hee that denies all but himself, break this branch, for they doe not rejoyce
in <hi>bonis temporalibus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This we must doe;<note place="margin">In spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus.</note> but in <hi>bonis spiritualibus,</hi> in the spirituall good things of this
world, much more we call those the spirituall good things of this world, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
our devotion here, and consequently our salvation hereafter. The rituall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall,
the outward worship of God, the places, the times, the manner of meetings,
which are in the disposition of Christian Princes, and by their favours of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which are in their government: and not to rejoyce in the peacefull exercise of those
spirituall helps, not to be glad of them, is a transgression. Now the Prophet expresses
this rejoycing thus, <hi>Venite exultemus,</hi> let us come and rejoyce. We must doe both. And
therefore they who out of a thraldome to another Church abstaine from these places
of these exercises, that doe not come, or if they doe come, doe not rejoyce, but
though they be here brought by necessity of law, or of observation, yet had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were in another Chappell, or that another kinde of service then in this: and
they also who abstain out of imaginary defects in this church, &amp; think they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<hi>Davids De profundis,</hi> they cannot call upon God out of the depth, except it be in
a Conventicle in a cellar,<note place="margin">Excles. 5. 8.</note> nor acknowledge <hi>Solomons Excelsis Excelsior,</hi> that God is
higher then the highest, except it be in a Conventicle in a garret, &amp; when they are here
wink at the ornaments, &amp; stop their ears at the musique of the Church, in which manner
she hath always expressed her rejoycing in those helps of devotion; or if there bee a
third sort who abstain, because they may not be here at so much case, and so much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
as at their own houses, all these are under this transgression. Are they in the
Kings house at so much liberty as in their own? and is not this the King of Kings house?
Or have they seene the King in his owne house, use that liberty to cover himselfe in
his ordinary manner of covering, at any part of Divine Service? Every Preacher
will look, and justly, to have the Congregation uncovered at the reading of his Text:
and is not the reading of the Lesson, at time of Prayer, the same Word of the same God,
to be received with the same reverence? The service of God is one entire thing; and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:93359:242"/>
though we celebrate some parts with more, or with lesse reverence, some kneeling, some
standing, yet if we afford it no reverence, we make that no patr of Gods service. And
therefore I must humbly intreat them, who make this Quire the place of their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to testifie their devotion by more outward reverence there; wee know our parts in
this place, and we doe them; why any stranger should think himself more priviledged in
this part of Gods House, then we, I know not. I presume no man will mis-interpret
this that I say here now; nor, if this may not prevaile, mis-interpret the service of our
Officers, if their continuing in that unreverent manner give our Officers occasion to
warn them of that personally in the place, whensoever they see them stray into that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely
negligence. They should not blame me now, they must not blame them then,
when they call upon them for this reverence in this Quire; neither truly can there be
any greater injustice, then when they who will not do their duties, blame others for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theirs.</p>
                     <p>But that we are bound to a thankfull rejoycing in all that falls well to us,<note place="margin">In malis.</note> 
                        <hi>In bonis,</hi>
admits lesse doubt, and therefore requires lesse proof: But the <hi>semper</hi> of our Text
extends farther, <hi>Gandete in malis,</hi> we doe not rejoyce always, except we rejoyce in evill
days, in all our crosses and calamities. Now, if we be not affected with Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
if we conceive not a sorrow for them, or the cause of them, our sins, God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry;
will he be angry too, if we be not glad of them, if we doe not rejoyce in them?
Can this sorrow and this joy consist together? very well. The School in the mouth of
<hi>Aquinas</hi> gives instances;<note place="margin">Aquin. 3. 84. 9. 2.</note> If an Innocent man be condemned, <hi>Simul placet ejus justitia,
&amp; displices afflictio,</hi> I congratulate his innocency, and I condole his death both at once.
So <hi>Displicet mihi quod peccavi, &amp; placet quod displicet;</hi> I am very sorry that I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but yet I am glad that I am sorry. So that, <hi>Ipsatristitia materia gaudii;</hi> Some sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is so far from excluding joy,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> as that naturally it produces it. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it with this advice, <hi>Semper doleat poenitens,</hi> Let him who hath sinned always lament;
But then where is the <hi>Gaudete semper?</hi> he tels us too, <hi>Semper gaudeat de dolore,</hi> Let him
always rejoyce,<note place="margin">Basil.</note> that God hath opened him a way to mercy, by sorrow. <hi>Lacrymae Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
quoddam sunt &amp; foenus, quibus increscit gaudium;</hi> Sorrow is our Seminary, from
whence we are transplanted into a larger Orchard, into the dilatation of the heart, Joy;
sorrow, says he, <hi>Seminium est, &amp; foenus est;</hi> It is our interest, our use; And if we have
sorrow upon sorrow, it is use upon use, it doubles the principall, which is joy, the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<hi>Cordae cum distenduntur,</hi> it is S. <hi>Augustines</hi> musicall comparison, when the strings of
an instrument are set up, the musicall sound is the clearer; if a mans sinew be stretcht
upon the rack, his joy is not the lesse perfect. Not that a man must seek out occasion of
sorrow; provoke the Magistrate by seditious intemperance, and call it zeal; or macerate
the body with fastings,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> or mangle it with whippings, and call that merit; <hi>Non ut quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
materiam quam non habent, sed at inveniant cam quam nescientes habent;</hi> This is the
way of joy, not to seek occasions of sorrow, which they have not, but to finde out those
which they have, and know not; that is, their secret sins, the causes of Gods judgements
in themselves. To discern that that correction that is upon me, is from God, and not a
naturall accident, this is a beam of joy, for I see that he would cure me, though by coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sives.
To discern that God is not unjust, nor cruell, and therefore it is something in me,
and not in him, that brings it to this sharpnesse, this is a beam of joy too; for I see how
to discharge God, and to glorifie him, and how to accuse my self; and that is a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of repentance.</p>
                     <p>But to perfect my repentance,<note place="margin">A sensis.</note>

de dolore,</hi> It is not enough to come to a sorrow in my sin, that may flow out into despair,
but I must come to a joy in my sorrow, for that fixes me upon the application of Christ,
and such a joy a man must suscitate and awaken in himselfe by these steps, <hi>In malis tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralibus,</hi>
in all worldly crosses; Else he does not <hi>Gaudere semper.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>In malis Spiritualibus,</hi> in Spirituall afflictions too.
When I fall into new sorrow, after my former joy, relapse into those sins which I have
repented (and beloved, the dangerous falling in any man, is to fall backward, he that
fals forward, hath his eys to help him, and his hands to help him, but he that fals back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
lacks much) yet even out of these relapses we must finde joy too. For when Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> says,<note place="margin">Iames 1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Count it all joy when you fall into divers tentations,</hi> as he speaks of all joy, so
he intends, or may justly be extended to all tentations, not onely tentations, that is, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:93359:243"/>
when God proves a man by affliction, where morall constancy is exercised, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in triall of religious constancy; in tentations to sin, still there is fresh occasion of
joy in discerning Gods deliverance from the falling into the sinne, or from lying in the
sinne.<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> 
                        <hi>Ipsa tentatio sal animae,</hi> as salt preserves flesh, so tentations preserve the Soule:
not the sinning, but the discerning that it is, nay that that was a tentation to sinne,
preserves the soule. And therefore, he calls <hi>tentationes custodes;</hi> he makes even the
evill Angells, our Guardians, our Tutelar Angells, because by their tentations they
bring us up in the feare of God, and in the ways of joy. And therefore though
it be a joyfull thing to have overcome a tentation, yet determine not your Joy in
that; that if that tentation had overcome you, you might have no more Joy, but
(as Christ says) <hi>In this rejoyce not,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 10. 20.</note> that is, not onely in this, <hi>that the Spirits are subject
to you, but rather rejoyce that your names are written in heaven.</hi> Rejoyce not in this, that is,
determine not, conclude not your ioy in this, that you have overcome that tentation,
but rather in this; that God does not forsake you after a sinne, nor after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse
into sinne; but manifests your election by continuall returning to you:
But that this may bee the joy of the text, true Joy, not a joy that induces pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
for that will faile, that it may bee <hi>Semper,</hi> it must bee <hi>in Sempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno,</hi> a Joy
rightly conceived, and rightly placed. <hi>Gaudium in Domino:</hi> and that is our next
step.</p>
                     <p>Rejoyce in the Lord always, says the Apostle; and left it should admit any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he repeates it,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Iterum dico gaudete, Againe I say rejoyce,</hi> But still in the Lord. For,
<hi>Quasi locus quidam, iustorum capax est Dominum:</hi> though God be in no place, God is
the place, in whom all good men are. God is the Court of every just King: God is
the Church of every holy Priest: God is the field of every valiant man; and the bed
of every sickly man: whatsoever is done <hi>in Domino,</hi> in the Lord, is done at home in
the right place.<note place="margin">Chrysoft.</note> He that is settled in God, centred in God, <hi>Laetitiae fontem, voluptatis

sicknesse take away the joy of that? Or what is health, if imprisonment take away the
joy of that? Or what is liberty, if poverty take away the joy of that? but he hath joy,
and not a Cistern but a fountain, the fountaine of joy, that rejoyces in God: He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

<hi>Flores,</hi> flowers of joy, and have no fruit, a man may have some fruit, and not enough,
but if he have joy in God, he hath <hi>radicem voluptatis;</hi> if we may dare to translate it so,
(and in a spirituall sense we may) it is a voluptuous thing to reioyce in God. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing

                        <hi>Rara

where is that joy now, is there a <hi>Semper</hi> in that? Call it joy to have had him whom
thou hatest, in thine hands or under thy feet, what ignoble disguises to that man, what
servile observations of some greater, then either you, or he, did that cost you before
you brought him into your power? and where is that joy, if a Funerall or a bloudy
conscience benight it? <hi>Currus Domini,</hi> says <hi>David, the Chariots of the Lord are twenty

farre from being made none, that it shall bee made better, better here, but
