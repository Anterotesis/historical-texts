            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a mongrell race of <hi>Mercuries</hi> lately sprung up,
but I claime no <hi>acquaintance</hi> with them, much lesse any
<hi>Kinred.</hi> They have commonly but one weeks time for their
conception and birth; and then are they but like those <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meran</hi>
creatures, which <hi>Pliny</hi> speakes of, that are borne in
the morning, grow up till noon, and perish the same night: I
hope to be longer liv'd then so, because I was longer a get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
there was more time and matter went to my Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>There is a Tale how the true <hi>Mercury</hi> indeed, descended
once in a disguise, to see how he was esteem'd on earth; and
entring one day into a Painters shop, he found there divers
Pictures of <hi>Apollo, Jupiter, Mars,</hi> with others, and spying
his owne hanging in a corner hard by he asked what the price
of that Pourtrait might be, The Painter answered, that if
he bought any of the rest, he would give him that into the
bargaine for nothing: <hi>Mercury</hi> hereupon shaking his white
<hi>Caducean,</hi> flung out in indignation, and flew up to Heaven.
Should <hi>Mercury</hi> chance to descend now from his spheare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
think he would be much more offended to find himself perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by every petty impertinent Pamphleter; yet I beleeve he
would not take it ill that <hi>Aulicus</hi> assumes his shape, nor that
the <hi>Harp,</hi> who owes her first invention to him, should be made
now his crest.</p>

            <p>THere is not any thing since these wars
begun, whereof there hath been more
advantage made, to traduce and blemish His
Majesties actions, to alienate and imbitter
the affections of his people, to incite them
to armes, and enharden them in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
than of the <hi>Irish</hi> affaires; whether one
cast his eyes upon the beginning and proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of that warre (which some by a most
mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous impudence would patronize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Majesties) or upon the late <hi>Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi>
and the transport of Auxiliaries
since from thence. There are some that
in broken peeces have written of all three,
but not in one entire discourse, as this is:
nor hath any hitherto hit upon those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and inferences that shall be displayed
herein.</p>
            <p>But he who adventures to judge of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of State, specially of traverses of
warre, as of Pacifications, of Truces, Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53765:4"/>
of Armes, Parlies, and such like,
must well observe the quality of the times,
the successe and circumstance of matters
past, the posture and pressure of things
present (and upon the <hi>Place</hi>) the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or <hi>enforcement</hi> of causes, the gaining
of time, the necessity of preventing greater
mischiefes (whereunto true policy <hi>prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
like hath alwayes an eye) with other
advantages. The late <hi>Cessation</hi> of Armes
in <hi>Ireland</hi> was an affaire of this nature; a
true Act of State, and of as high a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
as could be: Which Cessation is
now become the <hi>common Subject</hi> of every
mans discourse, or rather the discourse of
every <hi>common Subject</hi> all the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
over: And not onely the subject
of their discourse, but of their <hi>censure</hi> also;
nor of their censure onely, but of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and obloquy. For the World is
come now to that passe, that the Foot must
judge the Head, the very <hi>Cobler</hi> must pry
into the Cabinet Counsels of his <hi>King;</hi>

politician; such a fond irregular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
reignes generally of late yeeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the English Nation.</p>
            <p>Now the Designe of this small discourse,
though the Subject require a farre greater
volume, is, to vindicate His Majesties most
pious intentions in condescending to this
late suspension of Arms in His Kingdome
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> and to make it appeare to any
rationall ingenious capacity, (not pre-oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
or purblinded with passion) that
there was more of honour and necessity,
more of prudence and piety in the said
Cessation, than there was either in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification</hi>
or <hi>Peace</hi> that was made with the
Scot.</p>
            <p>But to proceed herein the more metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically,
I will lay downe, first,</p>
            <p>The reall and true radicall causes of the
late two-yeers Irish <hi>Insurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the course His Majesty used
to suppresse it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, those indispensable impulsive
reasons and invincible necessity which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
His Majesty to condescend to a
Cessation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53765:5"/>
Touching the grounds of the said Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
we may remember when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
out of a pious designe (as His <hi>late
Majesty</hi> also had) to settle an Uniformity
of serving God in all his three Kingdomes,
sent our <hi>Liturgie</hi> to his Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
some of that Nation made such an
advantage hereof, that though it was a
thing onely <hi>recommended,</hi> not <hi>commanded</hi> or
pressed upon them, and so cald in suddenly
againe by a most gracious Proclamation,
accompanied with a generall pardon: Yet
they would not rest there, but they would
take the opportunity hereby to demolish
Bishops, and the whole Hierarchy of the
Church (which was no grievance at all till
then) To which end, they put themselves
in actuall Arms, and obtained at last what
they listed; which they had not dared to
have done, had they not been sure to have
as good friends in <hi>England</hi> as they had in
<hi>Scotland</hi> (as <hi>Lesley</hi> himselfe confessed to Sir
<hi>William Berkley</hi> at <hi>Newcastle</hi>) for some of
the chiefest Inconformists here, had not
onely intelligence with them, but had been
of their Cabinet-counsels in moulding the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53765:5"/>
Plot: though some would east this war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the French Cardinall, to vindicate the
invasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we made upon <hi>his</hi> Masters domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Iste of <hi>Rets;</hi> as also for some adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the English use to do the Spaniard in
transporting his Treasure to Dunkerk, with
other offices. Others would cast it upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
<hi>Jesuit,</hi> that he should project it first, to
force His Majesty to have recourse to his
Roman Catholick Subjects for ayd, that so
they might, by such <hi>Supererogatory</hi> service in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves the more into his favour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> hearing how well their next
Neighbours had sped by way of Arms, it fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them full of thoughts &amp; apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of
feare &amp; jealousie, that the <hi>Scot</hi> would prove
more powerfull hereby, and consequently
more able to do them hurt, and to attempt
wayes to restrain them of that connivency,
which they were allowed in poynt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
Now there is no Nation upon earth
that the Irish hate in that perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; with a
greater Antipathy, than the <hi>Scot,</hi> or from
whom they conceive greater danger: For
whereas they have an old prophesie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, which one shall heare up and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53765:6"/>
downe in every mouth, <hi>That the day will
come when the Irish shall weep upon English
mens graves,</hi> They feare that this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
will be verified and fulfilled in the <hi>Scot,</hi>
above any other Nation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the <hi>Irish</hi> entred into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that <hi>They</hi> also had sundry grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and grounds of complaint, both touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their estates and consciences, which they
pretended to be farre greater than those of
the <hi>Scots.</hi> For they fell to think, that if the
Scot was suffered to introduce a <hi>new</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
it was reason they should not be so
pinched in the exercise of their <hi>old,</hi> which
they glory never to have altered. And for
temporall matters (wherein the <hi>Scot</hi> had no
grievance at all to speak of) the new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which had been lately afoot, to be
made in <hi>Conaught</hi> and other places; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
lands and defective titles which were
daily found out; the new customes which
were imposed, and the incapacity they had
to any preferment or office in Church and
State (with o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her things) they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived these
to be grievances of a farre greater nature,
and that deserved redresse much more than
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53765:6"/>
any the <hi>Scot</hi> had. To this end, they sent
over Commissioners to attend this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England,</hi> with certaine Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but those Commissioners were dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hence with a short and unsavoury an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which bred worse blood in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than was formerly gathered; and this,
with that leading case of the <hi>Scot,</hi> may be
said to be the first incitements that made
them rise.</p>
            <p>In the course of humane actions, we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find it to be a true rule, <hi>Exempla movent,
Examples move,</hi> and make strong impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the fancy; <hi>precepts</hi> are not so
powerfull as <hi>precedents.</hi> The said example
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wrought wonderfully upon
the imagination of the Irish, and filled
them (as I touched before) with thoughts
of emulation, that <hi>They</hi> deserved altogether
to have as good usage as the <hi>Scot,</hi> their
Country being farre more beneficiall, and
consequently, more importing the English
Nation. But these were but confused im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
notions, which began to receive
more vigour and forme after the death of
the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who had kept them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53765:7"/>
under so exact an obedience, though some
censure him to have screwed up the strings
of the <hi>Harp</hi> too high; insomuch that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off of the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> head, may
be said to be the second incitement to the
<hi>heads</hi> of that insurrection to stirre.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto, that the <hi>Irish</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
with what acrimony the Roman
Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> were proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
since the sitting of our Parliament,
and what further designes were afoot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and not onely against them,
but for ranversing the Protestant Religion
it selfe, as it is now practised (which some
shallow-braind Scismaticks doe throw into
the same scales with Popery.) They
thought it was high time for them to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
what should become of <hi>Them,</hi> &amp; how
they should be handled in poynt of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
when a new Deputy of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
election (<hi>approbation</hi> at least) should
come over. Therefore they fell to consult
of some meanes of timely prevention:
And this was another motive (and it was
a shrewd one) which pusht on the <hi>Irish</hi> to
take up Armes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53765:7"/>
Lastly, that Army of 8000. men, which
the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> had raised to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to <hi>England</hi> for suppressing the Scot,
being by the advice of our Parliament here,
disbanded; the Country was annoyed by
some of those stragling Souldiers, as not one
in twenty of the Irish, will from the sword
to the spade, or from the pike to the plough
againe. Therefore the two Marquesses that
were Ambassadours here, then for <hi>Spaine,</hi>
having propounded to have some numbers
of those disbanded forces, for the service of
their Master; His Majesty by the mature
advice of his privy Counsell, to occurre the
mischiefs that might arise to his Kingdom of
<hi>Ireland</hi> by those loose casheered Souldiers,
yeelded to the Ambassadours motion, who
sent notice here of to <hi>Spaine</hi> accordingly, and
so provided shipping for their transport, and
impressed mony to advance the businesse;
but as they were in the heat of that work,
His Majesty being then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there was
a sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stop made of those promised troops,
who had depended long upon the Spaniards
service, as the Spaniard had done on theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53765:8"/>
And this was the last, though not the least
fatall cause of that horrid insurrection: All
which particulars well considered, it had been
no hard matter to have been a Prophet, and
standing upon the top of <hi>Holy-Head,</hi> to have
foreseen those black clouds engendring in the
Irish aire, which broke out afterwards into
such fearfull tempests of blood.</p>
            <p>Out of these premises, it is easie for any
common understanding, not transported
with passion and private interest, to draw
this conclusion. That <hi>They</hi> who complied
with the Scot in his insurrection; <hi>They</hi> who
dismissed the Irish Commissioners with such
a short <hi>unpolitick</hi> answer, <hi>They</hi> who took off
the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> head, and delayed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the dispatching of the Earle of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester;
They</hi> who hindered those disbanded
troops in <hi>Ireland</hi> to goe for <hi>Spaine,</hi> may be
justly said to have bin the true causes of the
late insurrection of the Irish; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it is easie to know upon the account
of whose soules must be laid the blood of
those hundred and odde thousands poore
Christians, who perished in that war; so that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53765:8"/>
had it been possible to have brought over
their bodies unputrified to <hi>England,</hi> and to
have cast them at the doores, and in the
presence of some men I beleeve they would
have gushed out afresh into blood, for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the true murtherers.</p>
            <p>The grounds of this insurrection being
thus discovered, let us examine what meanes
His Majesty used for the suppression of it.
He made his addresse presently to his great
Counsell, the English Parliament then assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors
did seldome use to doe, but onely to
their Privy Counsell in such cases, who had
the discussing and transacting of all forreigne
affaires; for in mannaging matters of State,
specially those of war, which must be carried
with all the secrecy that may be, <hi>Trop grand
nombre, est encombre,</hi> as the Frenchman saith,
too great a number of Counsellours may be
an incumber, and expose their results and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
to discovery and other disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whereas in military proceedings the work
should be afoot before the Counsels be
blazed abroad. Well, His Majesty trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53765:9"/>
this businesse to the Parliament of
<hi>England,</hi> who totally undertaking it, and
wedding as it were the quarrell (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
they did that of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by solemne vote; the like was done by
the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> also, by a publike
joynt Declaration, which in regard there
came nothing of it, tended little to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of either Nation abroad) His Majesty
gave his royall assent to any Propositions or
acts for raising of men, mony and armes to
performe the work. But hereby no man is
so simple as to think His Majesty should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
give over his own personall care and
protection of that his Kingdome, it being a
Rule, <hi>That a King can no more desert the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of his owne people, then they their subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to him.</hi> In all his Declarations there was
nothing that he endeard and inculcated more
often, and with greater aggravation and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse
unto them, then the care of his
poore Subjects their fellow-protestants in
<hi>Ireland:</hi> Nay, he resented their condition so
f<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rre, and took the businesse so to heart, that
he offered to passe over in person for their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53765:9"/>
reliefe: And who can deny but this was a
magnanimous and King-like resolution?
Which the <hi>Scots</hi> by publike act of Counsell,
did highly approve of, and declared it to be
an argument of care and courage in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.
And questionlesse it had done infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
good in the opinion of them that have
felt the pulse of the Irish people, who are
daily ore-heard to groan, how they have bin
any time these 400. yeeres under the English.
Crowne, and yet never saw but two of their
Kings all the while upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Irish ground, though
there be but a <hi>salt ditch</hi> of a few hours sail to
passe over. And much more welcome should
His Majesty, now regnant, be amongst them,
who, by generall <hi>tradition, They</hi> confesse and
hold to come on the paternall side from <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
(by legall and lineall descent) who was
an Irish Prince, and after King of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
whereas the title of all our former Kings and
Queens was stumbled at alwayes by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
His Majesty finding that this royall
proffer of engaging his owne person, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with a kind of scorn, coucht in smooth
language, though the m<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine businesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53765:10"/>
himselfe neerest, and indeed solely
himselfe, that Kingdome being his owne he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Right. Understanding also, what
base sinister use there was made of this insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
by some trayterous malevolent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who, to cast aspersions upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and to poyson the hearts of his people,
besides publike infamous reports, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
certaine commissions in His Majesties
name to authorize the businesse, as if he
were privy to it, though I dare pawn my soul
His (or <hi>Her</hi> Majesty) knew no more of it
then the great <hi>Mogor</hi> did. Finding also that
the Commissioners imployed hence for the
managing and composing matters in that
Kingdome, though nominated by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by their recommendation autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
by His Majesty, did not observe their
instructions, and yet were connived at. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
also, what an inhumane designe
there was between them and the <hi>Scot,</hi> in lieu
of suppressing an insurrection to eradicat and
extinguish a whole Nation to make booty
of their l<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds, (which hopes the <hi>London</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
did hugge, and began to divide the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53765:10"/>
Beares skin before he was taken, as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
told them) an attempt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> not
any other Christian State ever intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the worst of Savages; The conceit
whereof infused such a desperate courage,
eagernesse and valour into the <hi>Irish,</hi> that it
made them turn <hi>necessity</hi> into a kind of <hi>vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, His Majesty taking notice that
those royall Subsidies, with other vast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
whereunto he had given way, with
the sums of particular Adventurers (amongst
whom some Aliens (<hi>Hollanders</hi>) were taken
in, besides the <hi>Scot,</hi> to share the Country)
were misapplyed, being visibly imployed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to feed and English Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
an Irish: Nay, understanding that
those charitable collections which were
made for the reliefe of those distressed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
who being stripped of all their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> were forced to fly over to
<hi>England,</hi> were converted to other uses, and
the Charity not dispensed according to the
Givers intention. Hearing also that those
5000. men which had been levyed and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to goe under the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53765:11"/>
Lord of <hi>Kerry,</hi> Sir <hi>Faithfull Fortescue</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were diverted from going to the west
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and imployed to make up the Earl
of <hi>Essex</hi> Army: And having notice besides
that the Earl of <hi>Warwicke</hi> had stayd certaine
ships going thither with supplies, and that
there was an attempt to send for over to
<hi>England</hi> some of those Scottish Forces which
were in <hi>Vlster,</hi> without his privity. Lastly,
His Majesty finding <hi>himself</hi> unfitted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
disabled to reach those his distressed
Subjects, his owne royall <hi>arme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> all his navall
strength, revenues and magazines being out
of his <hi>hands;</hi> and having as hard a game to
play still with the <hi>Scot,</hi> and as pernicious a
fire to quench in <hi>England,</hi> as any of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
ever had: Receiving intelligence
also daily from his Protestant Nobility and
Gentry thence, in what a desperate case the
whole Kingdome stood, together with the
report of the Committee that attended His
Majesty from them expresly for that service,
who amongst other deplorable passages in
their petition, represented, <hi>That all means by
which comfort and life should be conveyed unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53765:11"/>
that gasping Kingdome, seemed to be totally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and that unlesse timely reliefe were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded,
His loyall Subjects there must yeeld
their fortunes for a prey, their lives for a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and their Religion for a scorne to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse
Rebels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesty (as it was high time for him)
taking into his Princely thoughts those wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
complaints and cryes of his poore Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
condescended at last to appoint some
persons of honour to heare what the Irish
could say for themselves, as they had often
petitioned; and God forbid but the King of
<hi>Ireland</hi> should receive his Subjects petitions,
as well as the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
being unsatisfied with what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
then, the Lord Marquesse of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
marched with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siderable Forces against
them, and though he came off with honour,
yet no reliefe at all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thither for many
moneths after from the Parliament here, who
had undertaken the businesse, and had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all the summes and subsidies, with other
unknown contributions to that end, matters
grew daily worse and worse. To sum up all,
His Majesty receiving expresse and positive
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53765:12"/>
advice from his Lord Justices and Counsell
of State there, that the whole Kingdome was
upon poynt of utter perdition, which was
co-intimated the same time to the Parliament
here, by a speciall letter to the <hi>Speaker;</hi> I say
His Majesty finding that he had neither pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of himselfe, it being transmitted to others;
and that those Trustees did misapply that
power and trust he had invested in them (for
the time) to make good their undertaking
for preservation of that his fruitfull King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
being impelled by all these forcible
reasons, His Majesty sent a commission to the
Lord Marquesse of <hi>Ormond</hi> his Lieutenant
Generall (a most known sincere Protestant)
to hearken to a treaty according to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition;
and if any thing was amisse in that
treaty in poynt of honour (as it shall appeare
by comparing it with others, there was
none) we know whom to thank. For out
of these premises also, doth result this second
conclusion. That they who <hi>misapplied those
moneys, and mis-imployed those men</hi> which
were levyed with His Majesties royall assent
for the reduction of <hi>Ireland:</hi> They who set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
that most sanguinary designe of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53765:12"/>
at least of <hi>enslaving</hi> a whole ancient
Nation, who were planted there by the hand
of Providence from the beginning: They
who hindred His Majesties <hi>transfretation</hi>
thither to take cognizance of his own affairs
and expose the countenance of His own roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
person for composing of things: They,
They may be said to be the true causes of that
unavoidable necessity (and as the heathen
Poet sings, <hi>The Gods themselves cannot resist
Necessity</hi>) which enforced His Majesty to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate
with the Irish, and assent to a Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>It was the saying of one of the bravest
Roman Emperours, and it was often used by
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Her Majesties
Father, <hi>That he had rather save the life of one
loyall Subject then kill a hundred Enemies:</hi>
It may well be thought that one of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valentst
inducements that moved His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
(besides those formerly mentioned) to
condescend to this Irish Cessation, was a sense
he had of the effusion of his owne poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
blood, the hazard of the utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Protestants there, and a totall
irrecoverable losse of that Kingdome, as was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53765:13"/>
advertised both in the petition of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
themselves, the relation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
imployed thither to that purpose, and
the expresse letters of the Lord Justices and
Counsell there.</p>
            <p>To prove now, that this Cessation of Arms
in <hi>Ireland</hi> was more honourable and fuller of
Piety, Prudence and Necessity, then either
the Pacification or Peace with the <hi>Scot.</hi> I
hope, these few ensuing arguments (above
divers others which cannot be inserted here,
in regard of the fore intended brevity of this
Discourse) will serve the turne.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Imprimis,</hi> When the <hi>Pacification</hi> was
made with <hi>Scotland,</hi> His Majesty was there
personally present, attended on by the floure
of His English Nobility, Gentry and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and the enemy was hard by ready to
face Him. At the concluding of the Irish
Cessation, His Majesty was not there perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
present, but it was agitated and agreed
on by his <hi>Commissioner,</hi> and it hath been held
alwayes lesse dishonourable for a King to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate
in this kind with his owne Subjects
by his Deputy, then in his owne person, for
the further off he is, the lesse reflects upon
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53765:13"/>
2. Upon the Pacification and Peace with
<hi>Scotland,</hi> there was an Amnestia, a generall
pardon, and an abolition of all by-passed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
published, there were honours and
offices conferred upon the chiefest sticklers in
the War. At the Cessation in <hi>Ireland</hi> there
was no such thing.</p>
            <p>3. When the Pacification and Peace was
made with the <hi>Scots,</hi> there was mony given
unto <hi>Them,</hi> as it is too well knowne. But
upon the setling of this Cessation, the Irish
gave His Majesty a considerable summe as an
argument of their submission and gratitude,
besides the maintainance of some of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
in the interim; and so much partly in
poynt of honour.</p>
            <p>4. At the concluding of the Pacification
and Peace with <hi>Scotland,</hi> there was a vigorous
fresh, unfoiled English Army afoot, and in
perfect equipage; there wanted neither Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
Armes, Money, Cloaths, Victuals
or any thing that might put heart into the
Souldier and elevate his spirits. But the
Protestant Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> had not any of
all these in any competent proportion, but
were ready to perish, though there had been
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53765:14"/>
no other enemy then hunger and cold: And
this implies a farre greater necessity for the
said Cessation.</p>
            <p>5. In <hi>Ireland</hi> there was imminent danger
of an instant losse of the whole Kingdome,
and consequently, the utter subversion of the
Protestant Religion there, as was certified
both to King &amp; Parliament by sundry letters
&amp; petitions which stand upon record: There
was no such danger in the affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
either in respect of Religion or Kingdome;
therefore there was more piety shown in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the one, and prudence in preserving
the other in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by plucking both (as it
were) out of the very jawes of destruction
by the said Cessation.</p>
            <p>We know that <hi>in the Medley of mundane
casualties, of two evils, the least is to be chosen,</hi>
and a small inconvenience is to be borne
withall, to prevent a greater.</p>
            <p>If one make research into the French Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he will find, that many kinds of Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Suspensions of Armes were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
twixt that King and some of his
Subjects, trenching farre more upon regall
dignity then this in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Spaniard
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53765:14"/>
was forced to declare the Hollanders <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi>
before they could be brought to treat
of a truce: And now the <hi>Catalans</hi> screw him
up almost to as high conditions. But what
need I rove abroad so far? It is well known,
nor is it out of the memory of man, that in
<hi>Ireland</hi> it selfe there have been Cessations, all
circumstances well weighed, more prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to Majesty then this.</p>
            <p>But that which I heare murmured at most
as the effect of this Cessation, is the transport
of some of those Souldiers to <hi>England</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruting
His Majesties Armies, though the
greatest number of them be perfect and rigid
Protestants, and were those whom our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
it selfe imployed against the Irish.
But put case they were all <hi>Papists,</hi> must His
Majesty therefore be held a Favourer of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery?
The late King of <hi>France</hi> might have
been said as well to have been a Favourer of
<hi>Protestants,</hi> because in all his wars he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Them</hi> most of any in places of greatest
trust, against the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> whereas
all the World knows, that he perfectly hated
them in the generall, and one of the reaches
of policy he had, was to spend and waste
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53765:15"/>
them in the warres. Was it ever knowne
but a Soveraigne Prince might use the bodies
&amp; strength of his own naturall-born Subjects,
and Liege men for his owne defence? When
His person hath been sought and aimed at in
open field by small and great shot, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Engines of hostility and violence: When
he is in danger to be surprized or besieged in
that place where he keeps his Court: When
all the flowers of his Crowne (his royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
which are descended upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him from
so many successive progenitors) are like to
be plucked off and trampled under foot:
When there is a visible plot to alter and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn
that Religion he was born, baptized
&amp; bred in: When he is in danger to be forced
to infringe that solemn Sacramentall Oath he
took at his Coronation to maintain the said
Religion, with the Rights &amp; Rites of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Anglican <hi>Church,</hi> which some brain-sick Scis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
would transform to a <hi>Kirk</hi> and her
Discipline, to some chimericall forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
they know not what. <hi>Francis</hi> the
first, and other Christian Princes, made use
of the <hi>Turke</hi> upon lesse occasions; and if one
may make use of a Horse, or any other bruit
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53765:15"/>
animall, or any inanimat Engine or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his owne defence against man, much
more may man be used against man, much
more may one rationall Creature be usd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
another though for destructive ends in
a good cause, specially when they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a Soveraigne head, which is the maine
thing that goes to justifie a warre. Now
touching the Roman Catholicks, whether
<hi>English, Welsh, Irish,</hi> or <hi>Scottish,</hi> which repair
to His Majesties armies either for service or
security, He looks not upon them as Papists,
but as his Subjects, not upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Religion, but
their alleagiance, and in that quality he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines
them: Nor can the Papist be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Character of a <hi>good Subject,</hi> all the
while he conformes himselfe to the Lawes in
generall, &amp; to those lawes also that are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
enacted against him, &amp; so keeps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
within the bounds of his civil obedience:
As long as he continues so, he may challenge
protection from his Prince by way of right,
and if his Prince by some accident be not in
case to protect him, he is to give him leave to
defend himselfe the best he can, for the law of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53765:16"/>
nature allowes every one to defend himselfe,
and there is no positive law of man can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null
the law of nature. Now if the <hi>Subject</hi>
may thus claime protection from his <hi>Prince,</hi>
it followeth, the <hi>Prince</hi> by way of reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may require assistance, service and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
from the <hi>Subject</hi> upon all publike occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
as to suppresse at this time a new race
of <hi>Recusants,</hi> which have done more hurt
then ever the <hi>old</hi> did, and are like to prove
more dangerous to His Crowne and regall
Authority then any forraigne enemy.</p>
            <p>But whosoever will truly observe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
and trace the actions of this fatall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which now swayes with that bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
exorbitant, arbitrary and Antinomian
power, will find, that it is one of their prime
peeces of policy, to traduce and falsifie any
thing that is not conducible to their owne
ends: Yet what comes from <hi>Them</hi> must be
so magisteriall, it must be so unquestionably
and incontroulably true and lawfull, that it
must be beleeved with an implicite faith, as
proceeding from an in-erring Oracle (as if
these Zealots were above the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53765:16"/>
of mankind, to whom errour is as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riditary
as any other infirmity) though the
thing it selfe encroach never so grosly both
upon the common liberty, the states and
soules of men. But if any thing beare the
stamp of royall Authority, be it never so just
and tending to peace and the publike good,
yea, though it be indifferent to either side,
it is presently countermanded, cryed down,
and stifled; or it is calumniated and aspersed
with obloquies, false glosses and misprisions;
and this is become now the common Theam
wherewith their Pulpits ring.</p>
            <p>Which makes me think, that these upstart
politicians have not long to reigne; for, as
the common Proverb saith, <hi>Fraud and frost
end foule, and are short lived,</hi> so that policy,
those Counsels which are grounded upon
scandals, reproaches and lyes, will quickly
moulder &amp; totter away, and bring their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
at last to deserved infamy and shame,
and make them find a Tombe in their owne
ruines. Adde hereunto as further badges
of their nature, that black irreconcilable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and desire of revenge which rageth in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53765:17"/>
them, the aversnesse they have to any sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Conformity and Union, the violent
thirst they have of blood, which makes me
think on that distique of <hi>Prudentius,</hi> who
seemed to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> as well as <hi>Poet</hi> (a true
<hi>Vates</hi>) in displaying the humours of these
fiery Dogmatists, this all-confounding facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which now hath the vogue, to the <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
I will not say yet, the <hi>perdition</hi> of this
poore Island.</p>
