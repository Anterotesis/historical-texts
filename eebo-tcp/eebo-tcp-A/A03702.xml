            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was borne at <hi>Bourne,</hi> a Towne in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire,
from my age of twelue yeeres brought vp
in Redriffe neere London; with M. Frauncis Lee, who
was the Queenes Maiesties powder-maker, whome I
serued, vntill I was prest to goe on the voiage to the
West Indies, with the Right worshipful Sir Iohn Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
who appointed mee to be one of the Gunners in
her Maiesties shippe called the Iesus of Libbicke, who
set saile from Plimmouth in the moneth of October
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16705:5"/>
1567. hauing with him an other shippe of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties,
called the Minion, and foure shippes of his owne
namely, the Angell, the Swallow, the Iudith, and the
William and Iohn. He directed his Vizeadmirall, that
if foule weather did separate them, to meete at the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of Tennerif. After which by the space of seuen
daies and seuen nights, we had such storms at Sea, that
we lost our long boates and a pinnisse, with some men
comming to the Tennerif: there our Generall heard
that his vizeadmirall with the Swallow, and the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
and Iohn, were at the Iland called the Gomero,
where finding his vizeadmirall hee ancored, tooke in
fresh water and set saile for Cape Blanke, where in the
way we tooke a Portugall Caruill, laden with fish cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Mullets: from thence to Cape de Verde. In our
course thither we met a Frenchman of Rochell called
Captaine Bland, who had taken a Portugall Caruill,
whome our vizeadmirall chafed and tooke. Sir Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Drake was made Master and Captaine of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and so weekept our way till wee came to Cape de
Verde, and there we ancored, tooke our boates, and set
soldiers on shore. Our Generall was the first that leapt
on land, &amp; with him Captain Dudley there we tooke
certain Negros, but not without damage to our selues
for our General, Captaine Dudley, and eight other of
our company were hurt with poysoned arrowes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
nine daies after the eight that were wounded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Our Generall was taught by a Negro, to draw the
poyson out of his wound with a cloue of garlicke,
whereby he was cured. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence we went to Surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,
where be monstrous fishes called Sharkes, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16705:5"/>
wil deuoure men, I amongst others was sent in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
with two pinnaces into the riuer called the Calou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that were there trading with the Negros, we tooke
one of them with the Negroes, &amp; brought them away.
In this riuer in the night time we had one of our pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
bulged by a sea-horse, so that our men swimming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the riuer, were all taken into the other pinnaces,
except two that tooke holde one of another, and were
carried awaie by the sea horse, who hath the iust pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of a horse, sauing that his legs be short, his teeth
verie great and a span in length, he vseth on the night to
go on land into the woodes, seeking at vnawares to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
the Negros in their cabbins, whom they by their
vigilancie preuent, and kill them in this manner. The
Negros keepe watch, and diligently attend their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and when they are gone into the woodes, they
forthwith laie a great tree ouerthwart the waie, so that
at their returne, for that their legs be so short, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go ouer it: then the Negroes set vppon them with
their bowes, arrowes and darts, and so destroy them.</p>
            <p>From thence we entered the riuer called the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterus,
where there were other Caruelles trading with
the Negros, and them we tooke. In this Iland betwixt
the riuer and the maine, Trees grow with their rootes
vpwards, and Oisters vpon them. There grow Palmita
trees, which be as high as a ships maine mast, &amp; on their
tops grow nuts, wine and oyle, which they call Palmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
wine and Palmita oyle. The Plantine trees also
grow in that countrie, the tree is as big as a mans thigh,
and as high as a firre pole, the leaues thereof be long &amp;
broade, and on the top grow the fruit which is called
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16705:6"/>
Plantaines, they are crooked and a cubite long, and as
big as a mans wrist, they grow on clusters: when they
be ripe they be verie good and daintie to eate, Suger is
not more delicate in tast than they be. In this land bee
Elyphants, which the Negros kill in this manner: they
seke out their hants where they rest in the night, which
is against a tree, that they saw three partes in sunder, so
that when the Elephant leaneth and stretch himselfe
against it, the tree falleth, &amp; he with it, then he roareth,
wherby the Negros know he is fallen, then they come
vpon him and kill him.</p>
            <p>From thence with the Angell, the Iudith and the
pinnaces, wee failed to Surreleon, where our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
at that time was, who with the Captaines and
souldiers went vp into the riuer called the Faggarine,
to take a towne of the Negroes, where he found three
kings of that Countrie with fiftie thousand Negroes
beseeging the same towne, which they could not take
in many yeeres before that they had warred with it.
Our Generall made a breach, entered, and valiantlie
tooke the towne, wherein were founde fiue Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,
which yeelded themselues to his mercie, and hee
saued their liues, we tooke and carried thence for traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke
of the West Indies fiue hundred Negroes. The
three kings droue seuen thousand Negros into the sea
at low water, at the point of the land, where they were
all drowned in the oze, for that they could not take
their canowes to saue themselues. Wee retourued
backe againe in our pinnaces to the shippes, and there
tooke in fresh water, and made readie sayle towards
Reogrande. At our comming thether we entred with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16705:6"/>
the Angel, the Iudith, and the two pinnasses, we found
there seuen Portugall Caruils, which made great fight
with vs. In the end by Gods helpe wee won the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and droue them to the shore, from whence with the
Negroes they fled, we fetcht the caruils from the shore
into the riuer. The next morning sir Frances Drake
with his Caruell, the Swallow, the William and Iohn
came into the riuer, with Captaine Dudley and his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who landed being but a hundred souldiers, and
fought with seauen thousande Negroes, burned the
towne, and returned to our Generall with the losse of
one man.</p>
            <p>In that place there be many muske cats, which breed
in hollow trees, the Negroes take them in a net and put
them in a cage, and nourish them verie daintily, &amp; take
the muske from them with a spoone.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Heere we left the Ethyope land,</l>
               <l>And tooke the Indian voiage in hand.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Heere by the way died Captaine Dudley.</p>
            <p>In sayling towards the Indies, the first land that wee
escried, was the Iland called Domineco, where at our
comming we ancored, tooke in fresh water and wood
for our prouision, which done, we sayled towardes the
Iland called Margarita, where our Generall in despite
of the Spanyardes ancored, landed, and tooke in fresh
victuals. A mile off the Iland there is a rocke in the sea,
wherein do breede many fowles, like vnto Barnacles,
in the night wee went out in our boates, and with cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
wee killed many of them, and wee brought them
with many of their egges abord with vs, their egges be
as bigge as Turkies egges, and speckled like them, wee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16705:7"/>
did eate them, and found them very good meat.</p>
            <p>From thence wee sayled to Burborata, which is in
the maine lande of the West Indies, there we came in,
mored our shippes, and tarryed two moneths trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and dressing our shippes, and in the meane time
trading with certaine Spanyards of that cuntry. There
our Generall sent vs vnto a Towne called Placentia,
(which stood on a high hil) to haue intreated a Bishop
that dwelt there for his fauour and frendship in their
lawes, who hearing of our comming, for feare forsoke
the Towne, wherevpon one of our companie made
these English verses following.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Vnto the Bishop we were sent,</l>
               <l>To craue his fauour in the lawes:</l>
               <l>He knew not the good that we ment,</l>
               <l>He fled for feare and not for cause.</l>
               <l>We tooke such a iourney vp the hill,</l>
               <l>That few or none haue done so ill.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In our way vp the hill to Placentia, wee found a
monstrous venemous worme, with two heads, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
was as bigge as a mans arme, and a yard long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our
maister Robert Barret did cutte him in sunder with
his swoord, and it made it as blacke as if it were colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ynke.</p>
            <p>Heere bee many Tygers, monstrous and furious
beasts, which by subtletie deuoure and destroy many
men, they vse the traded waies, and will shewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
twise or thrise to the trauellers, and so depart se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
lurking till they be past, then sodainly and at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
they leape vpon them and deuoure them, they
had so vsed two of our companie, had not one of them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16705:7"/>
looked behind. Our Generall sent three ships vnto the
Iland called Corussa, to make prouision for the rest
where they remained vntill his comming. Hee sent
from thence the Angell and the Iudith to Riuer de
hache, where we ancored before the towne. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards
shot three peeces at vs from the shore, whome
we requited with two of ours, and shotte through the
Gouernors house, we wayed ancor, &amp; ancored againe
without shot of the towne, where we rid fiue daies in
despite of the Spanyards, and their shot. In the meane
space there came a Caruil of aduise from S. Domingo
whom with the Angell, and the Iudith we chased and
droue to the shore, we fetcht him from thence spite of
200 Spanyards hargabush shot, and ancored again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the towne, and rid there with him, till our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
comming, who ancored, landed his men, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
tooke the Towne, with the losse of one man,
whose name was Thomas Surgeon, wee landed and
planted on the shore for our safties our field ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
wee droue the Spanyards vp into the country aboue
two leagues, wherby they were inforced to trade with
our Generall, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sold most part of his Negros.</p>
            <p>In this riuer we killed a monstrous Alagarta in this
port at Sunne set: seuen of vs went in the pinnice vp
into the Riuer, carrying with vs a dogge, vnto whom
with rope yarne wee bound a great hooke of steele,
with a chaine that had a swiuel, which wee put vnder
the dogs belly, the point of the hooke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ouer his
back fast bound, as aforesaid, we put him ouer bord, &amp;
vered out our rope by little &amp; little, rowing away with
our boate, the Alagarta came and presently swallowed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16705:8"/>
vp the dogge, then did we rowe hard, till we had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him, hee plunged and made a wonderfull sturre in
the water, we leapt on shore, and haled him on lande:
he was 23 foote by the rule, headed like a hogge, in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
like a serpent, full of scales as broad as a sawcer, his
taile long and full of knots, as bigge as a fawcon shotte,
he hath foure legges, his feete haue long nailes like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a dragon, we opened him, tooke out his guttes, flead
him, dried his skinne, &amp; stuffed it with strawe, meaning
to haue brought it home, had not the shippe been cast
away. This monster wil carrie away and deuoure both
man and horse.</p>
            <p>Nowe to S. Amart, where wee landed, traded, and
solde certaine Negros: there two of our companie
killed a monstrous adder, going towards his caue with
a cunnie in his mouth, his bodie was as bigge as anie
mans thigh, and seuen foot long, vpon his tayle he had
sixteene knottes, euerie one as bigge as a great walnut,
which they say, do shew his age: his colour was green
and yellowe, they opened him and found two cunnies
in his bellie.</p>
            <p>From thence to Cartagene, where we went in, mored
our ships, and would haue traded with them, but they
durst not for feare of the king, we brought vp the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
against the Castell, and shotte at the Castell and
Towne: these we landed in an Iland, where were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gardens, there in a caue we found certain Buttesios
of wine, which wee brought away with vs, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
whereof our Generall commaunded to bee set
on shore woollen and linnen cloth to the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
From hence by foule weather wee were forced to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16705:8"/>
seeke the port of S. Iohn de Lowe: in our way, twhart
of Campeche, wee met with a Spanyard, a small ship,
who was bound for Santa Domingo, he had in him a
Spanyard, called Augustine de villa noua, that was he
that betrayed all the Noble men in the Indies, &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them to be beheaded, wherefore he with two Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with him fled to S. Domingo, them wee tooke and
brought with vs into the port of S. Iohn de Low. Our
Generall made a great account of him, and vsed him
like a Noble man, in the ende he was one of them that
betrayed vs, when we had mored our shippes, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
we mounted the ordinance that wee found there
in the Iland, and for our safeties kept watch and ward.
Two daies after wee discouered the Spanish fleete,
wherof Lushon a Spanyard was Generall, with him
came a Spanyard, called Don Martin Henerico, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the king of Spaine sent to bee his vize-king of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
He sent a pinnice with a flagge of truce vnto our
Generall, to know of what Countrie those ships were
that rode there in the King of Spaines port, who sayd
they were the Q. of Englandes ships, which came in
there for victuals for their mony, for the which if your
Generall will come in here, he shall giue me victualles
and all other necessaries, and I will go out on the one
side of the port, and he shall come in on the other side.
The Spaniard returned for answere, that he was a vize
king, &amp; had a thousand men, and therefore he would
come in. Our Generall sayd, if he bee a vize king, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
my Queenes person, &amp; I am a vize king as well
as he, and if he haue a thousand men, my pouder and
shot will take the better place. Then the vize king after
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16705:9"/>
counsell among themselues, yeelded to our Generals
demaund, swearing by his King and his Crowne, by
his commission and authoritie, that hee had from his
King, that he would performe it, and therevpon pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were giuen on both parts. Our Generall bearing a
godly and Christian mind, voide of fraud and deceite,
iudged the Spanyards to haue done the like, deliuered
to them six Gentlemen, not doubting to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the like from them, but the faithlesse Spanyardes,
in costly apparell gaue of the basest of their companie,
as afterwardes it was well knowne. These things fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
proclamation was made on both sides, that on
payne of death no occasion should be giuen, whereby
any quarrel should growe to the breach of the league,
and then they peaceably entered the port, with great
triumph on both sides.</p>
            <p>The Spanyards presently brought a great Hulke, a
ship of nine hundred, and mored her by the side of the
Minion, and they cut out ports in their other shippes,
planting their ordenance towards vs, in the night they
filled the Hulke with men, to lay the Minion aboord,
as the sequel did shew, which made our General dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of their dealinges, wherefore, for that hee could
speake the Spanish toong, hee sent Robert Barret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord
the vize-king, to knowe his meaning in those
dealings, who willed him with his company to come
in to him, whome he commaunded presently to bee
sette in the bilbowes, and foorthwith a Cornet (for a
watchword among the false Spanyards) was sounded
for the enterprising of their pretended treason against
our Generall, whome Augustine de villa noua sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16705:9"/>
at dinner with him, should then presently haue
killed with a poynado which hee had priuily in his
sleeue, which was espyed and preuented by one Iohn
Chamberlaine, who tooke the poynado out of his
sleeue. Our Generall hastily rose vp, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to bee put prisoner in the Steward roome,
and to bee kept with two men. The faithlesse Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
thinking all things to their desire had beene fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
sodainely sounded a Trumpet, and therewith
three hundred Spanyards entred the Minion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
our Generall with a lowde and fierce voyce called
vnto vs, saying, God and Saint George, vpon those
trayterous villaines, and rescue the Minnion, I trust in
God the day shall bee ours, and with that the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and soldiers leapt out of th Iesus of Libbicke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Minnion, and beate out the Spanyardes, and
with a shotte out of her fiered the Spanyards vize-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
where the most part of three hundred Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
were spoyled, and blowne ouer boord with
powder. Their Admiral also was on fier half an houre,
wee cutte our cables, wound off our shippes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fought with them, they came vpon vs on euery
side, and continued the fight from tenne of the clocke
vntill it was night, they kylled all our men that were
on shore in the Iland, sauing three, which by swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
got aboord the Iesus of Libicke. They sunke the
Generals ship called the Angell, and tooke the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
the Spanyards admiral had aboue threescore shot
through her, many of his men were spoyled, foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their shippes were sunke, there were in that
fleete, and that came from the shore to rescue them,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16705:10"/>
fifteene hundred we slew of them, fiue hundred and
fortie, as wee were credebly infourmed by a note that
came to Mexico. In this fight the Iesus of Libicke had
fiue shot through her maine mast, her fore-mast was
stroke in sunder vnder the hounds with a chaine shot,
and her hull was wonderfully pearced with shot, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was vnpossible to bring hir awaie. They set two
of their own ships on fire, intending therwith to haue
burnt the Iesus of Libbicke, which wee preuented by
cutting our cables in the halfe, and winding off by our
sternefast. The Minion was forced to set saile &amp; stand
off from vs, and come to an ancor without shot of the
Iland. Our Generall couragiously cheered vp his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Gunners, and called to Samuel his page for
a cup of Beere, who brought it him in a siluer cup, and
he drinking to al his men willed the Gunners to stand
by their ordenance lustily like men. He had no sooner
set the cup out of his hand, but a demy Culuerine shot
stroke away the cup &amp; a Coopers plaine that stood by
the maine mast, &amp; ran out on the other side of the ship,
which nothing dismaied our Generall, for hee ceased
not to incourage vs, saying, feare nothing, for God
who hath preserued mee from this shot, will also deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vs from these traytors and villaines. Then captaine
Bland meaning to haue turned out of the port, had his
main mast stroke ouer bord with a chainshot that came
from the shore, wherefore hee ancored, fired his ship,
tooke his pinnice with all his men, and came aboord
the Iesus of Libbicke to our Generall, who saide vnto
him, that hee thought he would not haue runne away
from him: hee aunswered, that he was not minded to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16705:10"/>
haue runne awaye from him, but his intente was
to haue turned vp, and to haue laide the wethermost
shippe of the Spanish fleet aboord, and fyred his shippe
in hope therewith to haue set on fire the Spanish fleet,
he said if he had done so hee had done well. With this
night came on. Our Generall commaunded the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
for safegard of her masts to be brought vnder the
Iesus of Libbicks lee: hee willed Sir Francis Drake to
come in with the Iudith, and to lay the Minion abord,
to take in men and other thinges needfull, and to goe
out, and so he did.</p>
            <p>At night when the wind came off the shore, wee set
sayle, and went out in despite of the Spanyardes and
their shot, where wee ancored, with two ancors vnder
the Iland, the wind being northerly, which was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
daungerous, and we feared euerie houre to be
driuen with the lee shore. In the ende the wind came
larger, we wayed ancor, and set sayle, seeking the riuer
of Pannico for water, whereof we had very little, and
victuals were so scarse, that we were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eat hides,
cats, rats, parrats, munkies, and dogges, wherefore our
Generall was forced to diuide his company into two
partes, for there was a mutenie among them for want
of victuals, and some saide that they had rather bee on
the shore to shift for themselues amongst the enemies,
then to sterue on shippe-boord. Hee asked them who
would goe on shore, and who would tarrie on shippe-boord,
those that would goe on shore, he willed to goe
on foremast, and those that would tarrie, on baft mast:
fourescore and sixteene of vs were willing to departe.
Our Generall gaue vnto euery one of vs six yardes of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16705:11"/>
roane cloth, and money to them that demaundedit.
When we were landed, he came vnto vs, where frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imbracing euery one of vs, he was greatly greeued
that he was forced to leaue vs behind him, he counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vs to serue God, and to loue one another, and thus
courteously he gaue vs a sorrowful farewell, &amp; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
if God sent him safe home, he would do what hee
could, that so many of vs as liued shuld by some means
be brought into England, and so he did.</p>
            <p>Since my returne into England I haue heard, that
many misliked that he left vs so behind him, &amp; broght
away Negros, the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this, for them he might haue
had victuals, or any other thing needfull, if by fowle
weather he had beene driuen vpon the Ilands, which
for gold nor siluer he could not haue had.</p>
            <p>And thus our Generall parted to his ships, and wee
remained on lande, where for oursafeties, fearing
the wild Indians that were about vs, we kept watch all
night, and at sunne rising wee marched on our waye,
three and three in a ranke, vntill that wee came into a
fielde vnder agroue, where the Indians came vppon
vs, asking vs what people we were, and how we came
there. Two of our companie, namely Anthonie
Goddard, and Iohn Cornish, for that they could
speake the Spanish toong, went to them, and sayde we
were Englishmen, that neuer came in that countrie
before, and that we had fought with the Spanyards,
and for that wee lacked victuals, our Generall sette vs
on shore, they asked vs whither we intended to goe,
wee saide, to Pannico. The Captaine of the Indians
wylled vs to giue vnto them some of our clothes and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16705:11"/>
shirtes, which wee did: then hee bad vs giue them
all, but wee would not so doe, whererevpon Iohn
Cornish was then slaine with an arrowe, which an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
boy that stoode by the Captaine shotte at him,
wherefore hee strooke the boy on the necke with his
bowe, that he laye for deade, and willed vs to follow
him, who brought vs into a great fielde, where wee
found fresh water, hee bad vs sitte downe about the
pond and drinke, and hee with his company would
goe in the meane space to kill fiue or sixe deere, and
bring them to vs. We tarryed there vntill three of the
clocke, but they came not: there one of our company
whose name was Iohn Cooke, with four other depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from vs into a groue to seeke reliefe, where present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they were taken by the Indians, and stript as naked
as euer they were borne, and so returned to vs.</p>
            <p>Then we diuided our selues into two parts, halfe to
Anthony Goddard, and the rest to Iames Collier, and
thus seuerally we sought for Pannico. Anthony God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
with his company, bid vs farewell, they passed a
riuer, where the Indians robbed many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their
clothes, &amp; so passing on their way, came to a stony hill,
where they staied. Iames Collyer with his company,
that day passed the same riuer, and were also robbed,
and one of them slaine by chance, we came that night
vnto the hill, where Anthony Goddard and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
rested, there we remained till morning, &amp; then
wee marched altogether from thence, entering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two groues, where the Indians robbed vs of all
our clothes, &amp; left vs naked, they hurt many, and killed
eight of vs. Three daies after we came to another riuer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16705:12"/>
there the Indians shewed vs the way to Pannico, and
so left vs: we passed the riuer into the wildernes, where
we made wreaths of greene grasse, which wee wound
about our bodies, to keepe vs from the sunne, &amp; gnats
of that country. Wee trauelled there seuen daies, and
seuen nights, before we came to Pannico, feeding on
nothing but roots, and Guiauos, a fruite like figges. At
our comming to the riuer of Pannico, two Spanish
horsemen came ouer vnto vs in a Canowe, they asked
vs how long we had beene in the wildernes, &amp; where
our Generall was, for they knewe vs to be of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that had fought with their countrymen: we told
them seuen daies and seuen nights, and for lacke of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
our Generall set vs on shore, and he was gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with his shippes. They returned to their Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who sent them with fiue Canowes, to bring vs
all ouer. Which done, they set vs in array, where a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horsemen with their launces, came forceably vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs, but did not hurt vs, they carried vs prisoners to
Pannico, where wee remained one night. In the riuer
of Pannico, there is a fish like a Calfe, the Spanyardes
call it a Mallateen, hee hath a stone in his head, which
the Indians vse for the disease of the Collicke, in the
night hee commeth on lande, and eateth grasse. I haue
eaten of it, &amp; it eateth not much vrlike to bacon. From
thence wee were sent to Mexico, which is threescore
leagues from Pannico. In our way thither, 20 leagues
from the sea side, I did see white Crabs running vp &amp;
downe the sands, I haue eaten of them, and they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
good meat. There groweth a fruit which the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
cal Auoco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es, it is proportioned like an egge, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16705:12"/>
as blacke as a cole, hauing a stone in it, and it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
good fruite. There also groweth a strange thing
which they call Magei, it serueth them to many vses,
below by the roote they make a hole, whereat they do
take out of it twise euery day, a certaine kind of licour,
which they seeth in a great kettell, till the third part be
consumed, and that it waxe thicke, it is as sweet as anie
honie, they doe eate it. Within twentie daies after that
they haue taken all the licour from it, it withereth, and
they cut it downe, and vse it as we vse our hempe heere
in England, which done, they conuert it to many vses:
of some part they make Mantles, ropes, and threed: of
the ends they make needles to sowe their saddels, pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
and other furniture for their horses: of the rest
they make tyles to couer their houses, and they put it
to many other purposes.</p>
            <p>And thus we came to Mexico, which is 7 leagues
about, seated in a great fen, inuironed with foure hils,
it hath but two waies of entrance, and it is ful of creeks,
in the which in their Canowes they passe from place
to place, and to the Ilandes there within. In the Indies
ordinarily three times a yeare bee woonderfull earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
which put the people in great feare and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
during the time of two yeres that I was in Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,
I saw them six times, when it commeth it throweth
downe trees, houses, and churches. There is a Citie 25
leagues from Mexico, called Tuscalia, which is inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a hundred thousand Indians, they go in white
shirts, linnen breeches, and long mantles, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
weare about them a garment much like vnto a
flannen petticote. The Kings pallace was the first place
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16705:13"/>
that we were brought vnto in Mexico, where without
we were willed to sit downe. Much people, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
&amp; children came wondering about vs, many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
our misery, &amp; some of their clergie asked vs if
we were Christians, we said, we praised God, we were
as good christians as they: they asked how they might
know that, we said, by our confessions. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence we
were carried in a Canowe to a Tanners house, which
standeth a little from the citie: the next morning two
friars &amp; two priests came thither to vs, and willed vs to
blesse our selues, and say our praiers in the Latin tong,
that they might vnderstand vs, many of our company
did so, wherevpon they returned to the vize-king, and
told him that we were good Christians, &amp; that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vs well, &amp; then they brought vs much releefe, with
cloths, our sick men were sent to their hospitals, where
many were cured, and many died. From the Tanners
house we were led to a gentlemans place, where vpon
paine of death wee were charged to abide, and not to
come into the Citie, thither we had all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
brought vs, on sundaies and holydaies, much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came, and brought vs great releefe.</p>
            <p>The vize-king practised to hang vs, and caused a
paire of new gallows to be set vp, to haue executed vs,
wherevnto the Noblemen of that country would not
consent, but praied him to stay vntill the ship of aduise
brought newes from the king of Spaine, what should
be done with vs, for they saide they could not finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing by vs, whereby they might lawfully put vs to
death.</p>
            <p>The vize-king then commanded vs to be sent to an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16705:13"/>
Iland therby, &amp; he sent for the Bishop of Mexico, who
sent foure priests to the Iland, to examine &amp; confes vs,
who said, that the vize-king would burne vs, when we
were examined and confessed according to the lawes
of their country. They returned to the Bishop, &amp; told
him that we were very good Christians. The Bishop
certefied the vize-king of our examinations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
and said that we were good Christians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would not meddle with vs. Then the vize-king
sent for our maister R. Barret, whom he kept prisoner
in his pallace, vntil the fleete was departed for Spaine.
The rest of vs hee sent to a Towne seuen leagues from
Mexico, called Tothscoco, to carde wooll among the
Indian slaues, which drudgery we disdained, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to beat our maisters, and so we did, wherefore
they sent to the vize-king, desiring him for Gods sake
and our Ladies, to send for vs, for they would not keep
vs any longer, they said that we were deuils &amp; no men.</p>
            <p>The vizeking sent for vs, &amp; imprisoned vs in a house
in Mexico, from thence he sent An. Goddard, &amp; some
other of our company with him into Spaine, with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shon,
the Generall that tooke vs, the rest of vs staied in
Mexico 2 yeeres after, &amp; then were sent prisoners into
Spaine, with Don Iohn de valesco de varre, admiral &amp;
general of the spanish fleet, who caried with him in his
ship, to be presented to the K. of Spaine, the anatomie
of a Giant, which was sent from China to Mexico, to
the vize-king Don Martin Hennerico, to be sent to the
K. of Spaine for a great wonder. It did appeere by the
anatomie, that he was of a monstrous size, the skull of
his head was neer as big as half a bushel, his neck bones
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16705:14"/>
shoulder plates, arme bones, &amp; all other lineaments of
his other partes, were huge and monstrous to behold,
the shanke of his leg from the ankell to the knee, was as
long as any mans ankell vp to his wast, and of bignesse
accordingly.</p>
            <p>At this time, and in this shippe, were also sent to bee
presented to the king of Spaine, two chests full of earth
with ginger growing in them, which were also sent
from China, to be sent to the king of Spaine. The gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
runneth in the ground like to liccoras, the blades
growe out of it, in length and proportion like vnto the
blades of wild garlicke, which they cut euerie fifteene
daies, they vse to water them twise a day, as we doe our
hearbes heere in England, they put the blades in their
porrage, and vse them in their other meates, whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
sauour and tast is very delightfull, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a good appetite.</p>
            <p>When wee were shipped in the port of S. Iohn de
Low, the Generall called our maister Robert Barret &amp;
vs with him, into his cabbin, and asked vs if wee would
fight against Englishmen, if we met them at sea, we said
that wee would not fight against our Crowne, but if
we met with any other, we would doe what wee were
able. He said if we had saide otherwise, hee would not
haue beleeued vs, and for that we should be the better
vsed, and haue allowance as other men had, &amp; he gaue
a charge to euery one of vs, according vnto our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Robert Barret was placed with the pilate, I
was put in the Gunner roome, William Cawse with
the bote-sunne, Iohn Beare with the quarter-maisters,
Edward Rider, and Geffrey Giles, with the ordinarie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16705:14"/>
marriner, Richard the maisters boy attended on him
and the pilate: shortly after we departed from the port
of S. Iohn de Lowe with all the fleete of Spaine, for
the Port called the Hauana: we were twenty six daies
sayling thither. There wee came in, ancored, tooke in
fresh water, and staied sixteene daies, for the fleete cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Numbredetheos, which is the fleet that brings the
treasure from Perowe.</p>
            <p>The Generall of that fleete was called Diego Flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
de Values. After his comming, when hee had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
his ships, both the fleetes ioyned in one, aud Don
de Valasco de varre was the first fifteene daies general
of both the fleets, who turning through the channell,
called the Bahama, his pilate had like to haue cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all the fleete vppon the Cape called Caneuerall,
which was preuented by me I. H. and our maister Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Barret, I being in the second watch, escried lande,
and called to Robert Barret, bidding him looke ouer
boord, for I saw land vnder the lee bow of the ship: he
called to the bote-sunne, and bad him let flie the fore
sayle sheate, and lay the helme vpon the lee, and cast
the shippe about. When we were cast about, we were
but in seuen fadome water: we shot off a peece, giuing
aduice to the fleet to cast about, and so they did. For
this we were beloued of the General, and all the fleet.
The Generall was in a great rage, and swore by the
king, that hee would hang his pilate: for hee saide, that
twise before, hee had almost cast away the Admirall.
When it was day, he commaunded a peece to be shot
off, to call to councell: the other Admirall in his ship
came vp to him, and asked what the matter was, hee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16705:15"/>
said, that his pilate had cast away his ship &amp; al the fleet,
had it not beene for two of the Englishmen, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee would hang him. The other Admirall with
many faire words perswaded him to the contrary.</p>
            <p>When we came in the height of the Barmotha, we
discouered a monster in the sea, who shewed himselfe,
three times vnto vs from the midle vpwards, in which
parts he was proportioned like a man, of the complec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Mulliato, or tawny Indian. The Generall did
commaund one of his clarkes to put it in writing, and
he certified the king and his nobles thereof. Presently
after this, for the space of sixteene daies wee had won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
fowle weather, and then God sent vs a faire
wind, vntill such time as wee discouered the Iland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Fiall.</p>
            <p>On S. Iames day, we made rackets, wheeles, &amp; other
fire works, to make pastime that night, as it is the order
of the Spanyards. When we came neere the land, our
maister R. Barret conferred with vs, to take the pinnise
one night, when we came on the Iland called the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
to free our selues, from the danger &amp; bondage that
wee were going into, wherevnto we agreed, none had
any pinnice a sterne then but our shippe, which gaue
great courage to our enterprise: we prepared a bagge
of bread, &amp; a buttesio of water, which would haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs 9. daies, &amp; prouided ourselues to go, our master
borrowed a small compas of the master gunner of the
ship, who lent it him, but suspected his intent, &amp; closly
made the generall priuy to it, who for a time dissemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the matter, in the end seeing our pretense, he called
R. Barret, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding his head to be put in the stocks,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16705:15"/>
and a great paire of iron bolts on his legs, and the rest
of vs to be set in the stocks by the legs. Then he wylled
a peece to be shot off, and hee sent the pinnice for the
other Admirall, &amp; all the captaines, maisters, &amp; pilates
of both fleets, to come aboord of him. He commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the maine yard to be strooke downe, &amp; to put two
pullies, on euery yard arme one; the hangman was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and we were willed to confesse our selues, for hee
swore by the king that he would hang vs.</p>
            <p>When the other Admiral, and the rest were come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord,
he called them into his counsell chamber, &amp; told
them that hee would hang the maister of the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and all his company. The Admirall, whose name
was Dego Flores de Values, asked him wherefore: he
sayde, that wee had determined to rise in the night
with the pinnice, and with a ball of fire-worke to sette
the shippe on fire, and goe our wayes: therefore sayde
he, I will haue you, the Captaines, Maisters, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
to sette your handes vnto that, for I sweare by the
King that I will hang them. Dego Flores de Values
aunswered, I, nor the Captaines, Maisters, and Pilates
will not sette our hands to that, for he saide, if hee were
prisoner, as we were, he would haue done the like him
selfe. He counselled him, to keepe vs fast in prison, till
he came into Spayne, and then sende vs to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
house in Ciuil, where, if we had deserued death
the law would passe on vs, for he would not haue it said
that in such a fleet as that was, six men &amp; a boy, should
take the pinnice, and goe away, and so he returned to
his shippe againe.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, the general came to the main mast
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16705:16"/>
to vs, and swore by the king, that we should not come
out of the stockes till we came into Spaine: within six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
daies after wee came ouer the Bar of S. Lucar, &amp;
came vp to the Hurcathoes, then hee put vs into a pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice
in the stocks, and sent vs prisoners to the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
house in Ciuill. From thence, after one yere we
broke prison, on S. Steuens day at night, seauen of our
company escaped, Robert Barret, I, I. H. Iohn Emurie,
Humphrey Roberts, and Iohn Gilbert, were taken, &amp;
brought backe to the Gontratation house, where wee
remained in the stockes till twelfe tide was past. Then
our keeper put vp a petition to the Iudge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratation
house, that we might be sent to the great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
house in Ciuill, for that we broke prison, whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we were presently led thither, where we remayned
one moneth. And then from thence, to the Castell of
the Inquisition house in Triana, where we continued
one yeere, which expired, they brought vs out in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
euery one of vs hauing a candle in his hande,
and the Cote with S. Andrewes crosse on our backes:
they brought vs vp on an high scaffold, that was set vp
in the place of S. Frauncis, which is in the cheefe street
of Ciuill: there they set vs downe vpon benches, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one in his degree, &amp; against vs on another scaffold
sate all the Iudges, and the Clergie on their benches,
the people wondered, and gazed on vs, some pittying
our cases, other said, burne those heretikes. When wee
had sit there two howers, we had a sermon made to vs,
after which one called Bresinnia, secretorie to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
went vp into the pulpit with the processe, &amp;
called Robert Barret and Iohn Gilbart, whom two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16705:16"/>
of the Inquisition brought from the scaffold
before the Iudges, where the secretorie reade the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which was that they should be burnt, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the scaffold, and were burnt.</p>
            <p>Then I Iob Hortop, and Iohn Bone, were called, &amp;
brought to the place, as before, where wee heard our
sentence, which was, that we should go to the Gallies,
and there to rowe at the oares end ten yeeres, and then
to be brought backe to the Inquisition house, to haue
the cote with S. Andrewes crosse put on our backes,
and from thence to go to the euerlasting prison reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse,
and so wee were returned to the scaffold from
whence we came. Thomas Marks, and Thomas Ellis
were called, and had sentence to serue in the Gallies
eight yeeres, and Humphrey Roberts, and Iohn Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to serue fiue yeres, and so were returned to the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
on the scaffold, where wee sate till foure of clocke
in the after noone. Then we were led againe to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
house, from whence we were brought. The
next day in the morning, Bresinia the secretorie came
thither to vs, and deliuered to euerie one of vs his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in writing, I with the rest were sent to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
where we were chained foure and foure together,
euery mans daily allowance was twentie six ounces
of course black bisket and water. Our clothing for the
whole yeare, two shirts, two paire of breches of course
canuas, a red cote of course cloth, soone on, and soone
off, and a gowne of haire with a Friars hoode, our lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
was on the bare bords, and bankes of the Gallies,
our heads and beards were shauen euery month, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
thirst, cold, and stripes, wee lacked none, till our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16705:17"/>
time expired, and after the time of 12 yeeres, for
I serued two yeres aboue my sentence, I was sent backe
to the Inquisition house in Ciuill, &amp; there hauing put
on the cote with S. Andrews crosse, I was sent to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
prison remedilesse, where I wore the cote 4.
yeeres, &amp; then vpon great suite, I had it taken off for 50
duckets, which Hornando de Soria, treasurer of the
kings mint lent me, whom I serued for it as a drudge 7
yeeres, and vntill the moneth of October last, 1590.
and then I came from Ciuil to S. Lucar, where I made
means to come away in a fly-bote, that was laden with
wines &amp; salt, which were Flemmings goodes, the king
of Spaynes subiects, dwelling in Ciuill, maried to Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
women, and sworne to their king. In this moneth
of October last, departing from S. Lucar, at sea, off the
sothernmost Cape, wee met an English ship, called the
Galleon Dudley, who tooke the Flemming, and mee
out of him, &amp; brought me to Portsmouth, where they
set me on land, the 2 day of December last past, 1590.
From thence I was sent by M. Muns the lieutenant of
Portsmouth, with letters to the R. honorable the Earle
of Sussex, who commanded his secretorie to take my
name and examination, how long I had beene out of
England, and with whom I went, which he did. And
on Christmas euen I tooke my leaue of his honor, and
went to Redriffe.</p>

               <l>The Computation of my imprisonment.</l>
               <l>I suffered imprisonment in Mexico two yeeres.</l>
               <l>In the Contratation house in Ciuill one yeere.</l>
               <l>In the Inquisition house in Triana one yeere.</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:16705:17"/>
In the euerlasting prison remedilesse, with the cote
with S. Andrews crosse on my backe, foure yeres.</p>
            <p>And at libertie I serued as a drudge Hornando de
Soria 3 yeres, which is the ful complement of 23 yeres.</p>
            <p>Since my departure from England, vntill this time
of my return, I was fiue times in great danger of death,
besides the many perils I was in, in the Gallyes.</p>
            <p>First in Port of S. Iohn de Low, where being on
shore, with many other of our company, which were
all slaine sauing I, &amp; two other that by swimming got
aboord the Iesus of Libbicke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when we were robd by the wild Indians</p>
            <p>Thirdly, after wee came to Mexico, the vize-king
would haue hanged vs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, because hee could not haue his minde to
hang vs, he would haue burnt vs.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Generall that brought vs into Spayne,
would hane hanged vs at sea.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing truly set downe vnto you my trauels,
misery &amp; dangers, endured the space of 23. yeres, I say:</p>
