         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr late, too late borne, or too soone</hi> dying Prince, <hi>HENRY</hi> of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, your deceased brother, sent for mee, a few monethes before his death. And at my second comming to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, among some other speeches, hee complained much of our Histories of <hi>England;</hi> and that the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is inferiour to none in Honourable actions, should be surpassed by all, in leauing the memorie of them to posteritie. For this cause hee blamed the negligence of former ages: as if they were ignorant of their owne deseruings, as if they esteemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnworthie of their worth.</p>
            <p>I answered, that I conceiued these causes hereof; One, that men of sufficiencie were otherwise employed; either in publicke affaires, or in wrestling with the world, for maintenance or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of their priuate estates. Another is, for that men might safely write of others in maner of atale, but in maner of a History<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:4099:3"/>
safely they could not: because, albeit they should write of men long since dead, and whose posteritie is cleane worne out; yet some aliue, finding themselues foule in those vices, which they see ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, reproued, condemned in others; their guiltinesse maketh them apt to conceiue, that whatsoeuer the words are, the finger pointeth onely at them. The last is, for that the Argument of our <hi>English</hi> historie hath bene so foiled heretofore by some vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie writers, that men of qualitie may esteeme themselues discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by dealing in it.</p>
            <p>And is not this (said he) an errour in vs, to permit euery man to be a writer of Historie? Is it not an errour to be so curious in other matters, and so carelesse in this? We make choise of the most skilfull workemen to draw or carue the portraiture of our faces, and shall euery artlesse Pensell delineate the disposition of our minds? Our apparell must be wrought by the best Artificers, and no soile must be suffered to fall vpon it: and shall our actions, shall our conditions be described by euery bungling hand? Shall euery filthie finger defile our reputation? Shall our Honour be basely buried in the drosse of rude and absurd writings? Wee are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prouide costly Sepulchers, to preserue our dead liues, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue some memorie what wee haue bene: but there is no monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either so durable, or so largely extending, or so liuely and faire, as that which is framed by a fortunate penne; the memory of the greatest Monuments had long since perished, had it not bene preserued by this meanes.</p>
            <p>To this I added; that I did alwayes conceiue, that we should make our reckoning of three sorts of life: the short life of nature, the long life of fame, and the eternall life of glorie. The life of glorie is so farre esteemed before the other two, as grace is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in vs: the life of fame before our naturall life is so farre esteemed, as a generous spirit surmounteth sensualitie; as humane nature ouerruleth brutish disposition. So farre as the noble na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man hath dominion in our minds, so farre do we contemne, either the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, or dangers, or life of our body, in regard of our reputation and fame. Now seeing this life of fame is both preserued and enlarged chiefly by history; there is no man (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) that will either resist, or not assist, the commendable or at
<pb facs="tcp:4099:3"/>
least tolerable writing thereof, but such as are conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, either that no good, or that nothing but ill, can bee repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them. In whom notwithstanding it is an errour to thinke, that any power of the present time, can either extinguish or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure the memorie of times succeeding. Posteritie will giue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man his due: Some ages hereafter will affoord those, who will report vnpartially of all.</p>
            <p>Then he questioned, whether I had wrote any part of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Historie, other then that which had been published; which at that time he had in his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I answered, that I had wrote of certaine of our <hi>English</hi> Kings, by way of a briefe description of their liues: but for historie, I did principally bend, and binde my selfe to the times wherein I should liue; in which my owne obseruations might somewhat direct me: but as well in the one as in the other I had at that time perfected nothing.</p>
            <p>To this he said; that in regard of the honour of the time, hee liked well of the last; but for his owne instruction, he more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the first: that he desired nothing more then to know the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Auncestours; because hee did so farre esteeme his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent from them, as he approached neere them in honourable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours. Hereupon, beautifying his face with a sober smile, he desired mee, that against his returne from the progresse then at hand, <hi>I</hi> would perfect somewhat of both sorts for him, which he promised amply to requite; and was well knowen to be one, who esteemed his word aboue ordinary respects. This stirred in mee, not onely a will, but power to perfourme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as engaging my duety farre aboue the measure either of my leisure or of my strength, I finished the liues of these three Kings of <hi>Norman</hi> race, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeeres of Queene <hi>ELIZABETHS</hi> Reigne.</p>
            <p>At his returne from the Progresse to his house at <hi>S. Iames,</hi> these pieces were deliuered vnto him; which hee did not onely courteously, but ioyfully accept. And because this seemed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worke, he expressed a desire that it should be published. Not long after he died; and with him died both my endeauours and my hopes. His death, alasse! hath bound the liues of many vnto death, face to face; being no wayes able, either by forgetfulnesse to couer their griefe, or to diminish it with consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4099:4"/>For in trueth he was a Prince of a most Heroical heart: Free from many vices which sometimes accompanie high estates, full of most amiable and admirable vertues: of whose perfections the world was not worthy. His eyes were full of pleasant modestie; his countenance manly beautifull; in bodie both strongly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately made; in behauiour sweet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ly sober, which gaue grace to whatsoeuer he did. He was of a discerning wit; and for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of his mind, of great capacitie and power, accompanied with equall expedition of will: much foreseeing in his actions, and for passions a commander of himselfe; and of good strength to resist the power of prosperitie. In counsaile he was ripe and measured, in resolution constant, his word euer led by his thought, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his deede. And albeit hee was but yong and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forward and free, yet his wisedome reduced both to a true temper of moderation; his desires being neuer aboue his reason, nor his hopes inferiour to his desires. In a word, hee was the most faire fruit of his Progenitours, an excellent ornament of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age, a true mirrour to posteritie: being so equally both setled to valour, and disposed to goodnesse and Iustice, as hee expressed not onely tokens, but proofes, both of a courage, and of a grauitie and industrie right worthie of his estate.</p>
            <p>Glorious Prince, my loue and duety hath caried me further, then happily is fit for the present purpose: and yet this is but an earnest onely of my earnest affection and zeale to thy Honour. I shall hereafter haue a more proper place to display at large, the goodlinesse of thy shape, the goodnesse of thy nature, the greatnesse of thy minde: all thy <hi>perfections,</hi> whereby our <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> were much enflamed. And euillworthy may he be of any happy hopes, who will not adde one blast of his breath, to make vp the glorious gale of thy fame.</p>
            <p>In the meane time I haue here accomplished his desire in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this worke: More to testifie to the world the height of his heart, then for any pleasure I haue to set foorth any thing, to the view of these both captious and vnthankefull times; wherein men will be, not readers onely, but interpreters, but wresters, but corrupters and deprauers of that which they reade; wherein men thinke the reproofe of others, to be the greatest parcell of their
<pb facs="tcp:4099:4"/>
owne praise. But how should I expect any better vsage? The Commentaries of <hi>Caesar,</hi> neuer disliked before, are esteemed by <hi>Lypsius,</hi> a dry saplesse piece of writing. The most famous <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> is tearmed by <hi>Alceate,</hi>

Secondly, for that the persons of whom it treateth, are those most worthy Ancestors of yours, who laid the foundation of this English Empire; who were eminent among all the Princes of their times, and happely for many ages after, as well in actions of Peace as of Warre. Lastly, for that I esteeme Histories the fittest subiect for your Highnesse reading: For by diligent perusing the actes of great men, by considering all the circumstances of them, by comparing Counsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But because many errours doe vsually arise, by ignorance of the State wherein we liue; because it is dangerous to frame rules of Policie out of Countreys differing from vs, both in nature, and custome of life, and forme of gouernment; no Histories are so profitable as our owne. In these your Highnesse may see, the noble disposition and delights of your Ancestors; what were their sweete walkes, what their pleasant Chases: how farre they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred glory, before either pleasure or safetie; how by the braue behauiour of their sword, they hewed honour out of the sides of their enemies. In these you may see, the largenesse, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and strength of this Countrey; the nature of the people,
<pb facs="tcp:4099:5"/>
their wealth, pleasure, exercise and trade of life, and what else is worthy of obseruation. Generally, by these you may so furnish your selfe, as not easily to be abused either by weake or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aduise.</p>
            <p>The Most <hi>High</hi> preserue and prosper your <hi>Highnesse:</hi> that as you <hi>succeed</hi> many excellent Ancestours in blood, so you may <hi>exceed</hi> them all in Honourable atchieuements.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>OBERT Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> the sixth in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Rollo,</hi> riding through <hi>Falais</hi> a towne in <hi>Normandie,</hi> espied certaine yong persons dauncing neere the way. And as he stayed to view a while the maner of their disport, he fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eye especially vpon a certaine damosell named <hi>Arlotte;</hi> of meane birth, a Skinners daughter, who there daunced among the rest. The frame and comely carriage of her body, the naturall beautie and graces of her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the simplicitie of her rurall both beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and attire pleased him so well, that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4099:6"/>
same night he procured her to be brought to his lodging; where he begate of her a sonne, who afterward was named <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not defile my writing with memory of some lasciuious behauiour which she is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue vsed, at such time as the Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched to embrace her. And doubtfull it is, whether vpon some speciall note of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie in herselfe, or whether vpon hate towards her sonne, the English afterwards adding an aspiration to her name (according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall maner of their pronouncing) termed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnchast woman <hi>Harlot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is remembred by some, rather seruile then fond in obseruations, who will either finde or frame predictions for euery great action or euent; that his mother before the time of her deliuery had a dreame, that her bowels were extended ouer <hi>Normandie</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> Also, that at the time of his birth, he fell from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers body to the ground; and there filled both his hands with rushes, which had bene cast thicke vpon the floore, and streined them with a very streit gripe. The wiues laughed at large, and soone grew prodigall of idle talke. But the Midwife somewhat more soberly said;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4099:6"/>
That he should not onely hold well his owne, but graspe somewhat from other men.</p>
            <p>When he was about 9. yeeres of age, his father went vpon deuotion to <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and in his returne died at the Citie of <hi>Nice.</hi> So <hi>William</hi> at that age succeeded his father; hauing then very generous and aspiring spirits, both to resist abroad, and to rule at home. Hee was committed to the gouernment of two of his vnckles; and the French King was entreated by his father to take vpon him the protection, both of his person and State. But his vnckles pretended title to his dignitie, by reason of his vnlawfull birth; the King of France also desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much and had often attempted to reduce <hi>Normandie</hi> to his absolute subiection, as it was before the inuasion of the <hi>Normans.</hi> So as it may seeme he was committed to these Tutors, as a Lambe should be committed to the tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of wolues. The onely meanes of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation consisted in a factious Nobilitie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into so many parts, as there were parties: Some contending for possession of the yong Dukes person; others, of his authoritie and power; all of them incompatible to endure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equals, or els superiours: All of them vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4099:7"/>
against a common enemie; all deuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues.</p>
            <p>Here it may be demanded how he being vnlawfully borne, could succeed his father in the dutchie of <hi>Normandie;</hi> his father leauing two brothers borne in lawfull marriage, and much other legitimate kindred behind him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will. Malmesburie</hi> and some others haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. in princ. Ingulph. lib. 6. cap. 19.</note> that albeit hee was borne out of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, yet Duke <hi>Robert</hi> his father did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards entertaine his mother for lawfull wife: which by the Law of that Countrey, agreeable in that point to the Ciuill and Canon Lawes, sufficed to make the issue inheritable, although borne before.</p>
            <p>And further, it was a generall custome at that time in France, that bastards did succeed, euen in dignities of highest condition, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then children lawfully begotten. <hi>Thierrie</hi> bastard of <hi>Clouis,</hi> had for his partage with the lawfull children of the same <hi>Clouis,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Austrasie,</hi> now called <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine. Sigisbert</hi> bastard of King <hi>Dagobert</hi> the first, had his part in the Kingdome of France, with <hi>Clouis</hi> the 12. lawfull sonne to <hi>Dagobert. Loys</hi> and <hi>Carloman</hi> bastards of King <hi>Loys le</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:4099:7"/>
               <hi>Begue,</hi> succeeded after the death of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So likewise in <hi>England, Alfride</hi> bastard sonne of <hi>Oswine,</hi> succeeded his brother <hi>Egfride. So Adelstane</hi> the bastard sonne of <hi>Edward</hi> the elder, succeeded his father, before <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Eldred</hi> his yonger brother; notwithstanding they were lawfully begotten. So <hi>Edmund,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the <hi>Martyr,</hi> Bastard sonne to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> succeeded him in the state, before <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi> his lawfull issue. Afterward, <hi>Harold</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Harefoote,</hi> bastard to <hi>Canutus,</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in the kingdome, before <hi>Hardicanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> his lawfull sonne. The like custome hath been obserued in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in <hi>Portugale,</hi> and in diuers other countreys. And it is probable that this vse was grounded vpon often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that bastards (as begotten in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est heate and strength of affection) haue many times been men of excellent proofe, both in courage and in vnderstanding.

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:4099:8"/>And yet in the third race of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> a law was made, that bastards should not inherite the Crowne of the Realme. This custome was likewise banished out of <hi>England,</hi> and other countreys of <hi>Europe.</hi> Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in <hi>France,</hi> other bastards of great houses were still aduowed.</p>
            <p>The exercises of this Duke from his verie youth were ingenuous, manly, decent, &amp; such as tended to actiuitie and valure: Hee was of a working minde and vehement spirit, rather ambitious then onely desirous of glory: of a piercing wit, blind in no mans cause, and well sighted in his owne: of a liuely and present cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; neither out of ignorance, or rash estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dangers, but out of a true iudgement both of himselfe and of them. In peace he was politicke: In warre valiant and very skilfull, both to espie, and to apprehend, and to follow his aduantages: this valure and skill in milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie affayres, was alwayes seconded with good successe. He was continually accustomed both to the weight and vse of armour, from his very childhood. Oftentimes hee looked death in the face with a braue contempt. He was neuer free from actions of armes; first vpon necessity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4099:8"/>
to defend himselfe, afterwards vpon ambition to offend and disturbe the possessions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>In his first age he was much infested with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in <hi>Normandie;</hi> who often conspired both against his life, and against his dignitie and State; traducing him, as a bastard, as a boy, as borne of a base ignoble woman, as altogether vnworthy to be their Prince. Of these, some he appeased and reconciled vnto him: others he preuented, and dispersed their power before it was collected: others hee encountred in open field, before he had any haire vpon his face; where hee defeated their forces in full battell, then tooke their strong holds, and lastly chased them out of his dominion.</p>
            <p>And first <hi>Roger Tresuye,</hi> hauing gained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great both fauour and reputation by his seruices against the <hi>Sarasins</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> made claime to the duchie of <hi>Normandie;</hi> as one lawfully descended from <hi>Rollo</hi> their first Duke. And albeit many others were before him in title, yet (said he) if they will sit still; if they, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through sloath, which is ill, or through feare, which is worse, will abandone the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he alone would free the <hi>Normans</hi> from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4099:9"/>
their infamous subiection. He was followed by many, partly vpon opinion of his right, but chiefly of his valour. But when he brought his cause to the arbitrement of Armes, hee was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne in a strong battaile, wherein his claime and his life determined together.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Arques,</hi> sonne to <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and vnckle to Duke <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> vpon the same pretence declared himselfe against his nephew. And albeit the <hi>Normans</hi> were heauie to stirre in his fauour, yet hee so wrought with the French King, by assuring him great matters in <hi>Normandie,</hi> that with a mightie armie of his owne people, hee went in person, to place him in possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that dutchy. The way which the King tooke, led him to a large valley, sandie and full of short bushes and shrubs; troublesome for horsemen either to fight or to march. On either side were rising hils, very thicke set with wood. Here the Armie entred with small aduisement, either for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the passage, or for the safetie of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. The Vaward consisted chiefly of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-axes and pikes. In the right wing were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Almans</hi> among the <hi>French.</hi> In the left were many of <hi>Aniou</hi> and <hi>Poictou.</hi> After these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4099:9"/>
the baggage, with an infinite number of scullians, carters and other base drudges at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vpon it. Next came the French King with the maine battaile, consisting for the most part of valiant and worthy Gentlemen, braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted. The lances and men at Armes cloased the Rereward.</p>
            <p>When they were well entred this valley, the <hi>Normans</hi> did liuely charge vpon them in head; they deliuered also their deadly shot from the hils on both sides, as thicke as haile. Notwithstanding the Vantgard, casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into a pointed battaile in forme of a wedge, with plaine force of hand made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues way; and marching in firme and close order through the thickest of their enemies, gained (albeit not without great losse) the top of a hill, and there presently encamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The like fortune happily might the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue haue had, if they had followed with the like order and courage. But failing herein, the right wing was hewed in pieces: the left wing was broken and beaten vpon the carriages; where ouerbearing and treading downe one an other, they receiued almost as much hurt from themselues, as they did from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4099:10"/>
The maine battaile and Rereward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing forward to rescue the carriage, were first miserably ouerwhelmed with a storme of arrowes from the hill on both sides: and the gallant horses once galled with that shot, would no more obey or endure their riders; but flinging out, either ouerthrew or disordred all in their way. And the more to encrease the miserie of that day, the dust and light sand which was raised, partly by the feete of horses and men, and partly by violence of the wind, which then blew full in the faces of the <hi>French,</hi> inuolued them all as in a thicke and darke cloud; which depriued them of all foresight and direction in gouerning their affaires. The valiant was nothing discerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the coward, no difference could be set betweene contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance and chance: All laboured in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamitie, and euery one encreased the feare of his fellow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> hauing well spent their shot, and perceiuing the <hi>French</hi> in this sort both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and dismayed, came downe from the hils where they houered before; and falling to the close stroke of battaile-axe and sword, most cruelly raged in the blood of their enemies. By
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4099:10"/>
whom if any sparke of valour was shewen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at so great disaduantage, it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it was altogether lost; it was so farre from relieuing others, that it was not sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselues. And doubtlesse no thing so much fauoured the state of the <hi>French</hi> that day, as that the number of the <hi>Normans</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not to enclose them behind. For then they had bene entrapped as Deere in a toile; then not one of them could haue escaped. But the entrance of the valley remayning open, many f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed backe to the plaine ground; tumbling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in such headlong hast, that if the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had sharply put vpon them the chase, it is certaine that they had bene extreemely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. But the Duke gaue ouer the execution vpon good aduise. For knowing himselfe not to be of force vtterly to vanquish the <hi>French,</hi> he assayed rather by faire forbearance to purchase their friendship.</p>
            <p>Here the French king assembled his broken companies, and encamped them for that night so well as he could. The ioy of their present escape expelled for the time all other respects. But after a little breathing, their remembrance began to runne vpon the losse of their cariages;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4099:11"/>
whereby they had lost all meanes to refresh themselues. Of their Vaward they made a forelorne reckoning, and the like did the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of them. Many were wounded, all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and the <hi>Normans</hi> gaue notice by soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out their instruments of warre, that they were at hand on euery side. The rudest of the Souldiers did boldly vpbraid this infortunitie to the King; one asked him where his Vaward was, where were his wings, where were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of his battell, and Rereward. Others cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the cariages, to preserue those in life who had not been slaine. Others demanded if he had any more mouse-traps to leade them into. But most sate heauy and pensiue, scarce accounting themselues among the liuing. The King swallowed downe all with a sad silence, sometimes he dissembled as though he had not heard; sometimes hee would fairely answere; <hi>Good words, good souldiers; haue patience a while, and all will be well:</hi> which was indeede a truer word then he thought it possible to bee when he spake it.</p>
            <p>In this extremity the King assembled the chiefe of his commanders, to aduise with them what was best to be done. It was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4099:11"/>
that in staying their case was desperate; and dangerous it was to stirre. But here lay the question; whether it was least dangerous to remoue together, or euery man to shift for himselfe. Whilest this point was in debating, whilest they expected euery minute to be aslai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whilest no man saw any thing but death and despaire; behold, a messenger came from the Duke, not to offer but to desire peace; and to craue protection of the French king, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the trust which <hi>Robert</hi> the Dukes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reposed in him. There needed not many words to perswade. Peace was signed, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on assured, in a more ample maner then it was required. Then the messenger with many good words appeased the Kings heauinesse, telling him, that his Vaward was safe, his cariages not touched, and that he should be furnished with horses both for burthen and draught, in stead of those that had been slaine. These words, as a sweete enchantment, rauished the <hi>French</hi> King with sudden ioy. But when they came to gather vp their baggage, a spectacle both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and loathsome was presented vnto them. The valley couered, and in some places heaped with dead bodies of men and horses:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4099:12"/>
many not once touched with any weapon, lay troden to death, or else stifled with dust and sand: many grieuously wounded, reteined some remainder of life, which they expressed with cries and groanes: many not mortally hurt, were so ouerlaid with the slaine, that they were vnable to free themselues: towards whom it is memorable, what manly both pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and helpe the <hi>Normans</hi> did affoord. And so the <hi>French</hi> King more by courtesie of his enemies, then either by courage or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne, returned in reasonable state to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon these euents of open hostilitie, <hi>Guy</hi> Earle of <hi>Burgogne,</hi> who had taken to wife <hi>Alix,</hi> daughter to Duke <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and Aunt to Duke <hi>William,</hi> conspired with <hi>Nicellus</hi> president of <hi>Constantine, Ranulph</hi> Vicecount of <hi>Bayon, Baimond,</hi> and diuers others, suddenly to surprise the Duke, and slay him in the night. A certaine foole, (nothing regarded for his want of wit) obseruing their preparations, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly got away, and in the dead of the night came to <hi>Valogne,</hi> where the Duke then lay; no lesse slenderly guarded with men, then the place it selfe was sleight for defence. Here he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4099:12"/>
continued rapping at the gate, and crying out, vntill it was opened, and hee brought to the presence of the Duke. To whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the conspiracie, with circumstances of such moment, that the Duke foorthwith tooke his horse, and posted alone towards <hi>Falais,</hi> an especial place for strength of defence. Presently after his departure the conspirators came to <hi>Valogne,</hi> they beset the house, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by force, they search euery corner for the Duke: And finding that the game was start, and on foote, in hote haste they pursued the chase.</p>
            <p>About breake of day the Dukes horse tired, and he was ignorant of his right way. He was then at a little village called <hi>Rie,</hi> where the chiefe Gentleman of the place was standing at his doore ready to goe abroad. Of him the Duke enquired the next way to <hi>Falais.</hi> The Gentleman knew the Duke, and with all duetie and respect desired to know the cause of his both solitarie and vntimely riding. The Duke would willingly haue passed vnknowne; but perceiuing himselfe to be discouered, declared to him the whole aduenture. Hereupon the Gentleman furnished him with a fresh horse,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4099:13"/>
and sent with him two of his sonnes to conduct him the direct way to <hi>Falais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner were they out of sight, but the conspirators came, and enquired of the same Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>leman (who still remained at his doore) whether he saw not the Duke that morning: as if, forsooth, they were come to attend him. The Gentleman answered, that he was gone a little before, and therewith offered them his company to ouertake him. But he lead them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout another way, vntill the Duke was safely alighted at <hi>Falais.</hi> And thus the more we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these and the like passages of affaires, the lesse we shall admire either the wisdome, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, or any other sufficiencie of man. In acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of weight it is good to employ our best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours; but when all is done, he danceth well to whom Fortune doeth pipe.</p>
            <p>When the conspirators vnderstood that their principall purpose was disappointed, they made themselues so powerfull in the field, that the Duke was enforced to craue ayde of the King of <hi>France;</hi> who not long before was his greatest enemie. The King preferring to his remembrance the late honourable dealing of the Duke, came in person vnto him; by whose
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4099:13"/>
countenance and aide the Duke ouerthrew his enemies in a full battell, in the vale of <hi>Dunes:</hi> albeit not without great difficultie, and bold aduenture of his owne person. <hi>Guy de Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogne</hi> escaped by flight, and defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in certaine castles which he had fortified in <hi>Normandie</hi> for his retreite; but in the end hee rendred both himselfe and them to the Dukes discretion. The Duke not onely pardoned him, but honoured him with a liberall pension; which he did afterward both with valiant and loyall seruice requite.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the French King had wars against <hi>Ieoffrey Martell,</hi> and Duke <hi>William</hi> went with a faire companie of Souldiers to his ayde. In this seruice he so wel acquited himselfe, both in iudgement and in hand, that the French King was chiefly directed by him; onely bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him for too carelesse casting himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouth of dangers; imputing that to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation, which was but the heate of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and age. Oftentimes hee would range from the maine battell with very fewe in his company; either to make discoueries, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter such enemies as could not bee found with greater troupes. Once hee withdrew
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4099:14"/>
himselfe onely with foure, and was met with by fifteene of the enemies. The most forward of them he strake from his horse, and brake his thigh with the fall. The residue hee chased foure miles; and most of them being hurt, tooke seuen prisoners. Hereupon <hi>Ieoffrey Martell</hi> then said of him; that he was at that time the best souldier, and was like to prooue the best commander in the world.</p>
            <p>And as hee was both fauourable and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full towards them who fairely yeelded, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as either obstinately or scornefully caried themselues, he was extreamely seuere, or rather cruell. When hee besieged <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> had taken from him, the defendants would often crie from the walles, <hi>Lapel Lapel;</hi> reproaching him thereby with the birth of his mother. This base insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as it enflamed both his desire and courage to atchieue the enterprise, so did it his fury, to deale sharpely with them when they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; by cutting off their hands and feete, and by other seuerities which were not vsuall.</p>
            <p>Besides these, some others of his owne blood prouoked <hi>Engelrame</hi> Earle of <hi>Ponthieu</hi> to moue against him in armes: but the Duke receiued
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4099:14"/>
him with so resolute valour, that the Earle was slaine in the field, and they well chastised who drew him to the enterprise. The <hi>Britaines</hi> did often feele the force of his victorious armes. Hee had many conflicts with <hi>Ieoffrey Martell</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou,</hi> confederate with the Princes of <hi>Britane, Aquitaine,</hi> and <hi>Tours;</hi> a man equall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him both in power and in skill to command, but in fortune and in force of arme much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. Many excellent atchieuements were performed betweene them; insomuch as their hostilitie seemed onely to bee an emulation in honour. Once the Duke fell into an ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment addressed for him by the Earle of <hi>Aniou;</hi> wherewith he was so suddenly surprized, that he was almost in the midst of the danger before he thought any danger neere him. An excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great both terrour and confusion seazed vpon his souldiers; because the more sudden and vncertaine a perill is, the greater is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes esteemed. Many of his brauest men were slaine; the residue so disordered, or at least shaken, as they began to thinke more of their particular escape, then of the common ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther safety or glory.</p>
            <p>When they were thus vpon the point to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4099:15"/>
the Duke rather with rage then courage cried vnto them, <hi>If you loue me not Souldiers, yet for shame follow me; for shame stand by mee; for shame let not any of your friends heare the report, that you ran from mee and left me fighting.</hi> With that he threw himselfe into the thickest throng of his enimies, and denounced those either traitours or cowards who would not follow. This example breathed such braue life into his Souldiers, that they rallied their loose rankes, and in close order seconded him with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute charge: encouraging one another, that it was shameful indeede not to fight for him, who so manfully did fight with them. The Duke brandishing his sword like a thunderbolt, dung downe his enemies on euery side; made at Earle <hi>Martell</hi> in the midst of his battallion, strake him downe, claue his helmet, and cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one of his eares. This so diuerted the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouans</hi> to the rescue of their Earle, that they let the other part of the victorie goe. The Earle they recouered againe to horse, and so left the Duke master of the field. Verely, it is almost impossible, that a commander of such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage should haue, either faint or false hearted Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:4099:15"/>Now it happened not long before, that <hi>Fulc</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou</hi> hauing drawen <hi>Herbert</hi> Earle of <hi>Maine</hi> vnder faire pretenses to <hi>Xantonge,</hi> cast him in prison, from whence he could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased vntill he had yeelded to certaine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both dishonourable and disaduantagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto him. <hi>Hugh</hi> succeded <hi>Herbert;</hi> from whom <hi>Ieoffrey Martell</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou</hi> tooke the citie of <hi>Maine,</hi> and made himselfe lord of all the countrey. <hi>Hugh</hi> hauing lost his dominion, left both his title and his quarrell to his sonne <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert:</hi> who hauing no issue, appointed Duke <hi>William</hi> to bee his heire. Hereupon the Duke inuaded <hi>Maine,</hi> and in short time subdued the whole countrey, and built two fortifications for assurance thereof; hauing first sent word to the Earle of <hi>Aniou,</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what day the worke should begin. The Earle vsed all diligence and means to impeach the buildings; but hee not onely failed of that purpose, but further lost the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Medune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> did many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times with great preparation inuade his Countrey; sometimes with purpose to winne vpon him, and sometimes to keepe him from winning vpon others. Vpon a time the King
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4099:16"/>
led his troupes ouer the foord of <hi>Dine;</hi> and when halfe his army had passed, the other halfe by reason of the rising of the Sea, was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to stay. The Duke apprehending the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, came vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them with a furious charge, being now deuided from the chiefe of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; and either slew them or tooke them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, in the plaine view of their King. After this they concluded a peace, whereof the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were, That the Duke should release such prisoners as he had taken; and that hee should retaine whatsoeuer he had wonne, or afterwards should winne from the Earle of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iou.</hi> And yet the King did againe enterprise vpon him, with greater forces then at any time before: But the Duke entertained his Armies with so good order and valoure, that the King gained nothing but losse and dishonour: and the greater his desire was of victorie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, the more foule did his foiles and failings appeare; which so brake both his courage and heart, that with griefe thereof (as it was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) hee ended his life. And thus during all the time that he was onely Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> he was neuer free from action of armes: in all his actions of armes hee was caried with a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4099:16"/>
most rare and perpetuall felicitie.</p>
            <p>As he grew in yeeres, so did he in thicknesse and fatnesse of body: but so, as it made him neither vnseemely, nor vnseruiceable for the warres; and neuer much exceeding the measure of a comely corpulencie. He was most decent, and there with terrible in armes. He was stately and maiesticall in his gesture; of a good sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in strength admirable: in so much as no man was able to draw his bow, which hee would bend sitting vpon his horse, stretching out the string with his foot. His countenance was warlike and manly as his friends might terme it; but as his enemies said, truculent and fierce. He would often sweare <hi>By Gods resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and his brightnesse:</hi> which he commonly pronounced with so furious a face, that hee strooke a terrour into those that were present. His head was bald; his beard alwayes shauen; which fashion being first taken vp by him, was then followed by all the <hi>Normans.</hi> Hee was of a firme and strong constitution for his health; so as he neuer was attached with sicknesse, but that which was the summons of his death: and in his age seemed little to feele the heauie weight and burthen of yeeres.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:4099:17"/>In his first age he was of a mild and gentle disposition; courteous, bountifull, familiar in conuersation, a professed enemie to all vices. But as in Fortune, as in yeres, so changed he in his behauiour; partly by his continuall follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the warres (whereby he was much fleshed in blood) and partly by the inconstant nature of the people ouer whom he ruled: who by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rebellions did not onely exasperate him to some seueritie, but euen constraine him to hold them in with a more stiffe arme. So hee did wring from his subiects very much substance, very much blood; not for that he was by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either couetous or cruell, but for that his affaires could not otherwise be managed. His great affaires could not be managed without great expence, which drew a necessity of charge vpon the people: neither could the often rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of his Subiects be repressed or restrained by any mild and moderate meanes. And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally as in all States and gouernments, seuere discipline hath alwayes bin a true faithfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vertue and valour; so in particular of his <hi>Normans</hi> he learned by experience, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times declared this iudgement: That if they were held in bridle, they were most valiant, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4099:17"/>
almost inuincible; excelling all men both in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and in strength, and in honourable desire to vanquish their enemies. But if the reines were layd loose vpon their necke, they were apt to runne into licentiousnes and mischiefe; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to consume either themselues by riot and sloath, or one another by sedition: prone to innouation and change; as heauily mooued to vndertake dangers, so not to bee trusted vpon occasion.</p>
            <p>He tooke to wife <hi>Matilde</hi> daughter to <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> a man for his wisedome and power, both reuerenced and feared euen of Kings; but because she was his cousin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, he was for his marriage excommunicate by his owne vnckle <hi>Mauger</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Roan.</hi> Hereupon he sued to Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> and obteined of him a dispensation: and afterwards so wrought, that by a prouinciall Councell his vncle <hi>Mauger</hi> was depriued of his dignitie. But by this meanes both he &amp; his issue were firmely locked in obedience to the Sea of <hi>Rome;</hi> for that vpon the authoritie of that place the validitie of his marriage, and consequently the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his issue seemed to depend.</p>
            <p>When he was about 50. yeeres of age, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:4099:18"/>
King of <hi>England</hi> ended his life. This <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> was sonne to <hi>Egelred</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Emma,</hi> sister to <hi>Richard</hi> the second Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> who was grandfather to Duke<note place="margin">

               <hi>William:</hi> so as King <hi>Edward</hi> and Duke <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> were cousins germane once remoued. At such time as <hi>Egelred</hi> was first ouercharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with warres by the <hi>Danes,</hi> he sent his wife <hi>Emma,</hi> with two sonnes which she had borne vnto him, <hi>Alphred</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> into <hi>Normandie</hi> to her brother; where they were enterteined with all honourable vsage for many yeeres. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward giuing place to the malice of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he passed also into <hi>Normandie,</hi> and left his whole state in the possession and power of <hi>Swanus</hi> King of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> But after the death of <hi>Swanus,</hi> partly by the aide of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and partly by fauour of his owne people, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered his Kingdome, and left the same to his eldest sonne <hi>Edmund.</hi> who either for the tough temper of his courage and strength, or for that he almost alwayes liued in Armes, was surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ironside.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Canutus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Swanus</hi> made sharpe warre, first against <hi>Egelred,</hi> then against <hi>Edmund:</hi> and finally after many varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4099:18"/>
of aduenture, but chiefly by the fauour of the Clergie of <hi>England</hi> (because they had sworne allegiance to his father) spread the wings of his victory ouer the whole Kingdome. He expelled out of the Realme <hi>Edwine</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the two sonnes of King <hi>Edmund:</hi> of whom <hi>Edwine</hi> married the Kings daughter of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> but died without issue; <hi>Edward</hi> was aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the marriage of <hi>Agatha</hi> daughter to the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> and by her had issue two sonnes, <hi>Edmund</hi> &amp; <hi>Edgar,</hi> and so many daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Margaret</hi> and <hi>Christine.</hi> The same <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> tooke <hi>Emma</hi> to wife, who had bene wife to King <hi>Egelred;</hi> by whom he had a sonne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Hardicanutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Canutus, Alphred</hi> the sonne of <hi>Egelred</hi> came out of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie saile landed at <hi>Sandwich:</hi> with purpose to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the recouerie of his fathers kingdome. In which enterprise hee receiued not onely encouragement, but good assurance from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>English</hi> Nobilitie. But by Earle <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> he was abused and taken; his company slaine, his eyes put out, and then sent to the Ile of <hi>Elie,</hi> where in short time hee ended his life. <hi>Edward</hi> also arriued at <hi>Hampton</hi> with 40. ships,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4099:19"/>
but finding the Countrey so farre from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as they were ready to resist him, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>Normandie,</hi> and attended the further fauour of time. So after <hi>Canutus</hi> succeeded in <hi>England,</hi> first <hi>Harold</hi> sirnamed <hi>Harefoot,</hi> bastard sonne to <hi>Canutus;</hi> and after him <hi>Hardicanutus,</hi> sonne to <hi>Canutus</hi> by <hi>Emma,</hi> mother also to King <hi>Edward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hardicanutus</hi> being dead, the Nobilitie of the Realme sent into <hi>Normandie</hi> for <hi>Edward</hi> to be their King; whereto also he was appointed as some haue written by <hi>Hardicanutus.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Alphred</hi> his brother vpon the like inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had bene traiterously taken and slaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>William</hi> at that time Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> would not permit him to depart, vntill he had receiued for pledges of his safety, <hi>Woolnoth</hi> son to Earle <hi>Goodwine,</hi> and <hi>Hacon</hi> sonne to <hi>Swaine,</hi> Earle <hi>Goodwins</hi> eldest sonne. Vpon this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he was furnished by the duke his cousin, with all meanes fit both for his enterprise and estate. And so hee passed the Seas, arriued in <hi>England,</hi> and with generall iov was receiued for King. He tooke to wife <hi>Edith</hi> the daughter of Earle <hi>Goodwine;</hi> but whether vpon vow of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, or whether vpon impotencie of nature, or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4099:19"/>
whether vpon hatred to her father, or whether vpon suspition against herselfe (for all these causes are alleaged by seuerall writers of those times) he forbore all priuate familiaritie with her.</p>
            <p>When he was well locked into the chaire of State, Duke <hi>William</hi> came out of <hi>Normandie</hi> to see him, to shew his magnificence to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> people; to shew to the <hi>English,</hi> both that he loued their King, and that he was of power to relieue him, in case his necessities should so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Here, besides honourable enterteine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, besides many rich gifts both to himselfe and to his followers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King hauing neither hope nor desire of issue, promised him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his great fauours and deserts, that hee should be his next successour in the Kingdome. And for further assurance thereof, sent him also the like message into <hi>Normandie,</hi> by <hi>Robert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Harold</hi> sonne to Earle <hi>Goodwine</hi> passed the Seas into <hi>Normandie,</hi> to deale for the discharge of his brother <hi>Wolnoth</hi> and <hi>Hacon</hi> his nephew, who had bene deliuered for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages to the Duke. In his passage he was much tossed with troublesome weather, and in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4099:20"/>
end was cast vpon the coast of <hi>Ponthieu,</hi> and there taken by the Earle and committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But at the request of the Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> hee was released with honourable respect, and by the Earle himselfe accompanied to the Duke; who enterteined him with great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence at <hi>Roan.</hi> The Duke was then going in Armes against the <hi>Britaines;</hi> in which iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>Harold</hi> did accompany him, and shewed himselfe a man, neither rash in vndertaking, nor fearefull in perfourming any seruices of the field. After prosperous returne, the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to <hi>Harold,</hi> the purpose of King <hi>Edward</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Dukes succession to this Crowne. <hi>Harold</hi> did auow the same to be true; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to affoord thereto the best furtherance that he could. Hereupon the Duke assembled a Councell at <hi>Boneuill;</hi> where <hi>Harold</hi> did sweare fidelitie vnto him: and promised likewise by oath, that after the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> he would keepe the Realme of <hi>England</hi> to the vse of the Duke: that he would deliuer vnto him the castle of <hi>Douer,</hi> and certaine other pieces of defence, furnished at his owne charge. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke promised vnto him his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in marriage, and with her halfe the Realme
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4099:20"/>
of <hi>England</hi> in name of her dower. He also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to him his nephew <hi>Hacon;</hi> but kept his brother <hi>Wolnoth</hi> as an hostage, for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that which <hi>Harold</hi> had sworne.</p>
            <p>In short time after King <hi>Edward</hi> died, and <hi>Harold</hi> being generall commander of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Realme, seized vpon the soueraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and without any accustomed solemnities set the crowne vpon his owne head. The people were nothing curious to examine titles; but as men broken with long bondage, did easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the first pretender. And yet to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> they were inclinable enough, as well vpon opinion of his prowesse, as for that hee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to winne their fauour, partly by aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their grieuous paiments, and partly by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the wages of his seruants and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; generally, by vsing iustice with clemencie and courtesie towards all.

the English and Saxons against the Britaines, afterward by the seuen <hi>Saxon</hi> kingdomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, and then lastly by the <hi>Danes.</hi> By meanes whereof the kingdome at that time could not bee setled in any certaine forme of succession by blood, as it hath been since; but was held for the most part in absolute domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and did often passe by transaction or gift: and he whose sword could cut best, was alwaies adiudged to haue most right.

            <p>Touching his propinquity in blood to King <hi>Edward</hi> by the mothers side, he enforced it to be a good title: because King <hi>Edward</hi> not long before had taken succession from <hi>Hardicanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> to whom hee was brother by the mothers side. And although King <hi>Edward</hi> was also descended from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, yet could not he deriue from them any right: For that <hi>Edgar</hi> and his sisters were then aliue, descended from <hi>Edmund Iron side,</hi> elder brother to King <hi>Edward.</hi> Hee could haue no true right of succession, but onely from <hi>Hardicanutus</hi> the <hi>Dane.</hi> So <hi>Pepine,</hi> when he was possessed of the State of <hi>France,</hi> did openly publish, that hee was descended of

            <p>These grounds of his pretence, beautified with large amplifications of the benefits which he had done to King <hi>Edward,</hi> he imparted to the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> who at time was reputed the arbitrator of controuersies which did rise betweene princes. And the rather to procure his fauour, and to gaine the countenance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to his cause, hee promised to hold the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> of the Apostolike Sea. Hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his title, and sent vnto him a white hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed banner, to aduance vpon the prowe of his ship: also an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> of gold, and one of <hi>S. Peters</hi> haires, together with his blessing to begin the enterprise.</p>
            <p>But now concerning his further procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4099:23"/>
concerning his victorious both entrance and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance within the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> two points are worthy to be considered: one, how he being a man of no great either power or dominion, did so suddenly preuaile against a couragious King, possessed of a large and puissant State. The other is, how he so secured his victorie, as not the English, not the Britains, not the Danes, not any other could dispossesse or much disturbe him &amp; his posteritie, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the fayre fruits thereof. And if we giue to either of these their true respects, wee shall find his commendation to consist, not so much in the first, as in the second: because that was effected chiefly by force, this by wisedome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which as it is most proper to man, so few men doe therein excell. Hee that winneth a State surmounteth onely outward difficulties; but he that assureth the same, trauaileth as well against internall weaknes, as external strength. To attaine a Kingdome is many times a gift of Fortune; but to prouide that it may long time continue firme, is not onely to oppose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst humane forces, but against the very malice of Fortune, or rather the power and wrath of time, whereby all things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4099:24"/>
inclineable to change.</p>
            <p>For the first then, besides the secret working and will of God, which is the cause of all causes; besides the sinnes of the people, for which (the Prophet saith,) <hi>Kingdomes are transported from one Nation to another:</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> not long before made a manifest way for this inuasion and change. For although he was <hi>English</hi> by birth, yet by reason of his education in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> he was altogether become a <hi>Normane,</hi> both in affection and in behauiour of life.

These he enriched with great posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; these he honoured with the highest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both of dignitie and charge. Chiefly he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced diuers of them to the best degrees of dignitie in the Church: by whose fauour Duke <hi>William</hi> afterward was both animated &amp; aided in his exploit. Generally as the whole Clergie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4099:24"/>
of <hi>England</hi> conceiued a hard opinion of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold;</hi> for that vpon the same day wherein King <hi>Edward</hi> was buried, he set the Crowne vpon his owne head, without Religious Ceremonies, without any solemnities of Coronation: so they durst not for feare of the Popes displeasure, but giue either furtherance or forbearance to the Dukes proceedings; and to abuse the credite which they had with the people, in working their submission to the <hi>Normans.</hi> Now of what strength the Clergie was at that time within the Realme, by this which followeth it may appeare.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Harold</hi> was slaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Edwine</hi> and <hi>Morcar</hi> Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Marck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> brothers of great both authoritie and power within the Realme, had induced many of the Nobilitie to declare <hi>Edgar Athelinge</hi> to be their King: but the Prelates not onely crossed that purpose, but deliuered <hi>Edgar</hi> the next heire from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings to the pleasure of the Duke.</p>
            <p>Againe, when the Duke after his great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie at <hi>Hastings</hi> aduanced his armie towards <hi>Hartford-shire; Fredericke</hi> Abbot of <hi>S. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi> had caused the woods belonging to his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4099:25"/>
Church to be felled, and the trees to be cast so thicke in the way, that the Duke was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to coast about to the castle of <hi>Berkhamstead.</hi> To this place the Abbot vnder Suerties came vnto him; and being demanded wherefore he alone did offer that opposition against him, with a confident countenance he returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: that he had done no more then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and by Nature he was bound to doe: and that if the residue of the Clergie had borne the like minde, hee should neuer haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the land so farre. Well, answered the Duke, I know that your Clergie is powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but if I liue and prosper in my affaires, I shall gouerne their greatnesse well ynough. Assuredly, nothing doeth sooner worke the conuersion or subuersion of a State, then that any one sort of Subiects should grow so great, as to be able to ouerrule all the rest.</p>
            <p>Besides this disposition of the Clergie, diuers of the Nobilitie also did nothing fauour King <hi>Harold</hi> or his cause: for that he was a manifest vsurper, naked of all true title to the Crowne, pretending onely as borne of the daughter of <hi>Hardicanutus</hi> the <hi>Dane.</hi> Yea he was infamous both for his iniurie and periurie towards the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4099:25"/>
Duke, and no lesse hatefull for his disloyaltie in former times, in bearing Armes with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against King <hi>Edward.</hi> Hereupon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the Realme were broken into factions. Many (of whom his owne brother <hi>Tosto</hi> was chiefe) inuited <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom whilest <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was incountring in Armes, the residue drew in Duke <hi>William</hi> out of <hi>Normandie.</hi> And these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so were diuided in respects. Some were caried by particular ends, as being prepared in diuers maner by the <hi>Normane</hi> before hand: others vpon a greedy and for the most part deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ambition, in hunting after hazard and change: others were led with loue to their Countrey, partly to auoyd the tempest which they saw to gather in clouds against them, and partly to enlarge the Realme both in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and strength, by adioyning the Country of <hi>Normandie</hi> vnto it. In which regard, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the lesse doeth alwayes accrue to the greater) they thought it more aduantageable to deale with a Prince of an inferiour state, then with a Prince of a state superiour or equal.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> the next successour to the Crowne in right of blood, he was not of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4099:26"/>
sufficient age; of a simple wit and slow cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; not gracious to the <hi>English,</hi> as well for his imperfections both in yeeres and nature, as for that he was altogether vnacquainted with the customes and conditions of their Countrey: vnfurnished of forces and reputation, vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of friends, vnfurnished of all meanes to support his title. So Duke <hi>William</hi> hauing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter right then the one, and more power then the other, did easily cary the prize from both.</p>
            <p>Now touching the state of his owne strength, albeit <hi>Normandie</hi> was but little in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>England,</hi> yet was it neither feeble nor poore. For the people, by reason of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exercise in Armes, by reason of the weightie warres which they had managed, were well inabled both in courage and skill for all Militarie atchieuements. Their valour also had bene so fauoured by their Fortune, that they were more enriched by spoile, then drawne downe either with losses or with charge. Hereupon when preparation was to be made for the enterprise of <hi>England,</hi> although some disswaded the Duke from embracing the attempt, affirming that it was a vaine thing to streine at that which the hand is not able to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4099:26"/>
conteine, to take more meat then the stomacke can beare; that he who catcheth at matters too great, is in great danger to gripe nothing: Yet did others not onely encourage him by aduise, but enable him by their aide. Among which <hi>William Fitz-Auber</hi> did furnish 40. ships with men and munition; The Bishop of <hi>Baieux</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise 40: the Bishop of <hi>Mans</hi> 30: and in like sort others, according to the proportion of their estates.</p>
            <p>And yet he drew not his forces onely out of <hi>Normandie,</hi> but receiued aide from all parts of <hi>France;</hi> answerable not onely to his necessitie, but almost to his desire. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> at that time was vnder age, and <hi>Baldwine</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> was gouernour of the Realme; whose daughter the Duke had taken to wife. By his fauour the Duke receiued large supplies from the state of <hi>France,</hi> both in treasure and in men of warre: for countenance whereof it was giuen foorth, that the Duke should hold the Realme of <hi>England</hi> as hee did the Duchie of <hi>Normandie,</hi> vnder homage to the Crowne of <hi>France.</hi> Hereupon diuers Princes of <hi>France</hi> did adioyne to his aide; and especially the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Britaine, Aniou,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:4099:27"/>
               <hi>Boloigne, Ponthieu, Neuers, Poictou, Hiesmes, Aumale,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Tours.</hi> Many other of the Nobilitie and Gentlemen did voluntarily aduenture, both their bodies and whole estates vpon the euent of this enterprise. So greatly had he either by courtesie wonne the loue, or by courage erected the hopes of all men: yea of many who had bin his greatest enemies. With these also the <hi>Emperour Henry</hi> 4. sent him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine troupes of Souldiers, commanded by a Prince of <hi>Almaine.</hi> Hee receiued also many promises of fauour from <hi>Swaine</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</hi> And who can assure (for the sequele maketh the coniecture probable) that he held not intelligence with <hi>Harold Harfager</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> to inuade <hi>England</hi> with two armies at once. So partly by his owne Subiects, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by supply from his Alleys and friends, hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>massed a strong Armie, consisting chiefly of <hi>Normans, Flemings, French</hi> and <hi>Britaines,</hi> to the number of fiftie thousand men; and brought them to <hi>S. Valeries,</hi> before which Towne his ships did ride. Here he stayed a certaine time attending the wind, as most writers doe report; but rather as it may be coniectured, to awaite the arriuall of <hi>Harold Harfager</hi> K. of <hi>Norway:</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:4099:27"/>
knowing right well, that the inuasion of <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>Norway</hi> vpon the North parts of the realme, would draw away <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to leaue the coasts towards the South vndefended.</p>
            <p>During his abode at <hi>S. Valeries,</hi> certaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish espials were taken, whom King <hi>Harold</hi> had sent to discouer both the purposes and power of the Duke. When they were brought to his presence, with a braue confidence he said vnto them: <hi>Your Lord might well haue spared this charge; hee needed not to haue cast away his cost to vnderstand that by your industrie and faith, which my owne presence shall manifest vnto him; more certainly, more shortly then he doth expect. Goe your wayes, goe tell him from me, If he find me not before the end of this yeere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the place where hee supposeth that hee may most safely set his foote, let him neuer feare danger from mee whilest hee liue.</hi> Many <hi>Normans</hi> disliked this open dealing of the Duke: preferring to his iudgement the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and experience of King <hi>Harold;</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his treasure; the number and goodnes of his men; but especially his strong Nauie, and expert Saylers; accustomed both to the fights and dangers of the Sea, more then any other people in the world. To these the Duke
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4099:28"/>
turned, and sayd: <hi>I am glad to heare this opinion run, both of his prowesse and of his power; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall our glory bee in preuailing against him. But I see right well that I haue small cause to feare his discouery of our strength, when you, who are so neere vnto mee, discerne so little. Rest your selues vpon the Iustice of your cause and foresight of your Commaunder. Who hath lesse then hee, who can iustly tearme nothing his owne? I know more of his weakenesse, then euer he shall know of my strength, vntill he feele it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you your parts like men, and he shall neuer be able to disappoint either my assurance, or your hopes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> had prepared a fleet to resist the inuasion of the duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie:</hi> but by reason of his long stay at <hi>S. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,</hi> speeches did spread, whether by error or subornation, yea, assured aduertisement was sent out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he had for that yeere abandoned his enterprise. In the meane time <hi>Harold Harfager</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> then whom no man was esteemed more valiant, hauing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured both intelligence and aide out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> arriued in the mouth of <hi>Humber:</hi> and from thence drawing vp against the streame of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4099:28"/>
the riuer <hi>Owse,</hi> landed at a place called <hi>Richhall.</hi> Here he Marshalled his Armie, and marched foorth into the Countrey: and when hee came neere vnto <hi>Yorke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> he was encountred by the <hi>English,</hi> led by <hi>Edwine</hi> and <hi>Morchar</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall commanders of all those quarters. The fight was furious, but in the end the <hi>English</hi> were ouerthrowne, and with a great slaughter chases into <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon aduertisement hereof, <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> caried all his forces against <hi>Harfager.</hi> His readinesse was such, and such his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the fifth day after the fight before mentioned he gaue him battell againe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Harold Harfager</hi> was slaine, and so was <hi>Tosto</hi> the King of <hi>Englands</hi> brother: <hi>Tosto</hi> by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine enemie, but <hi>Harfager</hi> by the hand of <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Their armie also was routed, and with a bloody execution pursued, so long as day and furie did last. Here a certaine Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of <hi>Norway</hi> was most famous almost for a miracle of manhood. He had been appointed with certaine others, to guard the passage at <hi>Stamford</hi> bridge. The residue vpon approach of the English forsooke their charge; but hee alone stepped to the foote of the Bridge, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4099:29"/>
with his Battle-axe sustained the shocke of the whole armie; slew aboue fourty assailants, and defended both the passage and himselfe, vntill an English Souldier went vnder the Bridge, and through a hole thereof thrust him into the bodie with a Launce.</p>
            <p>If this victory of King <hi>Harold</hi> had been so wisely vsed as it was valiantly wonne, he should haue neglected the spoyle, and returned with the like celeritie wherewith he came. But hee gaue discontentment to his Souldiers, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging their expectation for free sharing the spoile; and hauing lost many in that conflict, he retired to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and there stayed; as well to reforme the state of the Countrey, greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered by meanes of these warres, as also both to refresh and repaire his armie.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> receiuing intelligence, that the Sea-coasts were left naked of defence, loosed from S. <hi>Valeries</hi> with three hundred, or, as some writers report, 896, or, as one <hi>Norman</hi> writer affirmes, with more then one thousand saile: and hauing a gentle gale, arriued at <hi>Pemsey</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> vpon the 28. of September. The ship wherein the Duke was caried is said, (as if it had runne for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4099:29"/>
the garland of victory) to haue outstripped the rest so farre, that the sailers were enforced to strike saile, and hull before the winde to haue their companie. When hee first stepped vpon the shoare, one of his feete slipped a little. The Duke to recouer himselfe stepped more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the other foote, and sunke into the sand somewhat deepe. One of his Souldiers espying this, sayd merrily vnto him: <hi>You had almost fallen my Lord, but you haue well maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your standing, and haue now taken deepe and firme footing in the soyle of</hi> England. <hi>The presage is good, and hereupon I salute you King.</hi> The Duke laughed; and the souldiers, with whom super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition doth strongly worke, were much confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in courage by the ieast.</p>
            <p>When he had landed his forces, he fortified a piece of ground with strong trenches, and discharged all his ships; leauing to his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers no hope to saue themselues, but onely by victory. After this he published the causes of his comming in armes, namely:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 To chalenge the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> giuen to him by his cousin King <hi>Edward,</hi> the last lawfull possessor at that time thereof.</item>
               <item>2 To reuenge the death of his cousin <hi>Alfred,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:4099:30"/>
brother to the same K. <hi>Edward,</hi> and of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who did accompanie him into <hi>England;</hi> no lesse cruelly then deceitfully slaine by Earle <hi>Goodwin</hi> and his adherents.</item>
               <item>3 To reuenge the iniurie done vnto <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Archbishop of Canterburie; who by the practise (as it was then giuen foorth) of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> had been exiled in the life time of King <hi>Edward.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This last article was added either to please the Pope, or generally in fauour of the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie: to whom the example grew then intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that an Archbishop should bee once que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned by any other then by themselues.</p>
            <p>So the Duke, leauing his fortification fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with competent forces to assure the place, as wel for a retreit, as for daily landing of fresh supplies, marched forward to <hi>Hastings;</hi> and there raised another fortresse, and planted likewise a garison therein. And in all places he restrained his Souldiers, either from spoyling or harming the Countrey people, for feare that thereby they would fall into disorder: but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing forth, that it were crueltie to spoile them, who in short time should be his Subiects. Here the Duke, because he would not either aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4099:30"/>
or trust his Souldiers, went foorth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to discouer the Countrey, with 15. horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in his company, and no more. His returne was on foote, by reason of the euill qualitied wayes: and when <hi>Fitz-Osberne</hi> who went with him, was ouer wearied with the weight of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the Duke eased him by bearing his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met vpon his shoulder. This action may seeme of slender regard; but yet did gaine him, both fauour and dutie among his Souldiers.</p>
            <p>K. <hi>Harold</hi> hearing of these approches, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by great iourneyes towards <hi>London;</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his messengers to all places, both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and entreate the people to draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their common defence. Here he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered his Souldiers; and albeit hee found that his forces were much impaired by his late bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile against <hi>Harfager,</hi> yet he gathered an able armie, countenanced and commanded by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Nobilitie, which resorted vnto him from many parts of the Realme. The Duke in the meane time sent a messenger vnto him, who demanded the Kingdome in so stout ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he was at the point to haue bene euill entreated by the King. Againe the King sent his messenger to the Duke, forbidding him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4099:31"/>
with loftie language, to make any stay within that Countrey; but to returne againe no lesse speedily, then rashly he had entred. The Duke betweene mirth and scorne returned answere; That as he came not vpon his entreaty, so at his command he would not depart. But (said he) <hi>I am not come to word with your King, I am come to fight, and am desirous to fight: I will be ready to fight with him, albeit I had but 10000. such men as I haue brought 60000.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>K. <hi>Harold</hi> spent little time, lost none (vnlesse happely that which hee might haue taken more) both in appointing and ordering his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. And when he was ready to take the field, his mother entreated him, first moderately, then with words of passion and with teares, that he would not aduenture his person to the battaile. Her importunitie was admired the more, for that it was both without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant cause, and not vsuall in former times. But <hi>Harold</hi> with vndaunted countenance and heart, conducted his Armie into <hi>Sussex,</hi> and encamped within seuen miles of the <hi>Normans:</hi> who thereupon approched so neere to the <hi>English,</hi> that the one Armie was within view of the other.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4099:32"/>
dissolue. <hi>Or if</hi> (sayd he) <hi>you resolue to fight, yet because you are sworne to the Duke, you shall doe well to withdraw your presence; to imploy your authoritie in mustering a new armie, to bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to receiue him with fresh forces. And if you please to commit the charge of this incounter vnto me, I will not faile to expresse, both the loue of a brother, and the care and courage of a Commander. For as I am not obliged to the Duke by oath, so shall I either preuaile with the better cause, or with the quieter conscience die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both these counsailes were reiected by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold:</hi> The first out of a violent vehemencie of these Northerne nations, who doe commonly esteeme delay of battell a deiected cowardise, a base and seruile deflouring of time; but to beare through their designes at once, they account a point of honourable courage. The second he esteemed both shamefull to his reputation, and hurtfull to the state of his affaires. For what honour had he gained by his former vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, if when he came to the greatest pinch of danger, hee should fearefully shrinke backe? with what heart should the Souldiers fight, when they haue not his presence for whom they fight? when they haue not their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4099:32"/>
an eye witnesse of their performance? when they want his sight, his encouragement, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to enflame them to valour? The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Prince is worth many thousands of ordinarie Souldiers: The ordinary Souldier wil vndertake both labour and danger for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects so much, as by the presence of the Prince. And therefore he did greatly extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the worth of the <hi>Normans,</hi> terming them a company of Priests; because their fashion was to shaue their faces: But whatsoeuer they were, as he had (hee said) digested in his minde the hardest euents of battell; so either the infamie or suspicion of cowardise in no case hee would incurre. Hee resolued not to ouerliue so great dishonour; he resolued to set vp as his last rest, his Crowne, and Kingdome; and life withall. And thus oftentimes Fortune dealeth with men, as Executioners doe with condemned persons; she will first blindfold, and then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them.</p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Norman</hi> sent a Monke to offer the choise of these conditions to <hi>Harold;</hi> Either to relinquish his kingdome vpon certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; or to hold it vnder homage to the Duke; or to try their cause by single combate;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4099:33"/>
or to submit it to the iudgement of the Pope, according to the Lawes of <hi>Normandy</hi> or of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he would. Againe, some conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were propounded from K. <hi>Harold</hi> to the Duke: But their thoughts were so lifted vp both with pride and confidence, by reason of their former victories, that no moderate ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could take place: and so they appointed the day following, which was the 14. of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to determine their quarrell by sentence of the sword. This happened to be the birth day of K. <hi>Harold,</hi> which for that cause by a supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious errour, he coniectured would be prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vnto him.</p>
            <p>The night before the battaile for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects was vnquiet. The <hi>English</hi> spent the time in feasting and drinking; and made the aire ring with showtings and songs: the <hi>Normans</hi> were more soberly silent, and busied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues much in deuotion; being rather still then quiet, not so much watchful as not able to sleepe. At the first appearance of the day, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> did sparckle, and that in their face
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4099:33"/>
and gesture victorie did sit. The Duke put certaine reliques about his necke, vpon which King <hi>Harold</hi> had sworne vnto him. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that when he armed, the backe of his Curasses was placed before by errour of him that put it on: some would haue bin dismayed hereat, but the Duke smiled, and said; Assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this day my Fortune will turne, I shall either be a King, or nothing before night.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> were knit in one maine body on foot; whereof the first rancks consisted of <hi>Kentishmen</hi> (who by an ancient custome did challenge the honour of that place,) the next were filled with <hi>Londoners;</hi> then followed the other <hi>English.</hi> Their chiefe weapons were pole-axe, sword and dart, with a large target for their defence. They were paled in front with paueises in such wise, that it was thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the enemie to breake them. The King stood on foot by his Standard, with two of his brothers, <hi>Girth</hi> and <hi>Leofwine;</hi> as well to relieue from thence all parts that should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be distressed, as also to manifest to the Souldiers, that they reteined no thought of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping by flight. On the other side, the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were diuided into three battailes: The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4099:34"/>
first was conducted by <hi>Roger Montgomerie,</hi> and <hi>William Fitz-Osborne;</hi> it consisted of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Aniou, Maine</hi> and <hi>Britaine,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a <hi>Britaine</hi> named <hi>Fergent;</hi> It caried the Banner which the Pope had sent. The middle battaile consisting of Souldiers out of <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> was led by <hi>Geoffrye Martell,</hi> and a Prince of <hi>Almaine.</hi> The Duke himselfe clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the last battaile, with the strength of his <hi>Normans</hi> and the flowre of his Nobilitie. The Archers were diuided into wings, and also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed by bands through all the three battails.</p>
            <p>Thus were both sides set vpon a bloody bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; ambition, hope, anger, hate, enflaming them to valour. The duke edged his Souldiers, by declaring vnto them the noble Acts of their ancesters, the late admirable atchieuement of their fellow <hi>Normans</hi> in subduing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Sicill,</hi> their owne braue exploits vnder him; by shewing them all that pleasant and plentifull Countrey, as the purchase of their prowesse, as the gaine and reward of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture: by putting them in minde, that they were in a Countrey both hostile &amp; vnknowne, before them the sword, the vast Ocean behind, no place of retreit, no surety but in valour and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4099:34"/>
in victory; so as they who would not contend for glory, were vpon necessitie to fight for their liues: Lastly, by assuring them, that as he was the first in aduise, so would he be the foremost in aduenture, being fully resolued either to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish, or to die. The King encouraged his men, by presenting to their remembrance, the miseries which they susteined not long before, vnder the oppression of the <hi>Danes;</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were againe to endure, or neuer to feare, it lieth (said he) in the issue of this field. The King had the aduantage both for number of men, and for their large able bodies; The Duke both in Armes, (especially in regard of the Bow and arrowes,) and in experience and skill of Armes; both equall in courage; both confident alike in the fauour of Fortune, which had alwayes crowned their courage with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And now by affronting of both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the plots and labours of many moneths, were reduced to the hazard of a few houres.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> marched with a song of the valiant acts of <hi>Rowland,</hi> esteeming nothing of perill in regard of the glory of their aduenture. When they approched neere their enemies, they saluted them first with a storme of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4099:35"/>
               <hi>Robert Fitz-Beaumant</hi> a yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Normandie,</hi> beginning the fight from the right Wing. This maner of fight as it was new, so was it most terrible to the <hi>English,</hi> so were they least prouided to auoyd it. First, they opened their rancks, to make way for the Arrowes to fall; but when that auoydance did nothing auaile, they cloased againe, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselues with their Targets, ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in maner of a pendhouse; encouraging one another, to hast forward, to leape lustily to hand-strokes, and to scoure their swords in the entrailes of their enemies. Then the Duke commanded his horsemen to charge: but the <hi>English</hi> receiued them vpon the points of their weapons, with so liuely courage, in so firme and stiffe order, that the ouerthrow of many of the foremost, did teach their followers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture themselues with better aduise. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they shifted into wings, and made way for the footmen to come forward. Then did both armies ioyne in a horrible shocke, with Pole-axes, &amp; the Prince of weapons the sword: maintaining the fight with so manlike furie, as if it had bene a battaile of Giants, rather then of men. And so they continued the greatest

part of that day, in close and furious fight; blow for blow, wound for wound, death for death; their feet steadie, their hands diligent, their eyes watchfull, their hearts resolute; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their aduisement dazeled by fiercenesse, nor their fiercenesse any thing abated by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisement.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the horsemen gaue many sharpe charges, but were alwayes beaten backe with disaduantage. The greatest annoyance came from the Archers; whose shot showred among the <hi>English</hi> so thicke, as they seemed to haue the enemy in the middest of their Armie. Their armour was not sufficiently either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate or of proofe to defend them, but euery hand, euery finger breadth vnarmed, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an assured place for a deepe, and many times a deadly wound. Thus whilest the front was maintained in good condition, many thousands were beaten downe behind; whose death was not so grieuous vnto them, as the maner of their death, in the middest of their friends, without an enemie at hand, vpon whom they might shew some valour, and worke some reuenge.</p>
            <p>This maner of fight would soone haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4099:36"/>
aswell the hopes as the feares of both sides, had not the targets of English been very seruiceable vnto them; Had not King <hi>Harold</hi> also with a liuely and constant resolution, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the part, not onely of a skilfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, by directing, encouraging, prouiding, relieuing; but of a valiant Souldier by vsing his weapon, to the example of his Souldiers. In places of greatest danger hee was alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; repayring the decayes, reforming the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and encouraging his company, that in doing as men, whether they preuailed, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they perished, their labour was alwayes gloriously employed. So they knit strongly together, and stood in close and thicke array, as if they had been but one body: not onely bearing the brunt of their enemies, but making such an impression vpon their squadron, that the great bodie began to shake. The Duke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured in person so farre, moued no lesse by his naturall magnanimitie, then by glory of the enterprise, that besides his often alighting to fight on foote, two, or (as some report) three horses were slaine vnder him. And hauing a body both able by nature, and by vse hardened to endure trauaile, hee exacted the greater ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4099:36"/>
of his Souldiers: commending the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, blaming the slow, and crying out (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his nature) with vehement ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture and voice vnto all; that it was a shame for them who had been victorious against all men with whom they dealt, to be so long held by the <hi>English</hi> in delay of victory. So partly by his authoritie, and partly by his example, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Souldiers, and imposed vpon them the fayrest necessitie of courage; whilest euery man contended to win a good opinion of their Prince.</p>
            <p>Then the fight entred into a new fitte of heate; nothing lesse feared then death, the greatnesse of danger making both sides the more resolute: and they who could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to strike with the hand, were heard to encourage their fellowes by speach, to pursue the victory, to pursue their glory, not to turne to their owne both destruction and disgrace. The clashing of armour, the iustling of bodies, the resounding of blowes, was the fairest part of this bloody medley: but the grislinesse of wounds, the hideous fals and groanes of the dying, all the field desiled with dust, blood, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken armour, mangled bodies, represented Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4099:37"/>
in her foulest forme. Neuer was furie bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gouerned; neuer game of death better played. The more they fought the better they fought; the more they smarted, the lesse they regarded smart.</p>
            <p>At the last, when the Duke perceiued that the <hi>English</hi> could not be broken by strength of arme, he gaue direction that his men should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and giue ground; not loosely, not disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in a fearefull and confused haste, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly and for aduantage; keeping the front of their squadron firme and close, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding one foote in array. Nothing was more hurtfull to the <hi>English,</hi> being of a franke and noble spirit, then that their violent inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion caried them too fast into hope of victory. For, feeling their enemies to yeeld vnder their hand, they did rashly follow those who were not hasty to flee: And in the heate of their pursuit, vpon a false conceit of victory, loosed and disordered their rankes, thinking then of nothing but of executing the chase. The <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> espying the aduantage to be ripe, made a stiffe stand, redoubled vpon the <hi>English,</hi> and pressing on with a furie equall to their fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortune, with a cruell butchery brake into
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4099:37"/>
them. On the other side it is scarce credible with what strength both of courage and hand the <hi>English</hi> euen in despight of death, sustained themselues in this disorder; drawing into small squadrons, and beating downe their enemies on euery hand, being resolued to sell their liues with their place.</p>
            <p>But a mischiefe is no mischiefe, if it comes alone. Besides this disaduantage of disarray, the shot of the <hi>Normans,</hi> did continually beate vpon the <hi>English</hi> with a grieuous execution. Among other King <hi>Harold</hi> about the closing of the euening, as he was busie in sustaining his armie, both with voyce and with hand, was strooke with an arrow through the left eye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his braines, of which wound hee presently died. His two brothers, <hi>Girth</hi> and <hi>Leofwine</hi> were also slaine, and also most of the nobilitie that were present: So long as the King stood, they stood stoutly, both with him, and for him, and by him: his directions supported them, his braue behauiour breathed fresh boldnesse and life into them. But his death was a deadly stabbe to their courage; vpon report of his death, they began to wauer in resolution, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to trust to the force of their armes, or to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4099:38"/>
commend their safetie to their good foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship. In this incertainty many were slaine: Many retired in reasonable order to a rising ground, whither they were closely followed by the <hi>Normans;</hi> but the <hi>English</hi> hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aduantage of the place, and drawing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage out of despaire, with a bloody charge did driue them downe. Count <hi>Eustachius</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing fresh forces to be arriued, fled away with fiftie Souldiers in his company; and meeting with the Duke, rounded him secretly in his eare, that if hee went any further hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Whilest he was thus speaking, hee was strooke betweene the shoulder with so violent a blowe, that he fell downe as dead, and voided much blood at his nose and mouth. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict many of the noblest <hi>Normans</hi> were slaine, which mooued the Duke to make a strong ordered stand, giuing libertie therby for those <hi>English</hi> to retire. Others fled through a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery channell, the passages whereof were well knowen vnto them: and when the <hi>Normans</hi> did more sharpely then aduisedly pursue, the place being shadowed partly with Sedges and Reedes, and partly with the night, they were either stifled in the waters, or easily destroyed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4099:38"/>
by the <hi>English,</hi> and that in so great numbers, that the place was filled vp with dead bodies. The residue scattered in smaller companies, and had their flight fauoured by increasing darkenesse: the enemie not aduenturing to follow, both in a strange Countrey, and in the night. Earle <hi>Edwine</hi> and Earle <hi>Morcher,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of approoued both courage and faith, did great seruice at that time, in collecting these dispersed Troupes, and leading them in some fashion to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> surprised with Ioy, gaue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like charge for a solemne thanksgiuing to God. Then he erected his pauilion in the middest of the field, among the thickest of those bodies whom death had made to lie quietly together. There he passed the residue of that night; and the next morning mustered his souldiers, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried those that were slaine, and gaue libertie to the <hi>English</hi> to do the like. The bodie of King <hi>Harold</hi> could not be knowen by his face, it was so deformed by death, and by his wound; by his armour and by certaine markes vpon his body it was knowen. As it lay vpon the ground, a <hi>Norman</hi> Souldier did strike it into the legge with his sword: for which vnmanly acte he was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4099:39"/>
cassed by the Duke with open disgrace. It was caried into the Dukes Pauilion, vnder the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie of <hi>William Mallet.</hi> And when his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made suite for it to bee buried, the Duke denied it at the first; affirming, that buriall was not fit for him, whose ambition was the cause of so many Funerals. The mother, besides her lamentations and teares, offered for it (as one <hi>Norman</hi> writer affirmes) the weight thereof in gold. But the Duke, with a manly compassion gaue it freely; as holding it dishonourable both to value the bodie of a King, and make sale of a slaine enemie. So his body was buried by his mother at <hi>Waltham Crosse,</hi> within the monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which hee had founded. Verely there was nothing to be blamed in him, but that his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage could not stoupe to be lower then a King.</p>
            <p>I haue been the more long in describing this battel, for that I esteem it the most memorable and best executed that euer was fought within this land: as well for skilfull direction, as for couragious performance, and also for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the euent. The fight continued with very great both constancie of courage, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of fortune, from seuen of the clocke in the morning vntill night. Of the <hi>Normans</hi> were
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4099:39"/>
slaine 6000. and more, besides those that were drowned and beaten downe in the water. The slaughter of the <hi>English</hi> is vncertainely repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but certainely it was farre greater then that of the <hi>Normans.</hi> Certaine also that their death was most honourable and faire, not any one basely abandoning the fielde; not any one yeelding to bee taken prisoner. And yet one circumstance more I hold fit to bee obserued; that this victory was gotten onely by the meanes of the blowe of an arrow: The vse whereof was by the <hi>Normans</hi> first brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this land. Afterward the <hi>English</hi> being trained to that fight, did thereby chiefly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themselues with honourable aduantage, against all nations with whom they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in armes; being generally reputed the best shot in the world.</p>
            <p>But of late yeeres it hath bene altogether layed aside, and in stead thereof the harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze and calliuer are brought into vse: yet not without contradiction of many expert men of Armes; who albeit they doe not reiect the vse of these small pieces, yet doe they preferre the Bow before them. First, for that in a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able distance, it is of greater both certainty and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4099:40"/>
force. Secondly, for that it dischargeth faster. Thirdly, for that more men may discharge therewith at once: for onely the first rancke dischargeth the piece, neither hurt they any but those that are in front; but with the bow 10. or 12. rancks may discharge together, and will annoy so many ranckes of the enemies. Lastly, for that the arrow doeth strike more parts of the body: for in that it hurteth by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; (and not onely point blancke like the bullet) there is no part of the body but it may strike; from the crowne of the head, euen to the nayling of the foot to the ground. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth, that the arrowes falling so thicke as haile vpon the bodies of men, as lesse fearefull of their flesh, so more slenderly armed then in former times, must necessarily worke most dangerous effects.</p>
            <p>Besides these generall respects in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular seruices and times, the vse of the Bow is of greatest aduantage. If some defence lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enemy, the arrow may strike where the bullet cannot. Foule weather may much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the discharge of the piece, but it is no great impediment to the shot of the Bow. A horse strooke with a bullet if the wound be not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4099:40"/>
may performe good seruice; but if an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be fastened in his flesh, the continuall stirring thereof, occasioned by the motion of himselfe, will enforce him to cast off all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and either beare downe or disorder those that are neere.</p>
            <p>But the cracke of the piece (will some man say) doeth strike a terrour into the enemie. True, if they bee such as neuer heard the like noise before. But a little vse wil extinguish these terrours: to men, yea to beasts acquainted with these cracks, they worke a weake impression of feare. And if it be true which all men of action doe hold, that the eye in all battailes is first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, then against men equally accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to both, the sight of the arrow is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable to victorie then the cracke of the piece. Assuredly, the Duke before the battaile encouraged his men, for that they should deale with enemies who had no shot. But I will leaue this point to be determined by more discerning iudgements, and happily by further experience in these affaires, and returne againe to my principall purpose.</p>
            <p>The next day after the victorie the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Hastings,</hi> about seuen miles from the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4099:41"/>
place of the encounter, partly to refresh his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and partly to settle in aduise and order for his further prosecution. First, he dispatched messengers to signifie his successe to his friends abroad; to the Pope he sent King <hi>Harolds</hi> Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, which represented a man fighting, wrought curiously with golde and precious stones. Afterwards placing a strong garrison at <hi>Hastings,</hi> he conducted his Armie towards <hi>London:</hi> not the direct way, but coasted about through part of <hi>Kent,</hi> through <hi>Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire,</hi> and <hi>Barkeshire:</hi> the wayes where hee passed being as free from resistance, as his thoughts were from change. At <hi>Walling ford</hi> he passed ouer the <hi>Thames;</hi> and then marched forward through <hi>Oxford shire, Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and <hi>Hartford-shire,</hi> vntill he came to the Castle at <hi>Berkhamstead.</hi> In this passage many of his Souldiers languished and died of the Fluxe. And whether it were vpon licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse after the late victorie, or whether for want of necessary prouision, or whether to strike a terrour into the <hi>English,</hi> or whether to leaue no danger at his backe, he permitted the sword to range at large, to harrie freely, to defile many places with ruine and blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:4099:41"/>In the meane time the <hi>English</hi> Lords assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>London,</hi> to aduise vpon their common affaires; but the varietie of opinions was the chiefe impediment to the present seruice; the danger being more important, then the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile resolute, or the confidence assured. The Nobilitie enclined to declare <hi>Edgar</hi> grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child to <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> to be their King: and with these the <hi>Londoners</hi> wholy went. But those of the Clergie were of opinion (some vpon particular respects, all vpon feare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the Pope) to yeeld to the storme and streame of the present time, to yeeld to the mightie Arme of GOD; that their forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prostrated, their hopes feeble and forlorne, they must be content not to be constrained; they must not prouoke the Victor too farre; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whose forces and felicities, time gaue them not power to oppose. This deliberation held so long, that all the time of action was spent. For the Duke approched so neere the Citie, that many preferring their safetie before other respects, withdrew themselues and went vnto him. Hereupon the residue dissolued: and <hi>Alfred</hi> Archb. of <hi>Yorke, Wolstane</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester, Wilfire</hi> B. of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and many
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4099:42"/>
other Prelates of the Realme went vnto the Duke at <hi>Berkhamstead;</hi> accompanied with <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> Earle <hi>Edwine,</hi> Earle <hi>Morchar,</hi> and diuers others of the Nobilitie: who gaue pledges for their allegiance, and were thereupon receiued to subiection and fauour. The Duke present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispatched to <hi>London,</hi> was receiued with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny declarations of ioy, the lesser in heart, the fairer in appearance, and vpon <hi>Christmas day</hi> next following was crowned King.</p>

            <p>And first he endeauoured either to preuent or appease all forren warres, especially against the <hi>Danes,</hi> who were then chiefly feared in <hi>England,</hi> as well in regard of their former vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, as for that they pretended title to the Crowne. And herein two things did especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fauour his affaires. One, for that the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:4099:42"/>
were in some sort allied to the <hi>Danes;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the progenie of those <hi>Noruegians</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> which vnder the conduct and fortune of <hi>Rollo</hi> inuaded <hi>France,</hi> &amp; after many great atchieuements, seated in <hi>Normandie.</hi> The other was, for that after the death of <hi>Canutus,</hi> the state of <hi>Denmarke</hi> was much infeebled by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For the <hi>Noruegians</hi> set vp <hi>Magnus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Olaus</hi> for their King; but the <hi>Danes</hi> acknowledged <hi>Canutus</hi> the third of that name: by meanes whereof that puissant empire did languish in consumption of it selfe, and could not be dangerous to any neighbour Countrey. Yet ceased they not for many yeeres, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue claime to the Crowne of <hi>England:</hi> But King <hi>William</hi> had purchased many sure and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret friends in that diseased state, wherein all publike affaires were set to sale; especially he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the authoritie of <hi>Adelbert,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> either to crosse all counsaile of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilitie against him, or else to delay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to delude the enterprise, or lastly so to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the action, that it should no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>After the death of <hi>Swaine, Canutus</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Nauie of one thousand saile for inuasion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4099:43"/>
of <hi>England;</hi> and was aided with sixe hundred more by <hi>Robert le Frizon,</hi> whose daughter hee had taken to wife. But either for want, or else by negligence, or happily of purpose, this Nauie continued, partly in preparation, and partly in a readinesse, the space of two yeeres, and then the voyage was layd aside. The cause was attributed to contrarietie of winds; but the contrariety of wils was the truest impediment. Likewise <hi>Swaine</hi> had furnished against <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a Nauie of 204. sayle, commanded by Earle <hi>Osborne</hi> his brother. Another fleete of 200. saile was set foorth vnder the charge of Earle <hi>Hacon:</hi> But King <hi>William</hi> so corrupted them both, that the one departed out of the Realme without performing any great exploit, the other neuer would arriue.</p>
            <p>Also out of those confusions in <hi>England, Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> did take his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie for action. Hee receiued into protection many <hi>English,</hi> who either for feare, or for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, forsooke their Countrey; of whom many families in <hi>Scotland</hi> are descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and namely these; <hi>Lindsey, Vaus, Ramsey, Louell, Towbris, Sandlands, Bissart, Sowlis, Wardlaw, Maxwell,</hi> with diuers others. Hee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4099:43"/>
entertained into his Court <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> and tooke his sister <hi>Margaret</hi> to wife. He possessed himselfe of a great part of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> wherewith the people were well content, for that hee was their Earles si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters sonne.</p>
            <p>Hereupon King <hi>William</hi> sent against him, first, <hi>Roger</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> who was traiterously slaine by his owne Souldiers; then <hi>Gospatrick,</hi> Earle of <hi>Gloucester:</hi> These did onely represse the enemie, but were not able to finish the warre fully. Lastly, hee went himselfe with a mighty armie into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where hee made wide waste, and in <hi>Lothiam</hi> found King <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme,</hi> prepared both in force and resolution to entertaine him with battell. The great armie of King <hi>William,</hi> their faire furniture and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their sudden comming, but especially their firme countenance and readinesse to fight, much daunted the <hi>Scots:</hi> whereupon King <hi>Malcolme</hi> sent a Herault to King <hi>William,</hi> to mooue him to some agreement of peace. The more that the King was pleased herewith, the more hee seemed vnwilling and strange: the more he must be perswaded to that, which if it had not bin offered, he would haue desired. At
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4099:44"/>
the last, a peace was concluded, vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons honourable for King <hi>William,</hi> and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable for the King of <hi>Scots:</hi> whereby all the <hi>English</hi> were pardoned, who had fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and borne armes against their King.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Welsh,</hi> albeit both their courage and their power had been extreamely broken in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and that by the valour and industry of <hi>Harold;</hi> yet vpon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of these troubled times, they made some incursions into the borders of <hi>England;</hi> but in companies so disordered and small, so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly assaulting, so suddenly retiring, so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous more of pillage then of blood, that they seemed more like to ordinarie robbers then to enemies in field. Against these the King ledde an armie into <hi>Wales,</hi> reduced the people both to subiection and quiet, made all the principall men tributary vnto him, receiued pledges of all, for assurance of their obedience and faith.</p>
            <p>Whilest the King thus setled his affaires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, he secured himselfe against his subiects,<note place="margin">Quos v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And because at that time the Clergie were the principall strings of the <hi>English</hi> strength, he permitted not any of the <hi>English</hi> Nation to be aduanced to the dignities of the Church, but furnished them with <hi>Normans,</hi> and other strangers. And whereas in times before, the Bishop and Alderman were absolute Iudges in euery Shire, and the Bishop in many causes shared in forfeitures and penalties with the King; he clipped the wings of their Temporall power, and confined them within the limits of their Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction; to maintaine the Canons and customes of the Church, to deale in affaires concerning the soule. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <hi>Stigand</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie, Agel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:4099:45"/>
Bishop of <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and certaine other Bishops and Abbots, to be depriued by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from <hi>Rome,</hi> and deteined them in prison during their liues, that strangers might enioy their places. The matters obiected against <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gand</hi> were these.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 <hi>That hee had entruded vpon the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke whilest Robert the Archb. was in life.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 <hi>That he receiued his Pall from Benedict the fifth, who for buying the Papacie had bene deposed.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 <hi>That hee kept the Sea of Winchester in his handes, after his inuestiture into the Sea of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>He was otherwise also infamous in life; alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnlearned, of heauie iudgement and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, sottishly seruiceable both to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and sloath; in couetousnesse beneath the basenesse of rusticitie: insomuch as he would often sweare, that he had not one penie vpon the earth, and yet by a key which hee did weare about his necke, great treasures of his were found vnder the ground. And this was a griefe and sicknesse to honest mindes, that such spurious and impure creatures should susteine, or rather destaine the reuerence and maiestie of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:4099:45"/>Further, the King caused all the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Abbeys to be searched, pretending that the richer sort of the <hi>English</hi> had layd vp their money in them: vnder colour whereof he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the state of all, and bereaued many of their owne treasure. Some of these Religious houses he appropriated wholly to himselfe; of diuers others he seized the liberties, which they redeemed afterward at a very high and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue rate. Those Bishopricks and Abbeis which held Baronies, and had bene free before from secular subiection, he reduced vnder the charge of his seruice; appointing how many Souldiers, and of what sort, they should furnish for him and his successours in the time of their warres. Those strangers which he entertained in pay, he dispersed into Religious houses, and some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so among the Nobilitie, to be maintained at their charge: whereby he not onely fauoured his owne purse, but had them as a watch, and sometimes as a garrison ouer those, of whose al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance he stood in doubt.</p>
            <p>Now against the inferiour sort of people, knowing right well that hee was generally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hee prepared these remedies for his estate: All their armour was taken from them, they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4099:46"/>
were crushed downe with change of calamity, which held them prostrate vnder yoke, and brake the very heart of their courage: leauing them no hope to be relieued, no hope to rise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any degree of libertie, but by yeelding entire obedience vnto him. Those who either resisted or fauoured not his first entrance, he bereaued of all meanes afterward to offend him; holding them downe, and keeping them so lowe, that their very impotencie made him secure. All such as had their hand in any rebellion, albeit they were pardoned their liues, lost their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, and became vassals to those Lords to whom their possessions were giuen. And if they attained any thing afterward, they held it onely at the pleasure of their Lords; at the pleasure of their Lords they might bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoyled.</p>
            <p>Hee much condemned the iudgement of <hi>Swanus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> sometimes King of <hi>England,</hi> who permitted those whom hee had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, to retaine their former both authoritie and estates: whereby it happened, that after his death, the inhabitants were of force to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the strangers, and to quit themselues both from their societie and subiection. Hereupon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4099:46"/>
many seuere lawes were made; diuers of all sorts were put to death, banished, stripped of their wealth, disabled in their bodies by vnusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all variety of punishments; as putting out the eyes, cutting off the hands and such like: not onely to diminish his feares, if they were suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; but sometimes if they were of wealth, to satisfie therewith either his pleasure or wants. His cruelty made the people rebellious, and their rebellions made him the more cruell; in which case many Innocents were made the oblations of his ambitious feares. Many heauy taxations were imposed vpon them; their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Lords were remoued, their ancient lawes and policies of State were dashed to dust; all lay couched vnder the Conquerours sword, to bee newly fashioned by him, as should bee best fitting for his aduantage.</p>
            <p>Hee erected Castels in diuers parts of the Realme, of which the Towre neere <hi>London</hi> was the chiefe, which afterward was increased both in compasse and in strength by addition of the outward walls. In these he planted gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons of <hi>Normans,</hi> as if it had bene in a hostile Countrey; not without oppression to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple although they remained quiet, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4099:47"/>
to suppresse them if they should rebell. Thus he secured the Realme against a generall defection; as for particular stirres, they might happily molest him, but endanger him they could not. <hi>Exceter, Northumberland,</hi> and some other parts did rise against him in armes; but being vnable to maintaine their reuolt, their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow did much confirme his State.</p>
            <p>Hee either imitated or concurred with <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> in aduise: For, as <hi>Caesar</hi> inuaded the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> which kept the great forrest of <hi>Ardenna,</hi> not with his owne Souldiers, but with his aides out of <hi>Gallia;</hi> gaining thereby victory ouer the one, and securitie from the other, without any dispence of the <hi>Romane</hi> blood: so after the Kings great victory against the valiant, but too aduenturous King <hi>Harold,</hi> when many of the <hi>English</hi> fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from thence with fresh both courage, and supplies returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England;</hi> commaunded by two of <hi>Harolds</hi> sonnes; hee encountred them onely with <hi>English</hi> forces. In the first conflict the Kings partie was ouerthrowen, and the valiant lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Ednothus</hi> slaine, who had bene master of the horses to King <hi>Harold.</hi> In the second his enemies were so defeated, as they were neuer
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4099:47"/>
able to make head againe. So the victorers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weakened, and the vanquished wasted, the King with pleasure triumphed ouer both. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when he was occasioned to passe the Seas into <hi>Normandie,</hi> either to establish affaires of gouernement, or to represse rebellions, which in his absence were many times raised; he drew his forces out of <hi>England,</hi> and that in a more large proportion then the importance of the seruice did require. Hee also tooke with him the chiefe men of <hi>English</hi> blood, as well to vse their aduise and aide, as also to hold them and their friends from working innouation in his absence.</p>
            <p>He enclosed the great Forrest neere vnto the Sea in <hi>Hamshire,</hi> for which he dispeopled villages and townes, about the space of thirtie miles, to make a desert for beasts of chase; in which place afterward two of his sonnes, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> and <hi>William</hi> ended their liues; <hi>Richard</hi> by a fall from his horse, and <hi>William</hi> by the stroke of an arrow. The Kings great delight in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was made the pretence of this Forrest; but the true end was rather, to make a free place of footing for his <hi>Normans</hi> and other friends out of France, in case any great reuolt should
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4099:48"/>
be made. Diuers other parts of the Realme were so wasted with his warres, that for want both of Husbandrie and habitation, a great dearth did ensue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby many were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to eate horses, dogs, cats, rats, and other loathsome and vile vermine: yea, some abstei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not from the flesh of men. This famine and desolation did especially rage in the North parts of the Realme. For the inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Humber,</hi> fearing the Kings secret hate, so much the more deepe and deadly because vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust; receiued without resistance, and perhaps drew in the Armie of the King of <hi>Sueueland,</hi> with whom <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> and the other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> that fled into <hi>Scotland</hi> ioyned their power. The <hi>Normans</hi> within <hi>Yorke</hi> fired the suburbs, because it should not be a lodging for their enemies: but the strength of the winde caried the flame into the Citie, which consumed a great part thereof, with the Minster of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and therein a faire Librarie. And herewith whilest the <hi>Normans</hi> were partly busied, and partly amazed, the enemies entred, and slue in <hi>Yorke,</hi> in <hi>Duresme,</hi> and thereabout, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Normans;</hi> among whom were many of eminent dignitie, as well for birth, as for place
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4099:48"/>
of their charge. But in short time the King came vpon them, and hauing partly by Armes, and partly by gifts dispatched the strangers, exercised vpon the <hi>English</hi> an ancient and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red experience of warre, to represse with maine force a rebellion in a State newly subdued. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as all the land betweene <hi>Duresme</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> except onely the territorie of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> of <hi>Beuerlace,</hi> lay waste for the space of nine yeeres, without inhabitants to manure the ground.</p>
            <p>And because conspiracies and associations are commonly contriued in the night, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that in all Townes and villages a Bell should be runge in the euening at eight of the clocke; and that in euery house they should then put foorth their fire and lights, and goe to bed. This custome of ringing a Bell at that houre, in many places is still obserued.</p>
            <p>And for that likenesse is a great cause of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and of loue, he enioyned the chiefe of the <hi>English</hi> (and these were soone imitated by the rest) to conforme themselues to the fashions of <hi>Normandie,</hi> to which they had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues no strangers before. Yea, children in the schoole were taught their letters and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of grammar in the <hi>Norman</hi> language. In
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4099:49"/>
their speech, attire, shauing of the beard, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at the Table; in their buildings and hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold furniture, they altogether resembled the <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of his reigne he ordeined that the Lawes of King <hi>Edward</hi> should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, together with those Lawes which hee did prescribe: but afterwards he commanded that 9. men should be chosen out of euery shire, to make a true report what were the Lawes and customes of the Realme. Of these hee changed the greatest part, and brought in the customes of <hi>Normandie</hi> in their stead: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding also that causes should be pleaded, and all matters of forme dispatched in <hi>French.</hi> Onely hee permitted certaine <hi>Dane</hi>-Lawes, (which before were chiefly vsed in <hi>Northfolke, Suffolke,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi>-shire) to be generally obserued; as hauing great affinitie with his <hi>Norman</hi>-customes; both being deriued from one common head.</p>
            <p>Likewise at the great suit of <hi>William</hi> a <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> he granted a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of libertie to that Citie, for enioying the vse of K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Lawes: a memoriall of which benefite, the Citizens fixed vpon the Bishops
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4099:49"/>
graue, being in the middest of the great West Ile of <hi>S. Pauls.</hi> Further, by the counsaile of <hi>Stigand</hi> Archb. of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and of <hi>Eglesine</hi> Abbot of <hi>S. Augustines</hi> (who at that time were the chiefe gouernours of <hi>Kent</hi>) as the King was riding towards <hi>Douer,</hi> at <hi>Swanescombe</hi> two mile from <hi>Grauesend,</hi> the <hi>Kentish</hi> men came towards him armed, and bearing boughes in their hands, as if it had bene a moouing wood; they encloased him vpon the sudden, and with a firme countenance, but words well tempered with modestie and respect, they demanded of him the vse of their ancient Liberties and Lawes: that in other matters they would yeeld obedience vnto him: that without this they desired not to liue. The King was content to strike saile to the storme, and to giue them a vaine satisfaction for the present; knowing right well, that the generall customes &amp; Lawes of the residue of the Realme, would in short time ouerflow these particular places. So pledges being giuen on both sides, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to <hi>Rochester,</hi> and yeelded the Countie of <hi>Kent</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Douer</hi> into his power.</p>
            <p>In former times many Farmes and Mannors
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4099:50"/>
were giuen by bare word, without writing, onely with the sword of the Lord, or his head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece; with a horne or standing goblet, and many tenements with a quill, with a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe, with a bow, with an arrow; but this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere simplicitie at that time was changed. And whereas Charters and deeds were before made firme by the subscription of the partie, with crosses of gold, or of some other colour; then they were firmed by the parties speciall Seale, set vpon waxe, vnder the <hi>Teste</hi> of three or foure witnesses.</p>
            <p>He ordained also his counsaile of State, his Chancery, his Exchequer, his Courts of Iustice, which alwaies remoued with his Court. These places he furnished with Officers, and assigned foure Termes in the yere for determining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies among the people: whereas before all suites were summarily heard and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Gemote</hi> or monthly conuention in euery hundred, without either formalities or delay.</p>
            <p>He caused the whole Realme to be described in a censuall Roll, so as there was not one Hide of land, but both the yerely rent and the owner thereof, was therein set downe; how many
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4099:50"/>
plowlands, what pastures, fennes, or marishes; what woods, parkes, farmes and tenements were in euery shire; and what euery one was worth. Also how many villaines euery man had, what beasts or cattell, what fees, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods, what rent or commoditie his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions did yeeld. This booke was called <hi>The Roll of Winton,</hi> because it was kept in the Citie of <hi>Winchester.</hi> By the <hi>English</hi> it was called <hi>Doomes day booke;</hi> either by reason of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie thereof, or else corruptly in stead of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Dei booke;</hi> for that it was layed in the Church of <hi>Winchester,</hi> in a place called <hi>Domus Dei.</hi> According to this Roll taxations were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; sometimes two shillings, and sometimes sixe shillings vpon euery hide of land (a hide conteyning 20. acres,) besides ordinarie proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for his house.</p>
            <p>In all those lands which hee gaue to any man, he reserued <hi>Dominion in chiefe</hi> to himselfe: for acknowledgement whereof a yeerely rent was payd vnto him, and likewise a fine when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Tenant did alien or die. These were bound as Clients vnto him by oath of fidelitie and homage; And if any died his heire being in minoritie, the King receiued the profits of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4099:51"/>
the land, and had the custodie and disposing of the heires body, vntill his age of one and twentie yeeres.</p>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Caligula,</hi> that when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended<note place="margin">Tranquil. in Calig.</note> to make aduantage of his penal Edicts, he caused them to be written in so small letters, and the tables of them to be fastened so high, that it was almost impossible for any man to read them. So the King caused part of those Lawes that he established, to be written in the <hi>Norman</hi> language, which was a barbarous and broken <hi>French,</hi> not well vnderstood of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <hi>French,</hi> and not at all of the vulgar <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi> The residue were not written at all, but left almost arbitrarie, to be determined by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and discretion at large. Hereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, partly through ignorance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and partly through the malice of some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Iustice, who many times are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of secret and particular ends; that many were extreamely intangled, many endangered, many rather made away, then iustly executed.</p>
            <p>But here it may be questioned, seeing these Lawes were layed vpon the <hi>English,</hi> as fetters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their feet, as a ponderous yoke vpon their necke, to depresse and deteine them in sure sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4099:51"/>
how it falleth, that afterward they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not onely tolerable, but acceptable and well esteemed.</p>
            <p>Assuredly, these lawes were exceeding harsh and heauy to the <hi>English</hi> at the first: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore K. <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the first, at such time as <hi>Robert</hi> their eldest brother came in armes against them to challenge the crowne, being desirous to winne the fauour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did fill them with faire promises, to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the lawes of K. <hi>William</hi> their father, and to restore to them the Lawes of K. <hi>Edward.</hi> The like was done by K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and by K. <hi>Henry</hi> the second; whilest both contending to draw the State to himselfe, they did most grieuously teare it in pieces. The like by others of the first Kings of the <hi>Norman</hi> race, whensoeuer they were willing to giue contentment to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: who desired no other reward for all their aduentures and labours, for al their blood spent in the seruice of their Kings, but to haue the Lawes of K. <hi>Edward</hi> restored. At the last the Nobilitie of the Realme, with great dispence both of their estates and blood, purchased a Charter of libertie, First from K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which was soone reuoked, as violently enforced from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4099:52"/>
him: afterwards from King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which remained in force. And hereby the sharpe seuerity of these lawes was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</p>
            <p>In that afterwards they become, not onely tolerable, but easie and sweete, and happily not fit to bee changed, it is by force of long groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded custome, whereby those vsages which our ancestors haue obserued for many ages, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seeme either grieuous or odious to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4099:52"/>
of <hi>India,</hi> who vsed to eate them; called the <hi>Grecians</hi> before him: and told them that it was his pleasure, that they should conforme themselues to the custome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their deceased friends. But they applied all meanes of intreatie and perswasion, that they might not be inforced, to such a barbarous, or rather brutish obseruation.

            <p>Now these seuerities of the King were much aggrauated by the <hi>English,</hi> and esteemed not farre short of cruelties.

               <hi>to withstand all rapines and false Iudgements.</hi> Such of the nobilitie as had been taken in rebellion, were onely committed to prison; from which they were released in time: such as yeelded and submitted themselues, were freely pardoned, and often times receiued to fauour, trust, and imploymemt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edric,</hi> the first that rebelled after hee was King, he held neere and assured vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patric</hi> who had been a stirrer of great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he made Earle of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him against <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots. Eustace</hi> Earle of <hi>Boline,</hi> who vpon occasion of the Kings first absence in <hi>Normandie</hi> attempted to surprize the Castle of <hi>Douer,</hi> he imbraced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward with great shew of loue and respect. <hi>Waltheof</hi> sonne to Earle <hi>Siward,</hi> who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Citie of <hi>Yorke</hi> against him, had slaine many <hi>Normans,</hi> as they assayed to enter a breach, hee ioyned in marriage to his Neece <hi>Iudeth. Edgar</hi> who was the ground and hope of all conspiracies, who after his first submission to the King, fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned open hostilitie against him, who pretended title to the Crowne as next heire to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, he not onely receiued to fauour, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4099:53"/>
with faire enterteinments. Hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him to the warre of <hi>Palestine,</hi> where he atteined an honourable estimation with the Emperours of <hi>Almaine</hi> and of <hi>Greece.</hi> After his returne he was allowed 20. shillings a day by way of pension, and large liuings in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where he mellowed to old age in pleasure and vacancie of affaires; preferring safe subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, before ambitious rule accompanied both with danger and disquiet.</p>
            <p>Thus was no man more milde to a relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and vanquished enemie; as farre from crueltie, as he was from cowardice, the height of his spirit, ouerlooking all casuall, all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vncertaine dangers. Other great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders he punished commonly by exile or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, seldome by death. Onely among the <hi>English</hi> Nobilitie Earle <hi>Waltheof</hi> was put to death, for that after twice breaking allegiance, he conspired the third time with diuers both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> to receiue the <hi>Danes</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> whilest the King was absent in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie.</hi> And for the same conspiracie <hi>Ralph Fitz-aubert</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> was also executed; who had furnished 40. ships for the King in his voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for <hi>England:</hi> for which and for his other
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4099:54"/>
seruices in that warre, he was afterward created Earle of <hi>Hereford.</hi> But present iniuries doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ouerballance benefits that are past.</p>
            <p>He much delighted in hunting and in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. For the first he enclosed many forrests and parks, and filled them with Deere; which he so deerely loued, that he ordained great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties for such as should kill those or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beasts of game. For the second hee made many sumptuous feasts, especially vpon the high Festiuall dayes in the yeere. His <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse</hi> hee often kept at <hi>Glocester,</hi> his <hi>Easter</hi> at <hi>Winchester,</hi> his <hi>Whitsontide</hi> at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and was crowned once in the yeere at one of these places, so long as he continued in <hi>England.</hi> To these feasts he inuited all his Nobilitie, and did then principally compose himselfe to courtesie, as well in familiar conuersation, as in facilitie to grant suits, and to giue pardon to such as had offended. At other times he was more Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall and seuere; and imployed himselfe both to much exercise and great moderation in diet; whereby he preserued his body in good state, both of health and strength, and was easily able to endure trauaile, hunger, heat, cold, and all other hardnesse both of labour and of want.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:4099:54"/>Many wrongs he would not see, of many smarts he would not complaine; he was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute master of himselfe, and thereby learned to subdue others. He was much commended for chastitie of body; by which his Princely acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were much aduanced. And albeit the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reigne was pestered with such routs of outlawes and robbers, that the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people could not accompt themselues in surety within their owne doores; hee so well prouided for execution of Iustice vpon offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or rather for cutting off the causes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; that a yong maiden well charged with gold, might trauaile in any part of the Realme, without any offer of iniurie vnto her. For if any man had slaine another vpon any cause, he was put to death; and if he could not be found, the hundred paide a fine to the King; sometimes 28. and sometimes 36. pounds, according to the largenesse of the hundred in extent. If a man had oppressed any woman, he was depriued of his priuie parts. As the people by Armes, so Armes by lawes were held in restraint.</p>
            <p>He talked little and bragged lesse: a most assured performer of his word: In prosecution of his purposes constant and strong, and yet
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4099:55"/>
not obstinate; but alwayes appliable to the change of occasions: earnest, yea violent, both to resist his enemies, and to exact dueties of his Subiects. He neither loued much speech, nor gaue credite to faire; but trusted truely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to others so farre as he might not be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by credulitie.</p>
            <p>His expedition (the spirit of actions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) may hereby appeare. He inuaded <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about the beginning of October; He sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all resistance, he suppressed all rising Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and returned into <hi>Normandy</hi> in March following. So as the time of the yeere conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a man should hardly trauaile through the land in so short a time as he did win it. A grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exploit then <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> or any other stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could euer atchieue vpon that place.</p>
            <p>He gaue many testimonies of a Religious minde. For he did often frequent Diuine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the Church, he gaue much Almes, hee held the Clergie in great estimation, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured the Prelats of the Church. He sent many costly ornaments, many rich presents of gold and siluer to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> his <hi>Peter</hi> paiments went more readily, more largely then euer before. To diuers Churches in <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:4099:55"/>
after his victorie he sent Crosses of gold, vessels of gold, rich Palles, or other ornaments of great beautie and price. He bare such reuerence to <hi>Lanfranck</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> that he seemed to stand at his directions. At the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Wolstane</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> he gaue ouer a great aduantage that he made by sale of prisoners taken in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He respected <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> by whom he had bene crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> as his father. At a time vpon the repulse of a certaine suit, the Archbishop brake forth into discontentment, expostulated sharpely against the King, and in a humorous heat offered to depart. But the King staied him, fell downe at his feet, desired pardon, and promised satisfaction in the best maner that he could. The Nobilitie that were present, put the Archbishop in minde that he should cause the King to arise. Nay (answered the Archb.) let him alone; Let him still abide at <hi>S. Peters</hi> feet. So with much adoe he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and entreated to accept his suite. And so the name of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the Church hath been often vsed as a mantle, to couer the pride, passions and pleasures of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:4099:56"/>He founded and enlarged many houses of Religion: Hee furnished Ecclesiasticall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with men of more sufficiencie and worth then had been vsuall in former times. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause within his owne Dominions studies did not flourish and thriue, by reason of the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent times, by reason of the often inuasions of barbarous people, whose knowledge lay chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their fists; hee drew out of <hi>Italy</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places many famous men, both for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and integritie of life; to wit, <hi>Lanfranke, Anselm, Durand, Traherne</hi> and others. These he honoured, these hee aduanced, to these hee expressed great testimonies both of fauour and regard.</p>
            <p>And yet he preferred <hi>Odo</hi> his brother by the mothers side to the Bishopricke of <hi>Baion,</hi> and afterwards created him Earle of <hi>Kent:</hi> A man proud, vaine, mutinous, ambitious; outragious in oppression, cruelty and lust; a prophaner of Religion, a manifest contemner of all vertue. The King being called by occasions into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> committed vnto him the gouernment of the Realme: In which place of credite and command he furnished himselfe so fully with treasure, that hee aspired to the Papacie of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4099:56"/>
               <hi>Rome:</hi> vpon a prediction then cast abroad, (which commonly deceiue those that trust vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them) that the successour of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> was named <hi>Odo.</hi> So filled with proud hopes, hee purchased a palace and friends at <hi>Rome;</hi> hee prepared for his iourney, and drew many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to be of his traine. But the King retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning suddenly out of <hi>Normandie,</hi> met with him in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> as he was ready to take the Seas. There hee was arrested, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards charged with infinite oppressions; also for seducing the Kings subiects to forsake the Realme; and lastly, for sacrilegious spoyling of many Churches. Hereupon his treasure was seized, and he was committed to prison; not as Bishop of <hi>Baion,</hi> but as Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> and as an accomptant to the King. And so he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about foure yeeres, euen vntill the death of the King. His seruants, some in falshood, and some for feare, discouered such hidden heapes of his gold, as did exceede all expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yea, many bagges of grinded gold were drawen out of riuers, wherein the Bishop had caused them for a time to be buried. After this hee was called the Kings spunge: as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by him to that place of charge, wherein
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4099:57"/>
he might in long time sucke that from others, which should at once be pressed from himselfe. By this meanes the King had the benefit of his oppression without the blame; and the people (being no deepe searchers into secrets of State) were so well pleased with the present punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they were thereby, although not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, yet well quieted for all their wrongs.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of his reigne he appointed his two sonnes, <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> with ioynt authoritie, gouernours of <hi>Normandie;</hi> the one to suppresse either the insolencie, or leuitie of the other. These went together to visit the <hi>French</hi> King, lying at <hi>Conflance:</hi> where enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the time with varietie of disports, <hi>Henry</hi> played with <hi>Louis</hi> then <hi>Daulphine</hi> of <hi>France</hi> at Chesse, and did win of him very much. Hereat <hi>Louis</hi> beganne to growe warme in words, and was therein little respected by <hi>Henry.</hi> The great impatiencie of the one, and the small forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the other, did strike in the end such a heate betweene them, that <hi>Louis</hi> threw the Chesse-men at <hi>Henries</hi> face, and called him the sonne of a bastard. <hi>Henrie</hi> againe stroke <hi>Louis</hi> with the Chesse-boord, drew blood with the blowe, and had presently slaine him vpon the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4099:57"/>
place, had hee not been stayed by his brother <hi>Robert.</hi> Hereupon they presently went to horse, and their spurres claimed so good haste, as they recouered <hi>Pontoife,</hi> albeit they were sharpely pursued by the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had been much for the <hi>French</hi> King to haue remained quiet, albeit no prouocations had happened, in regard of his pretence to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pieces which King <hi>William</hi> did possesse in <hi>France.</hi> But vpon this occasion he presently inuaded <hi>Normandie,</hi> tooke the Citie of <hi>Vernon,</hi> and drew <hi>Robert,</hi> King <hi>Williams</hi> eldest sonne, to combine with him against his owne father. On the other side King <hi>William,</hi> who neuer lost any thing by loosing of time, with incredible celeritie passed into <hi>France;</hi> inuaded the <hi>French</hi> Kings dominions, wasted and tooke many principall places of <hi>Zantoigne</hi> and <hi>Poictou,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Roan,</hi> and there reconciled his sonne <hi>Robert</hi> vnto him. The <hi>French</hi> King summoned him to doe his homage for the kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> For the Duchie of <hi>Normandie</hi> he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him homage, but the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> (he said) he held of no man, but onely of God, and by his sword. Hereupon the <hi>French</hi> King came strongly vpon him; but finding him both
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4099:58"/>
ready and resolute to answere in the field: fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding also that his hazard was greater then his hope; that his losse by ouerthrow would farre surmount his aduantage by victory; after a few light encounters he retired: preferring the care to preserue himselfe, before the desire to harme others.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> being then both corpulent and in yeeres, was distempered in body by meanes of those trauailes, and so retired to <hi>Roan;</hi> where hee remained not perfectly in health. The <hi>French</hi> King hearing of his sickenesse, pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, that hee lay in child-bed of his great belly. This would haue been taken in mirth, if some other had spoken it; but comming from an enemie, it was taken in scorne. And as great personages are most sencible of reproach, and the least touch of honour maketh a wide and incurable wound; so King <hi>William</hi> was so nettled with this ieast, that hee swore <hi>By Gods resurrection and his brightnesse,</hi> (for this was the vsuall forme of his oath) that so soone as hee should be churched of that child, he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a thousand lights in <hi>France.</hi> So presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his recouery hee entred <hi>France</hi> in armes, tooke the Citie of <hi>Meux,</hi> set many Townes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4099:58"/>
and Villages and corne fields on fire; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abandoning all places where he came, and giuing foorth, that it was better the nests should be destroyed, then that the birds should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in them. At the last he came before <hi>Paris,</hi> where <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> did then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide: to whom he sent word, that he had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to be on foote, and was walking about, and would be glad likewise to find him abroad. This enterprise was acted in the moneth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, wherein the King was so violent and sharpe, that by reason both of his trauaile, and of the vnseasonable heate, he fell into a relapse of his sicknesse. And to accomplish his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, in leaping on horse-backe ouer a ditch, his fat belly did beare so hard vpon the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell of his saddle, that hee tooke a rupture in his inner parts. And so ouercharged with sickenesse, and paine, and disquietnesse of minde, hee returned to <hi>Roan;</hi> where his sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse increased by such dangerous degrees, that in short time it led him to the period of his dayes.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4099:59"/>
he had vsed against the <hi>English:</hi> holding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for that cause more guilty before God, then glorious among men. Hee spent many good speeches in reconciling himselfe to God and the world, &amp; in exhorting others to vertue and Religion. He gaue great summes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Clergie of <hi>Meux,</hi> and of some other places in <hi>France,</hi> to repaire the Churches which a little before he had defaced. To some Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries he gaue tenne markes of gold, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sixe. To euery Parish Church hee gaue fiue shillings, and to euery Borough Towne a hundred pounds for reliefe of the poore. Hee gaue his Crowne, with all the ornaments ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging, to the Church of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>Caen,</hi> which hee had founded: for redeeming whereof, King <hi>Henry</hi> the first did afterwards giue to the same Church the Mannour of <hi>Brideton</hi> in <hi>Dorcetshire.</hi> Hee reteined perfect memorie and speach so long as he reteined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny breath. Hee ended his life vpon the ninth day of September: full both of honour and of age, when hee had reigned twenty yeeres, eight moneths and sixteene dayes; in the threescore and fourth yeere of his age.</p>
            <p>So soone as he was dead, the chiefe men that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4099:59"/>
were about him went to horse, and departed forthwith to their owne dwellings: to prouide for the safety of themselues, and of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and estates. For all men were possessed with a marueilous feare, that some dangerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures would ensue. The seruants and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Officers also fled away; and to double the basenesse of their disposition, tooke with them whatsoeuer was portable about the king; his Armour, plate, apparell, household-stuffe, all things were held as lawfull bootie. Thus the dead body was not onely abandoned, but left almost naked vpon the ground: where it remained from prime vntil three of the clocke, neither guarded nor regarded by any man. In the meane time the Religious persons went in procession to the Church of S. <hi>Geruase,</hi> &amp; there commended his soule to God. Then <hi>William</hi> Archb. of <hi>Roan</hi> commaunded, that his body should be caried to <hi>Caen,</hi> to be there buried in the Church of <hi>S. Stephen.</hi> But hee was so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of all his followers, that there was not any found who would vndertake either the care or the charge. At the last <hi>Herlwine</hi> a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Knight, vpon his owne cost, caused the body to be embalmed and adorned for funerall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4099:60"/>
pompe: then conueyed it by coach to the mouth of the Riuer <hi>Some;</hi> and so partly by land, and partly by sea brought it to <hi>Caen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Abbot with the Couent of Monks came foorth with all accustomed ceremonies, to meet the corps: to whom the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Clergie and Lay-people did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne. But when they were in the middest of their sad solemnities, a fire brake out of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine house, and suddenly embraced a great part of the towne. Hereupon the Kings body was once againe abandoned; all the people running from it in a headlong haste; some to saue their goods, others to represse the rage of the flame, others (as the latest nouelty) to stand and looke on. In the end a few Moncks retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and accompanied the Hearse to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Church.</p>
            <p>Afterward all the Bishops and Abbots of <hi>Normandy</hi> assembled to solemnize the funerall. And when the diuine Office was ended, and the coffin of stone set into the earth, in the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytorie, betweene the Quire and the Altar (but the body remained vpon the Herse) <hi>Guislebert</hi> bishop of <hi>Eureux</hi> made a long Sermon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee bestowed much breath in extolling the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4099:60"/>
honourable actions of the King. In the end he concluded; That forsomuch as it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a man to liue, much lesse to gouerne, without offence; First, by reason of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Princes affaires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, for that he must commit the managing of many things to the conscience and courtesie of others; Lastly, for that personall grieuances are many times beneficiall to the maine body of State; in which case, particular either losses or harmes, are more then manifoldly recompenced by the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation or quiet of the whole: If therefore any that were present did suppose they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued iniurie from the King, he desired that they would in charitie forgiue him.</p>
            <p>When the Bishop had finished his speach, one <hi>Anselme Fitz-Arthur</hi> stood vp amongst the multitude, and with a high voice said; <hi>This ground whereupon wee stand, was sometimes the floore of my fathers house; which that man of whom you haue spoken, when he was Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie, tooke violently from my father, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward founded thereon this Religious building. This iniustice hee did not by ignorance or ouersight; not vpon any necessitie of State; but to content his owne couetous desire. Now therefore I doe chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:4099:61"/>
               <hi>this ground as my right; and doe here charge you, as you will answere it before the fearefull face of Almightie God, that the body of the spoiler be not couered with the earth of mine inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Bishops and Noble men that were present heard this, and vnderstood by the testimony of many that it was true, they agreed to giue him three pounds presently for the ground that was broken for the place of burial; and for the residue which he claimed, they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke he should be fully satisfied. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was performed in short time after, by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the Kings sonne, who onely was present at the Funerall; at whose appointment <hi>Fitz-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> receiued for the price of the same ground one hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>Now when the body was to be put into the earth, the sepulchre of stone which stood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the graue, was hewen somewhat too strait for his fat belly; whereupon they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to presse it downe with much strength. By this violence, whether his bowels burst, or whether some excrements were forced out at their natural passage, such an intolerable stinck proceeded from him, as neither the perfumes that smoaked in great abundance, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4099:61"/>
meanes were able to qualifie. Wherefore the Priests hasted to finish their office, and the people departed in a sad silence; discoursing diuersly afterward of all these extraordinarie accidents.</p>
            <p>A man would thinke that a sepulchre thus hardly attained, should not easily againe bee lost. But it happened otherwise to this vnquiet King; not destined to rest, either in his life or after his death. For in the yeere 1562. when <hi>Castilion</hi> tooke the Citie of <hi>Caen,</hi> with those broken troupes that escaped at the battaile of <hi>Dreux;</hi> certaine sauage Souldiers of diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, led by foure dissolute Captaines, beate downe the Monument which King <hi>William</hi> his sonne had built ouer him, and both curiously and richly adorned with gold &amp; costly stones. Then they opened his Tombe, &amp; not finding the treasure which they expected, they threw forth his bones with very great derision &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight. Many <hi>English</hi> souldiers were then in the Towne, who were very curious to gather his bones; whereof some were afterwards brought into <hi>England.</hi> Hereby the report is conuinced for vaine, that his body was found vncorrupt, more then foure hundred yeeres after it was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4099:62"/>
buried. Hereby also it is found to be false, that his body was eight foote in length. For neither were his bones proportionable to that stature, (as it is testified by those who saw them) and it is otherwise reported of him by som who liued in his time; namely, that he was of a good sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet not exceeding the ordinary propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men.</p>
            <p>And this was the last end of all his fortunes, of all that was mortall in him besides his fame: whose life is too much extolled by the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and no lesse extenuated by the <hi>English.</hi> Verely, he was a very great Prince: full of hope to vndertake great enterprises, full of courage to atchieue them: in most of his actions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and excusable in all. And this was not the least piece of his Honour, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> which succeeded, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt their order onely from him: not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his victorie in <hi>England,</hi> but generally in respect of his vertue and valour.</p>
            <p>For his entrance was not by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, but with pretence of title to the Crowne: wherein he had both allowance and aide from diuers Christian Princes in Europe. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his partie within the Realme, by whose
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4099:62"/>
meanes he preuailed against the opposite facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as <hi>Caesar</hi> did against <hi>Pompey</hi>) and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the entire strength of the State.</p>
            <p>Againe, hee did not settle himselfe in the chaire of Soueraignetie, as one that had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all things to the proud power and pleasure of a Conquerour, but as an vniuersall successor of former Kings, in all the rights and priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they did enioy. Hee was receiued for King by generall consent; He was crowned with all Ceremonies and Solemnities then in vse; Hee tooke an oath in the presence of the Clergie, the Nobilitie, and of much people, for defence of the Church, for moderate and carefull gouernement, and for vpright admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of iustice.</p>
            <p>Lastly, during the whole course of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, the kingdome receiued no vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall change, no losse or diminution of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For, neither were the olde inhabitants expelled, as were the <hi>Britaines;</hi> neither was the kingdome either subiected or annexed to a greater: but rather it receiued encrease of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in that a lesse State was adioyned vnto it. The change of customes was not violent and at once, but by degrees, and with the silent
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4099:63"/>
approbation of the <hi>English;</hi> who haue alwaies been inclinable to accommodate themselues to the fashions of <hi>France.</hi> The grieuances and oppressions were particular, and with some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance either of iustice, or of necessitie for the common quiet; such as are not vnusuall in any gouernement moderately seuere. So the change was chiefly in the stemme and familie of the King: which whether it be wrought by one of the same nation (as it was in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Pepine</hi> and <hi>Capett</hi>) or by a stranger, (as in the same Countrey by <hi>Henry</hi> 5. and <hi>Henry</hi> 6. Kings of <hi>England</hi>) it bringeth no disparagement in honour; it worketh no essentiall change. The State still remained the same, the solid bodie of the State remained still <hi>English:</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of many <hi>Normans,</hi> was but as Riuers falling into the Ocean; which change not the Ocean, but are confounded with the waters thereof.</p>
            <p>This King had by his wife <hi>Matild,</hi> daughter to <hi>Baldwine</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> foure sonnes; <hi>Robert, Richard, William</hi> and <hi>Henrie:</hi> Hee had also fiue daughters; <hi>Cicely, Constance, Adela, Margaret</hi> and <hi>Elianor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest sonne surnamed <hi>Courtcuise,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:4099:63"/>
by reason of the shortnesse of his thighs, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the duchie of <hi>Normandie.</hi> He was a man of exceeding honourable courage and spirit, for which cause he was so esteemed by the Christian Princes in the great warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Saracens,</hi> that when they had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Citie and territorie of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> they offered the kingdome thereof first vnto him. Yet afterwards, either by the malice of his Fortune, or for that he was both suddaine and obstinate in his owne aduise (two great impediments that valour cannot thriue) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued many foiles of his enemies, which shall be declared in their proper place. Before the King made his descent into <hi>England,</hi> hee gaue the duchie of <hi>Normandie</hi> vnto him: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did this onely to testifie his confidence, or whether afterwards his purpose changed, being often demanded to performe this gift, he would neither deny nor accomplish his word, but enterposed many excuses and delayes; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that he was not so surely setled in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the duchie of <hi>Normandie</hi> was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto him, both for supply for his seruices (which he found like <hi>Hydraes</hi> heads to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by cutting off) and also for an assured place
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4099:64"/>
for retreit, in case hee should be ouercharged with extremities. Hereupon <hi>Robert</hi> vnable to linger and pine in hopes, declared openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him in armes. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was ready to put fuell to the flame; who as he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fauoured in his owne iudgement the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous encreases of the King of <hi>England,</hi> so then he was vigilant to embrace all occasions, either to abate or limit the same. And thus <hi>Robert</hi> both encouraged and enabled by the King of <hi>France,</hi> inuaded <hi>Normandie,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his souldiers licentiously to wast; to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie those by spoile, which by pay he was not able to maintaine. At the last he encountred the King his father in a sharpe conflict, before the castle of <hi>Gerberie,</hi> wherein the King was vnhorsed and wounded in the arme; his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sonne <hi>William</hi> was also hurt, and many of his souldiers slaine. And albeit <hi>Robert</hi> so soone as he knew his father by his voyce, allighted forthwith, mounted him vpon his owne horse, and withdrew him out of the medley; yet did he cast vpon his sonne a cruell curse, which lay so heauie vpon him, that he neuer prospered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in any thing which hee vndertooke. And although after this he was reconciled to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4099:64"/>
his father, and imployed by him in seruices of credit and weight, yet did the King often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray of him an vnquiet conceit, often did he ominate euill vnto him: yea, a little before his death he openly gaue forth, <hi>That it was a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Countrey which should be subiect to his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for that he was a proud and foolish knaue, and to be long scourged by cruell Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> had erected the good expectation of many, as well by his comely countenance and behauiour, as by his liuely and generous spirit. But he died yong by misaduenture, as he was hunting within the New-forrest, before he had made experiment of his worth. Some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that he was goared to death by the Deere of that Forrest, for whose walke his father had dispeopled that large compasse of ground: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers report, that as he rode in chase, hee was hanged vpon the bow of a tree by the chaps: others more probably doe write, that he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by a fal from his horse. He was buried at <hi>Winchester</hi> with this inscription: <hi>Hic iacet Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardus filius Wilielmi senioris Berniae Dux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> did succeed next to his father in the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> To <hi>Henry,</hi> the King gaue at the time of his death fiue thousand
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4099:65"/>
pounds out of his treasure; but gaue him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignitie nor lands: foretelling, that hee should enioy the honour of both his brothers in time, and farre excel them both in dominion and power. Whether this was deuised vpon euent; or whether some doe prophesie at their death; or whether it was coniecturally spoken; or whether to giue contentment for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; it fell out afterward to be true. For hee succeeded <hi>William</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and wrested <hi>Normandie</hi> out of the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Robert.</hi> Of these two I shall write more fully hereafter.</p>
            <p>His daughter <hi>Cicelie</hi> was Abbesse of <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandie. Constance</hi> was married to <hi>Allen Fergant</hi> Earle of <hi>Britaine. Adela</hi> was wife to <hi>Stephen</hi> Earle of <hi>Blois,</hi> to whom she bare <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> who after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> was King of <hi>England. Margaret</hi> was promised in marriage to <hi>Harold;</hi> she died before hee attained the Kingdome, for which cause he held himselfe discharged of that oath which he had made to the Duke her father. <hi>Elianor</hi> was betroathed to <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Gallicia;</hi> but she desired much to die a Virgine: for this she daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this in the end she did obtaine. After
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4099:65"/>
her death her knees appeared brawnie and hard, with much kneeling at her deuotions. Assuredly it will be hard to find in any one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, both greater Valour in sonnes, and more Vertue in daughters.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this Kings reigne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no great accidents did fall, or else they were obscured with the greatnesse of the change: none are reported by the writers of that time.</p>
            <p>In the fourth yeere of his reigne, <hi>Lanfranke</hi> Abbot of <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandie,</hi> but borne in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> was made Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> And <hi>Thomas</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> and <hi>Chanon</hi> of <hi>Bayon</hi> was placed in the Sea of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Betweene these two a controuersie did arise at the time of their consecration, for prioritie in place: but this contention was quieted by the King, and <hi>Thomas</hi> for the time subscribed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Archb. of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> After this they went to <hi>Rome</hi> for their Palles; where the question for Primacie was againe renued, or, as some affirme, first moued before Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> The Pope vsed them both with honorable respect, and especially <hi>Lanfrank,</hi> to whom he gaue two Palles, one of honour, and the other
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4099:66"/>
of loue: but their controuersie he referred to be determined in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two yeeres after it was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and the Clergie at <hi>Windsore.</hi> The Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> alleadged, that when the <hi>Britaines</hi> receiued the Christian faith, in the time of <hi>Lucius</hi> their King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Eleutherius</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> sent <hi>Faganus</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, who ordeined 28. Bishops, and two Archbishops within the Realme, one of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and the other of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Vnder these the Church of <hi>Britaine</hi> was gouerned almost three hundred yeeres, vntill they were subdued by the <hi>Saxons.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> remained Infidels vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Gregorie</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> sent <hi>Augustine</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. By his preaching <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> was first conuerted to the Christian faith: By reason whereof <hi>Augustine</hi> was made Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Douer,</hi> by appointment of Pope <hi>Gregorie;</hi> who sent vnto him certaine Palles with his letter from <hi>Rome.</hi> By this letter it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that <hi>Gregorie</hi> intended to reduce the Church of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to the same order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was among the <hi>Britaines;</hi> namely, to be vnder twelue Bishops and two Archbishops; one of <hi>London</hi> and the other of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Indeede
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4099:66"/>
he gaue to <hi>Augustine</hi> during his life, authority and iurisdiction ouer all Bishops and Priests in <hi>England:</hi> but after his decease he ioyneth these two Metropolitanes in equall degree, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Bishops, to ouersee the Church, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult and dispose of such things as appertaine to the gouernement thereof, as in former times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Britaines.</hi> Betweene these he put no distinction in honour, but only as they were in prioritie of time: and as he appointeth <hi>London</hi> to be consecrated by no Bishop, but of his own Synod, so he expresseth, that the Bishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> should not bee subiect to the Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> And albeit <hi>Augustine</hi> for the reason before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, translated the Sea from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> yet if <hi>Gregorie</hi> had intended to giue the same authoritie to the successours of <hi>Augustine</hi> which hee gaue vnto him, he would haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed it in his Epistle: but in that he maketh no mention of his successours, he concludeth, or rather excludeth them by his silence.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> alleaged, that from the time of <hi>Augustine,</hi> vntill the time of <hi>Bede,</hi> (which was about 140. yeeres) the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Canterburie</hi> (which in ancient time (said he) was called <hi>Douer</hi>) had the Primacie
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4099:67"/>
ouer the whole land of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and of <hi>Ireland;</hi> that they did call the Bishops of <hi>Yorke</hi> to their Councels, which diuers times they kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prouince of <hi>Yorke;</hi> that some Bishops of <hi>Yorke</hi> they did constitute, some excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and some remoue. He alleaged also diuers priuiledges granted by Princes for the Primacie of that Sea; diuers graunted from the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Sea to confirme this dignitie in the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of <hi>Augustine:</hi> that it is reason to receiue directions of well liuing, from whence we first receiued directions of right beleeuing; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was subiect to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> because hee had his faith from thence; for the very same cause the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Yorke</hi> should be in subiection to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> that like as the Lord said that to all the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hee said to S. <hi>Peter;</hi> so that which <hi>Gregorie</hi> said to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> hee said likewise to all his successours. And whereas much is spoken of the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> what is that to the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury?</hi> For, neither is it certaine that <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> was euer resident at <hi>London,</hi> neither that <hi>Gregorie</hi> appointed him so to be.</p>
            <p>In the end it was decreed, That <hi>Yorke</hi> for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4099:67"/>
that time should be subiect to <hi>Canterburie;</hi> that wheresoeuer within <hi>England</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> should hold his Councell, the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> should come vnto it, with the Bishops of his Prouince, and be obedient to his decrees: that when the Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> should decease, the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> should goe to <hi>Canterburie,</hi> to consecrate him that should succeed: that if the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> should decease, his successour should goe to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or to such place as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> should appoint, there to receiue his Consecration, making first his oath of Canonicall obedience. And thus was the contention for this first time taken vp; but in succeeding times it was often renued, and much busied the Clergie of the Realme.</p>
            <p>In the ninth yeere of the reigne of King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> a Councell was holden at <hi>London,</hi> where another matter of like qualitie and nature was decreed: namely, that Bishops should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Sees from villages to Cities; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in short time after, Bishops Sees were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, from <hi>Selese</hi> to <hi>Chichester,</hi> from <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> to <hi>Exeter,</hi> from <hi>Wells</hi> to <hi>Bath,</hi> from <hi>Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne</hi> to <hi>Salisburie,</hi> from <hi>Dorcester</hi> to <hi>Lincolne,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:4099:68"/>
from <hi>Lichfield</hi> to <hi>Chester,</hi> and from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to <hi>Couentree.</hi> And albeit the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Yorke</hi> did oppose against the erecting of a Cathedrall Church in <hi>Lincolne,</hi> because he challenged that Citie to be of his Prouince; yet <hi>Remigius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> being strong both in resolution and in friends, did prosecute his purpose to effect. Not long before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of <hi>Lindafferne</hi> otherwise called <hi>Holy land,</hi> vpon the riuer <hi>Tweed,</hi> had bene translated to <hi>Durhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the tenth yeere of his reigne the cold of Winter was exceeding memorable, both for sharpenesse and for continuance: For the earth remained hard frozen from the beginning of Nouember, vntill the middest of April then ensuing.</p>
            <p>In the 15. yere a great earthquake happened in the month of April; strange for the strong trembling of the earth, but more strange for the dolefull and hideous roaring which it yeelded foorth.</p>
            <p>In the 20. yeere there fell such abundance of raine, that the Riuers did greatly ouerflow in all parts of the Realme. The springs also rising plentifully in diuers hils, so softned and decaied
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4099:68"/>
the foundations of them, that they fell downe, whereby some villages were ouerthrowne. By this distemperature of weather much cattel pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, much cornevpon the ground was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther destroyed, or greatly empaired. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence ensued, first a famine, and afterwards a miserable mortalitie of men.</p>
            <p>And that all the Elements might seeme to haue conspired the calamity of the Realme, the same yeere most of the principall Cities in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were lamentably deformed with fire. At <hi>London</hi> a fire began at the entry of the West gate, which apprehending certaine shops and Ware-houses, wherein was Merchandise apt to burne, it was at once begun and suddenly at the highest. Then being caried with a strong wind, and the Citie apt to maintaine the flame, as well by reason of the crooked and narrow streets, as for that the buildings at that time had open and wide windowes, and were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with base matter fit to take fire, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe spread more swiftly then the remedies could follow. So it raged vntill it came to the Eastgate, prostrated houses and Churches all the way, being the most grieuous that euer as yet hath happened to that Citie. The Church
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4099:69"/>
of <hi>S. Paul</hi> was at that time fired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereupon <hi>Maurice</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> began the foundation of the new Church of <hi>S. Paul.</hi> A worke so admirable, that many did iudge, it would neuer haue bene finished; yet all might easily esteeme thereby his magnanimitie, his high erected hopes, his generous loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Religion. The King gaue towards the building of the East end of this Church, the choise stones of his Castle at the West end of the Citie, vpon the bancke of the Riuer Thames; which Castle at the same time was also fired: in place whereof <hi>Edward Killwarby</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> did afterwards found a Monasterie of blacke Friers. The King also gaue the Castle of <hi>Storford,</hi> and all the lands which thereto belonged, to the same <hi>Maurice,</hi> and to his successours in that See. And doubtlesse nothing more then either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimonious or prophane expending the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church, hath since those times much dried vp those fountaines which first did fill them.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Maurice, Richard</hi> his next Successour, as well in vertue as in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, bestowed all the Rents rising out of this
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4099:69"/>
Bishopricke, to aduance the building of this Church; maintaining himselfe by his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and friendes: and yet all which hee could doe, made no great shewe: so that the finishing of this worke was left to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther succeeeding Bishops. Hee purchased the ground about the Church whereupon many buildings did stand, and inclosed the same with a strong wall of stone for a place of buriall. It seemeth that this wall was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards either battered and torne in some ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres, or else by negligence suffered to decay: for that a graunt was made by King <hi>Edward</hi> the second, that the Church-yard of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> should bee enclosed with a wall, because of the robberies and murthers that were there committed. Many parts of this wall remaine at this time, on both sides of the Church, but couered for the most part with dwelling houses.</p>
            <p>The same yeere in Whitsun-weeke, the King honoured his sonne <hi>Henrie</hi> with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood. What Ceremonies the King then vsed it is not certainly knowen: but before his time the custome among the <hi>Saxons</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:4099:70"/>
was thus. First, hee who should receiue the order of Knighthood, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>essed himselfe in the euening to a Priest. Then hee continued all that night in the Church, watching and applying himselfe to his priuate deuotions. The next morning he heard Masse, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his sword vpon the Altar. After the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel was read, the sword was hallowed, and with a benediction put about his necke. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he communicated the mysteries of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed body of Christ, and from that time remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a lawfull Souldier or Knight.

It was also coniectured by some, that the King was guided in this choise, no lesse by his iudgement, then by his affection: for that he esteemed the fierce disposition of his sonne <hi>William</hi> more fit to gouerne a people not well setled in subiection, then the flexible and milde nature of his eldest sonne <hi>Robert.</hi> So <hi>William</hi> taking his last leaue of his father, who was then taking his last leaue of this world, iourneyed towards <hi>England;</hi> and in short time arriued at the port called <hi>Whitesand,</hi> where he receiued the first report of his fathers death.

            <p>It is inconuenient (I grant) to be vnder a King who is defectiue in body or in mind; but it is a greater inconuenience, by disturbing a setled forme of gouernment, to open an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance for all disorders; wherein ambition and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4099:78"/>
insolencie (two riotous humours) may range at large. For as euill is generally of that nature, that it cannot stand, but by supportance of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other euill; and so multiplieth in it selfe, vntill it doth ruine with the proper weight: so mindes hauing once exceeded the strict bounds of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, cease not to strengthen one bouldnesse by another, vntil they haue inuolued the whole State in confusion.</p>
            <p>BVt now to returne to the person and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of this King <hi>William<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> He was a man of meane stature, thicke and square bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, his belly swelling somewhat round; his face was red, his haire deepely yealow, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof he was called <hi>Rufus;</hi> his forehead foure square like a window, his eyes spotted and not one like the other; his speech vnpleasant and not easily vttered, especially when he was mooued with anger. He was of great abilitie in body, as well for naturall strength, as for har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse to endure all ordinary extremities both of trauaile and of want. In Armes he was both expert and aduenturous; full of inward braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and fiercenesse; neuer dismayed, alwayes forward, and for the most part fortunate; in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4099:78"/>
counsaile sudden, in performance a man; not doubting to vndertake any thing which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible valour durst promise to atchieue. Hee had bene bred with the sword; alwayes in action, alwayes on the fauourable hand of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: so as, albeit he was but yong, yet was he in experience well grounded; for inuention subtill, in counsaile quicke, in execution reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; wise to foresee a danger, and expedite to auoid it. In a word, the generall reputation of his valour and celeritie, made him esteemed one of the best Chiefetaines in his time.</p>
            <p>His behauiour was variable and inconstant; earnest in euery present passion, and for the most part accompanying the disposition of his mind, with outward demonstrations. Of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was rough, haughtie, obstinate, inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, which was much enlarged both by his soueraigntie and youth: so singular in his owne conceit, that he did interprete it to his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that the world should deeme, that he did not gouerne by his owne iudgement. In publicke he composed his countenance to a stately terrour; his face sowerly swelling, his eyes truculent, his voyce violent and fierce, scarce thinking himselfe Maiesticall in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4099:79"/>
glasse of his vnderstanding, but when he flash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed feare from his presence. And yet in priuate he was so affable and pleasant, that he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neere the degree of leuitie: much giuen to scoffing, and passing ouer many of his euill actions with a ieast. In all the other carriages of his life, he maintained no stable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course; but declared himselfe for euery present, as well in vertue as in vice, strong, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, extreeme.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of his reigne he was estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a most accomplished Prince; and seemed not so much of power to bridle himselfe from vice, as naturally disposed to abhorre it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either with variation of times, or yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pleasures which prosperity vseth to ingender euen in moderate minds, or perhaps his nature beginning to disclose that which hee had cunningly concealed before, corruptions crept vp, and he waued vncertainely betweene vertue and vice. Lastly, being imboldned by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill teachers, and by continuance both of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie and rule, he is said to haue made his height a priuiledge of loosenesse, and to haue abandoned himselfe to all licentious demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; wherein he seemed little to regard God, and nothing man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:4099:79"/>Assuredly, there is no greater enemie to great men, then too great prosperitie in their affaires; which taketh from them all iudgement and rule of themselues; which maketh them ful of libertie, and bould to doe euill. And yet I cannot conceiue that this King was so bould, so carelesse, so shamelesse in vices, as many wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe report. It is certaine that hee doubted of some points of Religion, at that time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great contradiction professed; and namely, of praying to Saints, worshipping of Reliques, &amp; such like. It is certain also, that out of policie in State, he endeuoured to abate the tumorous greatnes of the Clergie at that time; as well in riches, as in authority and power with the people: and that he attributed not so much to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> as diuers Kings before him had done. Insomuch as he restrained his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and withheld the annuall paiment of <hi>Peter</hi> pence, and was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes heard to giue foorth, that <hi>they follow not the trace of S.</hi> Peter, <hi>they greedily gape after gifts and rewards, they retein not his power, whose pietie they do not imitate.</hi> These were causes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the writers of his time (who were for the most part Clergie-men) to enlarge his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4099:80"/>
beyond the trueth, to surmise many vices vntruely, to wrest his true vertues to be vices.</p>

Out of all doubt he was a magnanimous Prince; merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and liberall, and in martiall affaires most expert, diligent and prosperous; wise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue his best aduantage, and most couragious to atchieue it. But two things chiefly obscured his glory; one, the incomparable greatnesse of his father, to whom he did immediatly suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede; the other was the prowesse of those men, against whom he did contend in armes; especially of <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie.</hi> To these I may
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4099:80"/>
adde, that hee died in the principall strength and flourish of his age, before his iudgement had full command ouer his courage.</p>
            <p>Many doe attribute his excellent begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to <hi>Lanfranck</hi> Archb. of <hi>Canterburie:</hi> who during the time of his life, partly by authoritie, and partly by aduise, supported the vnstable yeeres and disposition of the King: which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Lanfranck</hi> returned by degrees to their proper sway. But I do rather attribute many of his first vertues to the troubles which happened in the very entrance of his reigne; which partly by employment, and partly by feare, held his inclination in some restraint. For <hi>Odo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Baion</hi> and Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Kings vncle by the mothers side, had drawen the greatest part of all the Prelates and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that were <hi>Normans,</hi> into a dangerous confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie against the King; to deiect him from his Srate, and to aduance <hi>Robert</hi> his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their King.</p>
            <p>The secret cause of this conspiracie was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon a generall discontentment, at the great, though worthy estimation and authoritie (a most capitall offence in the eye of enuie) of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie;</hi> by means
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:4099:81"/>
whereof many of the conspirators liued in farre meaner reputation, then their ambitious minds could easily breake: but chiefly it was vpon a more particular grudge, which <hi>Odo</hi> did beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same <hi>Lanfranck;</hi> because by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, <hi>Odo</hi> had been committed to prison by King <hi>William</hi> the elder. For when the King complained to <hi>Lanfranck</hi> of the intolerable both auarice and ambition of his brother <hi>Odo,</hi> the Archbishop gaue aduise, that hee should bee restrained of his libertie. And when the King doubted, how he being a Bishop, might be committed to prison, without impeaching the priuiledges of the Church; indeede answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Lanfranck,</hi> you may not imprison the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Baion,</hi> but you may doe what you please with the Earle of <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The publike and open pretenses were these. <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> had the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of birth; which being a benefit proceeding from nature, could not bee reuersed by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acte. He had also wonne a most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reputation for his militarie vertues; and had by many trauels of warre wasted the wilde follies of youth. Hee was no lesse famous for courtesie and liberalitie, two most amiable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4099:81"/>
of honour; being so desirous that no man should depart discontented from him, that he would oftentimes promise more then hee was able to performe, and yet performe more then his estate could expediently afford. As for K. <hi>William,</hi> besides that he was the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother, his nature was held to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and suspect, and the iudgement of most men enclined to the worst. And what are we then aduantaged, (said they) by the death of his father? if whom he hath fleeced, this shall flay; if this shall execute those whom he hath fettered and surely bound; If after his seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are past, wee shall be freshly charged with those rigours, which tyrants in the height and pride of their Fortune are wont to vse? And as stronger combinations are alwayes made betweene men drawne together by one common feare, then betweene those that are ioyned by hope or desire; so vpon these iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies and feares, accompanied also with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desires, the Confederats supposed that they had knit a most assured league.</p>
            <p>Now it happened that at the time of the death of <hi>William</hi> the elder, <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest sonne was absent in <hi>Almaine;</hi> and at once
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4099:82"/>
heard both of the death of his father, and that his brother <hi>William</hi> was acknowledged to be King. Hereupon in great hast, but greater heat both o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> anger and ambition, he returned into <hi>Normandie:</hi> and there whilest he was brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing foorth his discontentment and desire of reuenge, he receiued a message from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats in <hi>England;</hi> that with all speed hee should come ouer vnto them, to accomplish the enterprise, to furnish their forces with a head: that they had no want of able bodies; they wanted no meanes to maintaine them together; they wanted onely his person both to countenance and conduct them. The Duke thought it no wisdome, to aduenture himselfe altogether; vpon the fauour and faith of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented persons: and he had bene so loosely liberall before, that he was vnprouided of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to appoint himselfe with any competent forces of his owne. Hereupon he pawned a part of <hi>Normandie</hi> to his brother <hi>Henry,</hi> for waging Souldiers: many also flocked volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily vnto him; vpon inducement, that hee who of his owne nature was most liberall &amp; full of humanitie, would not faile both of pay and reward, vnlesse by reason of disabilitie &amp; want.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:4099:82"/>In the meane time the Confederats resolued to breake forth in Armes, in diuers parts of the Realme at once; vpon conceit, that if the King should endeuour to represse them in one place, they might more easily preuaile in the other. And so accordingly <hi>Odo</hi> fortified and spoiled in <hi>Kent; Geoffrey</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exceter,</hi> with his nephew <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at <hi>Bristow; Roger Montgomerie</hi> in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, Suffolke</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeshire; Hugh de Grandmenill,</hi> in <hi>Leicestershire</hi> and <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire; William</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durhame,</hi> in the North parts of the Realme; diuers others of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Nobilitie in <hi>Herefordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire,</hi> and all the Countreys adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Wales.</hi> And as in time of pestilence all diseases turne to the plague; so in this generall tumult, all discontentments sorted to Rebellion. Many who were oppressed with violence or with feare; many who were kept lower either by want or disgrace then they had set their mounting minds, adioyned daily to the side, and encreased both the number and the hope. And thus was all the Realme in a rumous rage against K. <hi>William,</hi> who wanted neither cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to beare, nor wisdome to decline it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:4099:83"/>And first hee endeuoured by all meanes to make the <hi>English</hi> assured vnto him. And albeit few of them were at that time in any great place, either of credite or of charge, but were all wounded by his fathers wrongs; yet for that they were the greatest part, he made the greatest reckoning of them. For this cause hee released many <hi>English</hi> Lords who had bene committed to custodie by his father. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himselfe to courtesie and affabilitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people, and distributed much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure among them. But especially hee wanne their inclination by promises of great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to restore vnto them their ancient lawes, to ease them of tributes and taxations, and to permit them free libertie of hunting: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their principall pleasure and exercise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was either taken away, or much restrained from them by King <hi>William</hi> the elder. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he applied himselfe to appease the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous minds of his Nobilitie, to seuer the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats, to breake the faction; to diuide it first, and thereby to defeat it.</p>
            <p>To this purpose he dealt with <hi>Roger Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomerie,</hi> who next vnto <hi>Odo</hi> was a principall both countenance and strength to the reuolt;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4099:83"/>
he dealt also with diuers others, inferiour vnto him in authority and degree; that he could not coniecture for what cause they were so violent against him: did they want money? His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers treasure was at their deuotion: desired they encrease of possessions? they should not be otherwise bounded then by their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: that hee would willingly also giue ouer his estate, in case it should be iudged expedient by themselues, whom his father had put in trust to support him: that they should doe wel to foresee, whether by ouerthrowing his fathers iudgement in appointing the kingdome vnto him, they should not doe that which might be preiudiciall to themselues; for the same man who had appointed him to bee King, had also conferred vnto them those honours and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions which they held. Thus sometimes dealing priuately with particulars, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with many together, and eftsoones filling them with promises and hopes, and that with such new vehemencie of words as they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued could not proceede from dissembled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; he so preuailed in the end, that hereby, and by example of some inducing the rest, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Montgomerie</hi> and diuers others were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4099:84"/>
to the King; in whom was thought to rest no smal matter to hold vp the reputation of the enterprise.</p>
            <p>And further, hee prepared a nauie to guard the seas, and to impeach the passage of his brother into <hi>England.</hi> Hee prepared great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also by meanes of the treasure which his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had left, and disposed them in places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, either to preuent or to represse these scattered tumults. But the successe of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires was by no meanes so much aduanced, as by <hi>Lanfranck</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and by <hi>Woolstane</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester:</hi> the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which two men, the one for his learning, wisedome, and mild moderation, the other for his simple sanctitie and integritie of life, was greatly regarded by all sorts of people. By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>Woolstane</hi> not onely the citie of <hi>Worcester</hi> was maintained in firme condition for the King, but his enemies receiued there a famous foyle; the greatest part being slaine, and the residue dispersed. This was the first sad blow which the confederates tooke; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they declined mainely, and the King as mainly did increase.</p>
            <p>The King in person led his chiefe forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4099:84"/>
               <hi>Kent,</hi> against <hi>Odo</hi> his vncle, the principall firebrand of all this flame. Hee tooke there the castle of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> and of <hi>Pemsey,</hi> which <hi>Odo</hi> had fortified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lastly hee besieged <hi>Odo</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the castle of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and with much trauell tooke him prisoner, and compelled him to abiure the Realme. Vpon these euents, the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> aduising onely with feare and despaire, fled out of the Realme; but after three yeeres he was againe restored to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his Sea. The residue did submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Kings discretion; and were by him receiued, all to pardon, some to gracious and deare account. For in offences of so high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, pardon neuer sufficeth to assure offenders, vnlesse by further benefits their loyaltie bee bound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> was busied all this time, in making preparation for his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>England:</hi> but his delayes much abated the affections of those who fauoured either his person or cause. At the length, hauing made vp a competent power, he committed to sea; where, his infelicities concurring with his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, diuers of his ships which he had sent somewhat before him, to assure the confederats
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4099:85"/>
of his approach, were set vpon and surprised by the nauie of King <hi>William.</hi> After this hee arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>England,</hi> sent vnto many of his secret friends, and made his comming knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all: but no man resorted to him, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no aduertisement from any man; but plainely found, that by the fortunate celeritie of King <hi>William,</hi> the heart of the conspiracie in all places was broken. So the Duke returned into <hi>Normandie,</hi> hauing then good leisure, to looke into the errour of his leisurely procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>When the King had in this sort either wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled, or valiantly repressed his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall enemies; because an vnperfect victory is alwayes the seede of a new warre, he followed his brother with a mighty armie, and remoued the seate of the warre into <hi>Normandie.</hi> For he coniectured (as in trueth it fell out) that the Duke his brother vpon his returne, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently disperse his companies, for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and for the same cause would not easily be able to draw them together againe. So his valour and his power being much aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his sudden comming, ioyned to the want of foresight and preparation in the Duke;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4099:85"/>
he tooke in short time the Castles of <hi>Walerick</hi> and <hi>Aubemarle,</hi> with the whole Countrey of <hi>Eu;</hi> the Abbacie of <hi>Mount S. Michael, Fescampe, Chereburge,</hi> and diuers other places; which he furnished with men of Armes, and Souldiers of assured trust.</p>
            <p>The Duke feeling his owne weakenesse, dealt with <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and by liberall promises so preuailed with him, that he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>Normandie</hi> with a faire Armie, and bent his siege against one of those pieces which K. <hi>William</hi> had taken. But he found it so knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a piece of worke, that in short time wearied with hardnesse and hazards of the field, he fell to a capitulation with King <hi>William,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of <hi>Normandie;</hi> receiuing a certaine summe of money in regard of his charges, and conceiuing that he had won honour ynough, in that no honour had bene won against him.</p>
            <p>The money that was payd to the King of <hi>France,</hi> was raised in <hi>England</hi> by this deuise. King <hi>William</hi> commanded that 20. Thousand men should be mustered in <hi>England,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>Normandie,</hi> to furnish his warres against the <hi>French.</hi> When they were condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted neere to <hi>Hastings,</hi> and almost ready to be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:4099:86"/>
embarked, it was signified to them from the King; that aswell for their particular safeties, as not to disfurnish the Realme of strength, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer would pay 10. shillings towards the waging of Souldiers in <hi>Normandie,</hi> he might be excused to stay at home. Among 20. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand scarce any was found, who was not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to embrace the condition; who was not ready to redeeme his aduenture with so small a summe: which being gathered together, was both a surer and easier meanes to finish the warres, then if the King had still struggeled by force of Armes. For when the <hi>French</hi> King had abandoned the partie, Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared neither with money, nor constancie of mind to continue the warre, enclined to peace; which at the last, by diligence of friends, was concluded betweene the two brothers, vpon these conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Duke should yeeld to the King the Countie of</hi> Eu, <hi>the Abbey of</hi> Fescampe, <hi>the Abbey of</hi> S. Michaels mount, Chereburge, <hi>and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Castles and fortifications which the King had taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the King should subdue to the vse of the Duke, all other Castles and houldes, which</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:4099:86"/>
               <hi>had reuolted from him in</hi> Normandie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the King should giue to the Duke cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dignities and possessions in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the King should restore all those to their dignities and lands in</hi> England, <hi>who had taken part with the Duke against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if either of them should die without issue male, the suruiuour should succeed in his estate.</hi> These Articles were confirmed by twelue Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons on the Kings part, and as many on the part of the Duke; so long obserued, as either of them wanted either power or pretence to disanull them.</p>
            <p>This peace being made, the Duke vsed the aide of King <hi>William,</hi> to recouer the fort of <hi>Mount S. Michael,</hi> which their brother <hi>Henrie</hi> did forceably hold, for the money which hee had lent to the Duke of <hi>Normandie.</hi> Fourtie dayes they layed siege to this castle; hauing no hope to carrie it, but by the last necessity, which is hunger. Within the compasse of this time, as the King straggled alone vpon the shoare, certaine horsemen salied foorth and charged vpon him; of whom three strooke him toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so violently with their lances, as because he could not be driuen out of his saddle, together
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4099:87"/>
with his saddle he was cast vpon the ground, and his horse slaine vpon the place, for which he had payed the same day 15. markes. Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of danger (as it often happeneth) tooke from the King all feare of danger: wherefore taking vp his saddle with both his hands, he did there with defend himselfe for a time. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to stand vpon defence onely is alwayes vnsure, he drew his sword, and would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part one foot from his saddle; but making shew of braue ioy, that he had nothing to trust vnto but his owne valour, he defended both his saddle and himselfe, till rescue came. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when some of his Souldiers in blaming maner expostulated with him, wherefore he was so obstinate to saue his saddle: his answere was, that a King should loose nothing which he can possibly saue: <hi>It would haue angred mee,</hi> (said he) <hi>at the very heart, that the knaues should haue bragged, that they had wonne the saddle from mee.</hi> And this was one of his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall felicities, to escape easily out of desperate dangers.</p>
            <p>In the end <hi>Henry</hi> grew to extreeme want of water, and other prouisions: by which meanes he was ready to fall into the hands of those,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4099:87"/>
who desired to auoyd necessitie to hurt him. And first he sent to the Duke his brother, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest some libertie to take in fresh water. The Duke sent to him a tunne of wine, and granted a surcease of hostilitie for one day, to furnish him with water. At this the King seemed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, as being a meanes to prolong the warre. But the Duke told him, that it had bene hard to deny a brother a little water for his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie. Here with like wise the King relenting, they sent for their brother <hi>Henry;</hi> and wisdome preuailing more then iniuries or hate, they fell to an agreement, That vpon a day appointed, <hi>Henry</hi> should receiue his money at <hi>Roan;</hi> and that in the meane time, hee should hold the countrey of <hi>Constantine</hi> in morgage. The King enterteined with pay many of his brother <hi>Henries</hi> souldiers; especially he receiued those who ouerthrew him, to a very neere degree of fauour. And thus all parties ordered their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition with great modestie; the custome of former warres running in a course of more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, then since they haue done.</p>
            <p>The King was the more desirous to perfect these agreements of Peace, for that <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> (as Princes often times make vse
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4099:88"/>
of the contentions of their neighbours) tooke occasion vpon these confusions, to enterprise vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the parts of <hi>England</hi> which confined vpon him. So as he inuaded <hi>Northumberland,</hi> made great spoile, tooke much prey, caried away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prisoners; whose calamitie was the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, for that they were to endure seruitude in a hard Countrey. For this cause the King with his accustomed celeritie returned into <hi>England,</hi> accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> his brother; and led a mighty armie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Scots</hi> by land, and sent also a nauie to infest them by sea. But by a sudden and stiffe storme, by a hideous confusion of all ill disposed weather, his ships were cruelly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; and hauing long wrought against the violence and rage of the tempest, were in the end dispersed, and diuers of them cast away. Many of his souldiers also perished, partly by penurie and want, and partly by the euill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litied ayre.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the <hi>Scots,</hi> knowing the King of <hi>England</hi> to bee an enemie mighty and resolute, began to wauer in their assurance; framing fearefull opinions, of the number, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and experience of his armie. Hereupon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4099:88"/>
some ouertures of Peace were made; the <hi>Scots</hi> expecting that the King, by reason of his late losses, would be the more moderate in his demands. But hee then shewed himselfe most resolute and firme; following his naturall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, not to yeelde to any difficulty. King <hi>Malcolme</hi> coniecturing that such confidence could not be without good cause, consented at the last to these conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That King</hi> Malcolme <hi>should make a certaine satisfaction for the spoyles which hee had done in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That King</hi> William <hi>should resto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re to him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lands in</hi> England.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That K.</hi> Malcolme <hi>should doe homage to King</hi> William.</p>
            <p>Now the day was come wherein <hi>Henrie</hi> was appointed to receiue his money at <hi>Roan,</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Normandie.</hi> But as affaires of Princes haue great variations, so they are not alwayes constant in their Counsels. And so the Duke, caried by his occasions, and ready to lay downe his faith and word more to the traine of times, then to the preseruation of his honour; instead of paying the money, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his brother <hi>Henry</hi> to prison: from
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4099:89"/>
whence he could not be released, vntill hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Countie of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and bound himselfe by oath neuer to claime any thing in <hi>Normandie.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Henrie</hi> complained hereof to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> who gaue him a faire enterteinement in his Court, but was content rather to feede then finish the contention: either expecting thereby some opportunitie to himselfe, or els the opinion of his owne greatnesse not suffring him to feare, that others might grow to haue fortune against him. <hi>Henry</hi> had not long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but a <hi>Normane</hi> Knight named <hi>Hacharde</hi> conueyed him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised into <hi>Normandie;</hi> where the Castle of <hi>Damfronç</hi> was deliuered vnto him; and in short time after hee gate all the Countrey of <hi>Passays,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Constantine;</hi> either without resistance, or without difficultie and perill.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Duke leuied his forces, and earnestly assayed to recouer <hi>Damfronç:</hi> but then hee found that his brother <hi>Henrie</hi> was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, yet surely vnderset by the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Hereupon, incensed with the furie of an iniuried minde, hee exclaimed against his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4099:89"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and almost proclaimed him a violater of his league. On the otherside, the King of <hi>England</hi> iustified his action, for that hee was both a meanes and a partie to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore stood bound in honour, not onely to vrge, but to enforce performance. So the flame brake foorth more furious then it was before, and ouer went King <hi>William</hi> with an able armie; where hee found the Duke also in good condition of strength commanding the field. And albeit in so neere approach of two mighty enemies, equall both in ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and power, it is hard to conteine men of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; yet was nothing executed betweene them, but certaine light skirmishes, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizements of some places of defence. In the end, the King hearing of new troubles in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Duke finding himselfe vnable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preuaile with few souldiers, or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine many, and both distrusting to put a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die end to the warre; they were easily drawne to capitulations of peace. And thus ended the contention betweene these brethren; who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this time had continued like the waues of the Sea, alwayes in motion, and one beating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:4099:90"/>Besides these businesses which befell the King, against his Nobilitie, against the Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> his brother, and against the King and nation of the <hi>Scots;</hi> the <hi>Welshmen</hi> also (who alwayes struggled for libertie and reuenge) perceiuing that the King was often absent, and much entangled with hostile affaires; enforced the fauour of that aduantage, to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from subiection of the <hi>English,</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to enlarge or enrich themselues vpon them. So hauing both desire and opportunitie, they wanted not meanes to assemble in armes, to expell the <hi>English</hi> that were amongst them, and to cast downe the Castles erected in their Countrey, as the principall yoakes of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. Afterwards, rising in boldnesse with successe, they made diuers incursions vpon the bordering parts of <hi>England;</hi> spoiled the Citie of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and exercised all those outrages, which vnciuill people, incensed both with want and with hate doe not vsually omit. But being a company neither in discipline nor pay, raw and vnarmed, they proceeded more like to robbers then to Souldiers; hauing no intention to vanquish, but to spoile.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the King twice in person inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4099:90"/>
               <hi>Wales,</hi> but with small shew of successe for the present. For the <hi>Welsh</hi>-enemies scattered the warre, by diuiding themselues into small companies, and retiring into the mountaines and woods, and other places of naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Here they trauailed the King with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue fight; flying when they were pursued, and houering vpon him when they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer: cutting off many stragling soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and taking some carriages, which in those rough places could not easily either be passed, or defended. And so by shifting alwayes into places of aduantage, they sought at one time, both to auoyd fighting, and to hinder the King from doing any thing of importance. At the last, the King hauing made sufficient proofe how vaine it is, to follow a light footed enemie with a heauie Armie, pestered with traine of carriage, in places where the seruice of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is almost vnprofitable; he gaue ouer the pursuit, and retired into <hi>England.</hi> But first he repaired those Castles which the <hi>Welsh</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and built new Castles also vpon the frontiers and within the bosome of <hi>Wales;</hi> which he furnished with so sure garrisons, as might suffice with fauour of opportunitie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:4099:91"/>
to weary or consume the enemies.</p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Welsh</hi> being by this meanes, alwayes exercised, and dayly wasted; declined in short time, no lesse to cowardise then to wearinesse and wants; so as <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewesbury,</hi> dispossessed them of the Isle of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> which they had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised not long before. The <hi>Welsh</hi> that were there taken, were very hardly, or rather vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully and cruelly entreated; Some had their eyes pulled out, some their hands cut off, some their armes, some their noses, some their geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles. An aged Priest named <hi>Kenredus,</hi> who had bene a chiefe directer of the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, was drawne out of a Church whereinto he had fled, had one of his eyes pulled out, and his tongue torne from his throat. I make no doubt but these seuerities were vsed against them, vpon some sauage outrages which they had done; wherein the lesse compassion was borne to their calamities, for the cowardise which they shewed in their owne defence.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, <hi>Magnus</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> the sonne of <hi>Olaus,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Harold Harfager,</hi> hauing brought the Isles of <hi>Orkeney</hi> vnder his dominion, subdued also from the <hi>Welsh</hi> the Isle
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4099:91"/>
of <hi>Man;</hi> and enterprised vpon the Isle of <hi>Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> against the <hi>English.</hi> But at his landing he was encountred by the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Chester;</hi> in which fight the <hi>Norwegians</hi> were vanquished and repelled, but the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> with too braue boldnesse lost his life: leauing his honourable both actions and end as an excellent ornament to his posteritie. Afterwards the Earle of <hi>Chester</hi> led an armie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Wales;</hi> and found the people so consumed by the <hi>English</hi> garisons, that he easily reduced many to professe obedience to the Crowne of <hi>England;</hi> and disabled others, hauing no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of experience and valour, for shewing their faces as enemies in the field.</p>
            <p>Also vpon some variances which did rise betweene <hi>Iustinus,</hi> sonne to <hi>Gurguntus,</hi> Earle of <hi>Glamorgane</hi> and <hi>Morganock;</hi> and <hi>Rhesus</hi> sonne to <hi>Theodore</hi> Prince of Southwales: <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus,</hi> not of power to maintaine either his right or his will, sent <hi>Aeneas,</hi> sonne to <hi>Genido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> sometimes Lord of <hi>Demetia,</hi> to craue aide in <hi>England.</hi> This he obtained, not onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, but in greater measure then the seruice did require. <hi>Robert Fitzhamond</hi> was generall Commander of the <hi>English</hi> armie; who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4099:92"/>
               <hi>Rhesus</hi> at a place called <hi>Blackhill;</hi> and in that fight <hi>Rhesus</hi> was slaine: after whose death the name of King ceased in <hi>Wales.</hi> Then <hi>Iustinus</hi> failing, and happily not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme such conditions as in necessitie hee had assured, <hi>Fitzhamond</hi> turned his forces against him; chased the <hi>Welsh</hi> out of the champaine Countrey, and diuided the same among his principall Gentlemen. These erected Castles, in places conuenient for their mutuall ayde; and so well defended themselues, that they left the Countrey to their posterity. Thus was the Lordship of <hi>Glamorgane</hi> and <hi>Morganock,</hi> which conteineth 27. miles in length, &amp; 22. in bredth, subdued to the <hi>English;</hi> giuing example how dangerous it is for any people, to call in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force of strangers to their ayde, then being victorious, they may easily be able to limit and restraine. This being a Lordship marcher, hath enioyed royall liberties, since the time wherein it was first subdued. It hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged seruice and obedience onely to the Crowne. It hath had the triall of all actions, as well reall as personall, and also held Pleas of the Crowne; with authority to pardon all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, Treason onely excepted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:4099:92"/>Whilest the King was entertained with these chases, rather then warres in <hi>Wales,</hi> hee lay at <hi>Gloucester</hi> many times; as not esteeming that his presence should alwayes be necessary, and yet not farre off if occasion should require. To this place <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, vpon an honourable visitation. But the King hauing conceiued some displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, refused to admit him to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Hereupon King <hi>Malcolme,</hi> full of fury and disdaine, returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> assembled an armie, enuaded <hi>Northumberland,</hi> harrased and spoyled a great part thereof; hauing done the like foure times before. Such is the heate of hate in mindes that are mighty; who sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hold it any breach of Iustice, to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of him who offereth dishonor. When he was come neere to <hi>Alnewicke,</hi> and his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were much pestered with prey, (a notable impediment both for readinesse and resolution to fight) hee was set vpon both suddenly and sharply by <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> Earle of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland;</hi> his troupes hewen in pieces, himselfe together with his eleest sonne <hi>Edward</hi> slaine. The third day ensuing, <hi>Margaret</hi> wife to King <hi>Malcolme,</hi> and sister to <hi>Edgar Adeling,</hi> not able
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4099:93"/>
to beare so sad and heauie a blow of fortune, ended also her life. Shee was famous for pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and for modestie, two excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that Sexe. By her perswasion <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme</hi> made a law, that whereas by a former law made by King <hi>Eugenius,</hi> the Lord enioyed the first night with any new married woman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his dominion; the husband might redeeme that abuse by paiment of halfe a mark of siluer.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Malcolme</hi> being slaine, <hi>Dunwald</hi> his brother vsurped the kingdome; but after a few dayes he was dispossessed thereof by <hi>Duncane,</hi> bastard son to K. <hi>Malcolme.</hi> In this action <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> was chiefly supported by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> with whom he had remained in hostage, and to whom hee had made his submission by oath. And because the <hi>Scots</hi> did either see or suspect that hee bare a fauourable affection to the <hi>English,</hi> they would not receiue him for their King, but vnder promise that hee should not entertaine any <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Normane,</hi> either in place of seruice, or as a follower at large. The yeere next following <hi>Duncane</hi> was slaine, and <hi>Dunwald</hi> was againe possessed of the kingdom. Hereupon King <hi>William</hi> sent <hi>Clito Edgar</hi> with an armie into <hi>Scotland;</hi> by whose meanes <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:4099:93"/>
was dispoiled againe of his Kingdome, and <hi>Edgar</hi> sonne to King <hi>Malcolme</hi> aduanced to his fathers estate.</p>
            <p>These were the principall aduentures by Armes which concerned <hi>England,</hi> during the reigne of K. <hi>William</hi> the second: wherein he so behaued himselfe, that he did worthily winne an opinion to be one, who both knew and durst. In all actions hee esteemed himselfe greatly dishonoured, if hee were not both in Armes with the first, and with the forwardest in fight; doing double seruice, as well by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as by direction: In which heate of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the fauour of his Fortune excused many of his attempts from the blame of rashnesse. He was oftentimes most constant, or rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in pursuing those purposes, which with small deliberation he vndertooke.</p>
            <p>At a certaine time when he was in hunting within the new Forrest, he receiued aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>Mans</hi> was surprised by <hi>Helie,</hi> Count <hi>de la Flesch,</hi> who pretended title thereto in right of his wife: that he was aided in this enterprise by <hi>Fouques d' Angiers,</hi> an ancient enemie to the Dukes of <hi>Normandie:</hi> and that the castle which held good for the King, must also be rendered,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4099:94"/>
if in very short time it were not relieued. Vpon these newes, as if he had bene in the heat of a chase, he presently turned his horse; and his passion not staying to consult with reason, in great haste roade towards the Sea. And when he was aduised by some to stay a time, and take with him such forces as the importance of the seruice did require; with a heart resolute and violent voice he answered, <hi>That they who loued him, would not faile to follow; and that if no man else would stirre, he alone would relieue Mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he came to <hi>Dortmouth,</hi> he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ships to be brought for his passage. The winds were then both contrary and stiffe, and the Sea swelled exceeding bigge; for which cause the Shipmasters perswaded him to await a more fauourable season, and not to cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon the miserable mercie of that storme. Notwithstanding the King, whose feare was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes least when dangers were greatest, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon Shipboard, and commanded them to put to Sea; affirming, That it was no Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like mind to breake a iourney for foulenesse of weather; and that he neuer heard of any King that had bene drowned. And so for that the chiefe point of rescue rested in expedition, hee
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4099:94"/>
presently committed to Sea; taking few with him, and leauing order that others should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. After hee had long wrastled with the winds and waues, he arriued in <hi>France,</hi> where running on in the humour of his courage and forwardnesse, he acquitted himselfe with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour then at any time before. So effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall is celeritie for the benefit of a seruice, that oftentimes it more auaileth, then either multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or courage of Souldiers.</p>
            <p>In this expedition, <hi>Helie</hi> the principall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander against him was taken. And when he was brought to the Kings presence, the King said pleasantly vnto him: <hi>Ah master! in faith I haue you now; and I hope I shalbe able to keepe you in quiet.</hi> Then he: <hi>It is true indeed, the successe of my attempts haue not bene answerable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of my minde; by meere aduenture now you haue me: but if I were at libertie againe, I doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know what I had to doe, and would not so easily be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ld in quiet.</hi> The King with a braue scorne replied: <hi>I see thou art but a foolish knaue; vnable to vse, either thy libertie or thy restreint aright. But goe thy wayes, make good thy confidence: I set thee free and at libertie againe; vse thy aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and doe thy worst. Helie</hi> daunted more
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4099:95"/>
with this high courage, then before he had bin with the victory of the King, submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and made his peace vnder such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as it pleased the King to lay vpon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Certainely this magnanimous example hath seldome bin equalled, neuer excelled by those, who are admired for the principall worthies of the world.</p>
            <p>He little fauoured flatterers; the flies which blow corruption vpon sweetest vertues; the myrie dogs of the Court, who defile Princes with fawning on them; who commonly are fatted with bread which is made with the teares of miserable people. He was most firme<note place="margin">

            <p>He is commended for his manly mercie; in releasing prisoners, and in pardoning offences of highest qualitie: which to a people that then liued vnder a Law, both rigorous, and almost arbitrarie, and (as well for the noueltie as for the vncertaintie thereof) in a manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, was a most high valued vertue. He not onely pardoned many great offenders, but partly by gifts, and partly by aduancements he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4099:95"/>
knit them most assuredly vnto him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although in the beginning of his reigne, most of the Nobilitie, and many Gentlemen of best quality and rancks endeuoured to displace him, and to set vp <hi>Robert</hi> his elder brother for their King; yet doeth it not appeare, either that any seueritie was executed vpon them, or that afterward they were dangerous vnto him. Notwithstanding in some actions he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of crueltie, or at the least of sharpnesse and seuerity in iustice. For albeit hee promised to the <hi>English,</hi> whilest his first feares and iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies continued, that they should enioy free libertie of hunting; yet did hee afterwards so seuerely restraine it, that the penalty for killing a Deere was death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> after he had defeated the <hi>Scots</hi> and slaine <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colme</hi> their King, not finding himselfe either honoured or respected according to his seruice; first refrained, and afterwards refused to come vnto the Court. Hereupon the King, ouerruled indifferently with suspition and hate, (two vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passions in minds placed in authoritie) sent his brother <hi>Henry</hi> with an armie against him; who spoyled the Countrey, tooke the Earle,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4099:96"/>
and committed him to prison. Then was hee charged with diuers crimes, which were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (although but surmised) to vndoe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Many examinations were also made, but for appearance onely and terrour, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bottome or depth. The especiall matter obiected against him was, for contriuing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoyle the King both of life and state, and to set vp <hi>Stephen Albamerle</hi> his Aunts sonne for King. And thus it often happeneth, that great deserts are occasions to men of their destruction; either because Princes generally loue not those to whom they are exceedingly beholding, or else for that thereby men doe grow proud, insolent, disdainefull, bould, immoderate both in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and demand, discontented, impatient if they be not satisfied, and apt to breake forth into dangerous attempts.</p>
            <p>Of those who any wayes declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in his fauour or defence, some were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoiled of their goods, some were banished the Realme; others were punished with losse of their eyes, or of their eares, or of some other part of their bodie. <hi>William d'Owe</hi> was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a Councell holden at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> to bee a complice of this Treason. And albeit he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4099:96"/>
his accuser to the combate, yet his eyes were pulled out, and his stones cut off by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the King. And yet some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours affirme, that he was ouercome in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate before. For the same cause the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>William Aluerie</hi> to be hanged; a man of goodly personage and modest behauiour; the Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Before his execution hee desired to be whipped through manie Churches in <hi>London:</hi> he distributed his garments to the poore, and bloodied the street as he went, with often knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the stones. At the time of his death he tooke it vpon the charge of his soule, that he was cleere of the offence for which he suffered. And so committing his innocencie to God, and to the world his complaints, he submitted himselfe to the Executioners hands: leauing an opinion in some, a suspition in many, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also died without desert. For the king gaue an easie eare to any man, that would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach others for his aduantage: whereby it sometimes happened, that offenders were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited by accusing innocents.</p>
            <p>He was liberall aboue measure; either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his owne abilities, or of the worthinesse
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4099:97"/>
of the receiuers. Especially hee was bountifull<note place="margin">

To winne and retaine the fauour of these, hee much impouerished his peaceable people. From many he tooke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iustice, to giue to others without desert: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming it no vnequall dealing, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the one, should bee aduentured and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended with the blood of the other.</p>
            <p>He much exceeded in sumptuousnes of diet and of apparell, wherewith great men vse to dazel the eyes of the people: both which waies he esteemed the goodnesse of things, by their price. It is reported, that when his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine vpon a certaine morning brought him a new paire of hose, the King demaunded what they cost; and the Chamberlaine answered, three shillings. Hereat the King grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and said: <hi>What? heauie beast! doest thou take these to be conuenient hose for a King? Away begger, and bring me other of a better price.</hi> Then the Chamberlaine departed and brought a farre worse paire of hose (for a better could not at that time bee found) and told the king
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4099:97"/>
that they cost a marke. The king not onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them for fine enough, but commended them also as exceeding fit. Assuredly this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate excesse of a King is now farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by many base shifting vnthrifts.</p>
            <p>In building his expences were very great. He repaired the Citie and Castle of <hi>Caerlile,</hi> which had been wasted by the <hi>Danes</hi> 200. yeres before. Hee finished New castle vpon <hi>Tine.</hi> Many other Castles he erected or repaired vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the frontiers of <hi>Scotland;</hi> many also vpon the frontiers and within the very brest of <hi>Wales.</hi> Hee much enlarged the Towre of <hi>London,</hi> and enuironed it with a new wall. Hee also built the great Hall at <hi>Westminster,</hi> which is 270. foote in length, and 74. foote in breadth. And when many did admire the vast largenes thereof, he would say vnto them, that it was but a bed chamber, but a closet, in comparison of that which he intended to build. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he layd the foundation of another Hall, which stretched from the Riuer <hi>Thames</hi> to the Kings high street: the further erection wherof, with diuers other heroicall enterprises, ceased together with his life.</p>
            <p>Thus partly by reason of his infinite plots
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4099:98"/>
and inuentions, and partly by his disorders and vnbrideled liberalities, he alwayes liued at great charges and expences; which whilest the large treasure lasted which his father left him, were borne without grieuance to the subiects: But when that was once drained, he was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to seeke money by extraordinary meanes. So, many hard taxes were laidvpon the people, partly for supplie to his owne necessities, and partly to imitate the policie of his father; that the people being busied how to liue, should reteine small either leisure or meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue innouations. For this cause he was suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, vpon purpose to haue enterprised many actions of charge; that thereby he might haue colour to impose, both imployments and taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon the people.</p>
            <p>And because the riches of the clergie at that time were not onely an eye-sore vnto many, but esteemed also by some, to bee very farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue due proportion; Hee often fleeced them of great summes of money. For which cause it is euident, that the writers of that age (who were for the most part Clergie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men) did both generally enueigh against him, and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue his particular actions. He withheld his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4099:98"/>
annuall paiment to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of a Schisme betweene <hi>Vrbane</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> at <hi>Rauenna.</hi> He claimed the inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture of Prelates to be his right: Hee forbade Appeales and entercourse to <hi>Rome:</hi> For which and other like causes he had a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with the Clergie of his Realme, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with <hi>Anselme</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The seedes of this contention were cast, when <hi>Anselme</hi> was first receiued to his Sea. For at that time two did striue for the Papacie of <hi>Rome; Vrbanus</hi> and <hi>Guibert,</hi> called <hi>Clement</hi> the third: some Christian States fauouring the one, and some the other. King <hi>William</hi> inclined to <hi>Clement</hi> the third, and with him the Realme generally went; but <hi>Anselme</hi> did fully goe with <hi>Vrbane;</hi> making so his condition before he did consent to accept his dignitie.</p>
            <p>When he was elected and before his conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, the King demanded of him, that such lands of the Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as the King had giuen to his friends since the death of <hi>Lanfranck,</hi> might still be held by them as their lawfull right: but to this <hi>Anselme</hi> would in no case agree. Hereupon the King stayed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration a certaine time; but at length by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4099:99"/>
of the people hee was content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his homage, and to giue way to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. Not long after, the Archbishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired licence of the king to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his Pall; which when the King refused to grant, he appealed to the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now this was the first Appeale that euer before had been made in <hi>England.</hi> For Appeales were not here in ordinarie vse, vntil after this time, vnder the reigne of King <hi>Stephen;</hi> when <hi>Henrie</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Wint.</hi> being the Popes Legate, brought them in.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the King offended with this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, charged <hi>Anselme</hi> with breach of his feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and oath. <hi>Anselme</hi> answered, that this was to be referred to the iudgement of a Councell, whether it bee a breach of allegiance to a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Prince, if a man appeale to the Vicar of Christ. The King alleaged; that the custome of his Realme admitted no appeale from the king; that supreame appeale was a most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall marke of Maiestie, because no appeale can be made but to a superiour; that therefore the Archbishop by appealing from him, denied his Souereignty, derogated from the dignitie of his Crowne, and subiected both him and that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4099:99"/>
to another Prince, to whom as to a superiour he did appeale; That herein hee was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and a Traitour to him and to the State. <hi>Anselme</hi> replyed, that this question was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by our Lord, who taught vs what allegiance is due to the Pope, where he saith; <hi>Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke will I build my Church, &amp;c.</hi> And againe; <hi>To thee will I giue the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, &amp;c.</hi> And againe in generall; <hi>Hee that heareth you heareth me, and who despiseth you despiseth me.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of my eye.</hi> But for the allegiance due to the King, he saith; <hi>Giue to Caesar that which belongeth to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, and to God what pertaineth to God.</hi> To this the king finally said; That hauing made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Masters to interprete and giue sence to the Scriptures, it was easie to maintaine by them whatsoeuer they desired or did; it was easie for them to burst their ambition with their swelling greatnes. But well he was assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that CHRIST intended not to dissolue orders for Ciuill gouernment, to ruine king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to embase authority and right of Kings, by meanes of his Church: this right of a King he had, and this right he would maintaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:4099:100"/>In this contention few of the Bishops did openly take part with <hi>Anselme;</hi> but some, and especially the Bishop of <hi>Durhame,</hi> did directly declare against him. The residue, when he asked their aduise, would answere him, That he was wise ynough, and knew what was best for him to doe; as for them, they neither durst nor would stand against their Lord. By assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of these the King purposed to depriue <hi>Anselme,</hi> and to expell him out of the Realme. But <hi>Anselme</hi> auowed, That as he was ready to depart the Realme, so would he take his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with him, though he tooke nothing else.</p>
            <p>Now the King had sent two messengers to Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to entreat him to send the Pall to the King; to be disposed by him as he should thinke fit. These messengers were by this time returned; and with them came <hi>Guibert</hi> the Popes Legate, who brought the Pall. The Legate went first priuily to the King, and promised that if <hi>Vrbane</hi> should be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for Pope in <hi>England,</hi> the King should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of him whatsoeuer he would. The King required that <hi>Anselme</hi> might be remoued. The Legate answered, that it could not be, that such a man without iust cause should be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4099:100"/>
Notwithstanding some other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted to the King, <hi>Vrbane</hi> was declared to be lawfull Pope; and the King was content to swallow downe that mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sel, which had bene so vnpleasant for him to champe on. The Pall was caried to <hi>Anselme</hi> with great pompe, in a vessell of siluer; and he came foorth bare foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in his Priestly Vestments to meete and to receiue it.</p>
            <p>The yeere next following the King inuaded <hi>Wales;</hi> where he repressed the rebellious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and returned victorious. <hi>Anselme</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to goe vnto him, to salute him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his good successe. But the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him by messengers, who layde to his charge, both the small number, and euill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Souldiers, which he sent to that seruice; and therefore warned him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the Court, to make his answere. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely also the King was incensed by matters more light; but taken in the worst part, as it commonly falleth out in suspitions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. At the day appointed <hi>Anselme</hi> appeared, but auoyded his answere by appealing to the Pope: for prosecution whereof, hee made suit for the Kings licence to goe to <hi>Rome.</hi> The
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:4099:101"/>
King said as before; That this appeale was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the custome of the Realme, and against the dignitie of his Crowne, to both which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> had sworne. <hi>Anselme</hi> answered, That he was sworne to neither of them, but so farre as they were consonant to the Lawes of GOD, and to the rules of equitie and right. The King replied, That no limitation being expressed, it was not reasonable that vpon his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of pietie or equitie, he should slip out of the band of his oath. Thus was the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on both sides obstinately maintained; and for a long time <hi>Anselme</hi> was commanded to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Court.</p>
            <p>At the last hee was released, but vnder ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse charge, that he should not depart out of the Realme; or if he did, that it should neuer be lawfull for him to returne. <hi>Anselme</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Court, went streight to <hi>Douer,</hi> with purpose to passe the Seas into <hi>France.</hi> Here hee was either awaited or ouertaken by <hi>William Warlewast</hi> the Kings officer; not to stay him from his passage, but to rifle him of all that he had. Others also were appointed to seise his goods in other places, and to conuert the profits of his Archbishopricke to the vse of the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:4099:101"/>
King; making a bare allowance to the Monks, of meat, drinke and cloathing. So the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop crossed the Seas into <hi>France,</hi> rested a while at <hi>Lions,</hi> and then trauailed ouer the <hi>Alpes</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he was enterteined by Pope <hi>Vrbane,</hi> with more then ordinarie ceremonies of honour.</p>
            <p>And first the Pope wrote to the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the behalfe of <hi>Anselme;</hi> and reteined him in his Palace vntill he should receiue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere from the king. When the messenger was returned with such answere as <hi>Anselme</hi> did not like, he desired of the Pope to be discharged of his dignitie; which he had found (he said) a wearisome stage, whereon hee played a part much against his will. But hereto the Pope would in no case agree; charging him vpon vertue of his obedience, That wheresoeuer he went, he should beare both the name and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie. As for these matters,</hi> (said he) <hi>we shall sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them at the next Councell, where your selfe shalbe present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Councell was assembled, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concilium Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronense.</note> fate on the outside of the Bishops; but the Pope called him vp, and placed him at his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:4099:102"/>
right foot with these words; <hi>Includamus hunc in orbe nostro, tanquam alterius orbis Papam.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in all generall Councels, the Archb. of <hi>Canterburie</hi> tooke the place. In this Councell the points of difference betweene the Greeke and Latine Churches were strongly debated; especially concerning the proceeding of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and for leauened bread in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> wherein <hi>Anselme</hi> shewed such deepe learning, weight of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and edge of wit, that he approched nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer admiration then applause. These mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters determined, complaints were brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Pope is said to haue bene ready to excommunicate him: but <hi>Anselme</hi> kneeled before the Pope, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined for the King a longer terme. The Pope was then at great contention with <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour, who had bene excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated before by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine excommunicate by <hi>Vrbane:</hi> being the first Christian Prince with Souereigne power, who was euer excommunicate by any Pope. And for that <hi>Vrbane</hi> at that time had his hands full against the Emperour, for that also hee would not make the example too odious at the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4099:102"/>
first, he was willing ynough to forbeare excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication against the King. And the rather for that <hi>Anselme</hi> had intelligence from his friends in <hi>England,</hi> that the excommunication would not be regarded. Hereupon, accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it a sufficient declaration of his power for the time, to haue menaced excommunication, he caused a generall decree to be made; That as well all Lay-persons who should giue inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture of Churches, as those of the Clergie who should be so inuested; also those who should yeeld themselues in subiection to Lay-men for Ecclesiastical liuings, should be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate.</p>
            <p>This generall sentence was pronounced. The Pope also signified by letters to the King, that if he would auoyd particular proceeding against himselfe, he should foorth with restore <hi>Anselme</hi> to the exercise of his Office in his Church, and to all the goods and possessions perteining thereto. Hereupon the King sent messengers to the Pope, who declared vnto him; That their great Master the King mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled not a litle, wherefore he should so sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vrge the restitution of <hi>Anselme;</hi> seeing it was expresly told him, That if he departed out of <hi>England</hi> without licence, he should expect no
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4099:103"/>
other vsage. Well said the Pope, Haue you no other cause against <hi>Anselme,</hi> but that he hath appealed to the Apostolicall Sea, and without licence of your King hath trauailed thither? They answered, No. And haue you taken all this paines (said he) haue you trauailed thus farre to tell me this? Goe tell your Lord, if he will not be excommunicate, that he presently restore <hi>Anselme</hi> to his Sea: And see that you bring mee answere hereof the next Councell, which shalbe in the third weeke after Easter: make haste, and looke to your terme, lest I cause you to be hanged for your tarryance.</p>
            <p>The messenger was herewith much abash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet collecting himselfe, he desired priuate audience of the Pope: affirming, that he had some secret instructions from the King to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto him. What this secret was it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. Whatsoeuer it was, a longer day was obtained for the King, vntill Michaelmas then next ensuing. And when that day was come, albeit complaints were renued, yet was nothing done against the King. The Archb. seeing the small assurance of the Pope, returned to <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and there remained vntil the death, first of Pope <hi>Vrbane,</hi> and afterwards of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4099:103"/>
king; which was almost the space of 3. yeeres.</p>
            <p>By this great conflict the king lost the hearts of many of the Clergie; but his displeasure had seasoned reuenge with contentment: and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe sufficient, both in courage and meanes to beare out his actions, he became ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wayes heauie vnto them. When any Bishopricke or Monasterie fell voyd, he kept them vacant a long time in his hands, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the profits to himselfe: At the last hee would set them to open sale, and receiue him for Prelate, who would giue for them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test price. Herehence two great inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did ensue; the best places were furnished with men of least sufficiencie and worth; and no man hoping to rise by desert, the generall endeuour for vertue and knowledge were layd aside: the direct way to aduancement, was by plaine purchase from the king.</p>
            <p>In this seazing and farming and marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing of Church-liuings, one <hi>Ranulph,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Kings Chapleine, was a great agent for the King. Hee was a man of faire vse of speach, and liuely in witte, which hee made seruants to licentious designes; but both in birth and behauiour base, and shamelesse in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4099:104"/>
dishonestie; a very bawde to all the Kings pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and desires. Hee could be so euill as hee li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ted, and listed no lesse then was to his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The King would often laugh at him, and say; that he was a notable fellow to compasse matters for a King. And yet besides more then ordinary fauour of countenance, the King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced him, first to be his Chancellour, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to be Bishop of <hi>Duresme.</hi> By his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, so soone as any Church fell voide, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentory was made of all the goods that were found, as if they should bee preserued for the next successor; and then they were committed to the custodie of the King, but neuer restored to the Church againe. So the next incumbent receiued his Church naked and bare, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he paid a good price for it. From this King the vse is said to haue first risen in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that the Kings succeeding had the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties of Bishops Seas so long as they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned voide. Hee also set the first enformers to worke, and for small transgressions appointed great penalties. Hee is also reported to haue been the first King of this Realme, who restrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his subiects from ranging into forreine Countreys without licence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:4099:104"/>And yet what did the King by this sale of Church dignities, but that which was most frequent in other places? For in other places also few attained to such dignities freely. The difference was this: here the money was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the King, there by fauorites or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour officers: here it was expended in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vses of the State; there to priuate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times odious enrichments: this seemeth the more easie, that the more extreme pressure, as done by more hungrie and degenerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: this may bee esteemed by some the more base, but assuredly it was the better dealing. And further, it is euident that the King did freely aduance many excellent persons to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall dignities in the Church; and especially <hi>Anselme</hi> to the Archbishopricke of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> who was so vnwilling to accept that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that the King had much to doe to thrust it vpon him. And the rather to enduce him, he gaue him wholly the citie of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> which his predecessors had held but at the pleasure of the King. This <hi>Anselme</hi> was one whose lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned labours doe plainely testifie, how little his spirits were fed with the fulsome fumes of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting and ease; which to many others, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:4099:105"/>
with their bodies, doe fatten and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse their mindes. He so detested singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he accounted it the sinne which threw Angels out of Heauen, and man out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. This detestation of singularitie might happily encline him to the other extreme; to adhere ouer lightly to some common receiued errours. It is attributed to him that hee would often wish, to bee rather in hell without sinne, then with sinne in heauen.</p>
            <p>The king also aduanced <hi>Robert Bloet,</hi> to the Bishopricke of <hi>Lincolne:</hi> a man whose wisedom was highly graced, with goodly personage, and good deliuery of speach: from whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the king afterwards wiped fiue thousand markes. Hee also freely receiued <hi>Hugh de Floriaco,</hi> a man for his vertue much esteemed, to be Abbot of the Monastery of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> in <hi>Canterburie;</hi> and likewise diuers others to other Ecclesiasticall preferments: whereby I am confirmed in opinion, that many odious imputations against the king, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether inuented, or much enlarged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the trueth.</p>
            <p>It happened vpon auoidance of a certaine Monastery, that two Monkes went to the king,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:4099:105"/>
either of them contending, as well by friends, as by large offer of purse, to procure to be made Abbot of the place. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ing espying a third Monke standing by, who came with the other two, either to accompany them, or to obtaine some inferiour place vnder him that should preuaile, demaunded of him what hee would giue? The Monke answered, that hee had small meanes and lesse minde, to purchase that or any other dignitie of the Church: For with that intention did he first betake himselfe to a religious life, that holding riches and honour (the two beauties of the world) in contempt, he might more freely and quietly dispose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the seruice of God. The King replied, that he iudged him most worthy of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; and therefore first offred it vnto him, then intreated, and lastly enioyned him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. Assuredly, the force of vertue is such, that often times wee honour it in others, euen when we little esteeme it in our selues.</p>
            <p>He is charged with some actions and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches tending to profanenesse. The Iewes at <hi>Roan</hi> so preuailed with him by gifts, that they drew him to reprehend one who had forsaken their superstition. At <hi>London</hi> a disputation was
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4099:106"/>
appointed betweene certaine Christians and Iewes. The Iewes a little before the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, brought to the King a rich present; At which time he encouraged them (no doubt but by the way of ioylitie and mirth) to acquite themselues like tall fellowes, and if they preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by plaine strength of trueth, hee sware (as was his vsuall) by S. <hi>Lukes</hi> face, that hee would become one of their Secte. These things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely not much spoken amisse, might easily bee depraued by report.</p>
            <p>It is affirmed of him that he so much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in bodily lust, (then which nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man more contemptible) that thereby hee seemed to decline from the Maiestie of a Prince. This vice did cast a great mist ouer his glorie. And yet neither is it infrequent in lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty bodies, placed in a State both prosperous and high, neither can the pleasure of one man that way extend it selfe to the iniurie of many. The worst was, that after his example, many<note place="margin">Haec conditio principium vt quicquid faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant praecipere videantur. Quint. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clam. 4.</note> others did follow licentious traces; examples of Princes being alwayes of greater force then their Lawes, to induce the people to good or to euill. As the King turned the prosperitie of his actions to serue his vanities and delights, so his
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:4099:106"/>
followers by felicitie became insolent, and let goe at aduenture serious affaires; not receiuing into their thoughts any other impression then of brauery and pleasure. And they who were greatest in the counsailes and fauours of the King, respected all things no further, then as they were aduantageable to themselues.</p>
            <p>Then rose vp costly apparell, and dainty fare, two assured tokens of a diseased State; the one the vainest, the other the grossest prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that can be. Then was brought into vse the laying out of haire, strange fashions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisings in attire, and all delicacies pertaining to the bodie. Then were practised nice trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, lasciuious lookes, and other dissolute and wanton behauiour: many effeminate persons did accompanie the Court, by whose immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest demeanour the maiestie of that place was much embased. From hence also the poyson brake foorth, first into the citie, and after wards into other places of the Realme; for as in fishes, so in families, and so likewise in States, putrifaction commonly beginneth at the head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:4099:107"/>IN the second yeere of this kings reigne <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franck</hi> Archb. of <hi>Canterburie</hi> ended his life: A man highly esteemed, with good men, for his learning and integritie; with great men, for his diligence and discretion to sound deepely into affaires; with the common people for his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and modest behauiour. King <hi>William</hi> the first did honour and embrace him with great respect, and was much guided by his aduise. He was as a Protector to King <hi>William</hi> the second. When he went to <hi>Rome</hi> to obteine his Pall, the Pope rose from his chaire, stepped forwards to meet him, and with many ceremonies of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie did enterteine him. Then he returned to his seat, and said: <hi>Now Lanfrancke, I haue done to thee what is due to thy vertue, come thou and doe to me what apperteineth to my place.</hi> He was an earnest enemie to all vices, especially to aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and pride, the two banes of all vertues. He renued the great Church of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and enriched it with 25. mannours. He repaired the walles of that Citie, and built two Hospitals therein; one of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> the other <hi>Harlebaldowne.</hi> He gaue a thousand markes towards the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and enlarging of the Abbey of <hi>S. Albones,</hi> and procured <hi>Redbourne</hi> to be restored there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4099:107"/>
By his Testament hee gaue to the same Church 1000. pounds, besides many rich orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He tooke great paines in purging anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authors fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such corruptions as had crept into them: diuers workes also he wrote of his owne, but the greatest part of them are perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus he liued in honour, and died with fame; his time imployed in honest studies and exercises, his goods to good and Religious vses.</p>
            <p>The same yeere a strange and great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake happened throughout all the Realme; after which ensued a great scarciti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In the fourth yere of the reigne of his King, a strong stroke of lightning made a hole in the Abbey steeple at <hi>Winchelscombe,</hi> neere to the top; rent one of the beames of the Church, brake one of the legges of the Crucifixe, cast downe the head thereof, together with the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Virgine <hi>Marie</hi> that was placed by it: Herewith a thicke smoke darkened the Church, and breathed foorth a marueilous stincke, which annoyed the Church a long time after. In the same yeere a mightie winde from the Southwest did prostrate 606. houses
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:4099:108"/>
in <hi>London:</hi> And breaking into the Church of <hi>S. Mary Bow</hi> in Cheape, slew two men with some part of the ruines which it made, raised the roofe of the Church, and carried many of the beames on such a height, that in the fall six of them, being 27. or 28. foot in length, were driuen so deepe into the ground (the streets not then paued with stone) that not aboue 4. foote remained in sight: and so they stood, in such order and rancke as the workemen had placed them vpon the Church. The parts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth were neuer raised, but so much was cut away as did appeare aboue the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; because it was an impediment for passage. The Tower of <hi>London</hi> at the same time was also bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and much other harme done.</p>
            <p>The next yeere <hi>Osmund</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> finished the Cathedrall Church of old <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> and the fifth day after the Consecration, the steeple thereof was fired with lightning.</p>
            <p>The yeere following much raine fell, and so great frosts ensued, that riuers were passable with loaden carts.</p>
            <p>The yeere next ensuing was exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable both for the number and fashion of gliding Starres, which seemed to dash together in maner of a conflict.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:4099:108"/>About this time Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> assembled a Councell at <hi>Cleremont</hi> in <hi>Auergne,</hi> wherein hee exhorted Christian Princes to ioyne in action for recouery of <hi>Palestine,</hi> commonly called <hi>The Holy Land,</hi> out of the seruile possession of the <hi>Saracenes.</hi> This motion was first set on foote, and afterwards pursued by <hi>Peter</hi> the Heremite of <hi>Amiens;</hi> which falling in an age both actiue and Religious, was so generally embraced, as it drew 300000. men to assemble together from diuers Countreys; and that with such sober and harmlesse behauiour, that they seemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pilgrimes then Souldiers. Among others, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> addressed himselfe to this Voyage; and to furnish his expenses therein, he layed his Duchie of <hi>Normandie</hi> to gage to his brother of <hi>England</hi> for 6666. li. or as other Authors report, for 13600. pounds of Siluer.</p>
            <p>This money was taken vp part by impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and part by loane, of the most wealthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants within the Realme: But especially the charge was layd vpon religious persons, for that it was to furnish a religious warre. When many Bishops and Abbots complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they were not able to satisfie such
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4099:109"/>
summes of money as the King demanded of them, vnles they should sel the Chalices &amp; sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vessels which pertained to their Churches. Nay answered the King, you may better make meanes with the siluer and gold which vainely you haue wrapped about dead mens bones; meaning thereby their rich Relickes and Shrines.</p>
            <p>The yeare following a blasing starre appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for the space of fifteene dayes together; the greatest bush whereof pointed towards the East, and the lesser towards the West. Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding starres were often seene, which seemed to dart one against another. The people began (as to mindes fearefull all fancies seeme both weightie and true) to make hard constructions of these vnusuall sights; supposing that the heauens did threaten them, not accustomed to shew it selfe so disposed, but towards some variation.</p>
            <p>In the 13. yeere of his reigne, the Sea sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted his vsuall bounds, in diuers parts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> whereby not only fields, but many villages, castles, and townes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowen, and some ouerturned, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed with sand; much people, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4099:109"/>
innumerable cattel was destroyed. At the same time certaine lands in <hi>Kent,</hi> which did once belong to <hi>Godwine</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowed and couered with sand, which to this day do beare the name of <hi>Godwins</hi> sands. Thunders were more frequent &amp; terrible then had been vsuall; through violence whereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers persons were slaine. Many feareful formes and apparitions are reported to haue bin seene; whether errours, or inuentions, or truethes, I will not aduow. The heauens often seemed to flame with fire.

The King was often terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his sleepe with vncouth, ougly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet dreames: and many fearefull visions of others were oftentimes reported vnto him. At the same time hee held in his handes three Bishoprickes, <hi>Canterburie, Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and <hi>Salisburie;</hi> and twelue Abbeys.</p>
            <p>The same yeere vpon the second of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, a little before the falling of the Sunne,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:4099:110"/>
as the King was hunting within the newe forrest, at a place called <hi>Choringham</hi> (where since a Chappell hath beene erected) hee strooke a Deere lightly with an arrow. The Deere ranne away, and the King stayed his horse to looke after it; holding his hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his eyes, because the beames of the Sunne (which then drew somewhat lowe) much dazeled his sight. Herewith another Deere crossed the way; whereat a certaine Knight, named Sir <hi>Walter Tirrell,</hi> aimed with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and loosing his bowe, either too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly at the Deere, or too steadily at the King, strooke him therewith full vpon the brest. The King hauing so receiued the wound, gaue foorth a heauie groane, and presently fell downe dead; neither by speach nor motion expressing any token of life. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much of the arrowe as was without his bodie was found broken; whether with his hand, or by his fall, it is not certainely knowen. The men that were neere vnto him (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir <hi>Walter Tirrell</hi>) galloped away; some for astonishment, others for feare. But a fewe collecting themselues returned againe,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4099:110"/>
and layd his bodie vpon a Colliers Cart, which by aduenture passed that way; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was drawen by one leane euill-fauoured, base beast, to the Citie of <hi>Winchester;</hi> blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundantly all the way, by reason of the rude iogging of the Carte. The day following hee was buried, without any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pompe, with no more then ordinarie solemnities, in the Cathedrall Church or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie of Saint <hi>Swithen;</hi> vnder a plaine flat marble stone, before the Lectorne in the Quire. But afterwards his bones were translated, and layd by King <hi>Canutus</hi> bones.</p>
            <p>Most writers doe interprete this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie accident to bee a iudgement of God, for the extraordinarie loose behauiour of the King, But it may rather seeme a iudgement of God, that King <hi>William</hi> the first, who threw downe Churches, and dispeopled Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Townes; who banished both the seruice of God, and societie of men, to make a vaste habitation for sauage beasts, had two sonnes slaine vpon that place. It may also seeme a iudgement of God, that King <hi>William</hi> the second, who so greatly fauoured beastes of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4099:111"/>
game, that he ordeined the same penaltie for killing of a deere, as for killing of a man; should as a beast, and for a beast, and among beasts be slaine. And thus God doth often punish vs by our greatest pleasures; if they be either vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or immoderately affected; whereby good things become vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>Hee died in the principall strength, both of his age, and of his distastfull actions; wherein hee had bene much carried by the hoate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his courage and youth; his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not then raised to that stayednesse and<note place="margin">Seris venit vsus ab annis.

Hee reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in great varietie of opinion with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects (some applauding his vertues, others aggrauating his vices) twelue yeeres, eleuen moneths wanting eight dayes: and was at his death fourtie and three yeeres old. At this time he presumed most highly, and promised greatest matters to himselfe, hee proiected also many difficult aduentures, if his life had continued the naturall course; wherein his hopes were nothing inferiour to his desires.</p>

But

the Duke, whether he coniectured the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of that warre, for that the enemie was both at hand, and vnder one command, but the Armie of the Christians was to be supplied from farre, and also consisted of many Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derats; In which case albeit sometimes men performe well at the first, yet in short time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences encreasing, they alwayes either dissipate and dissolue, or else fall into confusion.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:4099:116"/>
in some descents, when <hi>Darius</hi> the King had foure sonnes, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the eldest, <hi>Cyrus</hi> the next, and two others; <hi>Parysates</hi> the wife of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> hauing a desire that <hi>Cyrus</hi> should succeede in the kingdome, alleaged in his behalfe the same reason wherewith <hi>Xexes</hi> had preuailed before: to wit, that shee had brought foorth <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to <hi>Darius,</hi> when hee was in priuate state; but <hi>Cyrus</hi> was borne to him when he was a King. Yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirmeth, that the reason<note place="margin">In Artax.</note> which she vsed was nothing probable, and that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the eldest sonne was appointed to be King. And so <hi>Blondus</hi> and <hi>Ritius</hi> doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,<note place="margin">Blond. dec. 2. lib. 6. Mich. Ritius. de Reg. Hung. lib. 6.</note> that <hi>Bela</hi> the King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> being dead, <hi>Geysa</hi> succeeded, although borne vnto him before he was a King.</p>
            <p>Others inferiour in number, but not in weight of Iudgement do affirme, that whether a Kingdome be setled in succession, or whether by any other title newly attained, the right to succeed by all true grounds of law pertaineth to the eldest sonne; albeit borne before his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aduancement to the kingdome, in case there be no expresse law of the state to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The principall reason is, because this is the nature of all successions by way of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4099:116"/>
For, if a father purchaseth lands, leases, cattell, or other goods, the inheritance shall bee transmitted to his eldest sonne, although borne before the purchase. Likewise if a father be aduanced to any title of honour, as Duke, Earle, Marquesse, &amp;c. it was neuer, I will not say denied, but once doubted, but that the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne should succeede in the same, albeit he was borne before the aduancement. And therefore seeing this is the generall rule of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inheritable successions, and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of singularitie in a kingdome; it followeth, that in like case the succession of a kingdome should also descend to the eldest sonne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though borne before the kingdome were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued.</p>
            <p>Againe, the sonne who was borne before his father was a King, had once a right to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in the kingdome; for if another sonne had not afterwards beene borne, without all question hee should haue succeeded. But a right which a man by his owne person hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; albeit in some cases it may be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, yet can it not bee altogether extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by any externall or casuall euent, which hath no dependencie vpon himselfe. And so
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:4099:117"/>
the right which the eldest sonne hath to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inheritance, may bee diminished by the birth of other children, in regard of those goods which are to bee distributed in parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; but it cannot possibly be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Neither can it bee diminished in those things which are not of nature to bee either valued or diuided (of which sort a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the chiefe) but doe passe entirely vnto one. For the right of blood which onely is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in lawfull successions, is acquired and held from the natiuitie of the childe, and doth not begin at the fathers death; at which time the inheritance doth fall.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if it be true in sonnes, that he shal suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in a kingdome who is first borne, after the father is exalted to bee a King; then is it true also in other remote degrees of consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And hereby it should often happen, that when a King dieth without issue of his body, they who are not onely inferiour in age, but more remote in degree, should exclude both the elder and the neerer in blood; because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps borne after the kingdome was attained: which is against all lawes of lawfull succession.</p>
            <p>Howsoeuer the right standeth, <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:4099:117"/>
yonger brother to King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> vpon aduantage of the absence of Duke <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest brother, formed this title to the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi> In which pretence he was strongly supported, first by a generall inclination of the common people, for that he had both his birth and education within the Realme, and they were well perswaded of his good nature and disposition. Secondly, by the fauour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile of many of the nobilitie, especially of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Neuborow</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwicke.</hi> Thirdly, (for that the sailes of popular fauours are filled most violently with reports) by his giuing forth, that his brother <hi>Robert</hi> intended neuer to returne; for that he was elected King of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and of all those large Countreys in <hi>Asia,</hi> which the Christians had lately wrung out of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> hands. Lastly, by vsing celeritie the very life of actions; for he was Crowned at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> (as it hath bene said) vpon the fifth day of August, in the yeere 1100. which was the third day after his brothers death.</p>
            <p>In person he was both stately and strong; tall, broad brested, his limmes fairely fourmed, well knit, and fully furnished with flesh. He was exceeding both comely and manly in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:4099:118"/>
his face wel fashioned, his colour cleere, his eyes liuely and faire, his eye-browes large and thicke, his haire blacke and somewhat thinne towards his forehead. He was of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wit, free from ostentation; his thoughts high, yet honourable and iust: in speach ready and eloquent, much graced with sweetnesse of voyce. In priuate he was affable, open, wittily pleasant, and very full of merrie simplicitie: in publicke he looked with a graue Maiestie, as finding in himselfe cause to be honoured. He was brought vp in the studie of Liberall Arts at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he attained that measure of knowledge, which was sufficient both for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and vse; but ranne not into intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate excesse, either for ostentation, or for a cloake to vnprofitable expense of time. By his example the yong Nobilitie of the Realme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to affect a praise for learning: Insomuch as, at a certaine enteruiew betweene the King and Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 2. the sonnes of <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Mellent,</hi> maintained open disputations against diuers Cardinals and Chapleines of the Pope.</p>
            <p>He was an exact esteemer of himselfe, not so much for his strength as for his weakenesses:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:4099:118"/>
lesse inclined to confidence then to distrust; and yet in weighty affaires resolute and firme; neuer dismaied, and alwayes fortunate; his spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of force to oppose against any sort of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or doubts. Extremities made him the more assured; and like a well knit Arch, hee then lay most strong when hee sustained the greatest weight. Hee was no more disposed to valour, then well setled in vertue and goodnes; which made his valour of more precious valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He had good command ouer his passions; and thereby attained both peace within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and victory ouer others. In giuing hee was moderate, but bountifull in recompence; his countenance enlarging the worth of his gift. Hee was prone to relieue, euen where there was least likelihood of requitall. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted flatterie, the poysoned sugar, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit ciuilitie and loue, the most base brokery of wordes: yet was no musicke so pleasing vnto him as well deserued thankes. He was vigilant and industrious in his affaires; knowing right well that honour not onely hath a paineful and dangerous birth, but must in like manner be nourished and fed.</p>
            <p>He was somewhat immoderate and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4099:119"/>
as well in aduancing those he fauoured, as in beating downe and disabling his enemies. The sword was alwayes the last of his trials; so as he neuer either sought or apprehended oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of warre, where with honour he could reteine peace. But if it were iniuriously vrged, he wanted neither wisedome, nor diligence, nor magnanimous heart to encounter the danger; to beare it ouer with courage and successe. He was frugall of the blood and slaughter of his Souldiers; neuer aduenturing both his honour &amp; their liues to the hazard of the sword, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either necessitie or aduantage. He often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preuailed against his enemies more by policie then by power; and for victories thus attained, he attributed to himselfe the greatest glory. For wisedome is most proper to man, but force is common and most eminent in beasts; by wisedome the honour was entire to himselfe, by force it was participated to inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Commanders, to euery priuate ordinarie Souldier: the effects of force, are heauie, hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and sometimes inhumane; but the same wrought to euent by wisedome, is, as lesse odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, so more assured and firme.</p>
            <p>After that he was mounted into the seate of

Maiestie, hee neglected no meanes to settle himselfe most surely therin, against the returne of his brother <hi>Robert.</hi> To this end he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted both amitie and alliance with <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> by taking his sister <hi>Matild</hi> to wife: by which meanes he not onely remoued his hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but stood assured of his assistance, in case his occasions should so require. Shee was daughter to <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> by <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> his wife; who was sister to <hi>Edgar</hi> surnamed <hi>Adeling,</hi> and daughter to <hi>Edward,</hi> sonne to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Ironside,</hi> the most valiant Saxon King, the scourge and terrour of the <hi>Danes.</hi> So as after the death of <hi>Adeling</hi> who left no issue, this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tild</hi> was next by discent from the Saxon Kings to the inheritance of the Crowne of <hi>England:</hi> and by her entermariage with King <hi>Henry,</hi> the two families of <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> were vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together both in blood and title to the Crowne. This more then any other respect made the whole nation of the <hi>English</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firme to King <hi>Henrie,</hi> against his brother, but loyall and peaceable during all his reigne: for that they saw the blood of their Saxon Kings restored again to the possession of the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Shee was a Lady vertuous, religious, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4099:120"/>
and wise: farre from the ordinary either vices or weakenesses incident to her sexe. She had been brought vp among the Nunnes of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Rumsey,</hi> whether professed or onely veiled our writers doe diuersly report; but most affirme that shee was professed. Yet for the common good, for the publique peace and tranquilitie of the State, shee abandoned her deuoted life, and was ioyned to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> in mariage, by consent of <hi>Anselme,</hi> without any dispensation from <hi>Rome.</hi> Of this <hi>Matild</hi> the King begate <hi>William</hi> a sonne, who perished by shipwracke; and <hi>Matild</hi> a daughter, first married to <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth Emperour, by whom she had no issue; afterward to <hi>Geoffrey Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genet</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou,</hi> by whom shee brought foorth a sonne named <hi>Henrie,</hi> in whom the blood of the Saxon Kings was aduanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the gouernment of this Realme.</p>
            <p>Now to purchase the fauour of the Clergie, he called <hi>Anselme</hi> out of exile, and restored him both to the dignitie and reuenues of the Sea of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Other Bishoprickes and Abbeys which King <hi>William</hi> kept voide at the time of his death, hee furnished with men of best sufficiencie and reputation. Hee committed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:4099:120"/>
               <hi>Radulph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> to prison, who had been both authour and agent to King <hi>William</hi> in most of his distastfull actions against the Clergie. This <hi>Radulph</hi> was a man of smooth vse of speach, wittie onely in deuising, or spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or doing euill: but to honestie and vertue his heart was a lumpe of lead. Enuious aboue all measure; nothing was so grieuous to his eyes as the prosperitie, nothing so harsh to his eares as the commendations of others. His tongue alwayes slauish to the Princes desires; not regarding how truely or faithfully, but how pleasingly he did aduise. Thus as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall infamie of that age, hee liued without loue, and died without pitie; sauing of those who thought it pitie that he liued so long.</p>
            <p>Further, to make the Clergie the more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, the King renounced the right which his Ancesters vsed in giuing Inuestitures; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the same to appertaine to the Pope. This hee yeelded at his first entrance, partly not knowing of what importance it was, and partly being in necessitie to promise any thing. But afterwards he resumed that right againe; albeit in a Councell not long before held at <hi>Rome,</hi> the contrary had bene decreed.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4099:121"/>
For hee inuested <hi>William Gifford</hi> into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and all the possessions belonging to the same. He gaue the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of <hi>Canterburie</hi> to <hi>Radulph</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and inuested him therein by a Ring and a staffe: he inuested also two of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leins at <hi>Westminster; Roger</hi> his Chanceller in the Bishopricke of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> his Larderer in the Bishopricke of <hi>Hereford.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he assumed the custome of his father and brother, in taking the reuenues of Bishopricks whilest they remained void: and for that cause did many times keepe them a longer season va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in his hands, then many of the Clergie could with patience endure.</p>
            <p>But especially the Clergie did fauour him much, by reason of his liberall leaue either to erect, or to enlarge, or else to enrich Religious buildings. For to these workes the King was so ready to giue, not onely way, but encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and helpe, that in no Princes time they did more within this Realme either flourish or increase. And namely the house of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was then founded neere <hi>Smithfield</hi> in London, with the house of Nunnes by <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken well.</hi> Then were also founded the Church
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4099:121"/>
of <hi>Theukesburie,</hi> with all Offices thereto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: the Priorie and Hospitall of <hi>S. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewes</hi> in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> the Church of <hi>S. Giles</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Creeplegate;</hi> the Colledge of Seculare Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in the castle of <hi>Leicester;</hi> the Abbey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Northgate of the same towne called <hi>S. Mary deprato.</hi> Also the Monasterie of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> of <hi>Lanthonie</hi> by <hi>Glocester;</hi> the Church of <hi>Dunmow</hi> in <hi>Essex;</hi> the Monasterie of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> at <hi>Colchester,</hi> which was the first house of <hi>Augustine</hi> Chanons in <hi>England:</hi> the Church of <hi>S. Mary Oueries</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Chanons in <hi>Southwarke;</hi> the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the holy Trinity now called <hi>Christs Church</hi> within <hi>Algate;</hi> and the Hospitall of <hi>S. Giles</hi> in the field: The Priorie of <hi>Kenelworth;</hi> The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of <hi>Kenshame;</hi> The Monasterie of <hi>Plimpton</hi> in <hi>Deuonshire;</hi> with the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Exceter;</hi> the Priorie of <hi>Merton;</hi> the Colledge of <hi>Warwicke;</hi> the Hospitall of <hi>Kepar;</hi> the Priorie of <hi>Osney</hi> neere <hi>Oxeford;</hi> the Hospital of <hi>S. Crosse</hi> neere <hi>Winchester;</hi> the Priorie of <hi>Norton</hi> in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> with diuers others. The King also foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and erected the Priorie of <hi>Dunstable,</hi> the Abbey of <hi>Circester,</hi> the Abbey of <hi>Reading,</hi> the Abbey of <hi>Shirebourne.</hi> Hee also changed the Abbey of <hi>Eley</hi> into a Bishops Sea; he erected a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4099:122"/>
Bishopricke at <hi>Caerlile,</hi> placed Chanons there, and endowed it with many honours. These and many other Religious buildings either done, or helped forward, or permitted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the King, much encreased the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Clergie towards him.</p>
            <p>Now to draw the loue of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he composed himselfe to a sober ciuilitie; easie for accesse, faire in speach, in countenance and behauiour kind: his Maiestie so tempered with mildnèsse and courtesie, that his Subiects did more see the fruits, then feele the weight of his high estate. These were things of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the vulgar sort; who loue more where they are louingly intreated, then where they are benefited, or happely preserued. He eased them of many publicke grieuances. Hee restored them to the vse of fire and candle after eight of the clocke at night, which his father had most straitly forbidden. Punishments of losse of member vsed before, he made pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Hee moderated the Law of his brother, which inflicted death for killing any of the Kings Deere; and ordeined, that if any man killed a Deere in his owne wood, the wood should be forfeited to the King. He permitted
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4099:122"/>
to make enclosures for Parkes; which taking beginning in his time, did rise to that excessiue encrease, that in a few succeeding ages more Parkes were in <hi>England,</hi> then in all <hi>Europe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. He promised that the Lawes of K. <hi>Edward</hi> should againe be restored; but to put off the present performance, he gaue forth, that first they should be reuiewed and corrected, and made appliable to the present time. And albeit in trueth they were neuer either reuiewed or corrected, yet the onely hope thereof did worke in the people a fauourable inclination to his part.</p>
            <p>Whilest the King did thus Immure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the state of <hi>England,</hi> as well by ordering his affaires, as by winning the hearts of the people vnto him, Duke <hi>Robert</hi> was returning from <hi>Palestine,</hi> by easie and pleasurable iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; vsing neither the celeritie nor forecast which the necessitie of his occasions did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Hee visited many Princes by the way, and consumed much time in entertainments and other complements of Court. Hee tooke to wife as he came <hi>Sibell</hi> the daughter of <hi>Roger</hi> Duke of <hi>Apulia</hi> and Earle of <hi>Cicill,</hi> vvho was a <hi>Norman:</hi> and the great portion of money
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4099:123"/>
which he receiued for her dower, he loosely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished foorth amongst his followers; of whom he receiued nothing againe, but thankes when he (scattered rather then) gaue, and pitie when he wanted.</p>
            <p>At the last he arriued in <hi>Normandie,</hi> and foorthwith was sollicited out of <hi>England</hi> by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from many, who either vpon conscience or discontentment fauoured his Title; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from <hi>Radulph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who had lately escaped out of prison, a man odious ynough to vndoe a good cause; that he would omit no time, that hee would let fall no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to embarke himselfe in the enterprise for <hi>England:</hi> that he had many friends there, both powerfull and sure, who would partake with him in his dangers, although not in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour atchieued by his dangers: that therewith the peoples fauour towards the King did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ebbe, and that it was good taking the first of the tide. Hereupon he shuffled vp an Armie in haste; neither for number, nor furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor choise of men answerable to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise in hand. Then he crossed the Seas, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Portesmouth,</hi> and marched a small way into the Countrey; vainely expecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:4099:123"/>
and ayd which had bene assured him out of <hi>England.</hi> But King <hi>Henry</hi> had made so good vse both of his warning and time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide against this tempest, that hee did at once both cut from the Duke all meanes of ayd, and was ready to encounter him in braue appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hereupon many who were vnable by Armes to relieue the Duke, by aduise did to him the best offices they could. For they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured both the King and him to a reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The King with respect of his new vnset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled estate, the Duke with respect of his weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and wants; both with regard of naturall duetie and loue, knit betweene them by band of blood. So after some trauaile and debate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a peace was concluded vpon these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Henry <hi>should reteine the kingdome of</hi> England, <hi>and pay to his brother</hi> Robert 3000. <hi>markes yeerely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if either of them should die without issue, the suruiuour should succeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That no man should receiue preiudice for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the part of the one or of the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These conditions being solemnely sworne by the king and the Duke, and twelue Noble
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4099:124"/>
men on either part, the Duke returned into <hi>Normandie,</hi> and about two yeeres after went againe into <hi>England,</hi> to visit the King, and to spend some time with him in feasting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport. At which time, to requite the Kings kind vsage and entertainment, but especially to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>Matild</hi> the Queene, to whom he was god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, he released to the King the annuall pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 3000. markes. But as a wound is more painefull the day following, then when it was first and freshly taken; so this loose leuitie of the Duke, which was an exceeding sad and sore blow to his estate, was scarce sensible at his departure out of <hi>England,</hi> but most grieuous to him after hee had remained in <hi>Normandie</hi> a while: whereby many motions were occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as well in the one place as in the other.</p>
            <p>The Duke complained, that hee had bene circumuented by his brother the King: that his courtesies were nothing else but allurements to mischiefe; that his gifts were pleasant baites, to couer and conuey most dangerous hookes; that his faire speaches were sugred poysons; that his kinde embracements were euen to tickle his friends to death. <hi>Robert Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasme</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> a man of great estate,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:4099:124"/>
but doubtfull whether of lesse wisedome or feare, tooke part with the Duke, and fortified the Towne and Castle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Bridgenorth, Tichel,</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> and certaine other pieces in <hi>Wales</hi> against King <hi>Henry.</hi> And hauing drawen vnto him some persons of wretched state and worse minde, whose fortunes could not bee empaired by any euent, hee entred <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> and droue away light booties of cattell; being prepared neither in forces nor in courage, to stay the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater mischiefe.</p>
            <p>But neither was this sudden to the King, neither was he euer vnprouided against sudden aduentures. Wherefore encountring the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before it grew to perfection and strength, he first brought his power against the Castle of <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> which was forthwith rendred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The residue followed the example (which in enterprise of armes is of greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and submitted themselues to the Kings discretion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Onely the Castle of <hi>Arundel</hi> yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon condition, that <hi>Robert Belasme</hi> their Lord should be permitted to depart safely into <hi>Normandie:</hi> And vpon the same condition they of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> sent to the King the keys of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4099:125"/>
their Castle, and therewith pledges for their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance. Then <hi>Robert</hi> with his brother <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphus,</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi> abiured the Realme, and departed into <hi>Normandie:</hi> where being full of rashnesse, which is nothing but courage out of his wits; and measuring their actions not by their abilities, but by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; they did more aduance the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires by hostilitie, then by seruice and subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they could possibly haue done.</p>
            <p>Also <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Mortaigne</hi> in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> and of <hi>Cornewall</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> sonne of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> vncle to the king, and brother to king <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the first, required of the King the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Kent,</hi> which had been lately held by <hi>Odo</hi> vncle to them both. And being a man braue in his owne liking, and esteming no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which hee had in regard of that which hee did desire, he was most earnest, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, peremptorie in his pursuit. Insomuch as, blinded with ambitious haste, he would often say, that hee would not put off his vpper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vntill hee had obtained that dignitie of the King. These errours were excused by the greenenesse of his youth, and by his desire of rising, which expelled all feare of a fall. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4099:125"/>
the King first deferred, and afterwards moderately denied his demaund. But so farre had the Earle fed his follies with assured expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, that he accompted himselfe fallen from such estate as his hungry hopes had already swallowed. Hereupon his desire turned to rage, and the one no lesse vaine then the other: but both together casting him from a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fauour, which seldome stoppeth the race vntill it come to a headlong downefall.</p>
            <p>For now the King made a counter-chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to many of his possessions in <hi>England;</hi> and thereupon seazed his lands, dismantled his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and compelled him in the end to forsake the Realme. Not for any great offence he had done, being apt to the fault rather of rough rage then of practise and deceit; but his stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne stoutnesse was his offence; and it was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to hold him guiltie, that he thought himselfe to haue cause and meanes to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So hauing lost his owne state in <hi>England,</hi> he departed into <hi>Normandie,</hi> to further also the losse of that countrey. There he confederated with <hi>Robert Belasme,</hi> and made diuers vaine attempts against the Kings castles; neither gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by wisedome, nor followed by successe.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:4099:126"/>
Especially hee vented his furie against <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> who was but a childe, and in wardship to the King, whom he daily infested with inuasions and spoiles; being no lesse full of desire to hurt, then voyd of counsaile and meanes to hurt.</p>
            <p>On the other side, diuers of the Nobilitie of <hi>Normandie,</hi> finding their Duke without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to rule, had no disposition to obey; but conceiued a carelesse contempt against him. For he seemed not so much to regard his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall good, as a vaine breath of praise, and the fruitlesse fauour of mens opinions, which are no fewer in varietie then they are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. All the reuenues of his Duchie he either sold or morgaged; all his Cities he did alien, and was vpon the point of passing away his principall Citie of <hi>Roan</hi> to the Burgers thereof, but that the conditions were esteemed too hard. Hereupon many resolued to fall from him, and to set their sailes with the fauourable gale which blew vpon the fortune of the King. To this end they offered their submission to the King, in case he would inuade <hi>Normandie;</hi> whereto with many reasons they did perswade him: especially in regard of the late hostile at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:4099:126"/>
there made against him, by the plaine permission of the Duke his brother, and not without his secret support.</p>
            <p>The King embraced the faire occasion, and with a strong Armie passed into <hi>Normandie.</hi> Here he first relieued his forts, which were any wayes distressed or annoyed; then he recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red those that were lost; Lastly, he wanne from the Duke the towne and castle of <hi>Caen,</hi> with certaine other castles besides: And by the help of the President of <hi>Aniou,</hi> fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed <hi>Baion,</hi> with the stately Church of <hi>S. Marie</hi> therein. Vpon these euents, all the Priories of <hi>Normandie,</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling certaine flowers, which open and close according to the rising or declining of the Sunne; abandoned the Duke, and made their submission to King <hi>Henry.</hi> So the King hauing both enlarged and assured his state in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> by reason of the approach of winter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted into <hi>England:</hi> but this was like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiling of Ramme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, to returne againe with the greater strength.</p>
            <p>He had not long remained in <hi>England,</hi> but his brother <hi>Robert</hi> came to him at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> to treat of some agreement of peace. Here the words and behauiours of both were obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:4099:127"/>
At their first meeting they rested with their eyes fast fixed one vpon the other; in such sort as did plainely declare, that discourtesie then trencheth most deep, when it is betweene those who should most dearely loue. The Duke was in demaunds moderate, in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and speech enclined to submisnesse; and with a kinde vnkindnesse did rather entreate then perswade, that in regard of the naturall Obligation betweene them by blood, in regard of many offices and benefits wherewith he had endeuoured to purchase the Kings loue, all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilitie betweene them, all iniurie or extremitie by Armes might cease. <hi>For I call you</hi> (said he) <hi>before the Seate of your owne Iudgement, whether the relinquishing of my Title to the Crowne of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>whether the releasing of my annuity of</hi> 3000. <hi>markes, whether many other kindnesses, so much vndeserued as scarce desired; should not in reason withdraw you from those prosecutions, where warre cannot be made without shame, nor victory at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without dishonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King vsed him with honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; but perceiuing that he was embarked in some disaduantage, conceiuing also that his courage with his Fortune began to decline, he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4099:127"/>
made resemblance at the first, to be no lesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of peace then the Duke: But afterwards, albeit he did not directly deny, yet hee found euasions to auoyd all offers of agreement.</p>
            <p>The more desirous the Duke was of peace, the greater was his disdaine that his brother did refuse it. Wherefore cleering his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from all shewes of deiection or griefe, as then chiefly resolute when his passion was stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with a voice rather violent then quicke, he rose into these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue cast my selfe so low, as your haughty heart can possibly wish; whereby I haue wronged both my selfe and you: my selfe, in occasioning some suspition of weakenesse; you, in making you obstinate in your ambitious purposes. But assure your selfe, that this desire did not proceed from want either of courage, or of meanes, or of assistance of friends: I can also be both vnthankefull and vnnaturall if I bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. And if all other supportance faile, yet no arme is to be esteemed weake, which striketh with the sword of necessitie and Iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King with a well appeased stayednesse returned answere; that he could easily endure the iniurie of his angry wordes: but to men of moderate iudgement hee would make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4099:128"/>
that hee entended no more in offending him, then to prouide for defending himselfe. So the Duke obseruing few complements, but such as were spiced with anger and disdaine, returned into <hi>Normandie,</hi> associated to him the <hi>English</hi> exiles, and made preparation for his defence.</p>
            <p>The King followed with a great power, and found him in good appointment of armes: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to the King in resolute courage, but farre inferiour both in number of men, and in fine contriuance of his affaires. For the King had purchased assured intelligence, among those that were neerest both in place and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile to the Duke: in whom the Duke found treacherie, euen when he reposed most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent trust. Herewith Pope <hi>Paschal,</hi> to attaine his purpose in <hi>England,</hi> for deuesting the King of inuesting Bishops; did not onely allow this enterprise for lawful, but encouraged the King, that hee should doe thereby a noble and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable benefit to his Realme.</p>
            <p>So, many stiffe battels were executed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, with small difference of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at the first; but after some continuance, the Dukes side (as it commonly happeneth to euill
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4099:128"/>
managed courage) declined dayly, by reason of his dayly increase of wants. At the last the Duke, wearied and ouerlayed, both with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men and cunning working, resolued to bring his whole state to the stake, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the same vpon one cast: committing to Fortune, what valour and industry could bring forth. The king being the Inuader, thought it not his part to shrinke from the shocke; being also aduertised that the <hi>French</hi> King prepared to relieue the Duke. On the Dukes side, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, rage, and reuenge, attended vpon hate: the King retained inuincible valour, assured hope to ouercome, grounded vpon experience how to ouercome.</p>
            <p>They met vpon the same day of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth iust 40. yeeres, after the great battaile of <hi>William</hi> the first against King <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Kings footemen farre exceeding their enemies in number, began the charge, in small and scattering troupes; lightly assayling where they could espie the weakest resistance. But the Dukes Armie receiued them in close and firme order; so as vpon the losse of many of the foremost, the residue began somewhat to retire. And now, whether the Duke had
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4099:129"/>
cause, or whether confidence the inseparable companion of courage perswaded him that he had cause; he supposed that hee had the best of the field, and that the victory was euen in his hand. But suddenly the King with his whole forces of horse charged him in flanke, and with great violence brake into his battaile. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the footmen also returned, and turned them all to a ruinous rout. The Duke perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med admirable effects of valour, and so did most of the <hi>English</hi> exiles: as fearing ouerthrow worse then death. But no courage was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to sustaine the disorder; the <hi>Normans</hi> on euery hand were chased, ruffled, and beaten downe. Hereupon the Dukes courage boyling in choller, hee doubled many blowes vpon his enemies; more furiously driuen, then well pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and set: and pressing vp hardly among them, was suddenly engaged so farre, that hee could not possibly recouer himselfe. So he was taken manfully fighting, or as some other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours affirme, was beastly betrayed by his owne followers. With him were also taken the Earle of <hi>Mortaigne, William Crispine, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Ferreis, Robert Estotiuill,</hi> with foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men of armes, and ten thousand ordinary
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:4099:129"/>
souldiers. The number of the slaine on both sides, is not reported by any authour; but all authours agree, that this was the most bloody medly that euer had been executed in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> before: portended as it is thought by a Comet, and by two full Moones, which late before were seene, the one in the East, and the other in the West.</p>
            <p>After this victorie the King reduced <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> entirely into his possession, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed it to the Realme of <hi>England.</hi> Then hee built therein many Castles, and planted garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and with no lesse wisedome assured that State, then with valour he had wonne it. When he had setled all things according to his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he returned into <hi>England,</hi> brought with him his brother <hi>Robert,</hi> and committed him to safe custodie in the Castle of <hi>Cardiff.</hi> But either by reason of his fauourable restraint, or else by negligence or corruption of his keepers, he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped away, and fled for his libertie as if it had been for his life. Notwithstanding this proued but a false fauour, or rather a true flatterie or scorne of Fortune. For being sharply pursued, he was taken againe, sitting vpon horsebacke; his horse legs fast locked in deep &amp; tough clay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:4099:130"/>Then hee was committed to straight and close prison, his eyes put out (as if hee should not see his miserie) and a sure guard set vpon him. Thus he remained in desolate darkenesse; neither reuerenced by any for his former great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not pitied for his present distresse. Thus hee continued about 27. yeeres, in a life farre more grieuous then death; euen vntill the yere before the death of King <hi>Henrie.</hi> So long was he a suitor in wooing of death: so long did the one brother ouerliue his good fortune, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his good nature and disposition; estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it a faire fauour, that the vttermost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie was not inflicted. Albeit some writers doe affirme, that the Dukes eyes were not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently put out, but that either through age or infirmitie he fell blind: that he was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attended and cared for: that hauing dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in his iudgement the worst of his case, the greatnesse of his courage did neuer descend to any base degree of sorrow or griefe: that his braue behauiour did set a Maiestie vpon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected fortunes: that his noble heart like the Sunne, did shew greatest cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance in lowest state. And to this report I am the more incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for that it agreeth best, both to the faire
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4099:130"/>
conditions, and to the former behauiours, and to the succeeding fortunes and felicities of the King: For assuredly hee had a heart of manly clemencie; and this was a punishment barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously cruell: For which cause <hi>Constantine</hi> did<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Others auow that he was neuer blind; but that it was the Earle of <hi>Mortaigne</hi> whose eyes were put out. And this seemeth to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by that which <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> and <hi>Matth. Westm</hi> doe report. That not long before the death of <hi>Robert,</hi> the King vpon a festiuall day had a new robe of Scarlet brought vnto him: the cape whereof being somewhat too streight for his head, he did teare a little in striuing to put it on. And perceiuing that it would not serue, hee laid it aside and said: <hi>Let my brother Robert haue this Robe, for whose head it is fitter then for mine.</hi> When it was caried vnto him, being then not perfectly in health, he espied the crackt place, and thereupon enquired, if any man had worne it before? The messenger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the whole matter. Which when <hi>Robert</hi> heard, he tooke it for a great indignitie, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:4099:131"/>
said: <hi>I perceiue now that I haue liued too long, that my brother doth clothe me like his almoseman, with cast and torne garments.</hi> So hee grew weary of his life: and his disease encreasing with his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, pined away, and in short time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter died, and was buried at <hi>Glocester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was the end of that excellent commander; brought to this game and gaze of fortune, after many trauerses that he had troden. He was for courage and direction infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to none; but neither prouident nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in his affaires, whereby the true end of his actions were ouerthrowen. His valour had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed ouer desperate dangers: and vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was no more setled in valour, then dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to vertue and goodnesse; neuer wilfully or willingly doing euill, neuer but by errour, as finding it disguised vnder some maske of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. His performances in armes had raised him to a high point of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his prowesse; which made him the more vnhappy, as vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie after a fall from high state of honor.

In like sort <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> declared in armes against the King for a yeerely pension of 300. markes; the occasion of which demand was this. King <hi>William</hi> the first, in recompence of the ayde which he receiued in his enterprise for <hi>England,</hi> from <hi>Baldwine</hi> 5. Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> payd him yeerely three hundred markes, which after his death was continued to his sonne. <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> from a collaterall line, demanded the same Pension; but it was denied him by K. <hi>Henrie:</hi> wherefore <hi>Baldwine</hi> his sonne attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now to recouer it by Armes.</p>
            <p>With these, or rather as principall of these, <hi>Lewes</hi> the grosse King of <hi>France,</hi> seeing his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight in permitting <hi>Normandie</hi> to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> assembled a great armie; and vpon pretence of a trifling
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4099:132"/>
quarrell about the demolishing of the Castle of <hi>Gisors,</hi> declared <hi>William</hi> sonne to <hi>Robert Curtcuise</hi> for Duke of <hi>Normandie:</hi> and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to place him in possession of that state, which his vnfortunate father had lost. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those open hostilities in Armes, <hi>Hugh</hi> the kings Chamberlaine and certaine others were suborned traiterously to kill the King: but the practise was in good time discouered, and the conspirators punished by death.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the King both with celeritie and power answerable to the danger at hand, passed the Seas into <hi>Normandie:</hi> hauing first drawen to his assistance <hi>Theobald</hi> Earle of <hi>Champaine,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Crecie, Pissaux,</hi> and <hi>Dammartine,</hi> who aspired to be absolute Lords within their territories, as were many other Princes at that time in <hi>France.</hi> These deteined the <hi>French</hi> King in some tariance in <hi>France,</hi> whilest the King of <hi>England</hi> either recouered or reuenged his losses against the Earle of <hi>Aniou.</hi> At the last hee was assailed in <hi>Normandie</hi> on three parts at once: by the Earle of <hi>Aniou</hi> from <hi>Maine,</hi> from <hi>Ponthieu</hi> by the Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and by the <hi>French</hi> King betweene both. The King of <hi>England</hi> appointed certaine forces to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:4099:132"/>
guard the passages against the Earle of <hi>Aniou:</hi> with directions to hold themselues within their strength, and not to aduenture into the field. Against the Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> hee went in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and in a sharpe shocke betweene them the Earle was defeated and hurt, and (as some Authors affirme) slaine: albeit others doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that hee was afterwards slaine in a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile betweene the two Kings of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he turned against <hi>Lewes</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and fought with him before the towne of <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Normandie;</hi> which towne the <hi>French</hi> had surprised and taken from the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This battaile continued aboue the space of nine houres, with incredible obstinacie; the doubt of victory being no lesse great, then was the desire: and yet neither part so hastie to end, as not to stay for the best aduantage. The first battaile on both sides was hewen in pieces; valour of inestimable value was there cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: much braue blood was lost; many men esteemed both for their place and worth, lay groaning and grinning vnder the heauy hand of death. The sad blowes, the grisle wounds, the grieuous deathes that were dealt that day,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:4099:133"/>
might well haue moued any man to haue said, That warre is nothing else but inhumane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>The Kings courage, guided with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and guarded both with his strength and his skill, was neuer idle, neuer but working me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable effects. In all places his directions were followed by his presence; being witnesse both of the diligence and valour of euery man, and not suffering any good aduantage or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise for want of timely taking to be lost. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured so farre in perfourming with his hand, that his armour in many places was bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to his body, and by reason of the sturdie strokes set vpon his helme, he cast blood out of his mouth. But this was so farre from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maying his powers, that it did rather assemble and vnite them: so as aduancing his braue head, his furie did breath such vigour into his arme, that his sword made way through the thickest throngs of his enemies, and hee brake into them euen to the last ranckes. He was first seconded by the truely valiant; whose vndan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spirits did assure the best, and therewith contemne the very worst. Then came in they whom despaire, the last of resolutions had
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4099:133"/>
made valiant; who discerned no meanes of hope for life, but by bold aduenturing vpon death. Lastly he was followed by all; being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by this example to a new life of resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Generally, the swords went so fast, that the <hi>French</hi> vnable to endure that deadly storme, were vtterly disbanded and turned to flight. K. <hi>Henry</hi> after a bloody chase, recouered <hi>Nice;</hi> and with great triumph returned to <hi>Roan.</hi> Afterwards he would often say, That in other battailes he fought for victory, but in this for his life: and that hee would but little ioy in many such victories.</p>
            <p>Vpon this euent the King sent certaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into <hi>France,</hi> to harrase the countrey, and to strike a terrour into the enemie. The <hi>French</hi> King, besides the abatement of his power by reason of his late ouerthrow, was then prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Armes against <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, who intended to destroy <hi>Rhemes:</hi> partly drawen on by <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> whose daughter he had taken to wife; but chiefly for that a Councell had bene there held against him by Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> a French man, wherein the Emperour was declared enemie to the Church, and degraded from his Imperiall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:4099:134"/>
This brought the <hi>English</hi> to a carelesse conceit, and to a loose and licentious demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in their action; a most assured token of some mischiefe at hand. And so, as they scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and ranged after prey (as greedy men are seldome circumspect) they were suddenly set vpon by <hi>Almaricke</hi> Earle of <hi>Mountfort,</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>French</hi> K. to defend the Country, &amp; with no small execution put to the chase. The more they resisted, the greater was their losse: The sooner they fled, the more assured was their escape. And for that they were dispersed into many small companies, they had the better opportunitie to saue themselues.</p>
            <p>Many other like aduentures were enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betweene the two Kings and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; some in <hi>France,</hi> and some in <hi>Normandie;</hi> with large losse on both sides. But especially the King of <hi>France</hi> was most subiect to harme; for that his countrey was the more ample, open and rich. The King of <hi>England</hi> held this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, that no aduantage could be wonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: which in regard of the number, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and greatnesse of his enemies, was a very honourable aduantage indeed.</p>
            <p>At the last he made peace with the Earle of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:4099:134"/>
               <hi>Aniou;</hi> taking the Earles daughter to be wife to his sonne <hi>William,</hi> whom he had declared for successour in his estate; to whom all the Nobilitie and Prelates were sworne; and who seemed to want nothing through all his fathers dominions, but onely the name and Title of King. This sinew being cut from the King of <hi>France,</hi> and also for that <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour made preparation of hostilitie against him, he fell likewise to agreement of peace. By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions whereof, <hi>William</hi> sonne to the King of <hi>England</hi> was inuested into the Duchie of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> doing homage for the same to the K. of <hi>France.</hi> In this peace was comprised on the part of the <hi>French</hi> K, <hi>Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> son to <hi>Robert Curtcuise,</hi> who had bene declared Duke of <hi>Normandie.</hi> On the part of the king of <hi>England,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Champ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>igne</hi> and certaine other Lords were comprised; who had either serued or aided him against the king of <hi>France.</hi> After this the warres betweene the Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> king did forthwith dissolue.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> hauing happily finished these affaires, returned out of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from <hi>Barbeflote,</hi> vpon the 24. of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber towards euening, with a prosperous gale
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:4099:135"/>
arriued in <hi>England;</hi> where great preparation was made to entertaine him with many well deuised honours. His sonne <hi>William</hi> then duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and somewhat aboue 17. yeeres of age, tooke another ship; and in his company went <hi>Mary</hi> his sister Countesse of <hi>Perch, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> his brother, begotten of a concubine as some affirme; and the Earle of <hi>Chester</hi> with his wife <hi>Lucie,</hi> who was the Kings niece by his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Adela.</hi> Also the yong Nobilitie and best knights flocked vnto him, some to discharge their dueties, others to testifie their loue and respect. Of such passengers the ship receiued to the number of 140. besides 50. sailers which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto her.</p>
            <p>So they loosed from land somewhat after the King; and with a gentle winde from the Southwest, danced through the soft swelling floods. The sailers full of proud ioy, by reason of their honourable charge; and of little feare or forecast, both for that they had bene accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to dangers, and for that they were then well tippeled with wine; gaue forth in a braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they would soone outstrip the vessell wherein the King sailed. In the middest of this drunken ioylitie the ship strake against a rocke,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:4099:135"/>
the head whereof was aboue water, not farre from the shoare. The passengers cried out, and the sailers laboured to winde or beare off the ship from the danger; but the labour was no lesse vaine then the cry: for she leaned so stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the rocke, that the sterage brake, the sides cracked, and the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sea gushed in at many breaches.</p>
            <p>Then was raised a lamentable cry within the ship; some yeelding to the tyrannie of despaire, betooke themselues (as in cases of extremitie weake courages are wont) to their deuotions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others emploied all industrie to saue their liues, and yet more in duetie to nature, then vpon hope to escape: all bewailed the vnfortunate darkenesse of that night, the last to the liues of so many persons both of honour and of worth. They had nothing to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany them but their feares, nothing to helpe them but their wishes: the confused cries of them al, did much increase the particular astonishment of euery one. And assuredly no danger dismayeth like that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the seas; for that the place is vnnaturall to man. And further, the vnusuall obiects, the continuall motion, the desolation of all helpe or hope, will perplexe the minds euen of those
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:4099:136"/>
who are best armed against discouragement.</p>
            <p>At the last the boat was hoysed foorth, and the Kings sonne taken into it. They had clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselues from the danger of the ship, and might safely haue rowed to land. But the yong Prince hearing the shrill shrikes of his Sister <hi>Mary</hi> Countesse of <hi>Perch,</hi> and of the Countesse of <hi>Chester</hi> his cousin, crying after him, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his help; he preferred pitie before safety, &amp; commanded the boat to be rowed back to the ship for preseruatiou of their liues. But as they approached, the boate was suddenly so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with those, who (strugling to breake out of the armes of death) leaped at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures into it, that it sunke vnder them: and so all the company perished by drowning. Onely one ordinary Sayler, who had been a butcher, by swimming all night vpon the mast escaped to land; reserued as it may seeme, to relate the manner of the misaduenture. This ship raised much matter of nouelty and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course abroad; but neuer did ship bring such calamitie to the Realme: especially for that it was iudged, that the life of this Prince would haue preuented those intestine warres, which afterwards did fall, betweene King <hi>Steuen</hi> and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:4099:136"/>
               <hi>Matild</hi> daughter to King <hi>Henry.</hi> The King was so ouercharged with this heauy accident; that his reason seemed to bee darkened, or rather drowned in sorrow. Hee caused the coasts a long time after to bee watched; but scarce any of the bodies were euer found. Afterwards he tooke to wife <hi>Adalisia</hi> daughter to <hi>Godfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Louaine,</hi> of the house of <hi>Lorraine:</hi> She was crowned at <hi>Westminster</hi> by <hi>Roger</hi> B. of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> because <hi>Radulph</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> by reason of his palsey was vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe that office. And yet because <hi>Roger</hi> was not appointed by him, the doting old man fell into such a pelting chafe, that hee offered to strike the Kings Crowne from his head. And albeit this Lady was in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall flower both of her beauty and yeeres, yet the King had no issue by her.</p>
            <p>Now as after a storme a fewe gentle drops doe alwayes fall, before the weather turnes perfectly fayre; so after these great warres in <hi>France,</hi> certaine easie conflicts did ensue: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dangerous nor almost troublesome to the King. For <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Mellent,</hi> who for a long time had continued both a sure friend, and most close and priuate in counsaile with

the King; vpon some sudden either discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his part, or dislike on the Kings, so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged himselfe, as it was enterpreted to be a reuolt: being charged with intent, to aduance <hi>William,</hi> cousin to <hi>William,</hi> sonne to <hi>Robert Curtcuise,</hi> to the Duchie of <hi>Normandie.</hi> Wherefore the King besieged, and at last tooke his chiefe Castle called <hi>Pont. Audomer;</hi> and at the same time enuironed the towre of <hi>Roan</hi> with a wall. He also repaired and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the Castles of <hi>Caen, Arches, Gisore, Falace, Argentine, Donfronç, Oxine, Aubrois, Nanroye, Iuta,</hi> and the Towne of <hi>Vernone</hi> in such sort, as at that time, they were esteemed impregnable, and not to bee forced by any enemie; except God or gold.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Earle of <hi>Mellent,</hi> with <hi>Hugh Geruase</hi> his sonne, and <hi>Hugh de Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> his sisters sonne, calling such as either alliance or friendship did draw vnto them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those whom youthful either age or minds had filled with vnlimited desires; whom dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment also or want did vainly feed with hungry hopes; entred into <hi>Normandy</hi> in armes: being so transported with desire to hurt, and troubled with feare of receiuing hurt, that they
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:4099:137"/>
had neuer free scope of iudgement, either to prepare or manage the meanes to hurt. They were no sooner entred the Confines of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> but <hi>William Tankeruill</hi> the kings Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine came against them, brauely appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and resolute to fight. The very view of an enemie turned their euill guided furie into a feare: and whatsoeuer they did (proceeding rather from violence of passion then ground of reason) made them stumble whilest they ran, and by their owne disorders hindered their owne desires. So with small difficultie they were surprised and taken, and brought to the King; who committed them to streit prison at <hi>Roan.</hi> An ordinary euent when rage runneth faster, then iudgement and power are able to hold pace.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Charles</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> as he was at his deuotions in the Church of <hi>S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> was suddenly slaine by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie of his owne people. And because hee left no issue in life, <hi>Lewes</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>William</hi> sonne to <hi>Robert Curtcuis</hi> late Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> in the Earledome of <hi>Flanders;</hi> as descended from Earle <hi>Baldwine</hi> sirnamed the Pious, whose daughter <hi>Matilde</hi> was wife to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:4099:138"/>
King <hi>William</hi> the first, and grandmother to this <hi>William.</hi> This he did, not so much in fauour to <hi>William,</hi> or in regard of his right, as to set vp an assured enemie against King <hi>Henry:</hi> an enemie not onely of singular expectation, but proofe: whose courage was apt to vndertake any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; whether for glory, or for reuenge. And herein his proiect did nothing faile. For no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the Earle aduanced to that estate, but he raised a great hostilitie against the King of <hi>England:</hi> as well to recouer the Duchie of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> as either to relieue or to reuenge the hard captiuitie of his father.</p>
            <p>In this warre the Earle did winne a great opinion, both for iudgement to discerne, and for valour to execute what hee did discerne: shewing himselfe in nothing inferiour to his vnckle the king, but onely in treasure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of men. For this cause he craued sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of <hi>Lewes</hi> king of <hi>France;</hi> who, as he was the first that blew the cole, so was he alwayes ready to put fuell to the flame. But the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> entered <hi>France</hi> with a strong Armie, where his sword ranged and raged without resistance: and yet more in prosecution of prey, then in execution of blood. He lodged at <hi>Hesperdune</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:4099:138"/>
the space of 8. dayes; no lesse quietly, no lesse safely, then if he had bene in the principall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his kingdome. By this meanes hee kept the <hi>French</hi> King from sending succour to the Earle of <hi>Flanders.</hi> And in the meane season drew <hi>Theodoricke</hi> Earle of <hi>Holsteine,</hi> nephew to <hi>Robert</hi> who had bene Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus</hi> sisters sonne to Earle <hi>Charles,</hi> not long before slaine, to inuade Earle <hi>William:</hi> Both pretending title to his dignitie, both bringing seueral armies, consisting of men, tough in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and well exercised in affaires of the field.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodorick</hi> vpon his first approch tooke <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Ipres</hi> and <hi>Gandt;</hi> either willingly yeelding, or with small resistance: and vpon the necke thereof <hi>Arnoldus</hi> tooke the strong towne of <hi>S. Omer.</hi> Earle <hi>William</hi> being thus set as it were betweene the beetle and the blocke, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deiected, nothing dismayed, either in courage or in hope. And first he went against <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> with a small company, but with such a liuely countenance of a Souldier, that <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> fell to capitulation for his safe departure; and so returned home as if he had bene van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished. Then the Earle made head against <hi>Theodorick,</hi> and gaue him battaile, albeit farre
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4099:139"/>
inferious to him, both for number and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his men. The fight betweene them was long, furious and doubtfull. The <hi>Germans</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in their number, which made them trust the lesse to their valour: the <hi>Flemings</hi> rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate then resolute, vpon importance of their danger. And indeed it often happeneth, that good successe at the first doeth occasion the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of many great actions: by working in the one side a confidence in themselues, and contempt of their enemies; and by making the other more earnest and entire. So at the last the violent valour of the Earle, well followed with the braue and resolute rage of his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, did such effects, that the <hi>Germans</hi> were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and disordered, many slaine in the field, and the residue chased out of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle hauing now no enemie in open field, layed siege to the castle of <hi>Alhurst,</hi> which was defended against him by the <hi>English.</hi> The assaults were so liuely enforced, and with such varietie of inuention and deuise; that a wide way was opened through all impediments, and the defendants were constrained by many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, to desire faire conditions of yeelding. This whilest the Earle delayed to grant, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:4099:139"/>
in a certaine light co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict a wound in his hand, whereof in a short time after he died: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first raised himselfe very high in opinion with all men, for his courage, industrie and skill in Armes. And thus Duke <hi>Robert</hi> and his sonne <hi>William</hi> were brought to their vnhappy ends; rather through the malice of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, then through any bad merit or insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in themselues: whereby the Duchie of <hi>Normandie,</hi> which had bene both the cause and the seate of very great warres, was then strongly setled in possession of King <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee was neuer infested with domesticall warres; which in regard of those tumultuous times, is a manifest argument both of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and prouidence; the one not giuing cause, the other no hope, for his subiects to rebel. The King of <hi>Scots</hi> did homage vnto him; for what territories I doe not determine. <hi>Morcard</hi> King of <hi>Ireland</hi> and some of his successors were so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable vnto him, that they seemed to depend vpon his command. The <hi>Welsh</hi> who hated idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and peace alike, did striue beyond their strength to pull their feete out of the mire of subiection; but in loose straggling companies, without either discipline or head. For this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:4099:140"/>
cause hee made diuers expeditions into <hi>Wales,</hi> where he had many bickerings, and put many chases vpon them: but found nothing worthy the name, either of enemie or of warre. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by maintaining garrisons, and light troups of Souldiers, he consumed the most obstinate, and reduced the rest to his allegeance: receiuing the sonnes of their Nobilitie for hostages.</p>
            <p>At that time many Flemings inhabited in <hi>England;</hi> of whom some came ouer in the time of King <hi>William</hi> the first, by occasion of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Matild</hi> daughter to <hi>Baldwine</hi> their Earle: but the greatest part came vnder the reigne of this King <hi>Henrie,</hi> by reason that <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> at that time by irruption of the sea, was in many places ouerflowen. The King was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to entertaine them, because they brought with them both industrie and trades; because they made the Countrey both populous and rich. For in making a place populous, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also made rich: draw people to a place, and plentie will follow; driue away people, and it is vndone. They were first planted neere the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Tweede;</hi> besides those who dispersed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers Townes. But at this time the King sent many of them into <hi>Rose</hi> in <hi>Pembrokeshire,</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:4099:140"/>
whose progeny did euer since maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in good condition against the <hi>Welsh:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a people euen at this day distinguished from all other bordering vpon them, both in language, and in nature, and in fashion of life.</p>
            <p>On a time as the king marched through <hi>Powesland</hi> in <hi>Southwales,</hi> hee came to certaine streights, through which his maine army could not passe, by reason of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and traine of cariage: wherefore hee sent the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part a further way about, and himselfe with a small company tooke the neerer way thorow those streights. When he was well entred, he was charged very sharpely, but rudely, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordredly by the <hi>Welsh;</hi> who hauing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage both in number and in place, did much annoy him from the higher ground; but durst not approach to close fight at hand. The King himselfe was smitten with an arrow full vpon the breast: whereat hee swore <hi>By our Lords death</hi> (which was his vsuall oath) that it was no <hi>Welsh</hi> arme which shot that arrow. Many of his men also were hurt, and the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due strangely disordred; the amazement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farre greater then the distresse. But the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:4099:141"/>
king with a firme countenance retired in time, the enemies not daring to pursue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, then they might be assured by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of place. Then he sent peaceably vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and after some ouertures, brought them to agree, that for a thousand head of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the passage should be left open vnto him.</p>
            <p>IN this politicke gouernment he so managed the State, that neither subiects wanted iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, nor Prince obedience. He repaired ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defects, hee reformed many abuses, which would in the meane time enfeeble, and at last oppresse the Common-wealth. Hee ordred his affaires with such moderation, that he was not onely well obeyed by his subiects, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured and respected by forreine Princes: wherby it appeared, that learning may be both a guard and guide to Princes, if it be not so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately affected, as to bereaue them, either of the minde, or time for action. He vsed much seueritie in punishing offenders; seueritie, the life of iustice; of iustice, the most assured pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer of States: affording no more fauour for the most parr, then dead mercilesse law did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot. Against the eues he prouided, that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:4099:141"/>
should saue them from hanging. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined that counterfeitures of money should loose both their eyes, and be depriued of their priuie parts. He tooke away the deceit which had been occasioned by varietie of measures, and made a measure by the length of his owne arme: which hath been Commonly vsed euer since by the name of a yard.</p>
            <p>And wheras there are two infallible signes of a diseased State; excesse in eating, and in attire; which could neuer be restrained by penalties or feare, but the more the people are therin forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the more are they rauished into riot and vanitie: the King by two meanes cast a general restraint vpon them both: by example, and by reproofe: which by reason of the inclination of men to imitate and please their Prince, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been of greater force then lawes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme abuses in that kind. He much abhorred excesse in eating and drinking, and was so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his owne diet, that he seemed to feede onely for necessitie of nature. Hee both vsed and commended ciuill modestie in apparell: especially he could not endure an absurd abuse of men in those times, in wearing long haire like vnto women. And when their owne haire
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:4099:142"/>
failed, they set artificiall <hi>Peruques,</hi> with long locks vpon their heads; whereas by censure of the Apostle, it is reprochfull for men to weare<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 14.</note> long haire. He discharged his Court of many loose lasciuious persons; affirming, that they were no good instruments of the kingdome; as being in peace chargeable, and vnprofitable for warre.</p>
            <p>During his absence in <hi>Normandie,</hi> which was sometimes three or foure yeeres together, he committed the gouernement of his Realme to <hi>Roger</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisburie:</hi> A man harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in life, in mind flourishing and fresh, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention vpright: most wise in taking, and most faithfull and fortunate in giuing aduise. Hee had gouerned the Kings expenses of house when hee was but a Prince of priuate estate; whereby he gained that reputation for integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and skill, which aduanced him to a higher trust. He was Doctor of the Canon and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill lawes, as most of the Bishops at that time were, and did beare the title and name of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiarius totius Angliae.</hi> Hee built the <hi>Deuises</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> the Castles of <hi>Malmesburie</hi> and <hi>Shireburne.</hi> He repaired the Castle of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and enuironed the same with a wall; hee
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:4099:142"/>
built the stately Church at <hi>Salisburie,</hi> destined to a longer life then any of his other workes. And further, by reason of the Kings much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in <hi>Normandie,</hi> the prouisions of his house were valued at certaine prices, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in money, to the great contentment and ease of the people.</p>
            <p>In these times were mighty woods about the place where the two high wayes <hi>Watling</hi> and <hi>Ikening</hi> doe ioyne together; which woods were a safe couert and retreite for many rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who much infested those high wayes. The most famous thiefe among them, was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note place="margin">Dunne a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thiefe.</note> 
               <hi>Dunne,</hi> a man mischieuous without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, equally greedie of blood and of spoile, the first infamie of his name: Hee was in a sort as the most villanously aduentrous and vile; (for in lewd actions, the worst are greatest) Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ouer the rest, and of him the place was called <hi>Dunstable.</hi> To represse this annoyance, the King caused the woods to bee cut downe, built there a Borough, to which hee granted Faire &amp; Market, and that the Burgesses should be so free as any other Burgesses within the Realme. Hee erected there also a Palace for himselfe, and also a faire Church or Priorie;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:4099:143"/>
whereto he gaue large priuiledges and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By these meanes hee made the place first populous, and consequently both plentifull and safe.</p>
            <p>Many other royall workes hee performed, some for Religion, as the Religious buildings specified before; some for strength, as diuers Castles in <hi>Normandie,</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and some also in <hi>England:</hi> and namely the Castle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> the Castle Colledge and Towne of <hi>Windsore</hi> on the hill, about a mile distant from the old Towne of <hi>Windsore;</hi> which afterward was much encreased by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and after him by many Kings and Queenes succeeding. Many Palaces also he built for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament &amp; pleasure. And to this end he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Parke at <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> wherein hee preserued with great pleasure diuers sorts of strange beasts; which because he did with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny demonstrations of pleasure both accept and esteeme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were liberally sent vnto him from other Princes.</p>
            <p>Hee first instituted the forme of the high Court of Parliament, as now it is in vse. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, onely certaine of the Nobilitie and Prelats of the Realme were called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:4099:143"/>
about the most important affaires of state: he caused the commons also to be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, by Knights and Burgesses of their owne appointment, and made that Court to consist of three parts; the Nobilitie, the Clergie, and the Common people; representing the whole body of the Realme. The first Councell of this sort was held at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> vpon the 19. day of April, in the 16. yeere of his reigne.</p>
            <p>His seueritie in iustice, the very heart string of a Common-wealth, his heauie hand in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring downe his enemies, in disabling those from working him harme whom he knew would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loue him at the heart; was traduced by some vnder termes of crueltie. And yet was he alwayes more mindfull of benefits then of wrongs; and in offences of highest nature, euen for bearing Armes against him, he punished oftentimes by imprisonment or exile, and not by death.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Matilde</hi> his daughter was giuen in mariage to <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth Emperour, he tooke 3. shillings of euery hide of land throughout the Realme: which being followed by succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Kings, did grow to a custome of receiuing ayd, whensoeuer they gaue their daughters in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:4099:144"/>
marriage. For albeit the same be found in the great <hi>Custumier</hi> of <hi>Normandie,</hi> yet was it neuer practised in <hi>England</hi> before. This happened in the fifteenth yeere of his reigne: and he neuer had the like contribution after, but one for furnishing his warres in <hi>France.</hi> So the people were not charged with many extraordinary taxations, but their ordinary fines and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were very great; and yet not very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto them. For that they saw them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, not in wanton wast, not in loose and immoderate liberalitie, but either vpon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, or for the honour &amp; dignitie of the state: wherein the preseruation or aduancement of the common good, made particular burthens not almost sensible.</p>
            <p>But both his actions and exactions were most displeasing to the Clergy; the Clergy did often times not onely murmure, but struggle and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose against his actions: as taking their liberties to be infringed, and their state diminished; by abasing their authority, and abating both their riches and power. When any Bishopricke or Abbey fell voyd, hee did apply the reuenues thereof for supply of his necessities and wants: and for that cause kept some of them many
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:4099:144"/>
yeeres together vacant in his hands. He would not permit appeales to <hi>Rome.</hi> Canons were not of force within the Realme, vnlesse they were confirmed by the King. Legats from the Pope were not obeyed; and no man would come to their conuocations. In so much as one of the Popes Legates in <hi>France</hi> did excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate all the Priests of <hi>Normandy,</hi> because they would not come to his Synode. For this cause the King sent the Bishop of <hi>Exceter</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> albeit he was both blind and in yeeres, to treat with the Pope concerning that businesse. Hee gaue inuestitures to Prelates, by Crosse, Ring and Staffe: and is charged to haue receiued of some of them great summes of money for their places. About this time the marriage of Priests was forbidden in <hi>England;</hi> but the King for money permitted them to reteine their wiues, and in the end set an imposition in that respect vpon euery Church throughout the Realme. It auailed not any man to say, that he had no purpose to keepe a wife: he must pay for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to keepe a wife if he would.</p>
            <p>For these causes they fastened the infamie of couetousnesse vpon him. For these causes and especially for inuesting and receiuing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:4099:145"/>
of Prelats, he had a stiffe strife with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> Archb. of <hi>Canterburie.</hi> For the King said, that it was against the custome of his ancesters, it could not stand with the safety of his State; that the Prelats, who at that time held the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall places both of trust and command in his kingdome, who in very deed ruled all the rest, should not be appointed onely by himselfe; should not sweare faith and allegiance vnto him; should either bee aduanced or depend vpon any forren Prince. On the other side <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme</hi> refused, not onely to confirme, but to communicate or common friendly with those who had bene inuested by the King: reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as abortiues and children of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; traducing the King also, as a defiler of Religion, as a deformer of the beautie and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Church. Hereupon by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, they were confirmed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by the Archb of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Onely <hi>William Gifford,</hi> to whom the K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had giuen the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of <hi>Winchester,</hi> refused Consecration from the Archb. of <hi>Yorke;</hi> for which cause the King depriued him of all his goods, and banished him out of the Realme.</p>
            <p>Then the King required <hi>Anselme</hi> to doe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:4099:145"/>
him homage, and to be present with him at gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Inuestitures; as <hi>Lanfranck</hi> his predecesior had bene with King <hi>William</hi> his father. Against these demaunds <hi>Anselme</hi> obiected the decrees of the Councell lately held at <hi>Rome;</hi> whereby all Lay-persons were excommunicate, who should conferre any Spiritual promotions; and all those accursed, who for Ecclesiasticall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, should subiect themselues vnder the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or seruice of any Lay-man. Hereupon messengers were dispatched from both parties to the Pope: who determined altogether in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of <hi>Anselme,</hi> or rather in fauour of himselfe. Notwithstanding the king desisted not to vrge <hi>Anselme,</hi> to sweare homage vnto him. <hi>Anselme</hi> required, that the Popes letters should bee brought foorth; and he would doe as by them hee should be directed. The King answered, that he had nothing to doe with the Popes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that this was a Soueraigne right of his Crowne; that if any man may pull these Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties from his Crowne, he may easily pull his Crowne from his head: that therefore <hi>Anselme</hi> must doe him homage, or else depart out of his kingdome. <hi>Anselme</hi> answered, that hee would not depart out of the Realme, but goe home to

his Church, and there see, who would offer him violence.</p>
            <p>Then were messengers againe sent to the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> two Bishops from the King, and two Monckes from <hi>Anselme.</hi> The King wrote to the Pope, first congratulating his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement to the Sea of <hi>Rome;</hi> then desiring the continuance of that amitie which had bene betweene their predecessours; Lastly, he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all honour and obedience, which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did yeeld to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> desiring againe, that he might not be abridged of such vsages as his father did enioy: concluding, that during his life, hee would not suffer the dignities of his Crowne to be empaired; and if he should so doe, yet the Nobilitie and common people of the Realme would in no case permit it, but would rather recede from obedience to his See.</p>
            <p>The Pope wrote backe againe to <hi>Anselme;</hi> that for one mans pleasure hee would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse the decrees of former Popes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gaue him both encouragement &amp; charge, to continue constant, and to see them obserued in euery point. Hee directed also his letters to the King, which the King did suppresse: but his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:4099:146"/>
Embassadours declared by word, that the Pope permitted Inuestitures to the King, so as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things hee would execute the Office of a good Prince. <hi>Anselme</hi> called for the Popes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The King answered, that his Bishops were to be credited before the Monckes, who were disabled either for voyce or testimonie in Secular affaires. <hi>Anselme</hi> said, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to yeeld vnto the King, but he durst not although it should cost him his head, vnlesse he had a warrant from <hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore he would send thither againe, to haue a more full and ample answere. The King and diuers of the Nobilitie perswaded him to goe in person, to trauaile to the Pope, and to trauaile with him, for the quiet of the Church, and of his countrey. With much adoe he was entreated, and so set forth on his iourney towards <hi>Rome:</hi> and after followed the kings Embassadour <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam Warlewast,</hi> new elect Bishop of <hi>Exceter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Bishop came to the Popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, he declared vnto him; what great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities did rise out of <hi>England</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> that the Inuesting of Prelats had bene an ancient right to the crowne of that Realme; that as the King was by nature liberall, so was
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:4099:147"/>
he stout and resolute in courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it should be a great dishonour to him, who in power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded any of his ancesters, if hee should not maintaine the dignities which they held; that for this cause the Pope should doe well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to his consideration, what preiudice might follow to his Estate, if hee should remit nothing of the seuerities of those Canons which had bene lately made.</p>
            <p>The Pope gaue an attentiue eare, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to pause vpon that which had been sayd. Which the Kings Ambassadour taking to be a degree of yeelding, did more earnestly insist, and said: that the King his master would not for the Crowne of his Realme, loose the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of inuesting his Prelates. Hereto the Pope with a starting voice and countenance answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>Neither will I lose the disposing of spirituall promotions in</hi> England, <hi>for the Kings head that beareth the Crowne; before God</hi> (said hee) <hi>I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uow it.</hi> His flattering followers applauded this speach, as proceeding from a magnanimous courage, or rather as some flash of diuine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and the Kings Ambassador not a little abashed, was content to descend to lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. In the ende it was ordered, that the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:4099:147"/>
King should be restored to certaine customes which had been vsed by his father; but that all they who had bin inuested by the King, should be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, &amp; that their satisfaction and absolution should be committed vnto <hi>Anselme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Anselme,</hi> with full saile of victorie and ioy returned towards <hi>England;</hi> but the Kings Ambassadour stayed behind, to assay whether by any meanes hee could worke the Pope to a milder minde. But when hee saw that he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed in vaine, he followed <hi>Anselme,</hi> and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him at <hi>Placentia,</hi> and there deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him certaine priuate instructions from the King: that if he would come into <hi>England,</hi> and behaue himselfe as his predecessours had done towards the Kings father, hee should be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; otherwise, you are wise enough (said hee) you know what I meane, and may easily coniecture what will ensue. With these words he flang suddenly away; by occasion whereof his speaches setled with a more strong impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and multiplied many doubtfull constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So the Embassadour returned to the King; but <hi>Anselme</hi> went to <hi>Lions,</hi> and remained there a yeere and halfe.</p>
            <p>In the meane time much posting was made
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:4099:148"/>
betweene <hi>England, Lions,</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was concluded, nothing could please: For neither the Pope would yeeld to the King, nor the King to <hi>Anselme.</hi> At the last <hi>Anselme</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to excommunicate the King: whereof the King being aduertised by the Countesse <hi>Adela</hi> his sister, hee desired her to come to him into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and to bring <hi>Anselme</hi> with her. Here the King restored <hi>Anselme</hi> to his former posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; but his returne into <hi>England</hi> was respited, vntill the Pope had confirmed certaine things which <hi>Anselme</hi> did assure. So the King tooke his passage into <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Anselme</hi> abode at the Abbey of <hi>Beck.</hi> Then were dispatched for <hi>Rome, William Warlewast</hi> mentioned before, and <hi>Baldwine</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ramsey;</hi> by whose meanes the controuersie was composed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and the Pope; that the King should receiue homage of Bishops elect, but should not inuest them by Staffe and Ring. After this the king went into <hi>Normandie,</hi> and there agreed to <hi>Anselme</hi> in these points fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 That all his Churches which had been made tributary to King <hi>William</hi> the second should bee set free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <item>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:4099:148"/>2 That the King should require nothing of the sayd Churches, whilest the Sea should remaine vacant.</item>
               <item>3 That such Priests as had giuen money to the King to reteine their wiues should surcease from their function the space of three yeeres; and that the king should take no more after such maner.</item>
               <item>4 That all such goods fruits and possessions as the King had taken from the Sea of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> should bee restored to him at his returne into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus <hi>Anselme</hi> returned into <hi>England,</hi> and after a short time the king followed; hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his brother prisoner, and subdued <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> to his subiection.</p>
            <p>Forthwith <hi>Anselme</hi> by permission of the K. assembled a great Councell of the Clergie at <hi>Westminster;</hi> wherein hee so wrought with the King, that at length (albeit not without great difficultie) it was newly decreed; that no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral man should giue inuestiture with Crosse, or with Ring or with Pastoral staffe. Also he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Priests of his Prouince, that they and their wiues should neuer meete within one house; that they should not keepe any woman in their house, but such as were
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:4099:149"/>
next in kinred vnto them; That hee who held his wife and presumed to say Masse within eight dayes after, should solemnely be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. That all Archdeacons and their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficials should bee sworne, not to winke at the meetings of Priests and their wiues for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and if they would not take this oath, then to lose their office; that such Priests as would forsake their wiues, should cease fourty dayes from ministration in their office, and performe such penance as should be enioyned them by their Bishop. The execution of these Canons importing both a great and sudden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, occasioned much disquiet and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in many parts of the Realme.</p>
            <p>In the same Councel the censure of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was cast vpon those, who did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the vile vice of Sodomitrie: and it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decreed, that the same sentence should be published euery Sonday in al the parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>England.</hi> But afterward it was esteemed fit, that this general excommunication should be repealed. The pretence was, for that the prohibiting, yea, the publike naming of that vice might enflame the hearts of vngracious persons with desire vnto it. But wise men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:4099:149"/>
that after this seuere restreint of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the Clergie, it did grow so frequent and familiar among them, that they would not giue way to so generall a punishment. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that in this Kings dayes <hi>Io. Cremensis</hi> a Priest Cardinal, by the Kings licence came into <hi>England,</hi> and held a solemne Synode at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> where hauing most sharpely enueighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the marriage of Priests, the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee was taken in adulterie, and so with shame departed the Realme. It is certaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that <hi>Anselme,</hi> the most earnest enforcer of single life, died not a Virgine; as by the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which hee wrote for the losse thereof it may appeare.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Anselme</hi> died, being of the age of 70. yeeres. He had bestowed much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on <hi>Christs</hi> Church in <hi>Canterburie;</hi> as well in buildings, as in ornaments, and encrease of possessions. Other workes of charge he left not many; neither in very deed could he, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his often banishments, and the seasures of the reuenues of his Church. But this he did more then liberally supply by the eternall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his penne. After his decease the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishopricke remained voyd fiue yeeres: during
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:4099:150"/>
which time, the King applied the fruits to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The like hee did to other vacant Churches; and compounded also with Priests for reteining their wiues; and made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by Ecclesiasticall persons and liuings, more largely and freely then he had done before. For which cause it is not vnlike that the imputation of couetousnesse was fixed vpon him. At the last <hi>Radulph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> was aduanced to the See of <hi>Canterburie;</hi> and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all former agreements and decrees, the King inuested him with Ring and with Staffe.</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer we may either excuse or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the two vices of crueltie and couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherewith he is charged, his immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate excesse in lust can no wayes be denied, no wayes defended: And when age had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated in him the heat of that humour, yet was hee too much pleased with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his youthfull follies. For this vice it is manifest, as well by the sudden and vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate losse of his children, as for that he was the last King by descent from males of the <hi>Norman</hi> race, that the hand of God pressed hard vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Radulph</hi> succeeded <hi>Anselme</hi> in the See of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:4099:150"/>
               <hi>Canterburie.</hi> So after the death of <hi>Thomas, Thurstine</hi> the Kings Chapplaine was elected Archb. of <hi>Yorke.</hi> And because he refused to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge obedience to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> hee could not haue his Consecration, but was depriued of his dignitie by the King. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he tooke his iourney to <hi>Rome,</hi> complained to the Pope, and from him returned with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King: that the putting of a Bishop elect from his Church, without iudgement, was against diuine Iustice, against the decrees of holy Fathers: that the Pope intended no preiudice to either Church, but to maintaine the constitution which <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> the Apostle of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, had stablished betweene them: that the Bishop elect should be receiued to his Church, and if any question did rise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Churches, it should be handled before the King.</p>
            <p>Vpon occasion of this letter a solemne as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly was called at <hi>Salisburie,</hi> where the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance betweene the two Prelats was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. <hi>Radulph</hi> would not giue Imposition of hands to <hi>Thurstine,</hi> vnlesse hee would professe obedience. <hi>Thurstine</hi> said, that he would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace his benediction, but professe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:4099:151"/>
to him he would not. The King signified to <hi>Thurstine,</hi> that without acknowledgement of subiection to the Archb. of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> hee should not be Consecrated Archb. of <hi>Yorke. Thurstine</hi> replied nothing; but renounced his dignitie, and promised to make no more claime vnto it.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Calixtus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled a Councell at <hi>Rhemes;</hi> and <hi>Thurstine</hi> desired licence of the King to goe to that Councell. This hee obtained vnder faithfull promise, that he should there attempt nothing to the preiudice of the Church of <hi>Canterburie.</hi> In the meane time the King dealt secretly with the Pope, that <hi>Thurstine</hi> should not bee conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by him. This the Pope did faithfully assure; and yet by meanes of some of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, whom <hi>Thurstine</hi> had wrought to bee suiters for him; by reason also of his hate against <hi>Radulph,</hi> for taking Inuestiture from the King; The Pope was drawen to giue him consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there with the Pall. For this cause the King was displeased with <hi>Thurstine,</hi> and forbad him to returne into the Realme.</p>
            <p>After this, the Pope came to <hi>Gisors,</hi> to which place the King went vnto him; and desired
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:4099:151"/>
that he would not send any Legates into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> except the King should so require. The reason was, for that certaine Legates had come into <hi>England</hi> lately before, to wit, one <hi>Guid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and another named <hi>Anselme,</hi> and another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Peter;</hi> who had demeaned themselues, not as Pillars of the Church, but as Pillagers of all the Realme. Also he required that hee might reteine all such customes, as his auncestors had vsed in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Normandie.</hi> The Pope vpon promise that the King should ayd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his enemies, yeelded to these demands: and required againe of the King, to permit <hi>Thurstine</hi> to returne with his fauour into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The King excused himselfe by his oath. The Pope answered, that he might and would dispence with him for his oath. The King cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued respite, affirming that he would aduise with his Counsaile, and then signifie to the Pope what he should resolue. So in short time hee declared to the Pope, that for loue to him, <hi>Thurstine</hi> should bee receiued both into the Realme and to his Church: vpon condition, that he should professe subiection to the Sea of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> as in former times his predecessors had done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwise (said hee) so long as I
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:4099:152"/>
shall bee King of <hi>England,</hi> hee shall neuer sit Archb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>shop of <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The yeere following the Pope directed his letters to the King, and likewise to <hi>Radulph.</hi> And herewith he interdicted both the Church of <hi>Canterburie</hi> and the Church of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with all the Parish Churches of both Prouinces; from Diuine seruice, from Buriall of the dead, from all other offices of the Church; except onely baptizing of children, and absolution of those who shal lie at the point of death: vnlesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one moneth after the receit of the same let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Thurstine</hi> should be receiued to the Sea of <hi>Yorke,</hi> without acknowledging subiection to the Sea of <hi>Canterburie.</hi> It was further signified to the King, that he should also be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, vnlesse hee would consent to the same. Vpon these letters <hi>Thurstine</hi> was sent for, and reconciled to the King, and quietly placed in his Church at <hi>Yorke.</hi> And thus when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome had gained absolute superiority ouer the state of the Church, euen for mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging external actions and affaires (which seeme to be a part of ciuill gouernement) there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but either a weake Prince, or a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Nobilitie, or a headstrong tumultuous
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:4099:152"/>
people, to giue him absolute superioritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all.</p>
            <p>In the second yeere of this Kings reigne the Cities of <hi>Gloucester</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi> were for the most part wasted with fire.</p>
            <p>In the fourth yeere a blasing starre appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and foure circles were seene about the Sunne. The yeere next following the King preuailed much in <hi>Normandie,</hi> and so did the Sea in <hi>Flanders:</hi> insomuch as a great part of that Countrey lay buried in the waters.</p>
            <p>In the seuenth yeere a blazing starre appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and vpon thursday night before Easter, two full Moones were seene, one in the East, and the other in the West. The same yeere <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> was taken &amp; brought prisoner into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the tenth yeere the Abbey of <hi>Elie</hi> was made a Bishops Sea, and Cambridge shire was appointed for the Diocesse thereof. In regard whereof, the King gaue the mannour of <hi>Spal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> for that the shire of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was formerly vnder the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of <hi>Lincolne.</hi> The same yeere a Comet appeared after a strange fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. About <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> was a great earthquake. The water of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:4099:153"/>
               <hi>Trent</hi> was dried vp at <hi>Nottingham</hi> the space of a mile, from one of the clocke vntill three: so as men might passe ouer the Channell on foote. Warres ensued against the Earle of <hi>Aniou;</hi> a great mortalitie of men; a murraine of beastes both domesticke and of the fielde: yea, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>oules perished in great abundance.</p>
            <p>In the 13. yeere the Citie of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and therein the chiefe Church, the Castle, with much people were consumed with fire. A pigge was farrowed with a face like a childe. A chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken was hatched with foure legs. The yeere next ensuing the riuer of <hi>Medeway</hi> so fayled for many miles, that in the middest of the channell the smallest boates could not floate. In the <hi>Thames</hi> also was such defect of water, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Tower and the Bridge many men and children did wade ouer on foote. This happened by reason of a great ebbe in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, which layd the sands bare many miles from the shoare, and so continued one whole day. Much rage and violence of weather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, and a blasing starre. The Citie of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> with the principall Monastery was burnt. The yeere next following almost all the Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in <hi>England</hi> being then of timber, by reason
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:4099:153"/>
of a hard Winter were borne downe with Ice.</p>
            <p>In the 17. yeere the towne of <hi>Peterborough</hi> with the stately Church were burned to the ground. The Citie of <hi>Bath</hi> also was much rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and defaced with fire. In March there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened fearefull lightning, and in December grieuous thunder and haile. The Moone at both times seemed to be turned into blood, by reason of the euill qualited vapours through which it gaue light. The yeere following, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thild</hi> the Queene departed this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a woman in pietie, chastitie, modestie, and all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues nothing inferiour to her mother; but in learning and iudgement farre beyond her: who did not act, nor speake, nor scarce thinke any thing, but first it was weighed by wisdome and vertue. When the king desired her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for the publicke good and tranquilitie of the State, in reducing the <hi>Saxon</hi> blood to the Crowne; she first modestly, then earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the offer; shewing no lesse magnanimitie in despising honours, then others doe in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them. But when she was not so much perswaded as importuned to forsake her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, she is reported by some to haue taken the matter so to heart, that she cursed such issue
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:4099:154"/>
as she should bring forth: which curse did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards lie heauie vpon them. For her sonne <hi>William</hi> perished by shipwrack, and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Matild</hi> was neuer voyd of great vexations. As she trauailed ouer the riuer of <hi>Lue,</hi> at the <hi>Old-foord</hi> neere <hi>London,</hi> she was well washed, and somewhat endangered in her passage: whereupon he caused two Stone-bridges to be built ouer the same riuer, one at the head of the towne of <hi>Stratford,</hi> the other ouer another streame thereof, commonly called <hi>Channels<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi> and paued the way betweene them with grauel. She gaue also certaine mannours, and a mill called <hi>Wiggon</hi> mill, for repairing of the same bridges and way. These were the first Stone-bridges that were made in <hi>England.</hi> And because they were arched like a bow, the towne of <hi>Stratford</hi> was afterwards called <hi>Bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 20. yere, a great earthquake hapned, in the moneth of September. In the 22. yeere, the Citie of <hi>Glocester,</hi> with the principal Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie was fired againe. The yeere next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Citie of <hi>Lincolne</hi> was for the most part burned downe, and many persons perished with the rage of the flame. In the 27. yeere, the King receiued an oath of the chiefe of the

Prelats and Nobilitie of the Realme; that after his death, they should maintaine the kingdom against al men for his daughter <hi>Matild,</hi> in case she should suruiue, and the king not leaue issue male in life.</p>
            <p>In the 30. yeere, the Citie of <hi>Rochester</hi> was much defaced with fire, euen in the presence and view of the King. The yeere next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oath to <hi>Matild</hi> was receiued againe. About this time the King was much troubled with fearefull dreames; which did so affright him, that he would often leape out of his bed, and lay hand on his sword, as if it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe. This yeere as he returned out of <hi>Normandie</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> when he had bene caried not farre from land, the winde began to rise, and the Sea swelled somewhat bigge. This weather did almost suddenly encrease to so dangerous a storme, that all expected to be cast away. The King, dismayed the more by his sonnes mishap, reconciled himselfe to God; and vowed to reforme many errours of his life, if he did escape. So after his arriuall, he went to the Monasterie of <hi>S Edmund;</hi> and there both rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and renued the promise he had made. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he was better ordered in his actions; he
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:4099:155"/>
erected a Bishopricke at <hi>Caerlile,</hi> and endowed it with many honours: he caused Iustice indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently to be administred; and eased the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the tribute called <hi>Dane-guilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 32. yeere, <hi>Matilde</hi> daughter to the King was deliuered of a sonne, who was named <hi>Henry.</hi> Hereupon the king assembled his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie at <hi>Oxeford,</hi> where he did celebrate his feast of Easter; and there ordeined, that shee and her heires should succeed him in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And albeit they were often sworne to this appointment; albeit <hi>Stephen</hi> Earle of <hi>Bloise</hi> was the first man who tooke that oath: yet was he the first who did rise against it; yet did many others also ioyne with him in his action. For oathes are commonly troden vnder foote, when they lye in the way, either to honour or reuenge. The same yeere the Citie of <hi>London</hi> was very much defaced with fire.</p>
            <p>The yeere next following, many prodigies happened, which seemed to portend the death of the King, or rather the troublesome times which did thereupon ensue. In the moneth of August, the Sunne was so deepely eclipsed, that by reason of the darkenesse of the ayre, many starres did plainely appeare. The second
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:4099:155"/>
day after this defect of light, the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with so great violence, that many buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings were shaken downe. <hi>Malmesb.</hi> sayth, that the house wherein he sate, was lift vp with a double remooue, and at the third time setled againe in the proper place. The earth in diuers places yeelded foorth a hideous noyse; It cast foorth flames at certaine rifts diuers dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which neither by water nor by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes could be suppressed.</p>
            <p>During the time of the eclipse mentioned before, the King was trauersing the sea into <hi>Normandie;</hi> whither hee vsually went, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times euery yeere, but euery third yeere at the furthest. Here he spent the whole yeere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in ordering affaires of State, and in visiting euery corner of the Countrey. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer gaue greater contentment to the people, as well by his gifts, as by his gentle and courteous behauiour: he neuer receiued greater content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them, by the liuely expressing of their loue. But nothing did so much affect him with ioy, as that his daughter <hi>Matild</hi> had brought foorth other two sonnes, <hi>Geoffrey</hi> and <hi>William<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whereby hee conceiued, that the succession of his issue to the Crowne of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:4099:156"/>
was so well backed, that he needed not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his thoughts with any feare that his heires would faile.</p>
            <p>At the last he began to languish a little and droupe in health; and neither feeling nor fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any great cause, hee rode on hunting, to passe it ouer with exercise and delight. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being somewhat cheered, hee returned home, and eate of a Lamprey, albeit against his Physicians aduise; which meate he alwayes loued, but was neuer able well to digest. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, and happely vpon this vicious feeding, he fell into a feuer; which increased in him by such dangerous degrees, that within seuen dayes it led him to the period of his life. Hee died vpon the first of December, in the 67. yere of his age: when hee had reigned 35. yeeres and foure moneths, wanting one day. His bowels and eyes were buried at <hi>Roan:</hi> The rest of his bodie was stuffed with salt, wrapped vp in Oxe hides, and brought ouer into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and with honourable exequies buried in the Monastery of <hi>Reading,</hi> which hee had founded. His Physician who tooke out his braines, by reason of the intolerable stinch which breathed from them, in short time after
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:4099:156"/>
ended his life. So of all that King <hi>Henrie</hi> slue, this Physician was the last.</p>
            <p>He had by his first wife a sonne named <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> who perished by shipwracke; and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tild</hi> a daughter, who was espoused to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henrie</hi> the 5. when she was scarce sixe yeeres olde, and at the age of eleuen yeeres was married vnto him. When shee had been married vnto him twelue yeeres, he died; and shee returned to the King her father, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her owne minde, and against the desire of the greatest Princes of the Empire: who in regard of her wise and gracious behauiour, were suitors to the King more then once, to haue her remaine as Empresse among them. But the king would not consent to their intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: For that shee was the onely heire to his Crowne. Then many great Princes desired her in marriage. But the King bestowed her vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> sonne to <hi>Fulke</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou:</hi> somewhat against her owne liking, but greatly to the suretie of his estate in <hi>France.</hi> By him she had <hi>Henrie,</hi> who afterwards was King of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, the King had by a Concubine, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> a sonne, and <hi>Mary</hi> a daughter; who were
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:4099:157"/>
lost vpon the sea with their brother <hi>William.</hi> By another Concubine hee had a sonne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Robert,</hi> whom he created Earle of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester:</hi> a man for valour of minde and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of bodie inferiour to none; in counsailes so aduised, as was fit for a right Noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. By his faith, industrie, and felicitie chiefly, his sister <hi>Matild</hi> did afterwards resist and ouerbeare, both the forces and fortunes of King <hi>Stephen.</hi> He is reported to haue had 12. other bastards; which were of no great either note or continuance, according to that saying of the Wise man: <hi>Bastard plants take no deepe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sapien. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>rootes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This King in the beginning of his Reigne made many fauourable lawes: And namely, <hi>That he would reserue no possessions of the Church vpon their vacancies: that the heires of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie should possesse their fathers lands without redemption from him, and that the Nobilitie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise should afford the like fauour to their Tenants: that Gentlemen might giue their daughters and kinsewomen in marriage without his licence, so it were not to his enemie: that the widow should haue her ioynture and not be compelled to marrie against her owne liking: that the mother or next of kinred</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:4099:157"/>
               <hi>should bee Guardian of the lands of her children: that all debts to the Crowne and certaine offences also should bee remitted.</hi> But these lawes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were but slenderly obserued.</p>
            <p>Three vertues were most famous in him; wisedome, courage, and sweetenesse of speach. By the last hee gained much fauour from the people. By the other two he purchased, both peace at home, and victory abroad. He was noted also for some vices: but out of doubt they were farre exceeded by his vertues. And for these vices also, being himselfe of a pleasant disposition, he was well pleased with pleasant reproofes. <hi>Guymund</hi> his Chapleine (obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that vnworthy men for the most part were aduanced to the best dignities of the Church) as he celebrated Diuine seruice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and was to read these words out of <hi>S. Iames; [It rained not vpon the earth iij. yeres and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>vj. moneths:</hi>] Hee did read it thus: [<hi>It rained not vpon the earth one, one, one yeres, and fiue, one, moneths.</hi>] The King obserued this reading, and afterwards rebuked his Chapleine for it: But <hi>Guymund</hi> answered, that he did it of purpose, for that such readers were soonest preferred by the King. The King smiled, and in short time after
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:4099:158"/>
preferred him to the gouernment of <hi>S. Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swides</hi> in <hi>Oxeford.</hi> In this King failed the heires male of King <hi>William</hi> the first: and then the Crowne was possessed by Title of heires ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>In these times flourished two excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Church; <hi>Anselme</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> both of them enrolled in the list of Saints. And no lesse infamous for vice was <hi>Gerard,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke;</hi> a man of some learning; not so much in substance, as in seeming and shew; of commendable wit, which he applied chiefly, to giue a couler for euery vice of his owne, and for euery vertue of others either a slander or a ieast: Of enuious disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; plagued lesse with his owne calamities, then with the well either doing or being of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; in wiping money from his Subiects by dishonest meanes, subtill and shamelesse; and no lesse sordide in his expences: giuen to Magicall enchantments as many doe affirme. On a certaine day as he slept vpon a cushion after dinner, in his Garden at <hi>Southwell,</hi> and many of his Chapleines walked neere him; he was found in such a stiffe cold dead sleepe, as will require the trumpe of an Archangel to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:4099:158"/>
him. His face then looked with an ougly hell-burnt hue. His body was caried to <hi>Yorke;</hi> few vouchsafing to accompany, none to meete it (according to the vse of Exequies) when it came to the Citie; but the boyes in scorne throwing stones at the hearse. He was basely buried without the Church; without any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall solemnities, without any signe either of honour or of griefe.</p>
