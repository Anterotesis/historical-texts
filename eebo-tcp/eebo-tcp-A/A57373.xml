         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that his dead body was thence stollen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, though Christ revived and risen, stood close by her; and why? Christ was present, but she did not know him. So if we be close by the <hi>Well of grace,</hi> if <hi>Christ be present with us, yea, in us,</hi> if yet we know it not, we are still in our discomforts, our teares and sorrows are still flowing. <hi>David</hi> was told by the Prophet, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 12 13.</note>

                  <hi>for us, that we might live by him:</hi> may be a first Signe of Gods love to us. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 16. <hi>In this was manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Sonne into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our sinnes,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 9, 10. Hence when actually we live through Christ, we actually taste Gods free love in Christ.</p>
               <p>Gods speciall love acts towards his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones, chiefly three waies, (1.) In electing them before all time, <hi>elect of God, holy and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Col. 3. 12. which is more peculiarly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. (2.) In redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in fulnesse of time, which is more peculiarly attributed to the Son, <hi>Ioh. 15. 12, 13. Gal. 2. 20. Rev.</hi> 1. 5. (3.) In immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate applying of Christ unto them in due time by sanctification, effectuall calling, &amp;c. and this is more peculiarly given to the Holy Ghost, <hi>Tit. 3. 4, 5. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 2. And in every of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46248:23"/>
these acts of love, God comes neerer and closer unto his, The Fathers love in electing, is love intended, and purposed; this is most remote: The Sonnes love in redeeming, is love actually demonstrated to the world; this is neerer: but the Holy Ghosts love in sanctifying, &amp;c. is love effectually and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly applyed to individuall persons; this is most neare. Would we know our interest in the Fathers electing love? consider what part we have in the Sonnes redeeming love: would we discover our share in the Sonnes redeeming love? then let us accurately search what right and property we have in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits sanctifying love; when we spiritually live from the Father through the Sonne by the Spirit, then God gives us a taste of his love experimentally.</p>

this love of God to us. <hi>This is that which I said before, that God loves us more, then a Father his Sonne. Verily the thing is evident, that God loves us above the affection of sonnes, who for our sakes hath not spared his Sonne. And what adde I further? and this a just Son, and this an only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne, and this Son God, And what can be said more? and this for us; that is, for evill ones; for most wicked ones; for unrighteous ones. Who can estimate this love of God towards us, but that the justice of God is such, that no unjust thing can be incident unto him? For so far as humane reason may judge, any man had done an unjust thing, if for the worst servants he should haveput to death a good Sonne. So that in this the piety of God is more inestimable, and in this the vertue of God is more admirable, that so the greatnesse of his justice cannot by man be understood: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as to the apprehension of humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity, the greatnesse of his justice seemes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to have a shew of in justice.</hi> So he.</p>

For, 1. The love of the Father and the love of the world are sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant and inconsistent one with another, <hi>Iam. 44. Matth.</hi> 6. 24. 2. The love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of the world, do each of them so forcibly exhaust and draw out the whole heart, that it is impossible that these two loves should at one and the same time in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense degrees, dwell in one and the same heart.

                  <hi>Answ. Faith</hi> or <hi>believing</hi> as it relates to Christ, hath especially two primary and most remarkable acts, <hi>viz, Assenting</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying.</hi> 1. The <hi>Assenting</hi> act of faith, is, that whereby faith assents to Gods whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Record touching Jesus Christ, as true, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 10, 11. viz.</hi> That this Jesus which is revealed so fully to us in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in his Person and Offices, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>the Christ,</hi> the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed of God, that was fore-promised, fore-prophesied of, and prefigured under all

periods of the Old Testament, from the fall of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> to the fulnesse of time for the incarnation of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> to be the only Mediatour betwixt God and man, and Saviour of the world. This some call <hi>Dogmaticall faith,</hi> some <hi>Historical faith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it barely and precisely entertaines the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>History</hi> of Scripture as Truth: without any particular appropriation of any thing of Christ to them that so believe. Now this bare &amp; naked <hi>assenting</hi> act of faith, cannot be a character of Regeneration, nor the faith here intended. For, (1.) Hypocrites may assent to the truth of the Record which God hath given touching Christ. For we read often of the faith of such, as, <hi>Luk. 8. 13. Acts</hi> 8 13. which believing of theirs, was at least an <hi>Assent;</hi> for Assent to truth revealed, is the least and lowest act of faith. (2.) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils may <hi>assent</hi> to this truth Dogmatically, <hi>That Iesus is the Christ;</hi> yea, they have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it, and known it to be so. See <hi>Mar. 1. 24. Luke</hi> 4. 34, 41. Yet nor Hypocrites, nor devils are regenerate. 2. The <hi>Apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> act of faith is, that whereby faith ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving assented to the truth of all Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord touching Christ, proceeds to apply and appropriate all particularly to a mans self, as did <hi>Paul; Who loved me, and gave himself for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. and <hi>Thomas; My Lord, and my God,</hi> John 20. 28.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The habit of this faith is infused into the soul by God in Regeneration, <hi>Eph. 2. 8. Iohn.</hi> 1. 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This habit infused is brought into act by the <hi>Fathers drawing</hi> the soul to Christ. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 44. This <hi>drawing</hi> is effected, 1. By
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46248:33"/>
discovering the <hi>necessity</hi> of Christ to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 11, 12. 2. By displaying the <hi>sufficiency</hi> and alluring Excellency of Christ for salvation, <hi>Heb. 7. 25. Cant.</hi> 5. 10. to the end. 3. By manifesting the <hi>possibility</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Christ and salvation by him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. 4. By propounding the <hi>willingnesse</hi> and readinesse of God and Christ to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poor sinners, <hi>Matth. 11. 28, 29. Iohn 7. 37. Isaiah 55. 1. Iohn 6. 37. Luke</hi> 15. 20. to the end. 5. By disclosing the <hi>invaluable happinesse</hi> in gaining Christ, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 12. Iohn</hi> 3. 16, 18, 36. And, 6. By stirring up <hi>ardent strong desires</hi> in the heart after Christ, that the soul is restlessely thirsting, till he be obtained, <hi>Isa. 55. 1. Iohn</hi> 7. 37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith thus infused and acted, is perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to accept Christ upon his own termes, <hi>viz. self-denyal, bearing the Crosse, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Christ,</hi> and actually accepts him, <hi>Luk. 9. 23. Iohn</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith having received Christ, <hi>tastes</hi> such sweetnesse and <hi>pleasantnesse</hi> in him, that Christ is most <hi>precious</hi> to the soule, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 3, 7. and all things in the world are but <hi>losse and dung unto him,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. Oh, how is the soul <hi>filled with joy and peace in believing!</hi> Rom. 15. 13. and 5. 1. and so it <hi>sits down under Christs shadow with great delight, and his fruit is sweet unto its taste,</hi> Cant. 2. 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Faith having thus taken and tasted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46248:33"/>
Christ notably enlivens and quickens the soule, that not so much the Believer lives, as Christ by faith lives in the Believer, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Rom. 1. 17. Hab.</hi> 2. 4. Christ principally knows, wills, loves, prayes, and in a word per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes all spiritual motions in him. <hi>Oh that's a sweet life indeed, whereof Christ is both Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to give it, and Pilot to guide it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Faith having enlivened the soul by Christ, it notably puts forth it self in vital operations from Christ. For true living faith, is a working and fruit-bearing faith, as <hi>Iames</hi> demonstrates, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 14, to the end. Now faiths principal acts are these. 1. Cleansing and purifying the heart from all inward fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, so as not to approve it, or mingle with it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. 2. Calming and pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conscience, as once Christ said to the windes and waves, so faith in Christ saith to the troubled and perplexed soul, <hi>Peace and be still, and there is a great calme,</hi> Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3. Phil. 4. 7. 3. Acting and working by love, with a chearful respect and delightful enlargement to all Gods Commandements. <hi>Gal. 5. 6. 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally, Faith having attained to this spiritual strength and activity, contends af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fuller perfection, even after a <hi>full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,—</hi>Col. 2. 2. Heb. 10 22. Heb. 6. 11, 18, 19. which <hi>full-assurance</hi> is obtained by faith's reflecting upon its own acts, and seeing it self believe, <hi>I know whom I have

               <p>
                  <hi>But every regenerate man,</hi> whilest such, still sins against the Gospel-remedy, J. Christ, in not accepting him for salvation, <hi>Iohn. 1. 11, 12, 13.

                  <hi>But unregenerate persons are wont to sin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46248:42"/>
whereupon he encourages himselfe to go on in wayes of sin, (2.) Securely, (3.) Wilfully, (4.) Haughtily, &amp; (5.) Contemptuously against God; his Word, and judgements; it seems to be made up principally of these five ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens, which lively also describe unto us the way of sin which unregenerate men u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually walk in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Self-confidence</hi> of a mans safe and good estate present or future; <hi>The wicked flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth himselfe in his owne eyes,</hi> Psal. 36. 1, 2. <hi>Certain that trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others.—God I thanke thee that I am not as other men are,</hi> Luk. 18. 9, 11, 12. <hi>And it come to passe when he heareth the words of this curse, that he blesse himselfe in his heart, saying, I shall have heace, though I walke in the imagination of mine heart to add drunknes to thirst,—</hi>Deut. 29. 19, 20. This vaine self-confidence usually ariseth from abuse of Gods patience and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiall goodnesse and blessings: <hi>Because they have no changes, therefore they feare not God,</hi> Psal. 55. 19. <hi>And</hi> Ephraim <hi>said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance;</hi> in <hi>all my labours they shall finde none iniquity in me, that</hi> were <hi>sin,</hi> Hos. 12. 8. <hi>The wicked live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old, yea, are mighty in power. Their seed is established in their sight with them,—&amp;c. Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes. What is the Almighty, that we should
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46248:42"/>
serve him? and what profit should we have if we pray unto him?</hi> Job. 21. 7, to 16. See also <hi>Psal. 73. 7, 8, 9, 12. Luk.</hi> 12. 16, to 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Security.</hi> From self-confidence it is that they go on securely without remorse or feare in wayes of sin. <hi>Soule, thou hast much goods laid up for many yeares, eate, drink, and be meary,</hi> Luk. 12. 19. <hi>The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,</hi> that there is <hi>no feare of God before his eyes,—</hi>Psal. 36. 1, 2. <hi>Come ye,</hi> say they, <hi>I will fetch wine, and we will fill our selves with strong drinke, and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> Isai. 56. 12. <hi>Let us eate and drinke, for to morow we die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 32. Thus they that sinne presumptuously, sinne secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Wilfulnesse, obstinacy, resolvednesse in sin,</hi> is another poyson wherewith presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wicked men is tempered. <hi>They that will be rich,—</hi>1 Tim. 6. 9 <hi>We will not have this man to reigne over us,</hi> Luk. 19. 14, 27. <hi>As for the word that thou hast spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth out of our owne mouth,—</hi>Jer. 44. 17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Pride and haughtinesse</hi> also is intwisted in presumption. Wicked men sin proudly, disdainfully, with an high hand and much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency; <hi>Who is the Lord,</hi> said <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46248:43"/>
5. 2. <hi>Who is the Almighty that we should serve him?</hi> said those wretches, <hi>Iob. 21. 15. Their tongue speakes proud things. Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail, our lips</hi> are <hi>our owne, who</hi> is <hi>Lord over us?</hi> Psal. 12. 3, 4. <hi>They speake wickedly concerning oppression, they speake loftily, they set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.—Behold, these are the ungodly who prosper in the world,—</hi>Psal. 73. 8, 9, 12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Finally, <hi>Contempt and contumacy against God, his Word, and judgments,</hi> is found in wicked mens presumption. <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked contemne God?</hi> Psalm. 10. 13. <hi>Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us,</hi> Psal. 2. 3. <hi>But unto the wicked God saith What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee?</hi> Psal. 50. 16, 17. Thus the unregenerate sin <hi>presumptuously, viz.</hi> Self-confidently, Securely, Wilffully, Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and Contumaciously against God. Yet these evils discover themselves more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably and remarkably in some unregenerate persons then in others. Whereas they that are <hi>borne of God</hi> do not thus commit sin, nor can sin.</p>

               <p>Now sin though it do <hi>[habitare]</hi> dwell in the regenerate, as <hi>Austin</hi> notes, yet it doth not <hi>[regnare,]</hi> reign over the regenerate. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. and 8. 2.</p>

                     <p>A Case of Conscience touching the <hi>Sinne against the Holy Ghost,</hi> what it is, and whether they that are born of God fall into it?</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But before we passe from this Character of them that are borne of God, (viz. <hi>That they do not commit sinne, nor can sinne;)</hi> to another: it may be very usefull to lend a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle help to the weake, timerous, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Christian, against that perplexing temptation, that would perswade him, that <hi>he hath sinned against the Holy Ghost.</hi>

I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against my light, and the checks of my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. (2.)

(which kils my soule.) (6.) under all this I find my heart as hard and obdurate as an Adamant, without all Repentance or remorse for all this. Have not I just cause to conclude that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I am an unregenerate Person?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Poor soul, forbear a little thy hard conceits of thy self, and suspend thy censures. They that have worst thoughts of themselves are not always in the worst conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards God. Every one that feares he hath <hi>sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the H. Ghost,</hi> must not presently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to have committed that horrid sin of sinnes. All this may arise, (1.) partly from thy weaknesse, not knowing either thy owne spirituall estate, or the nature of this sinne, truely and distinctly. And (2.) partly from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans wickednesse, abusing thy weaknesse, to make thee believe this of thy self, that so (if it were possible) he might drive thee to despaire. But credit neither thine owne weaknesse, nor Satans wickednesse, to the ruine of thy precious soule.</p>
               <p>For a more cleare and satisfactory resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this case, consider these particulars, 1. <hi>Who or what kind of persons are they that are in danger of sinning this sin against the Holy Ghost. 2. What this sin against the Holy Ghost is, and wherein it consists. 3. What a vast difference there is betwixt the sinnes or falls of a regenerate person yea, though against knowledge, and their sinnes, that sinne against the H.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doubtlesse those persons who are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regenerate and borne of God, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any of them sin the sin against the Holy Ghost, nor can so sin. True, 1. They may commit such sins against light of minde and checks of conscience sometimes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 19. They may possibly have such blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and wicked suggestions darted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected into their thoughts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 3, 6, 9. They may perhaps fal from their first love, <hi>Rev:</hi> 2. 4. Yea, fall so fearfully, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did. Yea, it may be they may perceive such hard-heartednesse and impenitency upon their soules notwithstanding all this, for a season; that from all these (Satan also sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly taking advantage thereby) they may have sad apprehensions and feares that they have fallen into the very <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost.</hi> 2. They also that are borne of God, as they have the root of all <hi>actual</hi> sin still in them, <hi>viz. Original corruption</hi> dwelling in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46248:51"/>
them, <hi>Psalm. 51. 5. Rom.</hi> 7. 17, 18, 21, 23, 24 so they have the very roote of this sin against the H. Ghost in particular in them; originall sin being the proper seed, spawne and fountaine of this sin as well as of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatsoever. How humbly, vigilantly, and cautiously therefore should all Gods people walke before God, seeing this dangerous principle of originall corruption still sticks in their hearts!</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithstanding, persons truly borne of God never actually fall into this sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Ghost, nor (all things well considered) can do. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Holy Ghost himselfe in Scripture plainly testifies that the regenerate sin not this great sin.—<hi>There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. All unrighteousnesse is sin, and there is a sin not unto death. We know that whosoever is borne of God sinneth not, [viz,</hi> as Tertullian <note n="t" place="margin"> Scimus aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod omnis qui exDeo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sit non delinquit <hi>scilicet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod ad mortem est.</hi> Tertul. <hi>lib</hi> de Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicitâ, <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</note> notes, not this sin unto death,] <hi>but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himselfe, and that wicked one toucheth him not, 1 Iohn.</hi> 5. 16, 17, 18. In these and the two precedent verses the Apostle asserts more generally the priviledge of believers in the point of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>viz.</hi> confidence in Christ, that they shall have whatsoever they ask according to Gods will, vers. 14, 15. This done, he more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly accmmodates this their priviledge, declaring how prevalent their prayer shall be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46248:52"/>
in particular for a lapsed brother, to obtain life and pardon for him, <hi>verse</hi> 16. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular case of praying for a lapsed brother, is further amplified three wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> By a Distinction, a Caution, and a Cnofirmation of it. <hi>By a Distinction</hi> betwixt sin and sin, that a believer may know what sin he may pray for pardon of, according to Gods will, so as to speed.

                     <hi>Calvin</hi> much more judiciously, <hi>He toucheth him not lethally, mortally.</hi> The regenerate is not quite exempted from Satans <hi>wounding-touch,</hi> but by the shield of faith he guards himself from the <hi>mortall killing touch,</hi> that he is not <hi>stabbed to the heart.</hi> Whence is it that he is thus preserved? <hi>He keepeth himselfe,</hi> nay, God keeps him, as Christ prayed, <hi>Iohn 17. 11. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. Else wo, wo to every Christian, were he is own keeper. <hi>He keeps himself from this sinne, whilest God keeps him;</hi> for he acts meerely in Gods strength, and no further. Thus the H. Ghost plainly testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that they that are borne of God sin not this sin to death. Make but sure to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that thou art borne of God, and this may encourage thee against thy trembling apprehensions that thou hast sinned against the H. Ghost.</p>

2. Should it come to passe that the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate might sin against the H. Ghost, then they might totally and finally fall away from God: But that any regenerate person should totally and finally fall away is as impossible; as that Gods Covenant, promises, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse should faile; or that Gods Spirit, grace, and power preserving them should be overcome, (as was before cleared) or that Gods immutable decree for their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be shaken or overthrown, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that are regenerate shall never come into condemnation. <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the Law of the Spirit of life hath made them free from the law of sin and death,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shall never fall into the sin against the H.

                  <p n="2">2. Questionlesse those persons have not sinned the sin against the H. Ghost, who are perplexed, troubled, and afraid that they have fallen into it.

                        <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> observes, That the <hi>Sadduces</hi> denied the Holy Ghost; That the <hi>Arrians, Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> contended, that the Holy Ghost was a creature, not a Creator: That the <hi>Sabellians</hi> (called also <hi>Patripassians,</hi> because they held that the Father suffered) deny the Trinity, assert only the Father, that he is sometimes called the Son, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Holy Ghost: That the <hi>Photinians,</hi> denying the Trinity, say the Father onely is God, the Son onely man, but deny the Holy Ghost altogether.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Not every sin against knowledge</hi> is that sin against the Holy Ghost.

within, may sometimes so farre be borne down as to do those things which they know they should not do, as in <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 19. 20, 23. In <hi>Peter,</hi> he knew he ought not to deny his Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and resolved peremptorily the contrary, but sudden feare prevailed over him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 69, to the end. In <hi>David,</hi> he knew he should not commit adultery, nor kill; yet strength of corruption and temptation push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him upon both; yet none of these sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost. 2. Sins against knowledge admit both of repentance and pardon, as in all these three cases men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; <hi>David</hi> pardoned, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 13. Peter</hi> restored after his bitter tears; by a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold feare he denied Christ, by a threefold love he confessed Christ, <hi>Matth. 26. last. Iohn. 21. 15, &amp;c. Paul</hi> delivered from his body of death by Jesus Christ his Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25. 3. Besides, <hi>sinning against knowledge and illumination,</hi> divers other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full poysons are complicated and contained in the sin against the H.

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Not every sinning against the Truth of Christ and the Gospel,</hi> is the sin against the Holy Ghost.

Divers have sinned against the truth, yea, sometimes against fundamentals, and yet are not challenged to have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Ghost, but were accounted as of the visible Church; as those in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that denied the resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. And those in the Church of <hi>Porgamus,</hi> that <hi>held the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam, <hi>and the Doctrine of the</hi> Nicolaitanes: Yet are not counted hopelesse, but invited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of these damnable opinions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. The Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> were fearfully tainted with that dangerous error of the necessity of the workes of the Law to Justification, as well as of Faith; which gave occasion to <hi>Paul</hi> of writing that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Epistle to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, &amp;c. 2. 16. &amp;c. 3. 1, &amp;c. Yea, the very Apostles themselves had an erroneous opinion about Christs temporall Kingdome, and that till after his resurrection, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6. 3.

                     <p>Thus that judicious <note n="*" place="margin">Calv. in Comment. in Heb. 10. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Calvia,</hi> understands the Apostle here, not of some <hi>Particular,</hi> but of an <hi>Universall</hi> defection; the Faith of Christ, and grace of Christ being wholly cast off. And elsewhere he saith <note n="*" place="margin">Notan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est duplicem esse lapsum: alter est Particularis, alter universal is. Qui in specie aliqua, ut etiam pluribus modis deliquit, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani hominis, statu lapsus est. Itaqne omnla peccata totidem sunt lapsus.

there is a double falling-away,</hi> Particular <hi>and</hi> universall. <hi>He that in any kind, or seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wayes offends; he fals from the state of a Christian man, therefore all sins are so manyfals.

And that this may be the better understood, the Antithesis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the graces reckoned up, and this falling away, is to be observed.

10. 29. Matth. 12. How should such sinners ever be redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, or saved, that thus sin against the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? unbelief and impenitency are sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel-Remedy, but not aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with that obstinacy and maliciousnesse, as this sin is. That Patient that is so farre from applying, that he hates and abhorres the Remedy that should cure him, flings the Physick to the ground, curses and reviles the Physician, yea, and treads him under foot; is he ever likely to be cured?

Hence, <hi>This sin never is, never can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be repented of.</hi> So the Apostle tells us, <hi>For it is impossible for those who were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,—if they shall fall away, to renew them againe unto repentance,</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. As if he should say, It is impossible for such Apostates to repent. Note, he saith not, <hi>It is improbable, unlikely,</hi> or <hi>difficult</hi> for them to repent: but <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>It is impossible to renew them to repentance.</hi> To whom is it impossible? (1.) <hi>Impossible to themselves,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new themselves, for if carnall men that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thus relapsed, cannot renew themselves, no more then a blackamore can change his skin, and the leopard his spots, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible a bad tree should bring forth good fruit; how much lesse can such Apostates renew themselves to repentance?

They are but instruments, planting, watering, only God gives the increase. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. Only God gives Repentance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. Yea, 3. <hi>Impossible</hi> (in some sense) <hi>unto God himselfe,</hi> as some thinke; not through any impotency in God, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his infinite justice, which cannot chuse but take vengeance of such heynous and malicious offenders. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gives two great Reasons of the <hi>impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of such back-sliders <hi>Repentance.</hi> 1. From the atrocity and grievousnesse of the sin committed, <hi>viz.</hi> a sin of extreame malice against Jesus Christ, <hi>Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</hi> Which words have been formerly explained, <hi>p. 112, &amp;c.</hi> 2. From the just judgement of God inflicted upon them, set forth under the metaphor of good and bad ground; <hi>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God. But that which beareth thornes and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned,</hi> Heb. 6. 6, 7, 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> As an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman that tils, manures, waters, plants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes much cost and pains upon ground, and after all it brings forth nothing but bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; thorns; nettles, weeds, &amp;c. he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46248:81"/>
bestow more cost upon it, its worthy to be cursed, and burnt up: so after God hath by his Gospel-ordinances bestowed much husbandry upon men, and afforded them also many heavenly influences, <hi>viz.</hi> common gifts &amp; graces of his Spirit, &amp; they notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bring forth nothing but thornes and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars of this cursed Apostasie, God will give them up to finall impenitency and hardnesse of heart, to their own Destruction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence, <hi>This sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable.</hi> So Christ tells us, <hi>The blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, neither in this world, neither in the world to come,</hi> Matth. 12. 32. that is, as <hi>Mark</hi> expresseth it, <hi>He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> Mark. 3. 29. This sin is Unpardonable, not as if it were in its own nature beyond Gods pardoning mercy, or beyond Christs purging merit, both which are infinite: but because it is alwayes accompanied with <hi>finall impenitency,</hi> and therefore God will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his pardon, Christ will not apply his merit. To like effect the Apostle saith, <hi>If we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</hi> Heb. 10. 26. This sins unpardonablenesse heightens this sins grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousnesse above all other sins in the world. What other sin but hath been repented of, and upon repentance pardoned? This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46248:82"/>
all <hi>Manasses</hi> sins, they were repented of, and pardoned; beyond all <hi>Sauls</hi> sins, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13, 16. Act.</hi> 26. 9, to 12. they were repented of, and pardoned; beyond their sins that murdered Christ through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for they repented and were forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 36, 37, 38, 41. but this shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hence, <hi>This sin is inevitably damnable.</hi> If this sin be never repented of, never pardoned, it must needs alwayes be punished with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and eternall death, and that inavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. <hi>He that shall blaspheme against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, hath never forgivenesse, but is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of eternall damnation,</hi> Mark. 3. 29. <hi>If we sin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins; But a certain fearefull looking for of judgement and fiery indignation which shall devour the Adversaries. He that despised</hi> Moses <hi>Law, dyed without mercy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c? Heb. 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. Here's, 1. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fiery indignation, and that devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea, much sorer punishment, then death without mercy; what can this be but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation? 2. Here's the certainty of it, and that without hopes, or place remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any more Sacrifice for sin; what is this but inevitable damnation? Hence such
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46248:82"/>
as sin against the Holy Ghost, are resembled to ground <hi>nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned,</hi> Heb. 6. 8. Thinke now sadly of the inevitablnesse of eternall damnation ever attending upon this sin, and then consider how grievous it must needs be.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hence, <hi>This sin is usually a most intolerable torture to the Conscience;</hi> This plainly flows fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the former. For this being (1.) The highest sin against the saving Remedy; (2.) Never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of; (3.) Unpardonable; &amp; (4.) Inevitably damnable; How can the concience, reflecting upon all this, chuse but be unspeakablytortured in this present world, with horrour, terrour, despaire and self-Confusion? Which the Apostle calls A <hi>certain fearfull looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries,</hi> Heb. 10. 27. Oh what a torment, what a rack, what an hell afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand is this to the Conscience, to think that Hell is inevitable, and yet intolerable? the furious horrour hereof made <hi>Iudas</hi> restlesse till he had hanged himselfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 1, to 7. Yea, sometimes the anguish and sting of Conscience is so intolerable, that they despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wish themselves in hell, that they might not be so overwhelmed with tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fears, but feele the worst; but alas! when they shall come into hell, <hi>their worme</hi> of Conscience <hi>will never dye,</hi> but fret and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

6. Finally, <hi>this sin is so heynous, that the pardon of it is not to be prayed for. There is a sin unto death</hi> (saith <hi>Iohn) I do not say ye shall pray for it,</hi> 1. Joh. 5. 16. And that sin which may not be prayed for, is counted desperate and past remedy; for Prayer is one reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: now the more remedilesse, the more grievous.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, must <hi>not be prayed for,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 16. But we ought to pray for all Regenerate persons, not withstanding their sins &amp; frailties which they are subject to, <hi>Iames 5. 16. 1 Ioh.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Finally, they that sin against the Holy Ghost, <hi>shall certainly and inevitably be condemned;</hi> as was proved.

                  <p>These and divers such like differences are very remarkable betwixt the <hi>sinning of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate persons,</hi> and their <hi>sinning that sin against the Holy Ghost:</hi> whereby truly Regenerate Persons may discern how far they are from sinning that great sin, notwithstanding all their feares and perplexities about it.

God hath no where promised to the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his servants an universall exemption from lesser or greater Errors. (2.) The best, and perfectest of Gods people in this life have remaining in themselves the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Error and Heresie, many reliques of darkenesse, weaknesse, instability, &amp;c, <hi>We know but in part.—We see through a glasse darkly,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9, 12. <hi>All men are lyars,</hi> Rom. 3. 4. 3. <hi>Unity of Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,</hi> or onenesse of Judgements in all points, is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among all the Members of Christs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body, <hi>till</hi> (as the Apostle intimates) <hi>we all come unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ,</hi> Ephes 4. 13.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Regenerate persons may perhaps for a time be insnared in some Errours that are more grosse and dangerous, and that against funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of faith.</hi> Christ and his Offices are fundamentals, 1. <hi>Cor. 3. 11. Eph.</hi> 2. 20. yet

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Though Gods people may fall into lesser, yea, sometimes into more grosse Errours for a time: yet there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Elect and the children of God, and unregenerate, carnall, or hypocriticall persons, in reference unto Erroneous opinions, and the embracing of them.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The true children of God are not so facile &amp; apt to be carried aside into Error in opinion, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against fundamentals, as carnall and hypocrites are apt to be.</hi> They are not so unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fickle, wavering, mutable, unsetled in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith and Religion, as carnall men are; not so easily tainted, and <hi>carried about with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wind of doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There shall arise false Christs and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders, insomuch that (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very Elect,</hi> Mat. 24. 24.

It is observable that when the Holy Ghost tells us, that <hi>All that dwell upon the Earth shall worship the Beast;</hi> yet the Elect are exempted. <hi>All shall worship,—whose names are not written in the Lambs book of life,</hi> Rev. 13. 8. And elsewhere <hi>Iohn</hi> testifieth clearly, <hi>They went out from us (viz.</hi> by embracing Antichristian doctrines, <hi>v. 18.) but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 19. And <hi>Paul</hi> testifying to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>that there must be</hi> (not only <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> but) <hi>also Heresies among them, that they which are approved may be made manifest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19. implyeth notably, That even in times and places wherein He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies abound, yet Gods <hi>approved ones</hi> will withstand and reject <hi>Heresies,</hi> when others will embrace them; and so the <hi>approved,</hi> of sound judgments, shall be <hi>manifested</hi> among all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Nor need this seem strange, that Gods elect children are not so apt to be <hi>carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with every wind of</hi> Error, as carnall hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall persons; for they are better bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasted then these are, they have many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections

&amp; preservations from Errour, which carnall men have not. As, 1. <hi>Gods election</hi> is their sure foundation to keep them from dashing upon the rocks of Errour on which others split themselves. Compare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider well these two places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. and 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 17, 18, 19. 2.

For clearing this Evidence, consider herein: 1. How the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle brands some for their Hypocrisie, discovering it selfe in their Apostasy. They fell away, <hi>viz</hi> to Antichristian Doctr. <hi>v. 18. Went out from us:</hi> therefore they were not of us; no more then chaffe mingled with the wheate, is wheate; when the fanne comes, the chaffe flies away. 2. How the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle commends those to whom he wrote, opposing them to these Hypocriticall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46248:111"/>
as having <hi>the Anointing</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from Christ <hi>abiding in them,</hi> and <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all things.</hi> These then having this Unction from the Holy one teaching them all things, are of the number of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: inasmuch as they here stand opposed to them that were not of Gods people, though once they lived among them.</p>
                  <p>Now in this Evidence further observe, 1. The Distinctive character, <hi>An Unction,</hi> viz. The Holy Spirit. This the gladning oyle wherewith Christ was <hi>anointed above all his fellowes,</hi> Kings, Priests, Prophets, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. with <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27. &amp; 10. 38. <hi>his fellowes</hi> then had some of this anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14, 16. 2. The Fountain whence this Unction flowes to them, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>the Holy-one,</hi> i. e. Christ. An allusion (thinkes <note n="*" place="margin">Calvin, Comment, in loc,</note> 
                     <hi>Calvin)</hi> to the Sanctuary, whence the oyle was fetched to anoint the Priests. And <hi>Daniel</hi> describes Christs coming to be the proper time <hi>for anointing the most Holy,</hi> Dan. 9. 24. 3. The Receptacle of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from Christ in whom it should abide; <hi>ye have an unction.—</hi>4. The effect of this unction upon them, <hi>Teaching them all things,</hi> viz. All things necessary to salvation. If now we have this unction from Christ, teaching us all things, we are of the people of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Signes</hi> that we have the <hi>Unction of the Spirit from Christ, teaching us all things.</hi>

1. When this unction the Spirit teacheth us with a <hi>Scripturr-knowlede,</hi> not with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasmes; or orher by-wayes. Thus he taughr <hi>David,</hi> Ps. 119. 99, 104. Thus <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 14, 15. Hence, called <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> because he acts upon us, by and according to Scripture-Truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Spirits teaching is <hi>cleare and certaine</hi> in necessaries to salvation, <hi>Prov. 22. 20, 21. Ioh. 6. 69. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Spirits teaching is of a <hi>Growing nature.</hi> The more he instructs us, the more we desire to be instructed of him, <hi>Prov. 1. 5. &amp; 15. 14. &amp; 18. 15. David</hi> though he knew so much, yet wonderously thirsted to know more, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 27, 73, 125, 144.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirits teaching <hi>meekens and humbles</hi> a mans Spirit, <hi>Iam. 3. 13. Psal.</hi> 25. 9. for it manifests still more and more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and sinne, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. Carnall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge swels, puffes up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Spirits teaching floats not onely in the <hi>Head,</hi> but kindly soaks into the <hi>Heart,</hi> and forcibly works upon the <hi>Affections,</hi> Josh. 23. 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 8. stirring up the heart to trust, love, joy, &amp;c. in spirituals, <hi>Ps. 9. 10. 1 Ioh. 4. 8. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Spirits teaching is, <hi>Practical.</hi> Brings not only to <hi>knowing,</hi> but to <hi>doing.</hi> It is very effective, alters and changes a man wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and diverts his course from sinne, to

sanctitie. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22, 23, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. Iob. 28. 28. Psal. 119. 104. Prov. 15. 21. Psal. 111. 10. Iam. 3. 17. Ier.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Spirits teaching <hi>makes men come to Christ, and believe in him,</hi> Joh. 6. 44, 45. Make it evident thou comest to Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest in him, thou art taught most effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

He will be so loved, as nothing should be loved besides him. He will be perfectly loved, that will be alone loved: He will have no sharer in his love, that hath no equall in the reward of love.
