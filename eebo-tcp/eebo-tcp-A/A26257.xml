            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE having very lately crept abroad a certain printed Paper, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon the World a Liſt of what <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War have been taken by the Enemy, from the beginning of the preſent War, to the Firſt of <hi>October</hi> 1695, compared with thoſe they have Loſt within

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32690:5"/>
Ships, and the ſmalleſt Veſſels alſo, which (in regard of their Age and Crazineſs) have (after being Caſt) been either Sold, or Sunk for defence of our Docks or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Places from the Sea; and though the Guns belonging to thoſe Ships and Veſſels were taken out and placed in His Majeſty's Stores before they were diſpoſed of, yet he Sums them up among the Number of thoſe which have been really Loſt.</p>
            <p>But that it may the more plainly appear, how many Ships of each Rate the Enemy have both Taken from Us, and Deſtroyed, during this long War, I think it neceſſary to put down the following Account, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that the Loſſes the Merchants have ſuſtained during this War is very conſiderable; But in regard they do at a Time of ſo great Action, and when the Seas are ſo much peſtered with the Enemies Privateers, Trade with almoſt as much Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as if there was a ſetled Peace, it is not a matter of Wonder (tho' tis much to be lamented,) that their Loſſes have been ſo great; eſpecially when 'tis conſider'd, that they have not only very often ventured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Convoys, but deſerted ſuch Convoys as have been appointed them, ſo ſoon as they came within the ſmell of the Land, in hopes thereby to foreſtall the Markets. And as for the late Loſſes of the <hi>E. India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

had they (by the beſt Information I can come at,) been pleaſed to have made thoſe Gentlemen, who ſit at the Helm of our Naval-Force, more privy to their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, I dare be bold to ſay, that much of their Loſſes might very probably have been ſaved, by the timely placing Ships in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Station, to have met with their Trade in its Return.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing that I think fit to take Notice of is, That in the lamentable Account he gives of the Decreaſe of our Sea-Strength, ſince the beginning of the War, he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Stranger, (or at leaſt ſeems to be ſo,) that above Twelve of the Ships and Veſſels in his Liſt are ſuch as the French had loſt to us: and he takes a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Care to croud in ſuch Fireſhips as have been burnt on Service againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to draw the Curtain over the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers we have taken from them; the latter whereof, in Reputation to our Sea-Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, (who, as well as others, are but too often expoſed to the laſh of ignorant and malicious Tongues and Pens,) I have juſtly numbred One Hundred Eighty Two, Sixty Seven whereof were from Ten Guns to

Fifty Six, and very few of them under Twenty; beſides Ten which were deſtroy'd between the 10th of <hi>May</hi> 1694, and the firſt <hi>October</hi> 1695.</p>
