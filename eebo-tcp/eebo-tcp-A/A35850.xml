         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OH <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> thou beloved amongst the People, who art
become the beautifull Bride the Lambs Wife; Oh
how did he seek thee in the day of thy Devorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when thou wast weeping in the barren wildernesse, as a
desolate widdow, who had not any to comfort thee, when thy
greatest mournings and breakings of heart were thy greatest
comfort? And the more thou drunk the tears that was shed for
the want of him, was thy greatest satisfaction: <hi>Oh</hi> the weary
dayes thou had'st upon the Earth, because thy languishing
soul knew not where to meet with thy beloved, neither did'st
thou know how to walk in the steps of the Flock of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
who was comforted with his presence, whom thy soul
wanted: Then was he neer unto thee (though thou knew it
not) enlivening the desires that was towards his Name. And
in the acceptable day he sent forth whom he had ordained,
to declare unto thee the glory of his love, in the light of his
own life, in which he hath covered thee this day as with a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

garment, and in it thou appears comely in his sight, and
acceptable in his presence. And for thy sake, <hi>O Ierusalem,</hi>
thou City of the Living God, what hath been endured? how
many innocent Lambs have suffered? it's hard to be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to bring glad tidings unto thee of him whom thy soul
thirsteth after? How have the striplings sent out in Gods
Authority, run too and fro in the earth, willing to spend, and
be spent, in all services of love, to perswade thee to forsake
all that hath intangled thy mind, and hindered thee from the
innocent life of thy beloved. Thy mighty men, with many of
the Sons and Daughters of glory, hath sealed their living
testimony with their blood, in the patience and sufferings of,

            <p>And now the Lord God requireth of every particular Son

And as for our little Sister, (which is scattered amongst the

let your hearts breathe unto the Lord, that he may seale

amongst many brethren, to bear his glorious testimony over
and above the heads of all the wrath of the Children of
men, that withstands the Appearance of God, who will
cause them to bow before his Glory; in the day he will
cleare the innocency of his beloved people; which shall
smite the hearts of them that know him not, neither by
Sword, nor Spear, nor strength of the Arme of Flesh, but
with the breath of his mouth, and the brightnesse of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
which shall spread his fame over the Nations, to
gather our Brethren from far, and Sisters from the ends of

this is the Portion, and the Lot of thy Inheritance, thou
