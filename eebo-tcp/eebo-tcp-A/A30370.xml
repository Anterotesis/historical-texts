            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <dateline>Dated <date>
                     <hi>the Fourth</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1687.</date>
               </dateline>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">I. I Thank you for the Favour of sending me the late <hi>Declaration</hi> that His <hi>Majesty</hi> has granted for <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> I confess, I longed for it with great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and was surprised to find it so different from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pattern; for I imagined, that it was to be set to the second part of the same tune: nor can I see why the Penners of this have sunk so much in their stile; for I suppose the same men pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both. I expected to have seen the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Language of <hi>Absolute Power, to which all the Subjects are to obey without reserve; and of the cassing, annulling, the stopping, and disabling of Laws</hi> set forth in the Preamble and body of this <hi>Declaration;</hi> whereas those dreadful words are not to be found here: for instead of <hi>repealing the Laws,</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> pretends by this only to <hi>suspend them;</hi> and tho in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this amounts to a <hi>repeal,</hi> yet it must be confessed that the words are softer. Now since the <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> to which His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> pretends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not founded on such poor things as <hi>Law;</hi> for that would look as if it were the gift of the <hi>people;</hi> but on the Divine Authority, which is supposed to be delegated to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> this may be as well claimed in <hi>England</hi> as it was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64574:2"/>
and the pretention to <hi>Absolute Power</hi> is so great a thing, that since His <hi>Majesty</hi> thought fit once to claim it, he is little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to those that make him fall so much in his Language; especially since both these <hi>Declarations</hi> have appeared in our <hi>Gazettes;</hi> so that as we see what is done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we know from hence what is in some peoples hearts, and what we may expect in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. His <hi>Majesty</hi> tells his people, that <hi>the perfect Injoyment of their Property has never been in any Case invaded by him since his coming to the Crown.</hi> This is indeed matter of great Incouragement to all good <hi>Subjects;</hi> for it lets them see, that such Invasions, as have been made on <hi>Property,</hi> have been done without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge: so that no doubt the continuing to levy the <hi>Customes</hi> and the <hi>Additional Excise</hi> (which had been granted only during the late <hi>Kings</hi> Life,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Parliament</hi> could meet to renew the Grant, was done without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge; the many Violences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only by <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but <hi>Officers,</hi> in all the <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which are severe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions on <hi>Property,</hi> have been all without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge; and since the first Branch of <hi>Property</hi> is the Right that a man has to his <hi>Life,</hi> the strange Essay of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Government,</hi> that was shewed at <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> and the no less strange proceedings of the present <hi>Lord Chancellour,</hi> in his <hi>Circuit</hi> after the <hi>Rebellion</hi> (which are very justly called <hi>His Campagne,</hi> for it was an open Act of Hostility to all <hi>Law)</hi> and for which and other Services of the like nature, it is believed he has had the reward of the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and the <hi>Executions</hi> of those who have left their <hi>Colours,</hi> which being founded on no <hi>Law,</hi> are no othet than so many <hi>Murders;</hi> all these, I say, are as we are sure, Invasions on <hi>Property;</hi> but since the <hi>King</hi> tells us, that no such <hi>Invasions</hi> have been made since he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> we must conclude that all these things have fallen out without his Privity. And if a standing <hi>Army,</hi> in time of Peace, has been ever lookt on by this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion</hi> as an Attempt upon the whole <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> in gross, one must conclude, that even this is done without His <hi>Majesties</hi> knowledge.</p>
            <p n="3">III. His <hi>Majesty</hi> expresses his Charity for us in a kind wish, <hi>that we were all Members of the Catholick Church;</hi> in return to which we offer up daily our most earnest prayers for him, that he may become a Member of the <hi>truly Catholick Church:</hi> for Wishes and Prayers do no hurt on no side: but His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> adds, that <hi>it has ever been his Opinion, that Conscience ought not to be constrained, nor people forced in matters of meer Religion.</hi> We are very happy if this continues to be always his sense: but we are sure in this he is no obedient <hi>Member</hi> of that which he means by the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> for it has over and over again decreed the <hi>Extirpation of Hereticks.</hi> It encourages <hi>Princes</hi> to it, by the Offer of the Pardon of their Sins; it threatens them to it, by denouncing to them not only the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, but that which is more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the loss of their <hi>Dominions:</hi> and it seems they intend to make us know that part of their Doctrine even before we come to feel it, since tho some of that Communion would take away the Horror which the Fourth <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Lateran</hi> gives us, in which these things were decreed, by denying it to be a <hi>General Council,</hi> and rejecting the Authority of those <hi>Canons,</hi> yet the most learned of all the <hi>Apostates</hi> that has fallen to them from our <hi>Church,</hi> has so lately given up this Plea, and has so formally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Authority of that <hi>Council,</hi> and of its <hi>Canons,</hi> that it seems they think they are bound to this piece of fair dealing, of warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us before hand of our Danger. It is true <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sayes, <hi>The Church does not always exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute her Power of deposing Heretical Princes, tho she always retains it:</hi> one reason that he assigns, is, <hi>because she is not at all times able to put it in execution:</hi> so the same reason may perhaps make it appear unadviseable to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate Hereticks,</hi> because that at present it cannot be done; but the <hi>Right</hi> remains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and is put in execution in such an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting manner in all places where that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64574:2"/>
prevails, that it has a very ill Grace, to see any <hi>Member</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> speak in this strain: and when neither the <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> nor the Greatness of their <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor yet the Interests of the <hi>Emperour</hi> joyned to the Gentleness of his own temper, could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these Bloody <hi>Councils,</hi> that are indeed parts of that <hi>Religion,</hi> we can see no reason to induce us to believe, that a <hi>Toleration of Religion</hi> is proposed with any other design but either to divide us, or to lay us asleep, till it is time to give the Alarm for destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If all the <hi>Endeavours, that have been used in the last four Reigns, for bringing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom to a Unity in Religion have been ineffectual,</hi> as His <hi>Maj.</hi> says; we know to whom we owe both the first beginnings and the progress of the Divisions among our selves; the Gentleness of <hi>Q. Elisabeth's</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the numbers of those that adhered to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> made it scarce possible to put an end to that Party during her Reign, which has been ever since restless, and has had credit enough at <hi>Court</hi> during the three last <hi>Reigns,</hi> not only to support it self, but to distract us, and to divert us from apprehending the danger of being swallowed up by them, by fomenting our own Differences, and by setting on either a <hi>Toleration,</hi> or a <hi>Persecution,</hi> as it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to serve their <hi>Interests.</hi> It is not so very long since, that nothing was to be heard at <hi>Court</hi> but the supporting the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and the Extirpating all the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists:</hi> and it were easy to name the persons, if it were decent, that had this ever in their Mouths; but now all is turned round again, the <hi>Church of England</hi> is in Disgrace; and now the Encouragment of <hi>Trade,</hi> the Quiet of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and the Freedom of <hi>Conscience</hi> are again in Vogue, that were such odious things but a few years ago, that the very mentioning them was enough to load any man with Suspitions as backward in the <hi>King's</hi> Service, while such Methods are used, and the Government is as in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, divided between hot and cold fits, no wonder if Laws so unsteadily executed have failed of their effect.</p>
            <p n="5">V. There is a good reserve here left for <hi>Severity</hi> when the proper Opportunity to set it on presents it self: for his <hi>Majesty</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himself only against the <hi>forcing of men in matters of meer Religion:</hi> so that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Religion and Policy come to be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven, that <hi>meer Religion</hi> is not the case, and that <hi>Publick Safety</hi> may be pretended, then this <hi>Declaration</hi> is to be no more clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: so that the fastning any thing upon the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> that is inconsistent with the Publick Peace, will be pretended to shew that they are not persecuted for <hi>meer Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> when it was resolved to extirpate the <hi>Protestants,</hi> all the Discourses that were written on that Subject were full of the <hi>Wars</hi> occasioned by those of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in the last Age, tho as these were the happy Occasions of bringing the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> they had been ended above 80. years ago, and there had not been so much as the least Tumult raised by them these 50. years past: so that the <hi>French,</hi> who have smarted under this Severity, could not be charged with the least Infraction of the <hi>Law:</hi> yet Stories of a hundred years old were raised up to inspire into the <hi>King</hi> those Apprehensions of them, which have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the terrible effects that are visible to all the World. There is another <hi>Expression</hi> in this <hi>Declaration,</hi> which lets us likewise see with what Caution the Offers of Favour are now worded, that so there may be an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion given when the Time and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture shall be favourable to break thro them all: it is in these words, <hi>So that they take especial Care that nothing be preached or taught amongst them, which may any ways tend to alienate the Hearts of our People from us or our Government.</hi> This in it self is very reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and could admit of no Exception, if we had not to do with a set of <hi>men,</hi> who to our great Misfortune have so much Credit with His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and who will be no sooner lodged in the Power to which they pretend, than they will make every thing that is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64574:3"/>
               <hi>preached</hi> against <hi>Popery</hi> pass for that which may <hi>in some manner alienate the Subjects from the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>His Majesty makes no doubt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of his Two Houses of Parliament, when he shall think it convenient for them to meet.</hi> The Hearts of <hi>Kings</hi> are unsearchable; so that it is a little too presumptuous to look into His <hi>Majesties</hi> Secret Thoughts: but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Judgments that we would make of other mens Thoughts by their Actions, one would be tempted to think, that His <hi>Majesty</hi> made some doubt of it, since his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs both at home and abroad could not go the worse, if it appeared that there were a perfect understanding between <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that his <hi>People</hi> were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting him with fresh <hi>Supplies;</hi> and this <hi>House of Commons</hi> is so much at his Devotion, that all the world saw how ready they were to grant every thing that he could desire of them, till he began to lay off the Mask with relation to the <hi>Test,</hi> and since that time the frequent <hi>Prorogations,</hi> the <hi>Closetting,</hi> and the Pains that has been taken to gain <hi>Members,</hi> by Promises made to some, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces of others, would make one a little Inclined to think, that <hi>some doubt was made of their Concurrence.</hi> But we must confess, that the depth of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Judgment is such, that we cannot fathom it, and therefore we cannot guess what his Doubts or his Assurances are. It is true, the words that come after unriddle the Mystery a little, which are, <hi>when His Majesty shall think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them to meet:</hi> for the meaning of this seems plain, that his <hi>Maj.</hi> is resolved, that they shall never meet, till he receives such Assurances, in a new round of <hi>Closetting,</hi> that he <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall be put out of doubt concerning it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I will not enter into the dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> and the <hi>Reasons</hi> that may be offered for it to a <hi>Session</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> for there is scarce any one point, that either with relation to <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Politicks,</hi> affords a greater variety of matter for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection: and I make no doubt to say, that there is abundance of Reason to oblige a <hi>Parliament</hi> to review all the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> either with relation to <hi>Papists,</hi> or to <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> but I will take the boldness to add one thing, that the <hi>Kings</hi>'s <hi>suspending of Laws</hi> strikes at the root of this whole <hi>Government,</hi> and subverts it quite: for if there is any thing certain with relation to the <hi>English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it is this, <hi>that the Executive Power of the Law is entirely in the King;</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> to fortisy him in the Management of it has clothed him with a vast <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and made it unlawful upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever to resist him: whereas on the other hand, the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> is not so entirely in the <hi>King,</hi> but that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> have such a share in it, that no <hi>Law</hi> can be either <hi>made, repealed,</hi> or which is all one <hi>suspended,</hi> but by their consent: so that the placing this <hi>Legislative Power</hi> singly in the <hi>King,</hi> is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of this whole <hi>Government;</hi> since the Essence of all Governments consists in the Subjects of the Legislative Authority; Acts of Violence or Injustice, committed in the <hi>Executive</hi> part, are such things that all <hi>Princes</hi> being subject to them, the peace of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were very ill secured if it were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to resist upon any pretence taken from any ill Administrations, in which as the <hi>Law</hi> may be doubtful, so the Facts may be uncertain, and at worst the publick Peace must alwayes be more valued than any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Oppressions or Injuries whatsoever. But the total <hi>Subversion</hi> of a <hi>Government,</hi> being so contrary to the <hi>Trust</hi> that is given to the <hi>Prince</hi> who ought to execute it, will put men upon uneasy and dangerous Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: which will turn little to the Advantage of those who are driving matters to such a doubtful and desperate issue.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If there is any thing in which the Exercise of the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> seems In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable, it is in those <hi>Oaths of Allegeance</hi> and <hi>Tests,</hi> that are thought necessary to Qualify men either to be admitted to enjoy the Protection of the <hi>Law,</hi> or to bear a share in the <hi>Government;</hi> for in these the Security of the Government is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and therefore the total extinction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64574:3"/>
of these, as it is not only a Suspension of them, but a plain repealing of them, so it is a <hi>Subverting</hi> of the whole Foundation of our <hi>Government:</hi> For the Regulation that <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> had set both for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects having the Protection of the State by the <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> and for a share in places of trust by the <hi>Tests,</hi> is now pluckt up by the roots, when it is declared, <hi>that these shall not at any time hereafter be required to be taken, or subscribed by any persons whatsoever:</hi> for it is plain, that this is no <hi>Suspension</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but a formal <hi>Repeal</hi> of it, in as plain Words as can be conceived.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. His <hi>Majesty</hi> says, that <hi>the Benefit of the Service of all his Subjects is by the Law of Nature Inseparably annexed to and inherent in his Sacred Person.</hi> It is somewhat strange, that when so many <hi>Laws,</hi> that we all know are suspended, the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which is so hard to be found out, should be cited; but the Penners of this <hi>Declaration</hi> had b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st let <hi>that Law</hi> lie forgotten among the rest; for there is a scurvy Paragraph in it, concerning <hi>self Preservation,</hi> that is capable of very unacceptable Glosses. It is hard to tell what Section of the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> has markt out either such <hi>a Form of Government,</hi> or such <hi>a Family</hi> for it. And if His <hi>Majesty</hi> renounces his Pretensions to our <hi>Allegeance</hi> as founded on the <hi>Laws of England;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himself to this <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> he will perhaps find the Counsel was a little too rash; but to make the most of this that can be, the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> does indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Governours</hi> of all Societies a Power to serve themselves of every Member of it in the cases of extream Danger; but no <hi>Law of Nature</hi> that has been yet heard of will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if by <hi>special Laws,</hi> a sort of men have been disabled from all Imployments, that a <hi>Prince</hi> who at his Coronation <hi>Swore</hi> to maintain those <hi>Laws,</hi> may at his pleasure extinguish all these Disabilities.</p>
            <p n="10">X. At the end of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> as in a Postscript, His <hi>Majesty</hi> assures his Subjects, that he will <hi>maintain them in their Properties, as well in Church and Abbey-Lands, as other Lands:</hi> but the Chief of all their <hi>Properties</hi> being the share that they have by their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives</hi> in the <hi>Legislative Power;</hi> this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> which breaks thro that, is no great Evidence that the rest will be maintained: and to speak plainly, when a <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> is so little remembred, other <hi>Promises</hi> must have a proportioned degree of Credit given to them: as for the <hi>Abbey Lands,</hi> the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the <hi>Church</hi> is according to the Principles of that Religion <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and that is a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> and there can no <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> be given to any who continue in it: and so this <hi>Promise</hi> being an Obligation to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men in a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> is null and void of it self: <hi>Church-Lands</hi> are also according to the Doctrine of their <hi>Canonists,</hi> so immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Gods Right,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> himself is only the Administrator and Dispencer, but is not the Master of them; he can indeed make a truck for God, or let them so <hi>low,</hi> that God shall be an easy <hi>Landlord:</hi> but he cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods <hi>Property,</hi> nor translate the Right that is in him to <hi>Sacrilegious Laymen</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">XI. One of the Effects of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> will be the setting on foot a new run of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses</hi> over the <hi>Nation:</hi> for there is nothing how Impudent and base soever, of which the abject flattery of a Slavish Spirit is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. It must be confest, to the reproach of the Age, that all those strains of flattery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Tacitus</hi> sets forth with so much just Scorn, are modest things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to what this <hi>Nation</hi> has produced within these <hi>seven years:</hi> only if our Flattery has come short of the Refinedness of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it has exceeded theirs as much in its loathed Fulsomness. The late <hi>King</hi> set out a <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which he gave the most solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances possible of his adhering to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and to the <hi>Religion established by Law,</hi> and of his Resolution to have Frequent <hi>Parliaments;</hi> upon which the whole <hi>Nation</hi> fell as it were into Raptures of Joy and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: but tho he lived four Years after that, he called no <hi>Parliament,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Triennial Parliaments:</hi> and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64574:4"/>
manner of his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Papers</hi> printed after his Death in his Name, have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed, that he was equally sincere in both those Assurances that he gave, as well in that Relating to <hi>Religion,</hi> as in that other Relating to Frequent <hi>Parliaments;</hi> yet upon his <hi>Death</hi> a new set of <hi>Addresses</hi> appeared, in which, all that Flattery could Invent was brought forth, in the Commendations of a <hi>Prince,</hi> to whose <hi>Memory</hi> the greatest kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can be done, is <hi>to forget him:</hi> and because his present <hi>Majesty</hi> upon his coming to the <hi>Throne</hi> gave some very general <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Maintaining the Church of England,</hi> this was magnified in so Extravagant a strain, as if it had been a Security greater than any that the <hi>Law</hi> could give: tho by the regard that the <hi>King</hi> has both to <hi>it</hi> and to the <hi>Laws,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he is resolved to maintain both equally: since then the <hi>Nation</hi> has already made it self sufficiently ridiculous both to the present and to all succeeding Ages; it is time that at last men should grow weary, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ashamed of their Folly.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are now invited to set an Example to the rest: and they who have valued themselves hitherto upon their Opposition to <hi>Popery,</hi> and that have quarrelled with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for some small Approaches to it, in a few <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> are now solicited to rejoyce, because the <hi>Laws</hi> that secure us against it, are all plucked up: since they enjoy at <hi>present</hi> and <hi>during pleasure</hi> leave to meet together. It is natural for all men to love to be set at ease, especially in the matters of their Consciences; but it is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that those who allow them this favour, do it with no other design, but that under a pretence of a <hi>General Toleration,</hi> they may Introduce a <hi>Religion</hi> which must <hi>persecute</hi> all equally: it is likewise apparent how much <hi>they</hi> are <hi>hated,</hi> and how much <hi>they</hi> have been <hi>persecuted</hi> by the Instigation of those who now Court them, and who have now no game that is more promising, than the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> into new Quarrels: and as for the <hi>Promises</hi> now made to them, it cannot be supposed that they will be more lasting than those that were made some time ago to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who had both a better Title in <hi>Law</hi> and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Merit upon the <hi>Crown</hi> to assure them that they should be well used than these can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. The <hi>Nation</hi> has scarce forgiven some of the <hi>Church of England</hi> the <hi>Persecution</hi> into which they have suffered themselves to be cosened: tho now that they see <hi>Popery</hi> barefaced, the Stand that they have made, and the vigorous Opposition that they have given to it, is that which makes all men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forget what is past, and raises again the Glory of a <hi>Church</hi> that was not a little stained by the Indiscretion and Weakness of those, that were too apt to believe and hope, and so suffered themselves to be made a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> to those who would now make them a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> The Sufferings of the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> and the Fury that the <hi>Popish Party</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed against them, had recommended them so much to the Compassions of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and had given them so just a pretension to favour in a better time, that it will look like a curse of God upon them, if a few <hi>men,</hi> whom the Court has gained to betray them, can have such an ill Influence upon them as to make them throw away all that Merit, and those Compassions which their Sufferings have procured them; and to go and court <hi>those</hi> who are only seemingly kind to them, that they may destroy both <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us.</hi> They must remember that as the <hi>Church of England</hi> is the only Establishment that our <hi>Religion</hi> has by <hi>Law;</hi> so it is the main body of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and all the <hi>Sects</hi> are but small and strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling parties: and if the Legal Settlement of the <hi>Church</hi> is dissolved, and that body is once broken, these lesser bodies will be all at Mercy: and it is an easy thing to define what the Mercies of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. But tho it must be confessed, that the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are still under some Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to receive every thing that gives them present ease, with a little too much kindness; since they lie exposed to many severe <hi>Laws,</hi> of which they have of late felt the weight ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavily, and as they are men, and some
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64574:4"/>
of them as ill Natured men as other people, so it is no wonder if upon the first surprises of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> they are a little delighted, to see the <hi>Church of England,</hi> after all its Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Submissions to the <hi>Court,</hi> so much mortified by it; so that taking all together it will not be strange if they commit some Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon this occasion. Yet on the other hand, it passes all imagination, to see some of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> especially those whose Natures we know are so particularly sharpned in the point of <hi>Persecution,</hi> chiefly when it is levelled against the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at this <hi>Declaration,</hi> and make <hi>Addresses</hi> upon it. It is hard to think that they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to so high a pitch of Christian Charity, as to thank those who do now <hi>despitefully use them,</hi> and that as an earnest that within a little while they will <hi>persecute</hi> them. This will be an Original, and a Master piece in Flattery, which must needs draw the last degrees of Contempt on such as are capable of so abject and sordid a Compliance, and that not only from all the true <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but likewise from those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> it self; for every man is apt to esteem an Enemy that is brave even in his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, as much as he despises those whose minds sink with their Condition. For what is it that these men would thank the <hi>King?</hi> Is it because he breaks those <hi>Laws</hi> that are made in their Favour, and for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: and is now striking at the Root of all the Legal Settlement that they have for their <hi>Religion?</hi> Or is it because that at the same time that the <hi>King</hi> professes a <hi>Religion</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> yet he is not contented with the Exercise of it as it is warranted by <hi>Law,</hi> but carries it so far as to erect a <hi>Court</hi> contrary to the express words of a <hi>Law</hi> that was so lately made: That <hi>Court</hi> takes care to maintain a due proportion between their <hi>Constitution</hi> and all their <hi>proceedings,</hi> that so all may be of a piece, and all equally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Law.</hi> They have suspended one <hi>Bishop,</hi> only because he would not do that which was not in his Power to do: for since there is no Extrajudiciary Authority in <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Bishop</hi> can no more proceed to a Sentence of Suspension against a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> without a Tryal, and the hearing of Parties, than a <hi>Judge</hi> can give a Sentence in his Chamber without an Indictment, a Tryal, or a Iury: and because one of the <hi>Greatest Bodies</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would not break their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and obey a <hi>Mandate</hi> that plainly contradicted them, we see to what a pitch this is like to be carried. I will not Anticipate upon this <hi>ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Court,</hi> to tell what Iudgments are coming; but without carrying our Iealousies too far, one may safely conclude, that they will never depart so far from their first <hi>Institution,</hi> as to have any regard, either to our <hi>Religion,</hi> or our <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Liberties,</hi> in any thing they do. If all this were acted by avowed <hi>Papists,</hi> as we are sure it is projected by such, there were nothing Extraordinary in it: but that which carries our Indignation a little too far to be easily governed, is to see some <hi>Pretended Protestants,</hi> and a few <hi>Bishops,</hi> among those that are the fatal <hi>Instruments</hi> of pulling down the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and that those <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> Sacrifice their <hi>Religion</hi> and their <hi>Church</hi> to their Ambition and Interests; this has such peculiar Characters of Misfortune upon it, that it seems it is not enough if we perish without pity, since we fall by that hand that we have so much supported and fortifyed, but we must become the Scorn of all the world, since we have produced such an unnatural <hi>Brood,</hi> that even while they are pretending to be the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> are cutting their <hi>Mother's</hi> Throat: and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with <hi>Judas's</hi> Crime, of saying, <hi>Hail Master,</hi> and <hi>kissing</hi> him, while they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying him into the hands of others; these carry their Wickedness further, and say, <hi>Hail Mother,</hi> and then they themselves <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> her. If after all this we were called on to bear this as <hi>Christians;</hi> and to suffer it as <hi>Subjects;</hi> if we were required in Patience to possess our own Souls, ând to be in Charity with our Enemies; and which is more, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our <hi>False Brethren,</hi> who add Treachery to their Hatred; the Exhortation were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and indeed a little necessary; for humane Nature cannot easily take down things of such a hard digestion: but to tell us
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64574:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>we</hi> must make <hi>Addresses,</hi> and offer <hi>Thanks</hi> for all this, is to Insult a little too much upon us in our Sufferings: and he that can believe that a dry and cautiously worded <hi>promise</hi> of maintaining the <hi>Church of England,</hi> will be Religiously observed after all that we have seen, and is upon that carried so far out of his Wits as to <hi>Address</hi> and give <hi>Thanks,</hi> and will believe still, such a man has nothing to excuse him from believing <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> it self; for it is plain that he can bring himself to believe even when the thing is contrary to the clearest Evidence that his senses can give him.</p>
