            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEcauſe of the preſent differences between the French King and the Pope, I thought good to Tranſlate theſe following Viſions of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Meliſh</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> Cittizan of <hi>Liſſa,</hi> who (as ſaith he th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Therefore we muſt conclude that his Viſions were ſhewed him by a higher power. The moſt part of them being fulfilled, and others were fulfilling; ſome alſo ſeem to be juſt upon accompliſhment. This was the cauſe that I have Tranſlated thoſe Viſions, whoſe accompliſhment I judged to be now beginning; ſo that all good people here might have ſome knowledge of what paſſes beyond-Sea of this nature.

               <p>ON <hi>Palme-ſunday (April</hi> 9, 1656) I Dreamed thus: I travelled, and a man I knew not did accompany me; and we went forth together til we entred into a great Palace, the name of which I knew not: And the man drew me aſide, and asked me, from whence <hi>I</hi> was? I ſaid, of <hi>Poland.</hi> He again, Of what Religion? I, Of the Proteſtants. He, Sing ye alſo French Pſalms? Yes, ſaid I, that is my higheſt joy, when <hi>I</hi> riſe, and go to ſleep. Then he behaved himſelf loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards me, and ſaid, Stand here by me, no evil ſhal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to thee, thou ſhalt ſee great things that muſt be done in ſhort. If it be ſomewhat thou underſtand'ſt not, ask me, I ſhall tell thee. And ſoon he was changed into another ſhape, as a ſpiritual perſon; on whoſe ſide I ſtanding, ſaw exactly what I now ſhall tell thee without addition.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, There was ſet in the midſt of the Palace a ſquare ſilver-Table; in the mean time came a great King, whoſe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was of Silver-cloth, and led the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> at his right hand. Then he ſate down with his back Southwards, and his eies Northwards, and the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſate at the Table over-againſt him; and at the right hand of this King the Elector of <hi>Aeydelberg,</hi> of <hi>Saxen,</hi> of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> having their eyes turned as it were Weſtwards, but their backs Eaſtwards.</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33878:4"/>
But betwixt this King and the Elector of Saxen ſate a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal upon a ſilver-ſtool at the corner of the, Table, holding a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Crofier in his hand, which was mighty thick. He was cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with a long prieſts gown, (like to the Kings) in Silver cloaths, and was girded with a girdle, having upon his head a mitre of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange faſhion.</p>
               <p>At the left hand ſate one as it were <hi>Ra-Kocy</hi> cloathed according to the Hungarian mode, beſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him an ambaſſador of <hi>Spain,</hi> and then one of the Emperors Ambaſſadors, and others. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> ſate next the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Round about thoſe Kings were ſet ſilver ſtools, upon which ſate along the three ſides of the palace, or hall, mighty Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</p>
               <p>Then preſently was given a great ſound out of great Guns, and afterwards Pſalms and ſongs were ſung in the French tongue; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there was a very great noiſe of Muſick, &amp; all kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: I alſo heard voices of men amongſt this Muſick ſinging very loud, the Melody of the Pſalm I knew wel.</p>
               <p>Following, there was brought in upon two levers a ſmall ſilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, upon which did lie the Popes Crown.</p>
               <p>And by and by, at the Kings and Princes conſent lifted up him ſelf the Cardinall aforeſaid, and ſtruck with the croſier upon the crown, that it did flie into pieces; and others ſtanding round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, trampled on the burſted ſilver with their feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At that ſame inſtant there aroſe to be a ſudden quivering noiſe, by ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pieces, and great ordnances, horrible and dreadfull.</p>
               <p>After that ſhooting a very great triumph was made by ſingers and muſical inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Then came a Queen and ſate down next the King, She was cloathed like the King: After her followed Virgins with a melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſound of Pſalms and ſongs, bearing an exceeding precious preſent upon a golden lever, which they did preſent to the King. And then again was heard a great crack of pieces and ordnances to confirm all this.</p>
               <p>After came a very great multitude of the Gentry and Knight hood, and Lords, out of all the four corners of the World, and brought to the King a crown and a ſword, which crown they ſet before him in the preſence of all theſe Potentates: But the ſword
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33878:4"/>
they put him in his hand, even to the end that he ſhould skirmiſh againſt the Babyloniſh beaſt; At which they alſo joyned their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gratulation, which I underſtood not, becauſe it was done in French: And J durſt not ask the Man what they ſaid, onely what J did ſee with my eyes, &amp; could apprehend with my underſtanding. After this was heard again a great ratling of Guns, &amp; ſingers. And there came, as it were, perſons of the commonalty, and brought to the King a coſtly preſent, and did ad their gratulations, but J did not underſtand it. And all this was anew confirmed with ſhooting and muſick ſound,</p>
               <p>Whereas now the Gentry and Knighthood aforeſaid had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Crown, and reached the ſword into his hand, the ſaid King profered to the King of Sweden his right hand, and the other Princes, Potentates and Kings; ſtanding by, laid thereupon their hands, kiſſing one another, and ſung at it the 20 Pſalm; At which there was heard once more ſo great a ſhooting and muſicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, as never before, inſomuch that the very earth did ring.</p>
               <p>Then they all did ariſe, and went into a great temple, wherein the ſaid King did crown the ſaid Cardinall, and put him on a very Patriarch-Mitre, as it were a Cardinals-hat: And many Preachers ſate there in white ſilk-cloaths about the Altar, and elſewhere, and ſung French Pſalms, in the congregation of many thouſand people. There the King did eſtabliſh him to be an intendant Adminiſtrator of the Church of God inſtead of <hi>Moſes, Samuel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Out of this temple now J came forth with the ſame man upon a very large field, where the King did muſter his Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſent his Army towards the South &amp; Weſt to fight couragiouſly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his order to them how they ſhould behave themſelves.</p>
               <p>Then the Cardinal began a reformation in all cities, and gave them priviledges according to the manner of the old Teſtament. But all what could not be eaſily decided was ordered ſhould be brought before the King. It was alſo ordered, that nothing in what cauſe ſoever, Eccleſiaſtical or Secular, muſt be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge of this King and the ſaid Potentates.</p>
               <p>His Armies did increaſe of all ſides round about, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion was to be like as it were <hi>Germany,</hi> and he a King for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33878:5"/>
to wit, ſo long as the World ſtands, and no alteration at all was to be expected from him, but that at the time of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there ſhould be Peace, unity, and all kinde of good, like as it was in the time of <hi>Solemon.</hi> And it was clear day when <hi>I</hi> awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <hi>APril</hi> 27. had I ſuch a dream as thus: I came at a high mountain, unto which when I had climbed up very hardly, (yet with help of others,) I was commanded to look back. Which doing, he ſaid to me, Doſt thou ſee that piece of land? Yes, Sir, I ſee it, ſaid I. But when I looked back again, behold there was nothing more left then earth and aſhes. Then I asked; Sir, how is that gone ſo ſuddenly? He<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even ſo ſhall be gone the whole Land, becauſe of their great ſins, which they do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For terror ſhall fall upon them, indeed upon all, as well the fighting men, as them that are defending themſelves. But them that I ſhall preſerve, I will bring thorrow into other countries, that they might be preſerved for a time and ſeaſon; but the hypocrite, who do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my people, ſhall be an abomination for ever. For the Lords Seaſon is approaching, to make manifeſt the works and doings of every one.</p>

               <p>ON the 19, <hi>May</hi> (when I was already amongſt the ſcattered, ones in <hi>Sileſia)</hi> ſaw I the Sun ſhine towards the North, and all dark, only clear towards the bottome of it; and there aroſe three other Suns from the Eaſt, and Weſt, and betwixt the Weſt &amp; North. But on the higheſt part of the Heaven ſtood a very great Sun, the greateſt of all. And I did ask: Sir, Wherefore is the Northern Sun ſo dark? He anſwered: Becauſe that I will not by him alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (my Ambaſſador) perform the Work, leaſt there creep in pride and opinions (or imaginations) as though he by his own power or wiſdom did effect the work, to which I have called him. For behold, he already doth not what I will, but what he will himſelf: However I did not ſend him for his own
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33878:5"/>
profit and interreſt, but for my glory-ſake. For I have another Workman, whom I ſhall ſend unto him, even to the end that they ſhall work together, and perform the work.</p>
               <p>At that ſame inſtant began the Northern Sun, being refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the other Suns, to ariſe on high, and take her courſe. And preſently I did hear a voice coming from far: Beware now therefore thou do nothing, but what will tend unto the honor of God and his Worſhip, and unto the edification of his Church: And ye other Suns, proceed in your courſe alſo, and go on for it's time, do not tarrie one for another, for its high time, to perform the work of God, the time of the manifeſtation of his Glory is at hand.</p>
               <p>And there came from the South a very deformed wonderful beaſt, who had ſent forth many meſſengers of ſtrange faſhions: And theſe went to the (great Lords) and the common people, exhorting them, and giving drink out of a wonder-cup; Then they did conſpire, and bind themſelves together with great chains, to the end, that they might ſtand faſt together for the maintenance of their cauſe. But when the battle began, theſe were driven back to the South, and that wonder-beaſt was overcome and vanquiſhed, and I praiſed-God for the victory given to the Suns. But a Voice came to be heard, which ſaid; His fall is not yet, for the Suns help not truly one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their great envie, that is amongſt them, and ſome of them ſeek their own ends.

               <p>AGain I ſaw a bright fiery light towards the South, all as it were, burning up, and as it were an unquencheable fire. And there aroſe a very great out-cry, and many lamentations, with ſo thick and dark a ſmoak, that nothing was to be ſeen. At that inſtant I ſaw red Foxes come from the Eaſt, every one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great tooth. And a gold yellowiſh Lyon ſtood upon a green place, about whom the foxes were leaping. And a voyce
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33878:6"/>
was heard: Truſt them not, they have falſhood in their mind. Therefore the Lyon did ſmile at them, and a while after rent them in pieces. And behold that great Sun (the brightneſs of which was before ſo great, that nothing did appear to be ſeen, becauſe of his ſo great light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was changed into blood alſo in the ſame region, but only for a time.</p>
               <p>Inſtantly after came a fiery Man like a flame, with a black ſword of Iron: And againſt him a bright ſhining Man, like the the Sun, with ſuch a ſword like a flaſh of Lightning.

Preſently a voice was heard, ſaying: To ſhee, O lamb, be praiſe and thanks; for thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take the book, and to open his ſeals. For one time is paſt already, and half a time, and now is half half a time.</p>
               <p>Preſently there was a theater made for execution. Many of the great Lords were beheaded, and prieſts ſtrangled. And fear did overcome them, and ſome were taken priſoners. The Popes ſtool alſo did fall with a very great fall; and thereupon was a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, which was not broken, but lay there, and no body liſted it up. And a Voice came a farr off; Haſten and tarry not, for thou ſhalt go further, and perform the Work for which I have called thee: For the others alſo do expect their redemption.</p>

was grown dark, very black like a coal. And beſides him Eaſtwards ſtood a red moon, but over againſt her a black two horn'd-moon: And round about the Sun ſeven Stars, bright ſhining, as they do ſhine at night. But a thick miſt riſing from the earth diſcover them all with darkneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that both I and many others beſide me were terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and began to flie.

Behold the time of his down fall cometh near, and is now here! Wo to your life, who drink out of his cup. And at the ſame time he poured out a great Vial, of ſomewhat red, like blood; And great lamentations aroſe over the whole earth, inſomuch that I my ſelf thought nothing elſe but Doomsday did ſurprize us, and I went to prayer, till I awakened.</p>

               <p>I Saw again a Sun in the North Eaſt, riſen at the height of half South, and there ſtanding without motion: For there came great clouds from t' other Eaſts. And another Black Sun aroſe up from the Weſt, who was croſſed over by ſome clouds and winds with white ſtreaks. He went on through the black thick clouds, &amp; paſſed ſuddenly towards the South to the other Sun, and by how much the nearer he approached, &amp; the ſw fter he run on, ſo much the brighter he became. But when he came near the South line, as it were, between twelve &amp; one, there he ſtood ſtedfaſt like the very

But when I lifted up my eyes to the Heaven, I was aware of them called the Seven ſtarrs, that they did part from one another, four of them towards the North, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three towards the South, and great Winds began to blow one againſt another, like great Armies, and great lamenting was heard.

like a dying perſon. Then I ſunk into a very deep ſleep, and I was as it were truly dead.</p>
               <p>But there I ſaw a ſtrange man, who had two different bodies, with all the members of men, but one onely ſoul, of which both the bodies had their life. The one was fair of face, but the other had an ugly countenance. This now that was of ſo ugly a faſhion dyed, and was carried away from the remaining living body aſunder into another chamber. Then the other living body came unto the dead body, and ſpake to them that had carried him forth thus: A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>! how horrid looks now my dead body, &amp; ſtinks ſo ugly.</p>
               <p>Now I firſt ſee how ugly my countenance and form hath been when it was alive! Now as I thus conſidered of that ſtrange man, and much wondered at him, ſaying: What is that for a man? God hath never created ſuch a man? Then there was made an anſwer unto me: Thou haſt well ſaid. For in the beginning God has created man like unto his image; in ſincere holineſs and juſtice, and immortall. But by the Devils envy Death is come into the world, and through Sin it has pierced thorow into all men, becauſe they have all ſinned. And as concerning this ſtrange viſion, the ſignification of it is this: The man with thoſe two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and one ſoul, being partly fair, and alive; to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, partly ugly, dying, and remaining dead, that is the regenerated man, every one in his particular perſon created after God: In whom are two contrary natures, called the Old man, and the New man, ſpirit and fleſh, like as thou haſt ſeen, that the one was very ugly and ſtunk: Likewiſe, nay more horrid is the na<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ural man with all his bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences or luſts before the eyes of God. Now as the ugly died, ſo muſt that corrupted <hi>Adamical</hi> fleſh, with all his bad luſts, die in the regenerated man, and quite periſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For like as the dead was ſeparated from him who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33878:10"/>
alive: So alſo muſt a true Chriſtian deny all the dead works, &amp; ſerve the true God alone with a clear heart. And as the living did not ſooner acknowledg his ugly ſhapethen after the others death: So the naturall man as long as ſin has dominion in his mortall body, cannot acknowledge his corrupted nature, how that from the ſoal of the foot, even unto the crown of the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it; but wounds, &amp; bruiſes, and putrifying ſores, that have not been cloſed neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. Yea, like an unclean child that lies yet in his blood, not being bathed, ſo is the regenerated man, until God have born him again, &amp; given him grace, that through his Spirit he might kill the old <hi>Adam.</hi> At that time he can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg by the grace of God, how greatly he had been corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by hereditary ſin, ſince he came forth from his mother. Thereupon he begins to praiſe the Lord God in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fountain of all pureneſs, that he hath purified him. So ſtill he hath a hatred againſt ſin, denieth himſelf caſt forth all, ſelf-love Yea abſolutly given over unto God in his will, with all he hath in the innermoſt of his Soul &amp; body. Then he begins to live firſt of all accordingly, &amp; the Image of God is to be renewed again. For like as in a troubled water, that is moved &amp; agitated by wind, a Man cannot ſee his image; ſo the image of God cannot be ſeen in a heart, moved by the Winds of this World, the luſts of the eyes, the luſts of the fleſh, the pride of Life, and the hope upon periſhing things, and troubled by the dirt of riches, covetouſneſs and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is now the declaring of the man with two bodies and one Soul. God will be pleaſed, to kill in us all bad luſts, and ſtirr us up by his grace, that we might ſerve the living God in holineſs and righteouſneſs, according to his will and pleaſure.</p>
