         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And alſo the number of all thoſe that have dyed in this preſent Viſitation.</head>
            <p>IT is no doubt, that the corrupti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the Aire, together with uncleanly
and unwholſome keeping of dwelling, where many are peſtred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as alſo the not-obſerving to have fires private and publikely made
as well within houſes, as without in the ſtreets, at times when the Ayre
is infected, are great occaſions to increaſe, corrupt, and produce peſtilent
Diſeaſes. Neither can it be denyed, that the over-boldneſſe of many prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
into infected places, and the lewdneſſe of others with Sores upon
them, preſuming into the open Ayre, ſome of wilfulneſſe, but truly many
of neceſſitie, contaminateth and corrupteth divers: as the Leproſie, the
Poxe, and ſundry ſuch uncleane diſeaſes doe: as by drinking, lying in
company, and other ſuch meanes, where pure complexions and cleane
bloods are defiled with ſuch as are putrified: and therefore carefully to be
avoyded. But all theſe are accidentall, and rather effects than the cauſe.
For it plainly appeareth in the Booke of <hi>Exodus</hi> that when it pleaſed the
Almightie God to ſmite the Aegyptians, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o dip Iſop in the Blood of the Paſchall Lambe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſmite off that
bloud on the outward Poſts of their doores, that when the ſlayer came to
deſtroy in one night all the firſt borne in Aegypt, he might paſſe over the
houſes of Gods children. So that it is plaine, it was an Angell then ſent
to ſmite thoſe cruell people with the Peſtilence.</p>
            <p>Then firſt, this Citie of <hi>London,</hi> cannot be denyed, to have had as great
bleſſings as ever had <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> for here God hath long time beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by his Word and Sacraments, yet they have abounded in all iniquitie,
when Jeruſalem long ſince had not a ſtone left upon a ſtone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>London</hi> is ſituated as pleaſantly as <hi>Sodome,</hi> and her ſiſter Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
before they ſunke, even for the ſame ſinnes that we have committed:
for the ſinne of <hi>Sodome</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi>) was pride, fulneſſe
of bread, and contempt of the poore. That theſe ſinnes raigne in <hi>London,</hi>
who can deny? To them, adde fulneſſe of drinke; for therein we exceed
the Nation, that within theſe fiftie yeeres we hated for drunkenneſſe: and
I doubt, That un-nameable ſinne of <hi>Sodome</hi> is uſed in too many places
of the Citie. Yet <hi>London</hi> ſtands, and ſo God grant with his mercie it
long may.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, where in the change of Princes (eſpecially after long peace, as
<hi>London</hi> moſt happily enjoyed all the time of our late Soveraigne Queene
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of worthy memory) many Cities have come to miſerable ſpoile,
if not to ruine: yet <hi>London,</hi> by our moſt potent Lord and King, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in tranquillitie, bleſſing powring upon bleſſing: ſave only now for
our negligence, God hath with his owne hand ſmitten us, and ſent many
to mourn in death after our late Soveraigne deceaſed, whom we had almoſt
ungratefully forgotten in a day.</p>
            <p>In the Citie, called the great <hi>Caire,</hi> there is a Plague once every ſeven
yeeres, which commeth with ſuch a fierceneſſe, that the moſt part of the
people there doe dye thereof: and divers of them that remaine alive, loſe
their eye-ſight with the vapours and great heat which commeth from the
ground.</p>
            <p>In the yeere of Chriſt, 81. and in the yeere 188. there continued a
great time a Plague in <hi>Rome,</hi> of which there daily dyed two thouſand
people.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 254. fifteene Provinces of the Romane Empire, were in a
manner conſumed with the Peſtilence.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 530. there dyed in <hi>Constantinople</hi> 5000. a day, and divers
times 1000. and at that time, in ſome other parts of Greece, there were
not ſufficient living men left to bury their dead.</p>
            <p>And in the yeere 1569. there fell ſuch a Plague in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that
there dyed in ſixe months ſpace, ſeven hundred thouſand perſons, and the
yeere following fell ſuch a famine, that a penny loafe of Bread of Engliſh
mony, was worth a crowne of gold: by reaſon whereof, the people died as
faſt then of the Famine, as they did before of the Plague.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 540. there began an univerſall Plague all over the world,
that continued 50. yeeres with great violence.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 1348. in <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there dyed a hundred thouſand
people of the Plague.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 1359. ſo great a Peſtilence there was in <hi>Italy,</hi> that there
were ſcarce ten left of a thouſand.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 1521. there dyed in <hi>Rome</hi> a hundred thouſand of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence.</p>
            <p>In the yeeres 1576. and 77. in <hi>Millan, Padua</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> there fell a
hundred thouſand in every Citie: and in <hi>Bohemia</hi> (being but a ſmall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
there dyed 300000. the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> time.</p>
            <p>Soone after the Conqueſt of King <hi>William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> when the
people were ſubdued to him, &amp; the Knights fees rated which he had made,
and himſelfe placed with Crowne and Scepter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee tooke number of the
Acres of land in all the Realme, and of all the people, and of all the Cattell:
after which fell ſo ſore a Plague, that the people dyed in ſuch number, that
Tillage decayed, Famine enſued, with rot of Cattell, that men were faine
to eate fleſh of Dogs, Cats and Mice. A fearefull example for Princes.</p>
            <p>In the Reigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. there fell a very great Peſtilence
in the Eaſt-Indies, among the <hi>Tartariaens, Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> which
laſted the ſpace of ſeven yeeres: thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh the feare whereof, many of the
Heathens willingly offered themſelves to become Chriſtians. And ſhortly
after, by reaſon of Paſſengers from one Province to another, the ſame
Peſtilence was diſperſed in many Chriſtian Kingdomes, and amongſt other
places brought into <hi>England;</hi> where it was ſo forcible all over the Land
that not onely Men, but alſo Beaſts, Birds and Fiſhes were ſmitten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and found dead with Botches upon them. Alſo among men, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that were alive, were ſcarcely ſufficient to bury their dead. At which
time, with the reſt that then dyed of the Plague, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,
Blanch,</hi> Dutcheſſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> ended their
lives. So that in one yeere, in a little plot of ground of thirteene Acres
compaſſe, then called <hi>Spittle-croft,</hi> and now the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
50000 perſons, beſides all them that were buried in the Church-yards
and divers places in the Fields.</p>
            <p>Our Viſitations, though our ſinnes exceed, have been more gentle: For
in the firſt great Plague in our memory, after the loſſe of <hi>New-haven</hi> from
the firſt of January 1562. to December 1563. there dyed of the Plague,
twenty thouſand, one hundred, thirty ſix.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond great Viſitation, from the 20. of December 1592. to the
23. of the ſame month, in the yeere 1593. dyed in all 25886. of the Plague
in and about <hi>London,</hi> 15003. And in the yeere before, 2000.</p>
            <p>In the third great Viſitation which it pleaſed God to ſtrike us with, at
the comming in of King <hi>James</hi> of happy memory, there dyed from the 17.
of December 1602. to the 14. of July 1603. the whole number in <hi>London</hi>

            <p>From the 23. of December, 1602. unto the 22. of December 1603. there

favourable Phyſicion of ſicke ſoules and bodies, looke downe upon
thy ſinfull, yet proſtrate ſervants, the people of the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> who
are every where heart-ſtrucke with the Arrowes of thy angry Viſitation:
We have ſinned, we have ſinned, we have grievouſly offended, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy grace there is no helpe, being now ſhunned and deſpiſed, even of
all the Countrie people round about us; for whom, notwithſtanding, wee
earneſtly pray, as for our ſelves: beſeeching thee, of thy unmeaſurable
goodneſſe, not to looke upon them according to their deſerts, but to have
mercie on them and us; and ſtay thy heavie hand from them as well as
from us. O Lord God of mercy, be good to us, and looke not upon our
ſinnes: for if thou weigheſt the offences of man, no fleſh ſhall ſtand before
thee. We have ſinned, we confeſſe, O Lord, we have ſinned, there is no
righteouſneſſe in us, nor any helpe but thine. O then, let thy Angell ſtay
his hand, as he did at thy mercifull appointment, when <hi>David</hi> offending
thee, ſaw the Sword over <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Let the doores of our hearts bee
ſprinkled with the Blood of that Immaculate Lambe, Chriſt Jeſus, that
the ſlayer may paſſe by us, as he did when the firſt borne in <hi>Aegypt</hi> were
ſmitten with the Peſtilence. O God, thou canſt ſlay and reſtore againe,
ſtrike into ſickneſſe, and give health; for thou art onely a Saviour. O
God, the Maker of us all, looke mercifully on thy workmanſhip. O God,
the Saviour of us all, be an Interceſſor to thy Father for us. O God the
Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter of us all, inſpire us with true repentance, that
we may humbly ſeeke, and ſuddenly finde mercie from the Holy Trinitie;
one God in unitie, ever to be honoured, while man hath breath, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
any being. Have mercy, O God, have mercy, O God: for to thee
mercy belongeth, which all true Repentants purchaſe in our Redeemer
Jeſus: in whoſe Name we beſeech thee to free us and our Brethren, from
this fearefull Viſitation: concluding theſe our requeſts with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
