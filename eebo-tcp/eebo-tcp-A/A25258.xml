         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CHARACTER
OF A
Bigotted Prince, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT has been the great unhappiness of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> for some Years last past, to be troubled with
two very Different sort of Persons of quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Tempers; the one Party of so very Costive a
Faith, that they could believe nothing, and the other of so
easy a Belief that they could swallow every thing; the
first of these could not see the Sun of Truth in its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Meridian; and even Mathematical Demonstration signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
nothing in order to persuade them; they could not
(or at least would not) see their Native Country hurried
to the very Jaws of Ruine, and imitated <hi>Nero</hi> in his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
who could unconcernedly Tune his Harp when <hi>Rome</hi>
was in Flames; every thing about em seem'd pleasant and
gay, they never suffered their minds to be rufled with anxious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30191:5"/>
Thoughts for the Future, so they enjoy'd the present, and
observ'd in the Literal (but corrupted) sence the command of
our Saviour, to take no care for the Morrow; the most
surprizing Relations mov'd them not a jot, and they gave as
equal a Credit to an Information or Confession upon Oath,
as they would have allow'd to a Chapter in <hi>Rablais</hi> his
History of <hi>Garagantua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other were of a quite different stamp, they could cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
the most improbable Stories, and the most far fetcht Lyes
were with them esteem'd as Oracles; they were ever at
<hi>Coffee-houses</hi> or places of such resort, still listning to every
idle Pamphleteer's Discourse, with more Attention than to a
Sermon; they could not see a Chimney on Fire, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
some Treachery they believ'd was in agitation; and
a Drunken Midnight Quarrel in the Streets Allarm'd their
Thoughts into the Belief of a Massacre; they had nothing
in their Mouths but Plots and Designs; and Holy Writ it
self stood upon the same bottom in their Creed with some
Witnesses Depositions; their Imagination hag-rid with Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
and Fears, daily presented them with such frightful
Scenes, that they were not only uneasy to themselves, but
likewise to all about them, which render'd their Days unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and their Nights unquiet, insomuch that some of them
durst not go to Bed for fear next Morning they should wake
and find their Throats Cut.</p>
            <p>From these two very corrupt Humours in the late times,
were produced those two odious Characters of <hi>Whigg</hi> and
<hi>Tory,</hi> which were handed about so long in Jest, that they
soon turn'd Earnest, and he was thought either a Knave or
a Blockhead who would not suffer himself to be Dignified
or Distinguished by one of those Titles. This Humour
continued for some Years with great Violence and Disorder,
during the latter end of the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second;
in all which time tis obvious whoever wore the Crown, a
great Person then at Court manag'd Affairs at the Helm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30191:5"/>
That <hi>great Prince</hi> (who had seen both the Extreams of a
Prosperous and an Adverse Fortune) by his Death Yeilded
the Throne to his only <hi>Brother,</hi> in the beginning of whose
Reign the two Discriminating Names before mention'd
seem'd to have been utterly forgotten; the former in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Prince</hi> the Darling of their thoughts and wishes now
become a Monarch, and the latter in their mistaken apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of his unexpected Clemency in affording them Liberty
of Conscience.</p>
            <p>The Storm was now abated, and Mens Tempers grew
more compos'd, the Virtues of the Soveraign fill'd every
Mouth with His Praises; His Goodness, His Justice, and His
Piety was the Theme of common Discourse, and nothing
but the Name of <hi>James the Just</hi> heard in the most ordinary
Conversations.</p>
            <p>It does not become a Subject too nicely to inquire into the
Miscarriages of a <hi>Crown'd Head;</hi> but this must be confest,
very ill things were done, even to the Alteration of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
both of our Religion and Government; and this
must be own'd by every one whose Ears are not stopt by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Prejudice or Partiality.</p>
            <p>'Twould be vain labour to descend to particulars in a
Discourse which is design'd to be of another Nature. The
Jewish Feast of Tabernacles, tho' long time Abrogated by
the coming of our Saviour, hinders not, nor forbids me to
reflect on the Dangers I escap'd in the Wilderness. I may
Lawfully, I think, select such Days in the Year to consider
how Corporations were Regulated, Bishops Imprison'd, and
other Irregularities committed in the late Reign, without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
a Conventicle, and there in some lewd Harrang
swell every Miscarriage to a prodigious greatness. The
Actions of Princes (Evil ones especially) are their own proper
Heralds, and every one of his Subjects carries some short
Remarks of his Reign in their Memories.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:30191:6"/>
I do not believe that History can parallel the Joys and
Triumphs of any Nation upon their Deliverance from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
with the universal Triumphs of the <hi>English</hi> upon
the never to be forgotten late <hi>Revolution;</hi> they seem'd like
Men kept a long time in Durance, and now were blest with
the sweets of Liberty; nay, even some of our present <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merers</hi>
themselves were most forwardly Active to shew their
Zeal for the then <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> who by his coming seem'd
to open the Scene of a new World, and restore the <hi>English</hi>
to the Poet's time of the Golden Age again.</p>
            <p>But like true <hi>Israelites,</hi> we long again for the Onions and
Garlick of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and would fain be under our old Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters
once more; the Wound which was seemingly Heal'd,
is now broke out again, and what we lost in the Antient <hi>Tory,</hi>
we find reviv'd in the Modern <hi>Jacobite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were told in a Prophetick Discourse some years since,
what Treatment we were to expect if a <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Romish</hi>
Communion should settle upon the Throne; the effects of
which every one who is not wilfully Blind must acknowledg.
Did he not drive <hi>Jehu-like</hi> in a full Carreer to <hi>Rome?</hi> Were
not his <hi>Emisaries</hi> in every great Town in <hi>England</hi> Regulating
Corporations, and Poisoning the Minds of the People with
Popish Doctrins? Were not all places of Trust both Civil
and Military fill'd up with those of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whom he made use of for his own ends? Were they
not come to an excessive hight of Impudence both in their
Sermons and Discourses? Was not the Torrent swell'd so
high that they hourly expected the Deluge? Were not the
Fences of the Law (the Security of the Subject) attempted to
be broke down? And <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> when in Opposition to
the Princes will, be valued no more than a cancell'd Deed of
Conveyance; Was not an <hi>Embassador</hi> sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and a
<hi>Nuntio</hi> Entertain'd here (to settle the Protestant Religion no
doubt) and a thousand other Practices committed as directly
opposite to the Interest of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, as Fire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30191:6"/>
to Water. Was all this done in a corner? Were not
their Actions as barefaced as the Sun? And after all this,
and the Deliverance we Enjoy, must we go into the House
of Bondage again, and put on those Fetters we so lately
shook off?</p>
            <p>Let the seeming warmth of this Parenthesis be a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd;
yet I must confess, such considerations as these are
almost valid enough to justify a Passion, and make Anger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
no Fault; for were the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> the only Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Rights of the <hi>late King James,</hi> the wonder would
be little; bodies often Sympathise at a distance, and they by
several Obligations are bound to wish him Success; and
while they terminate in empty Hopes, let them still regale
themselves with their airy Diet; I pity the deluded Creatures,
but cannot blame them, because they Act upon their own
Principles; and 'twould be as unnatural for them not to Pray
for his Return, as for a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> in hopes of the <hi>Popedom,</hi>
to wish success to the Protestant Forces; or a <hi>Calvinist</hi> to
Drink a Health to <hi>Monsieur Catinat:</hi> But when a sort of Men
guided, as they pretend, by the Dictates of an unerring
Conscience, shall at this time of day openly declare for an
exploded Interest, and these <hi>Protestants</hi> too, Men no ways
leven'd with Popery, or any of her Doctrin's, but Zealous
Maintainers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Devout and Pious,
Charitable and Just, in the chief Employments of the <hi>Church,</hi>
and the Brightest of the <hi>Golden Candlesticks:</hi> For these so
openly to declare their Aversion to this Present Government,
and their Fondness for the Last, is what does not a little ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and surprise (to use an Expression of Mr. <hi>Bays</hi>) and comes
almost as near to a Miracle as <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A late very Eminent Doctor of the Church, when the
Prosecution was Violent against the Dissenters, wrote a
most Learned Tract, concerning the Nicety of a Scrupulous
Conscience; wherein he very curiously Anatomizes the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Meanders and turnings of that invisible Operation, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30191:7"/>
Proves that Humour, Discontent and Interest do frequently
wear the Livery of <hi>Conscience.</hi> How nice soever some may
be in point of Religion, I wish these Gentlemen could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
themselves from the forementioned Disguise with which
they masquerade their Political Conscience.</p>
            <p>One would wonder what strange bewitching Sophistry the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes use of to blind the Understandings of
her Votaries, to that degree, that they are continually
mistaking their own Interest, and tamely to deliver up their
Bodies, Souls, Reputation and Fortunes for the Reversion
of <hi>Purgatory</hi> hereafter, only for the slight gratification of
their humours here; and I appeal to the greatest asserter of
King <hi>James</hi> his Interest, if they can produce any Crown'd
Head in <hi>England</hi> since the Conquest, who was half so Infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and Bigotted to the Interest of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the
<hi>late King:</hi> Indeed we Read of a Religious <hi>Edward,</hi> and a
Pious, Devout <hi>Henry;</hi> but our <hi>English</hi> History cannot afford
us one Instance of a Prince who would Sacrifice his own
Honour, his Kingdoms Safety, his Interest Abroad, and the
Love of his Subjects at Home, meerly out of a mistaken
Zeal to the Advancement of the <hi>Romish Faith;</hi> the most
solemn Oaths and Protestations esteem'd do more than words
of Course; and that which was held Sacred amongst all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
valued as nothing in competition with a Command
from the Apostolick Chair: The old <hi>Lady at Rome</hi> with all
her Wrinkles, has still some Charms to subdue great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and tho she has Abus'd, Depos'd, and Murther'd so
many of her Lovers, yet she finds every day some new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
who are proud of her Charms; a Practice which
comes as near a Miracle, as any that <hi>Church</hi> in her <hi>Legends</hi>
can boast of; and I hope some passages in the late Reign are
not so forgotten, but they may serve to justify the truth of
the Assertion.</p>
            <p>Indeed for our amusement we were once told by a popular
Pen, <hi>That allowing a King upon the</hi> English <hi>Throne, Principled
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30191:7"/>
for Arbitrary Government and Popery, yet he was Clog'd and
Shackl'd with Popular and Protestant Laws, that if he had ne're
so great a mind to't, there was not a Subject in his Dominions
would dare to serve him in his Design.</hi> How true this Assertion
has since prov'd, let any indifferent person judge; the <hi>late
King</hi> himself both dar'd and found no small number of his
Subjects as resolute as their Master, to alter the whole Frame
of the <hi>English</hi> Government; he found not Men only of his
own Communion, but Men of all Religions, or rather of no
Religion at all, whose desperate Fortunes push't 'em on to
the most daring Enterprises;' his single Command added Life
to their Motions; and no wonder he found Tools to Work
withal, when all the Obligations of Law were shrunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the small compass of a Princes Will, and the musty Lines
of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> dwindled to a <hi>Sic volo, sic jubeo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several other artifices were us'd, to let us conceive a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Prince no such terrible Bugbear as common Fame repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
him; as that the Idolatrous Superstition of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> was by a long series of time so worn off the minds
of the People, and the Reformation so strongly Rooted, the
<hi>Church of England</hi> so firmly Establish'd, the <hi>Romanists</hi> so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
for their Innovations in Doctrin and Absurdity in
Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it was impossible ever to fix Popery
here: But, alas, 'twas meer Delusion, we quickly saw through
the Juggle, and the <hi>State-Quacks</hi> discover'd their Leigerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
tricks too openly; and had not Almighty God by a
most surprising, and almost unparllel'd Providence Deliver'd
us, I know not by this time, but that the Name <hi>Protestant</hi> had
been as odious in <hi>England,</hi> as the Term of <hi>Hugonot</hi> is now in
<hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciscans</hi> left their Cells
in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</hi> and the <hi>Savoy,</hi> to have Sung their <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Coelorum</hi> in all the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not Ignorant how some Persons do still Magnifie
the Merits of the <hi>late King,</hi> as to his Private Virtues, as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Descended of the Blood Royal, his Inviolable tenderness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30191:8"/>
for his Friend, the exact Correspondency of his Mouth and
Heart, his Courage against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. but these were
glimmering Rays of his, which shin'd upon some few only;
for when he came to his Meridian, they chang'd their Nature,
and the scorching Beams of his Zeal for his Religion got the
Ascenednt of all his other Accomplishments, which so clouded
his discerning Faculties, that he mistook his Friends for his
Enemies, and his Enemies for his Friends; the most sage and
deliberate Advices given him in opposition to beloved <hi>Jesuits,</hi>
were censur'd as intrenchments upon his Prerogative, and
the single <hi>Ipse Dixit</hi> of <hi>Father Peters,</hi> valued above the Joynt
Council of the Realm; the Colledges of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridg</hi>
esteem'd as Nurseries of Hereticks, and the President and
Fellows of <hi>Magdelen Colledg</hi> most illegally Ejected from their
just Rights, to receive upon the Foundation a sort of Sparks
who were neither Schollars nor Gentlemen. Priviledg was
swallow'd up by Prerogative, <hi>and Know I am your King,</hi> was
a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to all manner of humble Petitions and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances;
his <hi>Priests,</hi> those fatal Scorpions, he so hugg'd in
his Bosom, were the chief Incendiaries, and contrary to our
known Laws, swarm'd over from <hi>Doway</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
gaping after Preferments, which they needed not have
wanted, could his Will alone have placed them in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Dignities; they must be humbly content with Titular
and Imaginary Bishopricks <hi>in Nubibus,</hi> till the stubbern Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
who Enjoy'd 'em, would at once part with their Reasons
and their Livings together.</p>
            <p>But the greatest occasion of his Arbitrary Government,
and the <hi>Aera</hi> from whence he may date all his late Misfortunes,
was his Friendship with the <hi>French King,</hi> a right Son of <hi>Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
whose Hand is lifted up against every Man's, and every
Man's against his; a Man who has not one single Virtue to
counterballance that prodigious stock of Vices which harbour
in his Breast; a Man who has built a Reputation upon the
Ruins of his Neighbours Kingdoms; and yet with this <hi>Gallick
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30191:8"/>
Nimrod</hi> did the Unnfortunate King <hi>James</hi> contract a mo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
lasting Alliance.</p>
            <p>I perceive I am stopt in my Assertion, and a little Dabler
in Politicks challenges me to prove the Contract: 'Tis true,
we cannot shew the Original Deed, with their Signets and
Names affixt to it; but he must surely be Delivered over to
Unbelief, who cannot credit such Circumstances as serve to
clear the matter from all doubt or hesitation: Who Promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Marriage of the Duke with the Princess of <hi>Modena?</hi>
Who Defraid the Charges of her Journy, and Paid the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of her Fortune, but the <hi>French King?</hi> If this will
not satisfie, pray examine <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letter to Sir <hi>William
Throgmorton;</hi> the Duke's then agent at the <hi>French Court,</hi> where
he tells him, <hi>That when the Duke comes to be Master of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the King of</hi> France <hi>will have all reason to promise himself
all that he can desire; for according to the Dukes mind, the Interest
of the King of</hi> England, <hi>the King of</hi> France, <hi>and his Own, are
so closely bound up together, that 'tis impossible to separate them one
from the other, without the ruin of them all three; but being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they must notwithstanding all opposition, become Invincible:</hi>
There are other Letters between Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> and <hi>Father le
Chaise</hi> which carry such undeniable Marks of a Contract be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween
<hi>King James</hi> when <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Louis le Grand,</hi> that
none but those Devested of common Sense, can have reason
to doubt it: If this is not throughly convincing, let any one
consult the <hi>Memorial</hi> given in by <hi>Monsieur d' Avaux,</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Embassador at the <hi>Hague, Sept. 9th</hi> 1688, which if the
curious Reader desire to see at length, I refer him to the 1st
Vol. of <hi>Mercurius Reformatus,</hi> or the <hi>New Observator,</hi> No. 5.
wherein the Ingenuous Author of that Paper, does prove it
beyond all possibility of Contradiction. There are several
other Arguments as unquestionable as the former, which for
brevity's sake, I omit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:30191:9"/>
And now 'tis time to breath a while, and consider what
are the those Regal Virtues, of which, if a Prince has not a
share, he will hardly answer the expectations of his People,
nor the ends of Government; they are generally recon'd to
be Piety, Prudence, Justice, and Valour; but if his Piety
degenerates into <hi>Biggottism,</hi> his Prudence into unsteady Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merousness,
his Justice into acts of Cruelty and Severity,
and his Valour into Rashness and Obstinacy; what ever his
Flatterers may say of him, yet certainly he is unfit to
Govern.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader apply the Character where he pleases, and
find a <hi>Crown'd</hi> Head whereon to fix these four Vices, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
name call'd Virtues. How much of the Comparison
may fall to the <hi>late King's share,</hi> we know not; but of his
<hi>Bigottry, Zeal,</hi> (or what other Name you please) to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
I believe by this time the World wants not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd;
for if for Arguments sake we should allow (what we
cannot believe) <hi>viz.</hi> a Merit in Religious Actions, certainly
the <hi>late King</hi> has bid the fairest for <hi>Cononization,</hi> after his
Death, of all the Crown'd Heads who have liv'd these two
<hi>Centuries,</hi> who would Sacrifice three Kingdoms to the Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios
of a Priest; but be it unto him according to his Faith;
and indeed it is but just he should expect a Crown in Heaven,
if for its sake he has lost one on Earth.</p>
            <p>This in a few Lines we have given the Character of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted
unfortunate Prince: But leaving him at his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
let us a little return homewards, and observe a sort of
Men who are so very Impatient under this Government, that
their very Looks express their Discontent; they are as uneasy,
tho in the Sun-shine of Liberty, as the Slaves at <hi>Algeirs</hi> are
with their Chains; they cannot take an Oath to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that will Protect 'em, and nothing will ever satisfy them,
but the Return of their Old Master.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:30191:9"/>
Good God! to what stupidity is Mankind arriv'd? To
dislike the most easy Government in the World, to Espouse
that which is the most Barbarous in its Nature: A Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that in measures of Cruelty exceeds ev'n the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Communities on the Coast of <hi>India!</hi> A Government so
debauch'd with false Religion, that considering the Interest
of Mankind, and the ill usage it exposes Mens Persons and
Fortunes to, it could be almost wisht that such a Religion had
never been known in the World. In the name of Wonder,
what would these Gentlemen have? They were many of
them (at least many pretended to be) uneasy under the last,
when Popery and Arbitrary Government seem'd to come as an
Armed Man; and now they are almost beyond the possibility
of such Fears, they Murmur: Of what Mercurial Temper
are the <hi>English</hi> compos'd, that they can never be setled?
Popery was once their Terrour, and now that is remov'd,
they fear they know not what; like Men in Feavers, they
are Restless in this Bed, and when remov'd to another, are as
uneasy in that. I appeal to any of them, if the pressures
that gawl their Shoulders, either in their Persons or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
was not brought upon themselves by their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Obstinacy, for which Conscience is still the pretence;
the Government would have them Live easy, and enjoy their
Estates and Preferments both Civil and Ecclesiastical, nor
would molest them while quiet they might sit under their
Vines and under their Fig-Trees, but they will not; and if
Men will turn themselves out of all, in compliance to a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
who can help it?</p>
            <p>It must be confest, that when once the Persons of Kings
grow Contemptible, or little in the Eyes of their Subjects,
their smallest Miscarriages are Magnified to that degree, as
very often Terminates in their Ruin: But there is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
on the other hand, when the worst Actions of Princes
shall be thought Innocent (for according to some persons
Creed, <hi>a King can do no wrong</hi>) and the belief of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30191:10"/>
is carried so high, that even his Arbitrary Proceedings
shall be winkt at: This is to exceed even the Arts of the
<hi>Turkish Policy,</hi> who pay not a greater Veneration of their
<hi>Grand Signiors,</hi> than some of our Zealots do to the <hi>late King,</hi>
they solemnly drink his Health upon their Knees, and Pray
for him in their Private Devotions affectionately; nor do
they forget him in the Publick <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> for
every one knows the secret Mystery of Bless and Protect <hi>the
King</hi> our Governour. To be short, nothing will serve them
but his Return, to Redeem them out of their imaginary
Bondage; for this they Wish, for this they Pray: Nay,
the Jews themselves do not at this day with greater impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and mistaken Zeal expect the coming of the Messias, than
these kind of Men do for the Restauration of <hi>King James</hi> to
his Crown and Dignity.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore a little examin what specious Pretences
they have for such an Ambition; and tho indeed they are as
shy of Revealing the Secret, as they would be of a Fairy
Treasure; yet by some expressions occasionally dropt in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
'tis not very hard to Conjecture some of them.</p>
            <p>As first, they are great pretenders to Moral Justice; they
say King <hi>James</hi> had a great deal of Wrong done him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Soveraign Prince, they are Obliged to see him
Righted. Are they so? but who gave them the Commission?
Their Conscience, they will tell you, but their Conscience is
so great a Riddle, that it will never be Expounded; their
Conscience would have King <hi>James</hi> in his Throne again, tho
never so much Bloodshed and Miseries might ensue; their
fondness to his Person closes their Eyes and stops their Ears
to all the Calamities their fellow Subjects must necessarily
suffer by such a Revolution; nay, this very Conscience of
theirs, was one of the chief occasions which prompted the
<hi>late King</hi> to commit those Arbitrary Actions in his shortliv'd
Reign; they told him he might do what he pleas'd, and for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30191:10"/>
for his Actions, was accuntable to none but <hi>God,</hi> tho he
should turn upside-down our Laws, Religion, and Liberties,
and that we were tamely to submit our Necks to the Blow
when ever he should Command it, in spite of Laws, tho
it were in the Power of our Hands to save our selves by a
just Defence. No wonder then upon such considerations as
these, and prompted by the Native Cruelty of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he permitted those unaccountable Actions to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and he is as much beholding to those fiery sticklers
for the loss of his Crown, as he was to Father <hi>Pretre's,</hi> and
other Jesuetick Advice.</p>
            <p>It is the Nature of Mankind to covet Liberty, and to have
all things about them easy and free: Now I would ask these
Gentlemen what greater Freedom they can expect, were their
beloved Prince Reinstated in his Throne again, than what
they now Enjoy? Are not their Fortunes secur'd to them
by the best Laws in the World? Who goes about to Invade
their Properties, or devest them of their Estates? Yes, they
Reply, some <hi>Bishops</hi> and other Ecclesiastical Persons have lost
their Livings and Means of Subsistence, because:—Yes, the
<hi>Because</hi> is very well known, because they cannot take the
Oaths. It would have been wisht, that those Reverend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
would have Inform'd the World with the Reasons of
their Non-compliance, which might have regulated the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
minds of some of their <hi>Bigotted</hi> Followers, who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
even the Votaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in an Implicit
Faith; and believe 'tis not Lawful for them to Swear to the
Government, because Dr. such a one refuses the Oaths. A
very pretty conclusion; but allowing it to be Conscience in
their own acceptation, I believe when Humour, Prejudice, and
some other niceties are separated from it, the thing call'd
Conscience will appear in this Case but an Airy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:30191:11"/>
Some of the most Moderate of them, I confess, who are
great Lovers of the <hi>late King,</hi> could wish him here again
without the Assistance of the <hi>French;</hi> but if their Faith
was but as strong and powerful as their Hopes, they
might certainly remove Mountains, and joyn the <hi>Alps</hi> to
St. <hi>Michaels-Mount</hi> in <hi>Cornwall;</hi> but these are Wishes as
Improbable as they are Impossible to be Effected; for you
may as easily separate Heat from Fire, or Moisture from
Water, as divide the Interests of <hi>King James,</hi> from those
of <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth;</hi> no, no, like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twins
they must Live and Dye together; and therefore these
fort of Men deserve rather our Pity than our Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But there are another sort who will have their Old
Master return again, though by never such indirect
Means; and are as glad when they hear of the Success
of the <hi>French Arms,</hi> as they would be to Receive the
News of the Death of some Decrepid Relation of theirs,
who by his <hi>Exit,</hi> leaves them a plentiful Estate. And let
<hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Flanders, Savoy,</hi> and all the <hi>Confederate Countries</hi> be
reduc'd to heaps of Ruins, so their <hi>Dear King</hi> may come to
his Throne again, though he Enter'd the City of <hi>London</hi>
with <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> and <hi>Boufflers</hi> at the Head of fifty Thousand
<hi>French</hi> Dragoons.</p>
            <p>These are hopeful Protestants i'faith, blessed Reformers
and Defenders of the Christian Church; fresh Straw and a
dark Chamber, cooling Purges, Leeches and Blood-letting are
only fit for such as these; they are Mad beyond the cure
of <hi>Hellebore:</hi> But because it is necessary sometimes to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
a Fool according to his Folly. Let us ask em what
mighty Mischiefs have the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi>
the Electors of <hi>Brandenburgh, Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30191:11"/>
of <hi>Germany,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
done these Gentlemen, that they are so mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with them, and could wish the Sculls of all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
were to Pave the way for King <hi>James</hi> his Accession to a
forfeited Throne? how came these involv'd in the Quarrel?
must King <hi>James</hi> his supposed Right, like <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Lean
Kine, swallow up all other Princes Properties? What has
he done to be so much the Darling of Mankind, that
other Mens Glories must be Ecclips'd to make his Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
Rays shine the Brighter? Are great <hi>Britain,
France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be the only <hi>Goshen,</hi> and must there be
Darkness all over <hi>Europe</hi> besides? These Men are a most
strange sort of Political Predestinarians, who will allow no
Peace nor Plenty to any but their Master and his Friends;
and it is hard to be determin'd, whether Folly or Madness
has the greatest share in the Composition of their Hopes.
All Pity and Humanity to their fellow Creatures is laid
aside, and they seem to exceed the <hi>Indian Cannibals</hi> in acts
of Cruelty, for how severe they may be to Strangers, they
yet seldom Devour those of their own Tribe; no Man
that hears 'em Discourse, can certainly keep within the
bounds of Moderation; for who ever has the patience to
hear their Arguments, will certainly expect better. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> from the <hi>Lucida Intervalla</hi> of a Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
            <p>The Love of ones Country, was ever by the most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
Nations, esteem'd as the Characteristical mark of a
Noble Soul, and <hi>Vincit Amor Patriae,</hi> seem'd to be Written in
indelible Marks upon their Breasts; for this the ancient
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were Famous, Remarkable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is the Relation <hi>Livy</hi> gives us of <hi>Curtius</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi>
who when the Earth was sunk with a wide Gap in the
Middle of the <hi>Forum,</hi> and it was told, it would not come
together again, unles some Prime young Nobleman were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30191:12"/>
put into it; he to Deliver his Country, mounted on
Horse-back, Rode into the Gaping <hi>Chasma:</hi> But we on
the contrary, have a sort of Men amongst us, who would
gladly see their Native Soyl over run with a knot of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
to gratifie one Mans Lust of Power on the one hand,
and their unaccountable Humour on the other. I would
fain ask them, supposing the possibility of such Success,
whether the <hi>French</hi> Arms are so well bred, as to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
them from the rest of the <hi>English</hi> Sufferers by such
a Revolution (to which that of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> was but a civil Visit)? I fear like <hi>Tarpeia</hi> the Vestal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
who Covenanted with the <hi>Sabines</hi> to betray the Capitol
to them, for what they wore on their lest Arms; but
when they were Entred, into of Bracelets which she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
they threw their Targets upon her, and Pressed
her to Death; so would these very Men Suffer in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamity; for the <hi>French,</hi> as well as other Nations,
agree in this, <hi>That though they Love the Treason, they Hate the

            <p>It was the Speech of a Moderate Gentleman in the

was high against the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Establish'd
Church, Gentlemen,</hi> (says he) <hi>let us see the Model of your
New intended Superstructure, beforè you pull down the Old one.</hi>
If we should ask some of these Fiery <hi>Bigots</hi> for the Interest
of the <hi>late King,</hi> what Advantages they can propose to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30191:12"/>
themselves by his Return; unless like the unrewarded
poor expecting <hi>Caviliers</hi> at the Restauration of King
<hi>Charles the Second,</hi> they can be content to be Loyal and
Starve; for if the latter end of King <hi>James</hi> his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Reign, should be of a piece with his first real begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he will still neglect his truest Friends, and stick close
to Flattering Enemies. With so deep a Root has the Advice of
a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> about the year 1660, still remain'd in the
Breasts of the Princes, <hi>Oblige your Enemies, and your Friends
will be true to your Interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have wandred from my Subject, by a long, but I
hope, not very Impertinent Digression, and therefore
(asking my Reader's Pardon) return to my Subject, or
rather the Applicatory part of it. We have seen the
Character of the Prince and his Bigotted followers; And
as all things are best set off by Examples, let us now
draw a Parallel or Landscape of the two different Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
of the Reigns of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
and King <hi>James,</hi> and what we are unavoidably to Expect,
should Almighty God in the Course of his Providence,
for our Punishment, and the gratification of some rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Spirits, bring King <hi>James</hi> to his Throne again: Of
the Ease and Tranquility of the first we are certain, but
of the Horrour of the latter, the most terrible Ideas we
can form of it in our Imaginations will come short of the
Life; for as the safety we now enjoy, almost exceeds our
Hopes; so the Stripes we must then feel, will transcend
our very Fears.</p>
            <p>In the Person of the King, we have a Prince who is
truly (what the Historian says of <hi>Titus) Humani generis
Deliciae,</hi> who has centred in his Person all the Valour and
Wisdom of his Ancestors: A Prince so truly Great, that
those Lawrels which add such Lustre to anothers Brow,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30191:13"/>
look but faintly on His, He needing no additional Varnish
to set off His Native Goodness: A Prince, Born to be the
<hi>Arbiter of Christendom,</hi> whom all the Crown'd Heads and
States of <hi>Europe</hi> Adore as the only Person who must break
the Jaws of the <hi>French Leviathan:</hi> Not the greatest Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which so terrify pusilanimous minds, can at all move
Him, who caring not for an inactive inglorious Greatness,
expos'd his Sacred Person to Rescue these ungrateful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
from the moct insupportable Tyranny of Arbitrary
Power; since which, in <hi>Ireland</hi> he gave most Invincible
Proofs both of his Courage and Conduct; the United
Force of <hi>Europe</hi> could not concert their Measures against
<hi>France,</hi> till his Presence Influenced their Counsels at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> to which he went through a thousand Perils at Sea;
after a short Return, He is now gone again to <hi>Flanders</hi>
to head that Prodigious Army: Victory seems to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him in Attempts of War, and his worst Enemies
must own him to have the very Soul of Courage.</p>
            <p>In the Person of the <hi>Queen,</hi> we have a Second <hi>Queen
Elizabeth;</hi> but with respect to her Sacred Ashes, we may
say, the Copy far exceeds the Original. Never did a
Crown'd Lady shew more Conduct and Magnanimity
than when the <hi>French Fleet</hi> was upon our Coast, when her
<hi>Illustrious Husband</hi> was Fighting in <hi>Ireland:</hi> A Princess,
whose thousand Charms make her fit to Rule, and Command
even Respect from her very Enemies (if any such there
are;) her Majesty is Temper'd with so much Mildness,
that at the same time, she neither invites nor forbids Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
the Glory of her own Sex, and the Admiration of
ours.</p>
            <p>Under these two <hi>Illustrious Persons</hi> is <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. at
this time Govern'd by the most exact Laws that ever
were made, the Prerogative of the King not Dominaring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30191:13"/>
over the Priviledges of the People, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Flourishes, not withstanding the Peevishness of some
of her Votaries; and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> enjoy their Liberty of
Conscience without Design: The great Blessing of this
Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> does frequently Meet, and
their Votes are Unanimous for Supplies for the Nations
Good: The Taxes by them Levied are (excepting by some
few discontented Spirits) willingly Paid, and the People
satisfied that their Mony is Employ'd for the uses intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not Lavishly and Unaccountably thrown away on Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> every Man enjoys his Plentiful or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Competent
Fortune, with all the freedom Imaginable; no Tricks are
made use of to Decoy us into Slavery; from the very
Prospect of which, the <hi>King</hi> designs by his utmost Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to free us by appearing himself in Person at the
Head of the Confederate Army, in opposition to the Power
of <hi>France:</hi> He designing to Rescue the Glory of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Nation from that Stupidity, the Luxury, and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy
of the late Reigns had obscur'd it with; and we
have nothing to render us unhappy but our own ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Fears and Jealousies, in which unaccountable Humour,
if we still persist, like the <hi>Seditious</hi> amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> we
shall do our selves more Mischief within the Walls, than
our Enemies could possibly do without, when the Glory
of their City and Nation yeilded to the Arms of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
who could never have Conquered them, had not
their Murmurers within done more Execution to themselves,
than all Battering Rams of <hi>Titus</hi> could possibly Effect
against their Walls.</p>
            <p>But now to shew the Reverse of the Medal. If King
<hi>Jame</hi>'s return to re-assume his justly Forfeited Right, as
no Human Reason can possibly suppose him to come in
without the Assistance of the <hi>French,</hi> let us consider what
a Field of Blood will our Country be; he coming in like a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30191:14"/>
Conqueror, will make us quickly Feel the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Easy Government we now Live under, and
the Insupportable Tyranny we must then endure; his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Zeal for the Defence of the Protestant Religion,
being long since quench't by the Affronts he pretends to
have suffered by those of that Communion; then will <hi>Rome</hi>
Erect her Standard in Defiance to all the Methods of the
Reformation, and Popery become the standing Religion
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>It cannot be suppos'd that the Instructions he has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from his great Patrone <hi>Lewis,</hi> will easily be forgot;
and he who when in a private Capacity would ever hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgive one whom he suppos'd had done him Wrong,
will now be hardly brought to forget a National Indignity;
he will never certainly listen to any Overtures of Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and 'tis impossible to believe that things can be ever
Accomodated between an Incens'd Prince, and (as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses)
a Rebellious People. He has not so long Breath'd
in the Air of <hi>France,</hi> as not to learn its Tyrannical and
Arbitrary Maxims; and the (as he thinks) Meritorious Zeal
of Propagating his own Religion, will let him stick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
how Arbitrary soever, to Establish it. We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
imagin him to be of a Merciful Nature, and that all
shall be forgotten as if never done, and that an Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity
will make all even again; but those who are so
blinded as to believe these fair Promises, et them but
look into an Act of his own, Dated at his Residence in
<hi>Dublin.</hi> And in a Proclamation of his, to his Pretended
Subjects in <hi>Scotland, May</hi> 4. 1689. He is most Graciously
Pleas'd, not only to Incourage his Friends to be Destory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Mankind, but likewise offers them Pardons for
such Inhuman Cruelties: Telling them in the said Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<hi>'Tis his Pleasure they should Rise in Arms, and Assault
and Destory, and what ever Blood-shed and Slaughter, Mutilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30191:14"/>
or Fire-raisings should be done to these Rebels,</hi> (as he calls the
<hi>Scotch) his Proclamation should be their sufficient Warrant</hi> for
such Acts. If this is his Kindness for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation,
can we think the <hi>English</hi> will more civilly be Treated?</p>
            <p>No, no, let us no longer Amuse our selves with Fancies
of his Clemency and Kindness. We live under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where we may be Hapy if we please, and nothing
but our Discontent can render us Miserable; for as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
as there is a Providence, if ever such a Fatal Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should happen, not <hi>Savoy,</hi> nor <hi>Piedmont,</hi> nor all the
places where the Arms of the <hi>French</hi> have Ravag'd, were
ever such Scenes of Blood and Confusion as <hi>England</hi> will
be. We are now in our <hi>Crisis,</hi> and a few Months will, in
all probability, determine the fate of <hi>Europe</hi> in General, and
of our own Country in particular; and upon the Success
of the Confederate Army, Headed by our most Victorious
Prince, depends the Liberty or Slavery of the most Civiliz'd
part of the World.</p>

               <head>Postscript.</head>
               <p>AT the conclusion of this Discourse, I imagin some Smil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reader finding fault, and by his Looks would seem
to tell me the Landskips are as ill Drawn as they are ill Design'd,
and that the Lyon is not so fierce as he is Painted, nor will the
Return of a Prince of the <hi>Romish Commifon</hi> be so Terrible
to his Protestant Subjects as I would seem to represent. But in
Answer to this, I must acquaint the Gentleman, that I fear I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30191:15"/>
have communited an Error on the other Hand, and instead of
adding fierce Colours to make the Piece seem Tremendous: I
have used such faint shadows as do not heighten the Picture. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
and Prejudice are very ill Spectacles, and but too often
cause a false Medium. I have seen a Picture, which if one
lookt Obliquely upon, on the left Hand were represented the Heads of
three fair Ladies; but if you chang'd the Position of your Body,
and stood on the right Hand of the Design, the very same Picture
shew'd you a Monkey and two Parrots. I know not on which
hand my Reader's Judgment stands, which valued Faculty of
ours we find to be very often deluded; for if I may apply a
place in Holy Writ, very pertinent to this purpose, only exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Case of the Father for that of the Son; they who form
such terrible Ideas of the Imaginary Severities they feel under the
present Reign, where they are only beaten with Rods, will at the
Return of their Idoliz'd Prince, be Chastis'd with Scorpions.</p>
