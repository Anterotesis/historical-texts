            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gentleman of 19 years of Age, who had
he lived, might have been as well the
Wonder as the Delight of the Arts, and
been advanced by them amongst the
highest in the Temple of Fame. The
Myrtle and the Cypresse Groves, which
he made more innocent by his Love, shall

               <p>The weaving of one story into another and the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant

<hi>Virgill</hi> himself did often use it, and in my opinion
with a greater grace, making the last word only of his
Verso to be the beginning of the Verse following, as
<q>
                     <l>â€” Sequitur pulcherrimus Astur</l>

                  </q>
                  <hi>Virgill</hi> hath nothing more usuall than this gracefull
way of repetition, as those who are most conversant
with him, can readily witnesse with me. Our Authors
making use of one and the same Verse in several places
is also taken from <hi>Virgill,</hi> as you shall often find in his
Georgicks, which he would never have let passe (being
full twelve years in the compleating of that work) if
he had conceived it would have bin looked upon as an
imperfection either of two much Haste or Sloth, and
this also is often to be found in <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You behold now how many, and what great Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
our Author hath propounded to himself to imitate,
if it be obiected, that it is a disparagement to imitate
any, be they never so excelent (according to that of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race)
O imitatorum stultum pecus;</hi> It is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
to make answer, that <hi>Horace</hi> wrote that in a
criticall hour, when he abounded with a hypercrytical
sense for if you please to look upon the Fragments of
those Greek Poets, which in many books are inserted
<pb facs="tcp:49247:5"/>
at the end of <hi>Pindar,</hi> you shall undoubtedly find that
<hi>Horace</hi> hath translated as much of them as are now
extant word for word, and put them into the first book
of his Odes, which is very easie in this place to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
but that it is much beyond our room, and
a little besides our subiect.</p>

These praelibations may serve not only to discharge our
Author, but to raise him above those accusations which
peradventure some distemper'd Criticks might have
charged him with. The other part of his invention is
intirely his own, smooth yet smart, and as clear as it
<pb facs="tcp:49247:6"/>
is active! Now when all this shall be done at nineteen
years of age, and out of a desire onely to please you,
what entertainment should you give unto it? with what
flowers should you crown his memory, who brought so
many flowers to crown your delight? Take them, and
peruse them, his leaves invite every hand to turn
them over; The young men may read them for their
Information, and with some sympathy of affection;
The old men for their Recreation, The Ladies may
learn them by heart, and repeat them to one another,
for this the Muses, upon their credit, have given me
in charge to impart unto them, That whatsoever they
shall lay forth on his praises (the Book readover)
they will finde it paid back to them in the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.</p>

               <l>But they are far beyond my skill t'unfold,</l>

               <l>And are laid prostrate with the first assault,</l>
               <l>Because, our love makes their desert their fault.</l>
               <l>Then justice, us to some amends should move</l>
