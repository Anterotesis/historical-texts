            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is long since I waited upon your <hi>Highnesse</hi> after the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:57132:3"/>
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> unto the Town of <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> where I took my leave of as much Happiness as could be left.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Royall Father</hi> of ever Blessed Memory, was then alive, a Confessor Royal, and soon after Martyr, for the <hi>Protestant Religion, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Parliaments, the Liberty of the Subject, and the Lawes of the Land.</hi> All which no man ever defended so unto Blood as Himself, nor indeed could any man: For He was butteres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up by especial Grace, high Undestanding, the Pen of a ready Writer and invincible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>Not long after His bloody <hi>Exit</hi> off the Stage of this World, with the general <hi>Plaudit</hi> of good Men and Angels, your Highnesse made an happy escape from St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s, where you now are at more Liberty (God be thanked) then before. I have lov'd the Play of <hi>Hide and Seek</hi> ever since, and with just regard ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour those Gentlemen, who from the <hi>Royall Bo-peep</hi> were grand Instruments to metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize the <hi>Pyrocles</hi> of their Land into a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea.</hi>

            <p>Who would not take this History for a Romance, were it not that the truth thereof is

undeniable? How did the <hi>Red Rose</hi> blush, adorn'd in a Silk Gown and Sattin Petticoat? with what Art and cover of Handkerchiefs or Gloves did you imitate Virgin smiles, even to the beguiling those who knew of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise? the Pilot and Master of the Ship ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carried such a noble Fraight, which was his Barques protection and tutelary power: Not a Tar-paulin but would have throwne his cap at you, while the enamour'd winds followed your Ship with all speed, more to salute the <hi>Royal Passenger,</hi> then to forward the sailes.</p>

For though he died not presently upon the <hi>effugium,</hi> yet, as Queen <hi>Mary</hi> said of the losse of <hi>Callice,</hi> you might find the <hi>sad impressions of that miscarriage</hi> imprinted in her heart.

I have wrote these sollowing Meditations in a time, when it was not a sin, but punishment to observe them. I remember ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that those two famous Prelates of our Church, the Bishop of</hi> London-derry, <hi>and the eminent Scholar Dr.</hi> Gunning, <hi>with many others, were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned for celebrating the</hi> Nativity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>when the</hi> third of September <hi>was kept most religiously for the routing of a King.

If ever there may be a boast of visibility, or of infalibility of a single Church, then modestly we of our Church may lay some small claim to it; which from the scoffs of our neighbours, and the deplored opinion of most of her own spurious children is raised</hi> (Deo Gratias) <hi>like</hi> Job <hi>from the dunghil, more nich, more honoured, more conspicuous then ever: so that I may say of my restored Mother and King, as it was said of</hi> Marius <hi>returning from the Lake of</hi> Minturnum, <hi>where he was forced to skulk from the proscriptions of</hi> Scylla, Catenae, fuga, exilium ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norificaverunt dignitatem, <hi>that is, their Exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Imprisonments, Scornes, Miseries, did imbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon their dignities, and set a varnish upon that Gold, which the evil tongues of those and these dayes had laboured to rust, and with Calumnies Canker-eat and deface;</hi> Victrix causa malis placuit, sed victa Gatono, <hi>I loved the Church when she was unlovely,</hi>

In my Mother the Church her spots are not black Foyles but red, the Red-letter daies being the Ornament of her Year: her Festivals (my present subject) so many pillars as in</hi> Solomon<hi>'s Porch, the beautie and flourish of the building. I do acknowledge that learneder Pens have laboured in this Argument, and I come forth burthened with their just Fames, and must needs incur the censure of an impertinent and superfluous Scribler.</hi> Scribendi Cacoethes <hi>is a Disease incurable, for which there is no dose in our</hi> Pharmacopaea. <hi>I can make no other Apologie then this, that,</hi> Nil est dictum, quod non est dictum prius: <hi>the Mode perchance, the Fashion may be new, but the ground-work is old.

Rome <hi>onely, but was shared among the rest of his Brethren; but in</hi> Phocas <hi>the Emperour's dayes</hi> Boniface the third <hi>usurped the title of</hi> Universal Bishop, <hi>and did affix the name of</hi> Papa <hi>to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man See <hi>onely, though S.</hi> Gregory <hi>before him plainly said,</hi> That whoever did assume that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, was the fore-runner of Antichrist: <hi>What need the</hi> Geneva <hi>Glosse? is not S.</hi> Gregory <hi>enough to state the Question? And in</hi> 142 Lent <hi>was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted at</hi> Rome, <hi>the forementioned</hi> Telesphorus, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Pontifex Maximus: <hi>but as for the business it self, the Antiquity makes no great matter, no more then our long contentions for the Superiority of</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>and</hi> Cambridge, <hi>though in this present Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament my Mother hath got the right-hand side; and to shew my thankfulness for that Vote, I shall tell the noble Suffragators of a piece of</hi> Petrarch <hi>(a Poet too, yet of good authority) wherein speaking of the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Disputative,</hi> Ergo—<hi>he saith,</hi>

               <hi>To wipe off that stain and aspersion from our</hi> Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Tribe, <hi>I wrote these</hi> Meditations, <hi>to shew the World, that it is possible for a Physician of the Lower Form to be</hi> Theologue, <hi>at leastwise to seem</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57132:9"/>
               <hi>to seem to be one: S.</hi> Luke <hi>was a Physician, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and Evangelist; and we own one of the best stories in the world,</hi> The Acts of the Apostles, <hi>and the compleatest Gospel: so S.</hi> Paul <hi>esteems it to that Physician. 'Tis certain, according to practice, our Art doth not so much intend the amendment of the soul as the body, especially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Doctor</hi> Butler <hi>be judge, whose advice to a salacious Patient a little intrencht against the seventh Commandement: But yet that Cure might have been wrought without infringement of the Precept, if the party would have pleased to have taken a wife; and then</hi> Hippocrates <hi>and S.</hi> Paul <hi>might have been reconciled with a</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumfer sorore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conjugem, <hi>and without</hi> Gocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius <hi>the cure had been effected: But to say precisely and peremptorily, that the Physician hath nothing to do in respect of the soul, is more then can be justified: for the Physick of the body is but a preparative for the bettering of the soul, which is highly eased and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Divine contemplation, by emptying a Plethorick cask: how sprightful is the whole man after the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workings of a Vomit, moderat Phlebotomy, or a dose of Pills, or a Purge? 'tis true, we may be</hi> Canes ad vomitum, <hi>and</hi> Sues in coeno volutantes, <hi>but no man</hi> sanae mentis <hi>will dedignifie his body after a noble Wash, but will rather look out clean places, good</hi>

               <l>THe Eighth day Ceremony calls, a Rite</l>
               <l>Of long observance, a Covenant plight</l>
               <l>'Twixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> when his Faith gain'd</l>
               <l>That promis'd Blessing that this day's obtain'd;</l>
               <l>And Circumcision was the Seal, whereby</l>
               <l>That Grant was past to his Posterity;</l>
               <l>And not to his alone, but the whole Earth</l>
               <l>Was to be blest i'th' product of that Birth.</l>
               <l>Here it is tender'd, in the Temple done,</l>
               <l>Legall throughout, as 'twere 'twixt Sun and Sun.</l>
               <l>And now the Covenant-maker doth submit</l>
               <l>To his own Law, which is fulfill'd in it:</l>
               <l>A Passion but continued his whole life,</l>
               <l>How will he end that enters on the <note n="a" place="margin">The Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal Knife of Circumcision.</note> Knife?</l>
               <l>Here the first stroke, the last upon the Crosse,</l>
               <l>Thy Agony then both a greater loss</l>
               <l>Of blood: enter'd in discipline severe,</l>
               <l>This Knife is but <hi>praeludium</hi> to thy Spear:</l>
               <l>Here suffering under Law, and there against,</l>
               <l>Lamb-like from sheering thou to th' Shambles went'st:</l>
               <l>Thy Fore-skin now is clipt, but the next Dart</l>
               <l>Will pierce thee (Man of Sorrow) to the heart;</l>
               <l>And yet nor Speares, nor Whips, nor Nailes, nor Thorns,</l>
               <l>Are so tormenting as unworthy scorns.</l>
               <l>Thus in the rigour of exacting Law,</l>
               <l>Blood from thy Infant-flesh the Priest doth draw;</l>
               <l>Blood from thy side doth after spring, that we</l>
               <l>Might from sanguineous Rites be ever free.</l>
               <l>Water suffices to the same intents,</l>
               <l>And Bread and Wine more kinder Elements;</l>
               <l>Our Sacramentall Dues are easie, mild,</l>
               <l>Which will not hurt i'th' duty the least child:</l>
               <l>Take then them not <hi>in opere,</hi> in fact,</l>
               <l>But let us doe what those sweet Rites exact:</l>

               <l>If your Stars tell what after shall arise,</l>

               <l>Take heed of such predictions, but chief,</l>

               <l>WElcome thou double Jubilee; such things</l>
               <l>Are dark, the Mysteries of God and Kings:</l>
               <l>Uncomprehended that, and this unseen,</l>
               <l>Yet we believe they are, shall be, have been.</l>
               <l>Enthroned Elders fall, and worship Thee,</l>

               </l>
               <l>But our exalted Elders pull down Kings,</l>
               <l>And do themselves create Omnipotent things:</l>
               <l>Yet we, who love th' Old Revelation,</l>
               <l>Do as those Beasts (which did surround the Throne,</l>
               <l>Not ruine it) cry a perpetuall Song</l>
               <l>To God, and for the King: <hi>O Lord, how long?</hi>

               <l>Shall stand, and a perpetuall Basis be:</l>
               <l>Not so of Kings, whose delegated Crowns</l>
               <l>Are in subjection to the Doners frowns.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> is Gods Commission,</l>
               <l>And he pulls down, and setteth up alone:</l>
               <l>Yet do the Heathen rage, and do strange things,</l>
               <l>Disturb the Offices and Rights of Kings,</l>
               <l>Murder their Persons, and the Heire throw out,</l>
               <l>(Kings are no better then Their Lord, no doubt;)</l>
               <l>Yet shall the Anthem still the Beast become,</l>
               <l>These Christs both are, and were, and are to come.</l>
               <l>Is there an Evil (that of punishment,</l>
               <l>Or vengeance) on a cursed Nation sent,</l>
               <l>And is it not from him who raiseth Seas,</l>
               <l>And can as soon the peoples rage appease?</l>
               <l>Boast not thy self, thou high <hi>Babelick-man,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The Lord hath hooks for thee <hi>(Leviathan;)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And though thou swell in thy conceited height,</l>
               <l>With Asies thou must forrage this same night:</l>

Nor with a multitude go on, the cause</l>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is that portion of the year, in which (as the Prophet sayes) the Lord calls for <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Sackloth</hi> and <hi>Ashes,</hi> the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Rites of the Jewish Penitence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we Christians (as well as they of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision) should forsake our beds of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and boords, not onely of excesse, but convenient food, to the dismantling and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating the body, that the soul being made active and unclogg'd of the load of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy scabbard, may be more expedite in the exercise of holy duties. He that is to go a great journey (sayes <hi>Minutius Felix)</hi> doth not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57132:44"/>
load himself, but lighten his garments, lest the balast of his obese and heavy body should sink him in the way. Ships that are for speed and saile are not big bottom'd, but gaunt, and made neat for their quicker dispatches. No man seeing a <hi>Flemmin</hi> and a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> both dress'd for a Race, would ever imagine that the Dutchman should come first to the Goal; wherefore with great care and wisdome hath the <hi>Church of England</hi> called the first day of this Quadragesimal Fast, <hi>Ashwednesday, Dies Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerum,</hi> a day of the most low prostration of our Mind and Flesh to all acts of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In my University it is the day of convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or convening our determining <hi>Batchelors</hi> (the Lamb-skin hopes which the Mother lately yean'd into the first degree of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick honour.) These <hi>Cyens,</hi> Grafts of early learning, meet at a Latin Sermon, where the <hi>Concionator</hi> excites them gravely and apposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to both sobrieties, the abstinence from Lusts and Meats, the Nerves and Sinews of the other, that these young men might be (as <hi>Solomon</hi> wished his) <hi>Rememberers of their Creator in the dayes of their youth;</hi> with which severe pickle if that age be seasoned, you have a Poets warrant,

Their whole life will smell of the ingredients if it took a due and handsome tincture.</p>
               <p>This introductory Sermon is the Parent of many more, solemnly perform'd in another Pulpit at S. <hi>Peters in the East,</hi> and so held on till the Religious grief of the whole <hi>Lent</hi> ends in a joyfull Resurrection Sermon in that place, and two at S. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, which all are and have bin of late years most excellently repeated by two successive admirable sons of <hi>Pia Mater</hi>

                  <hi>memoria:</hi> Which circumstances premised, I shall to the matter of this Meditation, which is the things for which we fast, and from which we fast. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> could not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd to undertake the latter part of this, whose pure and guiltless soul, as it could not be tainted, so it needed none of these auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for its pious support. Holinesse it self, <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall Purity,</hi> wants no <hi>Fulcra Pietatis;</hi> those props are for us mortals made of fragile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures, which are apt to faell and break, if not corroborated and strengthened by continuall covers and shields of Grace and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57132:45"/>
Prayers. And for the things for which we fast (unlesse it were the glory of his Father) Christ also needed not to have undergone this miraculous <hi>Lent,</hi> which no man could ever keep but himself, although some do not forbear to think and say that any man butte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest up in Grace may attain to such perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It were to be wished indeed, but never to be hoped for; therefore the <hi>Montanists</hi> of old, and the <hi>Racovians</hi> of late; and the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> pretenders to highest <hi>Discipline</hi> may prescribe much, but never can take this Dose of Penance, nor observe the Rules they teach others: Nor was this Example of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> set for an <hi>adaequate</hi> Rule, to be imitated either by his Apostles, which were otherwise assisted then any of us, or by any of us, who though our spirits perchance may be willing, yet he knowes our flesh is weak; <hi>Deus non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit ab homine, quod non habet,</hi> and our measures of Grace are proportion'd to our capacities. If we are by Divine assistances holy men, yet men are men still, and not Gods. Let no Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaicall presumption delude us into a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for the experience of our strength and spirituall valour, for fear Satan, that vigilant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57132:45"/>
spie of all our devotions, smell out the pride or hypocrisie which first were of his instilling, and while we think to be <hi>Similes altissimi,</hi> like Christ in this duty, fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (what he never could) the Devil himself. In my small observation I never found the most Atlantick professors, both in Civil and Religious resolution and practice, those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for Monarchy, and the Hierachy in times of peace, I found them fall in the dayes of temptation most sadly. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal magnanimity and great challenge; what a poore come off hath it? how does it end? This Dimock for Christ layes downe the Cudgels at the Quaerie of a poor Damosel, &amp; turnes an Apostate of a Cavalier, untill a Cock (the valiant'st of creatures) allarum'd his affrighted heart, and made him know that it is not good to crow before the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Engagement be begun: 'tis not he that putteth on, but he that putteth off the armor, knows the success of the battel. This diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion pardoned, I shall succinctly touch (for I intend a speech rather then a Tract) the <hi>Res substrata,</hi> or subject of a Fast: And first, the things we fast for, are Faith, assistances of

Which hints unto me the second things from which we are to fast, which are most excellently enumerated in that singularly well composed Prayer of the Letany of our Churches Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, wherein we pray God to deliver us <hi>from all Evil and Mischief, from Sin, from the Crafts and Assaults of the Devil:</hi> Which if avoyded, by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57132:47"/>
necessary consequence Gods wrath and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting damnation will be escaped. And take the concluding Prayer into your Fasts, and say, <hi>From all Sedition and privy Conspiracy</hi> (begot by &amp; arising) <hi>from false Doctrine and Heresie, and from hardness of Heart (which is now called tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Conscience) and contempt of Gods Word and Commandements,</hi> (which is now called <hi>The new Light) Good Lord deliver us.</hi> Thus fast and you shall obtain, not out of the <hi>work done</hi> by you, which is acceptable, but in his fasting, who is onely gracious, and in whose merits all our lame and imperfect works are sanctified.</p>

But what a Scene is in that last Catastrophe? The Sun withdrew his light, the Temple rent assunder, the Graves opened. Let me a little paraphrase here: so was it (under correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) at the departure of our King? The Light, which was more precious then the Suns, the Gospel, was for a time clouded and extinct: Darkness, worse then <hi>Egyptian,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded us, no <hi>Goshen,</hi> but here and there a light, like <hi>ignes fatui,</hi> the Wise and Learned of the Land wandered up and down in Fields and Dens; the Routed Glow-worms of this Land shone for all that in this obscurity. <hi>Temples rent not onely,</hi> but <hi>pull'd down,</hi> or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

by Horsedung, and what is worse, Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Graves opened, and the bodies of new Saints streight appeared, which no man ever knew before. These Graves were truly open Sepulchres, which devoured Widowes Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Royalists Estates, Church, Kings and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Lands.

               <p>IF the noyse of <hi>Ioy</hi> were not as loud as that of <hi>Treason,</hi> we should not on this day hear the news of our own Redemption (said a learned Arch-deacon of <hi>Christ Church)</hi> and to quote an eminent Prelate of the same House, I shall borrow a little Preface from him also, and say, <hi>Sicut infra sic supra, Sicut extra sic intra,</hi> as the <hi>Mine</hi> of the first Treason was in a cellar, and below the House, so the second, which was no lesse in intention, and higher in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, was in the House it self, where depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and most wicked persons out-gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Popish Conspirators. What those intended, these acted, &amp; the Conclave was but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57132:58"/>
the Antimasque to the Consistory. If ever <hi>Lenthall</hi> the faithless Speaker spoke any thing true, it was, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were and are the mortal enemies to <hi>Monarchy.</hi> This was no extorted confession, but the words of a dying sinner, affraid, of the account he was to make to him by whom Kings reign. His vast Estate could not quiet a troubled consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor will <hi>Brandywine,</hi> though it intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the present, comfort or relieve a <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,</hi> or a <hi>Hugh Peters.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> saying he died a Presbyterian, shewed he died a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel in Grain, and in his confession aggrevated his Sin against God, and entail'd to that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I believe the <hi>Prick-ear'd Knight</hi> thought to see a <hi>new War</hi> out of the <hi>Elysian fields,</hi> where he, <hi>Cromwel, Ireton</hi> and <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> are dancing a Fiery Morris, and the three Furies playing upon severe instruments to their deplored Changes. Let not any man or party think, that evil is, or ought to be done, that good may come of it, when it is contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words of the Text: no man is able, or can, or must bring good events out of bad actions; 'tis onely God can do that, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes does, who over-ruling all designes, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57132:58"/>
suffering high mischiefs for ends best known to himself, doth, and providentially did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Presbyterian Contrivances by an Anabaptistical Army, and that Army by an Indigent Rump, and an almost beggar'd City, and the sound rather then the power of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and so restored without a blow, a most Heroick Prince to the Rights which every one of those Factions had deprived his Father of. Who, I pray, but God blasted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> dethroned the hotspur <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> intrapped the politick <hi>Adonijah</hi> and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Ioab,</hi> the revolted Captain of the Host of <hi>Israel?</hi> Men may plot, but God orders the event: What are the tutelary Angels of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes for, but to execute his Will, and to over-rule the mad enterprizes of ambitious, covetous and blood-thirstymen? Nor doe I write this because of the joyfull event onely, but in the midst of the Usurpers glory it was my faith, though I could not assure my selfe the sight of it, that it would be brought to pass.</p>
               <p>These are thy Doing, O God, and it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in our eyes; let our hearts be enlarged with thankfulness, as thy favours are ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

above our deserts. Honourable mention is made by the Parliament for the 29th. of <hi>May,</hi> and in everlasting memory will be the fifth of <hi>November.</hi> Here the Grandfather, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Father of our King was preserved from the blow of unruly fire; and now the joy of our hearts, the breath of our nostrils wonderfully brought in into a gasping and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most expiring Kingdome: <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vision acted to the life, bones, carcases, Skelitons, are re-enlivened, reflesh'd, and walking, not like trees, but trees reverst, men indeed, Royalists, the reputed off-scouring of this Nation, in Feathers, Velvet Jumps, and Gold Belts, as if it had been their <hi>Resurrection day:</hi> an Army, but a moneth ago in pay against their <hi>Prince,</hi> the loyal Reer-guard of his Majesty's person: Red-coats, that routed him at <hi>Worcester,</hi> and my heroick Duke at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> houting and shouting loud <hi>Vive le Roy's,</hi> tossing their caps for joy that he was come again to them, whom God would exalt. The Devils extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confession of our Saviour was the effect of a Divine Power, and these Acclamations were the Finger-work of God, who can turn the hearts of men as it pleaseth him best, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57132:59"/>
stills the raging of the people, and allayes the foaming of the Sea. Let us therefore cry <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to him that sitteth on the Throne,</hi> &amp; <hi>setteth in the Throne:</hi> Let our <hi>Amen</hi> be as a clap of Thunder, and our <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> as the roaring of the Sea.

               <p>Let the Discontented no more repine at what the Lord hath brought about; let them not fight against Heaven, but imitate this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Philip,</hi> the husband of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who when he heard of the loss of his formidable Armado, dispersed and scattered by the Fleet of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (but as it was related to him by a Tempest) he patiently said, He did not send his Navy to <hi>fight against God Almighty.</hi>
