            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

acted in the name of the Society called

            <p>THis Apology of mine ſhall be divided into four
Parts:</p>
            <p>1. The Occaſion of my preſent Perſecution.</p>
            <p>2. The Pretences upon which it is grounded: in
the diſquiſition whereof, I have diſcovered under
how great a Myſtery of Iniquity this Art hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been managed, to the abuſe and detriment of the
Nobility, Gentry, and all the People.</p>
            <p>3. The manner of the <hi>Colledges</hi> vexatious proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ruine me.</p>
            <p>4. An Account of my ſelf, as to my education in
Phyſick, my Practice both here and beyond-Sea, and
my behaviour towards all <hi>Engliſh</hi> abroad; eſpecially
the friends of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>It is not for the ſake of my own particular, that I
appear hear in Print: For, were not my Caſe the
Concern of all other Practitioners; and were not the
people of <hi>England</hi> concerned in having the Gowns
of my Adverſaries thus ſtrip't over their ears, that
they may read and know them naked as they are, and
not be abuſed any longer about matter of Medicine:
And had not I well underſtood, that by their preſent
perſecution, a moſt juſt occaſion hath been given me
to ſerve the Publick, by being ſmart and plain in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to inform the world, as well as to ſerve my ſelf,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49888:3"/>
I would have been content to have born all in ſilence:
But Conſcience of duty hath called me forth.</p>
            <p>In order therefore to the better underſtanding of
the Collegiates Quarrel at me, know, that at my
firſt coming into <hi>England</hi> from my Travels, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of quality, being in a deplorable condition,
having called divers of the Doctors that are beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
to his aſſiſtance, it was all in vain; For, after
many Trials of skill, and uſeleſs applications, they
gave him over: upon which, I being called to the
ſame Patient, did (by Gods bleſſing) recover him.
At which, ſome of his former Phyſicians, being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
when they were told it, could not hold (it ſeems)
but ſaid, they would rather have had him died, than
that I, being none of their Society, ſhould have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him. And for this, with ſome other of my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of the ſame nature, they have waited for
an Opportunity to fall upon me.</p>
            <p>I could give many more like inſtances of time
paſt; For, I have been very willing to entertain
ſuch Patients as they had given over to the Grave:
But I forbear, and may do it upon occaſion, if they
put me to it. That which moves them to moleſt me
now is, partly to pay old Scores of envy, and partly
to ſatisfie the humour of one of their fellow Doctors.
One would have thought, my houſe being in the
fields betwixt <hi>Chelſey</hi> and <hi>Kenſington,</hi> I ſhould have
been far enough out of the reach of malice; but that
Doctor living not far from <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> having
now and then a Patient about <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and my
Neighbour-Villages, it was my hap to be called among
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49888:3"/>
ſome of them, and (by Gods Bleſſing) to cure thoſe
whom he, and ſeveral other of his fellow Doctors of
the Colledge could not. This (it ſeems) was Crime
enough; and upon this it was, that he framed a
complaint againſt me at the Colledge. When St.
<hi>Peter</hi> had cured the <hi>lame man,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> could not
deny he had done a good work; however, it was
againſt their intereſt to tollerate him, therefore they
concluded he ſhould not practiſe any more, though
in the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but contrived how to lay hold
on him upon ſome pretences. So thoſe Gentlemen,
though a great part of my practice be to cure the
poor members of <hi>Jeſus</hi> freely for his ſake, do uſe me
like <hi>Jews,</hi> have been buſie with pretences to diſturb
my Practice. To this purpoſe a Council was called; and
a Junior Doctor of the gang they employed to be
their <hi>Pedee-Solicitor,</hi> as having a buſie humour, and
but little elſe to do; and ſo he is condemned to
carry the <hi>Green-bag</hi> after the other Doctor. The
more grave and cunning of the number ſeem to waſh
their hands of the buſineſs; But theſe are the <hi>two
wights</hi> that now wear the name of the <hi>Colledge</hi> in
the proſecution at law againſt me: and yet there is
alſo a <hi>Tipling Committee of Juniors</hi> of the ſame Society,
that have little elſe to do; to whom they give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what paſſes, and from whom they receive alſo
Counſel and Inſtructions what next to do, to give
trouble to other Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to their pretences for the commencing
of this malicious Suit, they are divers.</p>
            <p>1. The Firſt is their <hi>Foundational pretence, viz.</hi> a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49888:4"/>
Statute ſuppoſed to be made in the 14th and 15 year
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. Whereby a confirmation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have been made of a Patent before
granted by the ſame King <hi>Henry,</hi> wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
perſons (to the number of 6, or 7,) and their
Succeſſors, were conſtituted a Colledge of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and none but themſelves, and ſuch as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by them, to be permitted to practice Phyſick in
<hi>London</hi> City, and 7, miles about. Now, for the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this pretence, give me leave, with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Law of the Land, and its learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
to produce certain <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> whereby it
may appear queſtionable, whether ever any ſuch
Law, as is pretended, were paſſed in due form, as
a Law or Statute in <hi>England</hi> ought to be. One Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
very material is; that it doth not appear by
any Record, that the <hi>Royal Aſſent</hi> was given to it.
'Tis granted, ſuch a Bill was tendred in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the 14th and 15th year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
8th and a copy of ſuch a Bill is to be ſeen in the <hi>Rolls;</hi>
which ſeems to be but a meer <hi>Copie</hi> of ſomewhat that
was ſet on foot then, but periſhed in the birth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
neither at Top nor Bottom of it is to be ſeen,
<hi>Le Roy le veult,</hi> the only <hi>Signature</hi> whereby any thing
is known to be a Law.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Circumſtance</hi> that may induce a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it no Statute, is, becauſe the contents or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
contained in it, are ſuch as militate againſt the
very Spirit of an <hi>Engliſh Parliament,</hi> the great San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
of the publick freedom: For, nothing can be
more difficult than to believe, that a Parliament would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49888:4"/>
concurr to inveſt any ſort of men, with ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Powers over their fellow Subjects, as are
contained in that ſuppoſed Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo ſit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as a Court of Judicature, and there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any practiſers not licenſed by themſelves, &amp; upon
informations without Oath, and without a tryal <hi>per
Pares,</hi> themſelves being the only parties, to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to judge and condemn men; and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remedy by appeal to any Superiour Court in
caſe of Injuſtice, but to ſuffer penalties both in their
purſes by Fines and Amercements, and perſons by
impriſonments, according to ſuch ſentence as they
ſhall pleaſe to paſs againſt them; ſo that they may be
ruined in matter of livelihood, and their bodies rot
in Jayle, till theſe their Judges and Adverſaries
ſhall pleaſe to ſet them free. It cannot enter into any
Engliſh heart to imagine, that our Anceſtors would
entail upon us by Law ſo great a Slavery, ſo
manifeſtly contrary to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and to all the
fundamental Laws and Liberties of the Subject.—If
it be objected, that the ſaid ſuppoſed Statute ought
to be believed a real one, becauſe it appears to have
been in print about a hundred years ago, and hath
been ſince collected into the great Book of Statutes.
Let ſuch <hi>Objector</hi> conſider, how eaſie a matter it
might be to impoſe upon a Printer a Copie of a Bill
inſtead of a Statute, to be printed among Statutes;
eſpecially about matter of Phyſick, whoſe concerns
in thoſe daies were but in few hands, and thoſe but
very ſlender, inſomuch that the Art it ſelf was poor
in improvement, &amp; the profeſſors very inconſiderable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49888:5"/>
perſons. And after it had been once printed as a Law
how eaſie a matter it was in proceſs of time for the
Lawyers themſelves unawares to accept it, and Mr.
<hi>Pulton</hi> to reprint it as ſuch without further inquiry,
and to hand it as authentick down to Poſterity: So
that tis no marvel at all, that the miſtake ſhould run on
to ſuch a height at length, as to take it <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi>
and admit of it for a Law in Courts of Judicature,
and give judgment accordingly; as in the caſe of
Dr. <hi>Bonham</hi> recorded by my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> and others.
But it is withal to be conſidered, that in this latter
Age, the City of <hi>London</hi> it ſelf encreaſing to a vaſt
amplitude, the number of Phyſitians alſo being excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
augmented, and the extravagant Inſolencies of
the <hi>Collegiates,</hi> with their enmity and oppoſition to
the Profeſſors of a more excellent way of Phyſick,
monſtrouſly encreaſing with their pride and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
irritated men to reſiſt their pretended power,
and by aſſiſtance of the moſt learned Gentlemen of
the <hi>long Robe</hi> to enquire into the bottom of it; which
upon divers Trials afterward in Courts of Law was
found to be but <hi>Sandy;</hi> as in the ſeveral Caſes of Dr.
<hi>William Trigge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Barker,</hi> Doctor <hi>Stephen
Trigge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Read, Fettiplace,</hi> and others;
in whoſe trials they ſucceſſively were either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
or elſe non-ſuited, when great multitudes of
people were preſent, who came thither to teſtifie
what Benefits they had received by Cure from thoſe
men, after they had tried the <hi>Collegiates</hi> and could
find none: which being done, they had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to hoot them out of the great Hall of Juſtice.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49888:5"/>
—Before I leave this point, it cannot be amiſs to add
one paſſage very remarkable, much to the purpoſe;
and that was in the daies of the Uſurper <hi>Oliver,</hi> from
whom the <hi>Colledge-men</hi> had gotten ſuch Countenance,
that they, after the having received ſeveral defeats
at Law in ſuing of others, took courage notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to Arreſt one Dr. <hi>Read,</hi> that lived then in
<hi>Moor-fields,</hi> and they brought the Cauſe to a Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> ſuppoſing they
muſt needs carry it before the then Chief Juſtice
St. <hi>John,</hi> becauſe he having been a Creature of
<hi>Olivers</hi> ſeemed moſt likely to favour a Cauſe
that was favoured by his Maſter. And the
<hi>Colledge-party</hi> labouring to prove the Legality of their
Patent, the Record pretended to juſtifie it was there
produced in Court; and upon view of it, the ſaid
<hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> declared openly, he could not admit it
as a good Record; for which he gave divers Reaſons,
too copious here to be inſerted. I have preſumed
the rather to give this inſtance, becauſe whatever St.
<hi>John</hi> was, as to his ſiding with the <hi>Rump Parliament,</hi>
yet no Lawyer (I preſume) will deny him to have
been an able Judge, to underſtand whether that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Record were an Authentick Statute, or no:
However, the vaſt body of the people there preſent,
were ſo apprehenſive it was a Cauſe of general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
that upon the Judges declaring his opinion,
they filled <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> with acclamations; and the
<hi>Colledge-pretenders</hi> ſneak't away, not daring a long
time after to venture upon any further diſturbance.
The conſideration of theſe things is that which gives
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49888:6"/>
me courage, to ſtand up in my own defence at Law

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Combination: And for two things I bleſs Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God with all my heart; the one is, that the
Riſe of their malice hath been, becauſe I did good
where they could not; And the other is, that it is
my lot to live in a time, wherein the Benches of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter
Hall</hi> are repleniſhed with Judges, ſuch as for
reputation of Learning, Juſtice, and high affection
to the Subjects Liberty, exceed all times that have
gone before.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third Circumstance,</hi> giving cauſe to believe it no
Statute, and that what evidence they inſiſt on to
prove a Statute, is really but a <hi>meer Copy</hi> of ſome
Bill that might in thoſe daies be tendered to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but not paſſed, is this: That in the third
year of the ſame Kings Reign, there was an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
ſetled of a certain power by a particular
Statute to licenſe ſuch perſons as were fit for the Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice
of Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> and Parts about it; which
power was by that Statute lodged in the hands of the
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> or the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and ſo,
a much better proviſion made for the Government of
Phyſick than what is now pretended, foraſmuch as
they were learned hands in whom the Truſt was then
repoſed to judge of fit perſons: and certainly thoſe
Truſtees were more fit than the preſent Collegiate
pretenders can be, in regard they were not as theſe
are, parties in the profits of the Profeſſion. And if
any one ſhould object, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deans,</hi> being
buſied about matters of a more Sacred importance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49888:6"/>
are not like to be fit Judges of Phyſical Concerns, as
men bred up to the faculty may be; I anſwer on the
behalf of thoſe <hi>Reverend Perſons,</hi> that they are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to that dignity for their excellency of learning;
and if men who are to be Licenſed, do bring them
good Certificates of their integrity of life, and good
ſucceſs in their Practice, which is the ſureſt evidence
of a mans Learning and knowledge proper for his
faculty, (nay it only is neceſſary, and other kinds of
Learning in a Phyſician, but ornamental) then I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the truſt is better repoſed in Conſciencious hands
of thoſe Learned and Reverend Fathers; who are
more like to deal impartially in approbation, than
men of our own profeſſion, who have given the
world too great a proof of their appetite of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
and devouring one another, as well as their
Brethren, who like not their way nor their Society;
having abundant cauſe to decline them.—And here
now (gentle Reader) if it were proper for me in this
place, it were a work worthy of your patience, to let
me clear up three particulars: 1. That it is altogether
impracticable among Phyſicians, to ſet up any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them to be Judges of their Brethren, becauſe
there can be no certain Rules; and if there be no
Rules fixt to Judge by, then thoſe Judges are left to
be Arbitrary, and may reject or oppreſs whom they
pleaſe; but that there can be no Rules for this way
of Judgement which may be grounded upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
it ſelf, is evident by what wiſe <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith in
his Preface, <hi>Eſt enim haec Ars Coniecturalis; neque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondet
ei plerumque non ſolum conjectura, ſed etiam
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49888:7"/>
experientia; For, this Art of ours is but Conjectural, &amp; for
the moſt part not only our Conjecture, but our former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
alſo doth fail us in the making of our Judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
And to this concur alſo all the reſt of the <hi>old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
of the Art, as I might demonſtrate in their own
expreſſions. And the Reaſon of it is ſufficiently ſet
forth by that great Philoſopher of this latter Age,
my Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his Book called <hi>The
Advancement of Learning;</hi> wherein he ſets forth the
wonderfull variety, or different propriety of Temper
that is in mens Bodies, which occaſioneth a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
to error; wherefore the Art is to be reckoned
among <hi>Arts Conjectural;</hi> and that it muſt therefore
needs be <hi>but Conjectural, becauſe of the inconſtancy and
variety of the Subject.</hi> viz. <hi>man's Body.</hi> And he ſaith,
<hi>whereas all other Arts and Sciences are Judged by their
power and operation, not by their ſucceſs or work, only
Phyſicians bear away honour or diſgrace principally from
the event, which is ever an unequal Judicature: For,
Who can tell, if a Patient die or recover, whether it be
by Accident or by Art?</hi> So then, there is no neceſſity
from the Art it ſelf, why only Phyſicians, and not
other men, ſhould be Judges. 2. It is utterly impoſſible,
unleſs men can be found out perfect in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all that is knowable in Phyſick, to make
any number of them Judges over the reſt. For, whereas
other profeſſions of men are to be bounded, having
certain Rules to Judge by; as the Divine hath the
Sacred Scriptures; the Lawyer certain Maxims, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and Cuſtoms, whereby to ſteer his Courſe; and
ſo theſe Profeſſions are with Reaſon made Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
excluſive of all other men from them:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49888:7"/>
Only <hi>Phyſick</hi> is not alike capable, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Rules of it are not <hi>aeternae veritatis,</hi> i. e. <hi>not
perpetual:</hi> ſo ſaith the ſame <hi>Celſus:</hi> ſo alſo ſaith day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
experience, the Buſineſs of Phyſick being upon
perpetual improvement; and ſo will be (the Treaſures
of natural Subjects, and the Reaſons, flowing from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
freſh inquiry and diſcovery, being inexhauſtible, and
alterable,) to the end of the world, though all the
hands and heads in the world were employed about it.—I
my ſelf have lived long enough (almoſt forty
years acquainted with this Art) to ſee it by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
in all points turned topſie-turvie, the old
Learning belonging to it exploded by Scholars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
the old Education in Academies judged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent,
the places themſelves being too narrow
to afford much obſervation or experience, and the
manner of life more ſpeculative and notional than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
or laborious, which a Phyſitian's ought to
be; for, all notions of curing not derived from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and practice, are meer <hi>talkative vanities;</hi> and be
they dreſſed never ſo learnedly and quaint, can only
make a <hi>formal Doctor,</hi> not a Phyſician, at beſt but
only the better fit him to be bound Prentice to ſome
able Practiſer in a populous City, that under him he
may work out his way, to become <hi>indeed a Doctor.</hi>
I have alſo lived to ſee divers medicines, which, at
the firſt uſage of them in the world, were exclaimed
againſt and condemned by their Colledg-men, as
noyous and hurtful to the Kings Subjects, to be now
found of ſo much good uſe, beyond the remedies of
former time, that in a little while they have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49888:8"/>
the obſtinate coudemners, and the very ſame are
now printed by themſelves in their <hi>Pharmacopeia</hi> for
publick uſe; and in many difficult, as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Caſes, becauſe but few of the Collegiate Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
are acquainted with any other improvements,
they rely on them as their great <hi>Arcanaes</hi> And no
queſtion but ere 20, or 40, years more be paſt, ſo
great a Spirit being now up and at work, for furthrr
and further improvement among the <hi>working Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
even thoſe very Remedies which are now to be
magnified as the greateſt, will ere long alſo be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
far inferior, and give place to others that will
be of a more noble attainment. What a miſchief
then muſt it needs be, if any number of <hi>Academian
Thinkers</hi> ſhould ſucceſſively be tranſlated ſtill to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and there be ſetled with power by Law, to
be Arbitrators over other Phyſicians of a more labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and practical Courſe of Studie; whoſe Coals
they are ſcarce worthy to carry, unleſs it be to learn
under them how to make effectual, ſafe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Phyſick! On the other ſide, what a happineſs
would it be, if the <hi>reverend Church-men</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
theſe things, and what Authorty hath
been intruſted in them only by Law, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Phyſicians, and the prevention of that
Tyranny which the more idle and formal ſpeculators
of Phyſick, have hitherto exerciſed over the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
practical Phyſicians, under pretence of Law; and
thereby ſtrangled (as much as in them lay) time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time, their worthy endeavours for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Science! For, it is ſtill to be preſumed, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49888:8"/>
reverend Biſhops are the only Truſtees in the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter, ſeeing their Statute of the third
of <hi>Henry</hi> 8th was never yet ſo much as doubted of,
as this pretended one of the Collegiates of the 14th
hath been, and in Court divers times rejected. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it is apparent enough, to any one that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the whole courſe of proceeding in Parliament;
which is, when they make a Law for a new eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any thing, alwaies to repeal the former Law
that had appointed another of a contrary nature. How
then can we believe, a Parliament could forget it
ſelf ſo far, as to form a Law to remove the firſt power
of licenſing Practiſers of Phyſick out of the hands of
the Clergie, into other hands, and yet the latter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Law not contain ſo much as one word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
the former; Certainly, 'tis more rationall to
ſuppoſe, that (whatever hath been pretended) the
Parliament did indeed never paſs the Bill propoſed,
ſeeing it would have been a ſtrange thing ſo to have
left Phyſicians at an uncertainty for licenſing, as they
muſt needs be if both were Statutes in force, and the
power divided betwixt the <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Colledg.</hi> If
Phyſicians then have a mind to be Licenſed, their
ſureſt way and moſt unqueſtionably Legall, is to do
as I have done long ſince take a Licenſe from the
Clergie; by which and my other Advantages in Law
I queſtion not to be abundantly able, to juſtifie my ſelf
ſelf and my practice, againſt my malicious perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth Circumſtance</hi> that may lead a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it no Statute, ariſeth by the ſucceſs of the late
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49888:9"/>
grand attempt, which the Colledge-men made in
the year 1663. when they preſented an Addreſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Parliament now in being, to paſs a Bill they
had prepared, not only for confirmation of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
contained in their former ſuppoſed Statute, but
for enlargement of them alſo to ſuch a monſtrous
magnitude as is almoſt incredible; inſomuch that the
honourable Committee, to whom the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
had referred the Bill, and thereupon to report
to the houſe their Opinion, after a full hearing of the
Counſel that appeared for all parties, both Phyſicians
and others, were ſo well ſatisfied of the monſtroſity of
their demands, that they diſmiſſed the Colledge-men,
<hi>re infecta,</hi> who retuned home with a flea in their ears
and have ever ſince been wondrous quiet, till of late,
upon pretence of I know not what new <hi>Chimaeraes,</hi>
they begin again to be troubleſome; yea, I have been
informed, that after the Committee had had many
daies patience, to admit a full Scrutiny into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Cauſe, there appeared on the laſt day
none on the <hi>Colledge</hi> ſide but two of their own fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
who had on this occaſion acted as <hi>Sollicitors;</hi> ſo
that one of the Lawyers employed by the defendants,
had the pleaſure to obſerve, how ill a Cauſe it was,
ſeeing their own Lawyers declined to appear any
more in the Buſineſs. So there was an end of it, all
being diſmiſſed by the honourable Committee. Yet
the men do boaſt, and would give the Parliament (as
I hear) new trouble: But 'tis poſſible, others may
be beforehand with them there, with Reaſons to
deſire a Reformation, and to remonſtrate the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49888:9"/>
eſtate, into which Phyſicians, and the Art it ſelf,
have in all times been reduced, and would be in the
future for want of improvement, if thoſe men might
have their way of domination. I can here challenge
them, and do, in the view of the world, to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
any one particular of improvement, that their
Society hath made in the Art of curing, ſince their
firſt Incorporation, and I will prove the contrary. As
for their pretenſions of diſcoveries in <hi>Anatomie,</hi> if
they inſiſt upon them, I am readie to prove, they
have done nothing in all their <hi>Anatomick Theatres,</hi>
which may conduce to better Cure; and no more
than what may ſerve the <hi>Salta-di-Banco</hi>'s upon a <hi>Stage,</hi>
it being the laſt part they have to play, or trick to
ſhew, to entertain Spectators, and amuſe the world,
to uphold ſome Repute among ſuch as are ignorant;
and draw on Cuſtomers; ſo that it is wonderfull to
ſee how many, even of the Nobility, and Gentry,
as well as the Citizens, are taken by this ſort of trick,
the <hi>Mock-ſhews</hi> of pretended diſcovery by Anatomy.
But how little is to be expected from ſuch Actors,
that honourable Gentleman Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> tells you, in
his Book of <hi>Experimental Philoſophy,</hi> where he ſaith he
doth not ſee wherein <hi>by any of thoſe new diſcoveries,
any thing hath been done, to better the Cure of Diſeaſes.</hi>
You may take his word: And if the Maſters of the <hi>ſtage</hi>
pleaſe to juſtifie themſelves, I will in publick, evidence
they have done nothing by it worth a ſtraw, beyond
what was done by the Antients. Yet know withal, I
reverence ſo much of Anatomie as is neceſſary: and
half a years time ſpent in it is enough to fit any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49888:10"/>
or Chirurgian for practice. The <hi>new Nicities</hi> ſerve
for nought but oſtentation and diſcourſe. But as for
noble Medicaments, the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Leaders</hi> among
them, have (I will make it evident, by almoſt forty
years obſervation) made it their buſineſs to ſtifle, or
elſe diſcredit them, and diſcourage the Practiſers or
downright abuſe and vex them under pretence of law;
though theſe are the ſort of men, to whom the world
have in this Age been obliged (as I can by inſtances
make appear) for the delicacie, eaſineſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Medicine. But I would not be too
large, to tire the <hi>Reader;</hi> therefore I proceed.</p>
            <p>2. Their <hi>Second pretence</hi> of Suit againſt me is, that
I am a <hi>Chymiſt.</hi> This ſome perſons have told me
that had it from ſome of their own mouths. Upon
this Point I anſwer, that it is my glory to be a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt;
though among ſome ignorant of all Science; and
others not ſkilled in this, it is hardly thought of;
and the only reaſon is this, becauſe the other ſort of
Phyſicians, and their Agents, being either wholly
ignorant, or at beſt but <hi>dablers</hi> in it, do count it their
intereſt to cry out and clamor againſt it to fright the
weaker perſons, leſt the experience of its excellency,
ſhould detect their own ignorance and inſufficiency,
and thereby annihilate their reputation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
among the People. But they may do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that in the beginning of the year 1665 when
ſome worthy Phyſicians endeavoured, and had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
from many of the chiefeſt of the Nobility,
who gave their approbation to an <hi>inſtrument in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
under their hands,</hi> for the erecting of <hi>a new Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49888:10"/>
of Phyſicians</hi> for the advancement of Phyſick by
Chymical Medicaments and Practice, as <hi>eaſieſt, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
and most effectual</hi> for Cure of his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
one of the Arts then uſed by the <hi>Collegiates,</hi>
to prevent the ſetting up of this <hi>Society,</hi> was, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to put on a pretence, that they alſo are Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
and make and uſe thoſe Remedies as much as
any; and this pretence they ſometimes take up when
they happen to be converſant among any ingenious
perſons that are knowing in this Art: But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, if they chance to light into Practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
people ignorant of the Art, and who alſo are
either religiouſly, or naturally melancholy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
timerous, ſuſpitious, and apt to entertain
their Suggeſtions, then they work on the <hi>dark ſide,</hi>
ſecretly whiſper and blaſpheme this noble way of
Medicine, as dangerous, and as ſuch that though it
cure one diſeaſe at preſent, yet it leaves a root of ill
behind, which after long time, if not ſhortly,
ſprings up into the ſame or ſome worſe diſeaſe, ſo
that by ſuch little Arts as theſe, they and their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
do play on both ſides, to uphold a tottering
Reputation; which is now almoſt down, and will
be quite ere long; the eyes of the world being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every day more and more to diſcover them,
and the Myſtery of their Craft. In this matter know,
I do not include all of that Society; but 'tis the uſual
practice of a prevailing party among thoſe few <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi>
thereof who rule all. And now, ſeeing I ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
mention <hi>that Society,</hi> know that the Government
of it is not managed by the ableſt and the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49888:11"/>
But by ſuch as grow up in Seniority of entrance as
<hi>Fellows,</hi> be they wiſe or unwiſe. And to ſhew the
world how much a few do affect Domination over
the vaſt multitude of their Brethren, generally more
learned than themſelves, be pleaſed to conſider that
only the ſet number of men called <hi>Fellows,</hi> do look
upon themſelves alone to be the <hi>Colledge,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
muſt truckle under, by the names of <hi>Candidate,</hi>
or <hi>Licentiate.</hi> Only (forſooth) a new Project was
lately laid for a <hi>Feather in the Cap,</hi> by the name of
<hi>honorary,</hi> to be conferred upon ſome out-liers in
Town, and new-comers from the Univerſities, that
had repute for Learning: And this contrivance was
made, not out of love to the mens merits, but merely
for fear leſt theſe ſhould make a Seceſs to Mount <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventine,</hi>
and ſet up for a <hi>popular Rebellion,</hi> in ſome
<hi>free</hi> Society, againſt the <hi>Senate of the Colledge.</hi> For,
the number of Phyſicians flocking to <hi>London</hi> being
very great, it was by them thought meet to train as
many of them as they could, into a dependence (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)
upon the <hi>Colledge:</hi> But how? Not to be <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi>
or Sharers in the Reglement of the Society; but
as <hi>things tack't to,</hi> or meer <hi>hangers on,</hi> pleaſed with a
<hi>Rattle,</hi> and called <hi>honorary fellows,</hi> which is a Title
only a little more plauſible than the poor word <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates;</hi>
for, their piteous Priviledge thereby is no
more, than what is enjoyed by meer <hi>Licenciates;</hi>
which is, to have the favor (in ſooth) of free Practice
among their <hi>Worſhips,</hi> but not a bit of intereſt in the
Lordſhip and Authority; that is meat for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
When I look over the new Liſt of <hi>Honoraries,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49888:11"/>
what a ſhame is it, think I, that men of better learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and repute, ſhould be content to be made <hi>mere
properties,</hi> and no part of the Party! And now what
(I pray you) ſhall become of all the reſt? Here are
ſtill in <hi>London,</hi> abundance of Phyſicians more; ſome
broke looſe from the <hi>Non-conforming Miniſtry,</hi> others
from the Univerſities here, or from beyond-Sea, in
the habit of <hi>Doctors:</hi> and theſe (I hear) have many
of them offered themſelves to be herded alſo in the
Colledge: But it ſeems, all their Truckling will not
do; the <hi>Sanctorum</hi> muſt not be made too common,
nor the <hi>Commons</hi> be over-ſtock't, and therefore they,
for their pittifull petitions of Addreſs, are left to
champ upon a denial, and graze among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Myſtery</hi> being opened, 'tis time to return
where I left; that is, to tell you what became of the
new Society of Phyſicians, which, ſo many of the
<hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>prime Gentry</hi> ſubſcribed unto, as moſt
neceſſary to be erected in the year 1665. know, that
the great Plague then befalling this Noble City, the
deſign for that time was of neceſſity laid aſide, though
moſt of its Members did ſtay in Town, while moſt
of the Collegiates ran away, except Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> and
three or four of the Novices; to ſhew how well they
deſerve henceforth to be called <hi>The Colledge of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
of London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I leave the Subject of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> I have
only a ſhort word to add in defence of this <hi>Queen of
Arts;</hi> which is the Mother not only of the nobleſt
Phyſick, but of abundance of other Inventions the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49888:12"/>
moſt uſeful for Mankind; of which a large Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
might be given, if it were fit to be more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But what I have to ſay is, if any ill ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
thereby, it is no otherwiſe than what is uſual
by uſe of the common Medicines, when they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by ignorant, careleſs, or knaviſh hands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
Remedies well prepared by Art <hi>Chymical,</hi> do ſeem
to be as the <hi>hands of God</hi> reached down from Heaven
in this latter Age, in exceeding mercy to poor man,
when his iniquities have ſo altered the whole Scene
of diſeaſes, that in every one almoſt there is a touch
of that which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Somewhat
that is admirable or extraordinary, which makes
them exceedingly different from what they were in
the daies of him, or <hi>Galen;</hi> and indeed, from what
they were a hundred years ago, and leſs; ſo that the
old Art and Remedies are inſufficient to deal with
them. And therefore from hence it is, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of <hi>Apothecaries</hi> of <hi>London</hi> have wiſely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
and executed a deſign moſt laudable, to ſupply
the defect, and anſwer publick neceſſity, by erecting
a <hi>grand Laboratory</hi> and <hi>Repoſitory</hi> in their <hi>Publick Hall,</hi>
for <hi>Chymick Medicaments;</hi> to have them there ready
made, of all ſorts, to prevent fraud in the Shops of
<hi>private Operators</hi> (who have been wont heretofore to
be (for the moſt part) the only Preparers for common
Sale) and to anſwer the Preſcripts of ſuch Phyſicians
as underſtand the uſe of them; who may now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of having them good there (and at one rate or
price common to all men) upon the Publick faith and
honour of the <hi>whole Company,</hi> rather than from the
hand of any <hi>private Sales-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49888:12"/>
And whereas the common miſtake of people is,
when <hi>Chymical Medicines</hi> are named, that thereby are
meant only <hi>Mineral Medicines,</hi> with the fear of
which the malicious idle ignorant Phyſicians have
bug-bear'd them often; know, that though moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Remedies are made out of <hi>Minerals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
<hi>Metalls</hi> well prepared, to cure many ſtrange diſeaſes,
which other Remedies will not, and are as ſafe for
uſe as milk it ſelf, (and indeed only ſafe, becauſe all
other, being in ſuch Caſes inſufficient, are for that
Cauſe moſt dangerous) yet no men do uſe the parts
of <hi>Animals</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Salts,</hi> more than the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
do;</hi> but exceedingly more to the purpoſe, being
Chymically prepared; becauſe by this Art they are
made to cure abundance of obſtinate diſeaſes, which
they can never effect, if prepared the <hi>Galenical</hi> way: &amp;
for proof of this, I could run over a whole field of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
if it were not too tedious. But to end this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
let it ſuffice to tell you, that 'tis the glory
of <hi>Chymistry,</hi> to have contributed in a few years, more
to manifeſtation of the vertues of Plants, Animals,
and Salts, than all the Sectators of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi>
have done from their times to this day: which is the
reaſon why many <hi>Chymical Practiſers</hi> do ſeldom uſe
other, unleſs there be a neceſſity. On the other ſide,
'tis obſerved in the practice of our Adverſaries, that
they are moſt frequent even when there is no neceſſity
in the uſe of the common Chymical Mineral Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſet down in their <hi>Pharmacopeia;</hi> which are
things of but the <hi>loweſt form in Chymiſtry,</hi> and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by knowing men in this Age of Improvement;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49888:13"/>
yet uſed by thoſe our Maſters, as their <hi>ultimum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugium,</hi>
upon every little puzzle in their Practice, and
as their grand <hi>Arcanaes.</hi> Whereas I remember
their Predeceſſors were wont to cry out upon them,
and damn all the growing Practiſers who in thoſe
daies durſt uſe them, as dangerous, and enemies to
the health of mankind; though every dayes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
did manifeſt that they then condemned what
they underſtood not, and that they produced ſuch
notable effects in curing, as could not be attained by
the old Remedies, in the moſt deplorable Diſeaſes. Nor
have matters gone thus only in <hi>London,</hi> to the
diſcouragement of all the moſt uſefull Laborers in this
Faculty; but ſhould I revolve and repeat the Hiſtory
of time paſt, from the time of <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> how he
was abuſed by <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and by almoſt all the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>
Profeſſors throughout <hi>Germany;</hi> and how ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically
that ſort of men behaved themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; and afterwards how they, in moſt of
the Univerſities and great Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> perſecuted
his very memory, and all ſuch as being enlightned by
his Labors did follow his way, for diſcovery of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Medicine, down to the year 1603; at which time
the laborious famous <hi>Quercetan,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Tbeodore de
Mayerne,</hi> were both of them in two ſeveral publick
Sentences of the Academian Profeſſors, and whole
Colledge of Phyſicians in <hi>Paris,</hi> printed by their
Order, condemned, and in poſitive terms the <hi>whole
Art it ſelf of Chymiſtry,</hi> as men not only unworthy
to be conſulted with by the Phyſicians of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
eſpecially <hi>Mayerne,</hi> declaring him <hi>an unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49888:13"/>
impudent, drunken mad fellow; exhorting all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to abominate them both, and baniſh them and the
like practiſers, out of their Territories as Monsters of
mankind:</hi> And threatning all the fellows of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that <hi>if they conſult with either of them about any
Patient, they ſhall be deprived of all priviledge belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Colledge.</hi> Which is alſo at this day one great
myſtery made uſe of by our <hi>London-Collegiates;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they reſolve to correſpond only with each other,
in hope to ingroſs the Trade among themſelves; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the <hi>name of a Colledge</hi> muſt needs carry away
the reputation from all other Phyſicians, if they deny
(upon occaſion) to conſult with them, <hi>becauſe they
are none of the Colledge.</hi> O fine Confederacy! now
good people look to your Purſes. But what I pray
you became of <hi>Quercetan</hi> and <hi>Mayerne</hi> after this?
You may read their <hi>Sentences</hi> publiſhed at large, in
that unanſwerable Book called <hi>Medela Medicinae;</hi>
which was written by Dr. <hi>Marchamont Nedham,</hi>
eleven years ago; where he tells you, <hi>that for all
this, the one of thoſe Condemned perſons became famous
in</hi> France, <hi>the Kings Chief Phyſician, and lived to ſee
that Colledge repent of their folly, and their Succeſſors
become admirers of thoſe Chymical Books and Remedies
which they had ſo raſhly damned. The other,</hi> (viz.
Mayerne) <hi>became Phyſician to two Kings of</hi> England,
<hi>and two of</hi> France, <hi>and left a name of great wealth
and honour behind him.</hi> Now by theſe things you
may underſtand, what a wondrous precious thing an
<hi>All-wiſe Colledge</hi> may be in any Noble City;
and what Advancers of the Art of Curing,
if either damning and ſuppreſſing laborious Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49888:14"/>
or the inthroning of Arrogance, and ſuch a
courſe of Study and ſort of Learning as is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to Phyſick, can effect it.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>third Pretence is,</hi> becauſe I am not one of
or with their <hi>Colledge.</hi> I confeſs I am not, nor will
I ever be, There are good ſtore of the beſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
about Town that are of the ſame mind; and they
have their Reaſons for it, which (upon occaſion) they
will produce: I alſo have my Reaſons, part of which
may be pickt out of what I have already ſaid. And
to accept a Licenſe from them, is to acknowledge a
power which I am not ſatisfied they have, or ought
to have; ſeeing that if (as I ſaid before) we revolve
the tranſactions of time paſt, tis to be found upon
Record, that ſuch <hi>Collegiate Eſtabliſhments</hi> or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
of Phyſick, have been the great hinderers
of the progreſs of this Art throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi>
and ſtill are; which hath made the moſt ingenious
Scholars which are Laborers and Inquirers, in the
Univerſities and Capital Cities of all the Countries
where I have travelled, ſigh and ſwell with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to ſee how their moſt laudable endeavours are
diſcountenanced, and calumniated by that ſort of
<hi>Medicaſters,</hi> becauſe they out-do, and ſhame them by
diligence; and, 'tis to be lamented there hath been ſo
little hope to ſee a through Reformation in this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
both as to the manner of men's education for
it, the full freedom of its Profeſſors, and the diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
of <hi>thoſe Societies;</hi> the natural tendency of whoſe
power hath ever been (as I can prove in <hi>facto</hi>) to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
over their Brethren, and <hi>monopoly</hi> of the Art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49888:14"/>
It may be ſoberly inquired, in <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Language, <hi>Cui
Bono?</hi> To what end are they continued now, having
been erected in the old time of ignorance, when Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
and other Sciences were at a ſtand, and all the
world brutiſhly and tamely acquieſced in Notions
received from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and did ſet
up their <hi>Hercules Pillars</hi> with a <hi>Nil ultra?</hi> But hear
what that moſt learned Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid, in the Book
of <hi>Advancement of Learning. I dare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
avouch, that the wiſdom we have extracted chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the</hi> Grecians, <hi>is but a Childhood of knowledge.</hi>
And he further ſaith thus, <hi>Medicine therefore hath
been ſuch hitherto, as hath been more profeſſed than la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored,
and yet more labored than advanced, ſeeing the
pains bestowed therein hath been, more in Circle than in
Progreſſion; for, I find much Iteration, but ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the writers of that Faculty.</hi> And to the ſame
purpoſe writes Dr. <hi>Mar. Nedham</hi> in <hi>Medela Medicinae,</hi>
in theſe words, <hi>I may ſafely ſay, that there hath been
more of importance done for the advancement of Phyſick,
ſince my Lord</hi> Bacon <hi>wrote his Book, than ever was done
in the world before: For, in former time, men contented
themſelves with the little skill that was left them by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
making no progreſs; but ran a round in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Arabs, <hi>as the Oracles of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;
and uſually one Commentator hath ſtolen out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
ſo that you have but the ſame diſh of</hi> Crambe <hi>new
cook't: And if you have but one of the moſt volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
you have all.</hi> Therefore, in the former Age,
it might be eaſie enough, the Art it ſelf being fixt and
ſtaked down to certain Points, Maxims, or Rules, to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49888:15"/>
ſet down Rules alſo how to judge the Profeſſors, and
with ſome colour of Reaſon condemn that for <hi>Male
practiſe,</hi> which anſwered not to the Doctrine of their
Rulers. But in this Age, when the faculty of Phyſick is
ſo vaſtly diffuſed, and freſh diſcoveries of Phyſical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and of Doctrine touching the nature of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
are daily made, that any ſort of Practiſers ſhould
be Authoriſed as Judges, to determine who is a good
or a bad Practiſer, when they can have no certain
Rules to judge them by; or perhaps they underſtand
not the nature of the Medicines uſed, though they
be told of the Preparation; or perhaps they will out
of envy or hatred to ſuch Phyſicians, decrie what is
more excellent (as they have done heretofore) this
ſeems to be againſt the very Reaſon, Intereſt, and end
of Government: And therefore without all queſtion,
the aboliſhment of a nipping domination over the
growth of the Art of Phyſick, in the hands of a few
<hi>Ingroſſers</hi> in Collegiate Societies, will in a ſhort time
be judged by the Princes and Eſtates of <hi>Europe,</hi> to be
moſt neceſſary; the exerciſe of it having hitherto
been the great Impediment of the <hi>Progreſs of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if things be thus, what then ſhall be next? Is
it fit all ſhould be at liberty; I anſwer yes for the
preſent; but not without Government: Let ſuch as
do amiſs anſwer for it at the Laws. A Government
ought to be: But ſeeing men, as Phyſicians, for the
foregoing Reaſons, cannot make certain Laws or
Rules whereby to judge one another, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Profeſſion (till the King and Parliament
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49888:15"/>
be at leiſure to reform the matter) may be left in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to the Laws of the Land. It ſeems to be one of
the moſt unreaſonable things in the world; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(I think) can be more deſtructive to the Liberty
of the Subject, or make a man more miſerable, than
that if he be ſick, he ſhould not with freedom uſe
what Phyſician he believes can beſt cure him, but he
muſt be limited to an accepting of ſuch or ſuch a one,
of ſuch a Company, or elſe can have none that he
phanſies, but the man ſhall be moleſted, perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
for doing the ſick ſervice: and all under a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of avoiding thereby the uſe of bad Phyſick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people. The vanity of which Suppoſal,
and the ſecurity of mankind thereby, hath already
here in part been diſcover'd, and will be much more
before the end of this Diſcourſe; in ſhewing of how
pernicious a conſequence it hath been to Phyſick, to
inthrone a few Phyſicians to Lord it over all the reſt.
Wherefore, if the whole Body of Phyſicians here in
this City be really the Phyſicians of <hi>London,</hi> Why
may they not, being part of the City, be taken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
under the City Government? Be obliged to
take Apprentices, ſuch young men as have taken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in other Arts at ſome Univerſity; who when
they have ſerved their time at work under a City-Phyſician,
may then be made a free Practiſer of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi>
Such a populous City is the only place (being
a Theatre of all Diſeaſes) wherein to breed up men
Phyſicians indeed; ſuch as may practiſe with real
knowledge; not fill the world with Cobwebs of idle
ſpeculations and notions, as men of the old way of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49888:16"/>
Education are wont to do; and which may furniſh
his Majeſties Armies and Fleets Royal, with Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as the Society of Chirurgerie do with Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
and be content to ſubmit to a Law, that if they
<hi>run away from the City in the time of Plague,</hi> or depart
without ſpecial Licenſe of Authority, to forfeit their
freedom of Practiſe therein any more. This altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may ſeem uncouth at the firſt mention; but
ſhould it be eſtabliſhed by publick Authority, the
conſequence would be, that the City would not be
ſo baſely deſerted in the time of its neceſſity and few
could incurr (having been thus bred) any ſuſpicion of
ignorance in the Art; which is now made the pretence
of a great Clamor by the <hi>Collegiates,</hi> againſt many
ingenious men, whoſe firſt Education in the
world was not in this Art, but afterwards betook
themſelves to learn it in the moſt proper way of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which is by labor, and have ſoon out-ſtrip't the
Scholaſticks in right knowledge of the <hi>Materia Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
to the comfort of many thouſands of his Majeſties
poor Subjects; many of which have been left by the
collegiates, who might elſe have periſht for want of
a purſe, to run through the tedious methods and means
of that Adverſe party. But to avoid Calumnie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſeek every occaſion to ſow it, know that
in this I plead not on the behalf of any Impoſtors, or
real ignorants; I only point out a way of better Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
for Practice, which may prevent all Ignorants,
in the future, as far as by the wit of man they may
poſſibly be prevented in this Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49888:16"/>
In the mean time, till this which I here humbly
mention, or ſome better eſtabliſhment be thought of
by others more able, it would be happy for the Art,
if Certificates of a Phyſician's having lived in good
reputation for his manners and Practice, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
as a ſufficient evidence of his ability, and
fitneſs to be licenſed; either by the <hi>reverend Clergie,</hi>
according as is directed in the firſt Statute of the 3d
year of <hi>Henry</hi> 8th (which never was yet repealed)
or elſe by ſome other perſons not Phyſicians, as by
Authority ſhall be thought meet. <hi>Ratione Legis ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſante
ceſſat ipſa Lex.</hi> If in former time, a King and
his Parliament had reaſon to enact ſuch a Statute (the
very being of which, as a Statute, hath yet been a
queſtion among ſome eminent Lawyers) nevertheleſs
the condition of the very Art, and all the affairs
of Phyſick, being ſo altered (as is before declared)
and ſo many Reaſons lying now againſt the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is not in the leaſt doubted by the ingenious
and laborious improvers of Medicine; that when the
ſame Authority ſhall be rightly inform'd of theſe
things, in a full and clear <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which may
be preſented to them, they will ſee reaſon abundant
for the repealing of that Statute of the 14th of <hi>Henry</hi>
the 8th (if it be one) and enact ſuch a form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as may conduce to the improvement of
the Art, and the general comfort of the people.</p>
            <p>4. Their Fourth pretence of Suit againſt me is,
that I have refuſed to leave off Practiſing as a <hi>Doctor.</hi>
There is ſuch adoe about this <hi>Feather in the Cap</hi> call'd
<hi>Doctor</hi> of Phyſick, that I often wiſh it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49888:17"/>
by the People. If they knew ſo well as I do,
of how ſlight eſteem it is beyond Sea, and how eaſie
to be gained, ſo many would not dote as they have
done, upon many that run looſe from being <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters,</hi>
or <hi>Preachers,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to be made <hi>Doctors</hi>
at <hi>Leyden,</hi> and the like places beyond-Sea; and by
reading a few Books and prating, intrude into a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which is not to be acquired but by years of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and ſtudie of <hi>Experimental,</hi> not <hi>School-philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
Such <hi>talking Book-Doctors</hi> the world is too full of,
and too many of them have crept in from time to time,
to be Principal Fellows of the Colledge here (of
whoſe names you may ere long have a Catalogue;) to
which they have been, and are admitted upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
a <hi>Diploma;</hi> which is a <hi>Parchment and publick
Seal</hi> of ſome forein Univerſity, and the anſwering
of a few queſtions about <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Method;</hi> and
becauſe <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> hath been a fruitful
Mother of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brats, (too many of which
are now dominering among us) they are by our own
Univerſity-men in ſcorn called <hi>Leaden Doctors:</hi> But
the fitteſt name for all Phyſicians, that thus ſlightly
by the Book enter upon the Stage of the World, from
our own or forein Univerſities, to Practice, is the
due word of diſtinction, <hi>Book-Doctors.</hi> For, it is
<hi>Galen</hi>'s own Expreſſion [<hi>Duobus Cruribus innitimur;
quotidiana inſpectione, &amp; experientia,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>we
Phyſitians</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do stand upon two Legs,</hi> viz.
<hi>daily Inſpection and Experience:</hi> But of the <hi>Book-pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners</hi>
he ſaith, they are like thoſe that take upon
them [<hi>Ex Libro navigare</hi>] to <hi>Saile by the Book:</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49888:17"/>
ſo both <hi>Paſſengers</hi> and <hi>Patients</hi> are in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">

               </gap>king this degree
for very good Reaſons; I might have had it in <hi>Holland</hi>
when I would; but becauſe the way of diſtributing
degrees is grown ſo corrupt, (and as it is managed in
Univerſities) ſerves but to impoſe upon mankind rather
than ſecure them of a benefit by it, I did decline it;
reckoning it more honeſt, to reſt upon a knowledge
and Conſcience of my own Sufficiency in Phyſick to
advance me, rather than to cloth my ſelf with an
<hi>empty Title;</hi> and ſo by my example, approve a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Courſe of Formality which ought to be deſpiſed,
ſeeing 'tis made a mere matter of courſe, equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to any <hi>per Courteſie,</hi> or <hi>per-Penny</hi> be they ſufficient
for it or no. What ſad Souls have I ſeen too often paſſed
among the beſt Univerſities, unto this degree of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick!
<hi>Wine, Veniſon,</hi> and <hi>Pence,</hi> have been a cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Paſſport to the old words of Inſtitution, <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

in an Univerſity abroad, where I will for <hi>ten pounds,</hi>
procure any <hi>Novice</hi> that can but frame, or get a
Friend to frame for him, a <hi>Theſis</hi> to read, and act
ſome other ſlight Forms of exerciſe in the <hi>publick
place,</hi> to be made a Doctor; and this is the place that
too many of our people run to, Yea more, if any one
will but ſend the Money, no matter who he be, nor
where; for, though the Profeſſor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who gives the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
never ſee his face, he ſhall with grant of a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Diploma,</hi> be dubb'd a Doctor. Of ſo little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
is it among Foreigners; and ought to be in all
the world, till mankind can have better Security of
Phyſick thereby: Which can never be had but by
breeding up youth, (as I before ſaid) in the liberal Arts
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49888:18"/>
firſt in ſome Univerſity (which is but the Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
part;) and afterwards to be bound Apprentices
(for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Art it ſelf, and the Philoſophie proper to
it, ariſeth, and is improved, only by <hi>Mechanick</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration)
under a Free-man practicant of this City,
in order to the becoming free for Practice here. The
paſſing of ſuch a Formality as this, or the like, men
can ſeldom be deceived by; and it is the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
means to make able Doctors, and to prevent the
miſerable ſcandalous inconveniencies of the other <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Formality,</hi> whereby the world (like the <hi>Dog</hi> in
the <hi>Fable</hi>) is too frequently miſtaken with the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi>
inſtead of the <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having done with their <hi>pretences,</hi> I now paſs
on to the <hi>Third Point</hi> of this <hi>Apology;</hi> which is, the
manner of their vexatious proceeding at Law to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
me; wherein I ſhall be very brief.</p>
            <p>I am, and would have been a man of peace, but
by no means could obtain it: For, after they had
arreſted me by Writ, and carried on the Suit againſt
me in the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> I made application to them by
my Self and Friends: Serjeant <hi>Wiſeman</hi> (his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
chief Chirurgian) having well known me many
years, very courteouſly went with me to the <hi>Preſident</hi>
of the Colledge; who at firſt promiſed very fair, but
when I went alone to him the ſecond time, to know
what I might expect, he told me, <hi>They had many Weeds
in their Garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they muſt take a courſe to root them
out:</hi> which was all the anſwer I could get; ſo I troubled
him no more. And as for the <hi>Counteſſe</hi>'s <hi>Doctor</hi> (my
great Proſecutor) he ſent me word by a perſon of
quality, that if I would lay down my practice,
they would lay aſide their quarrel in Law; but upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49888:18"/>
no other terms: Whereupon, I provided to defend
my ſelf, the Suit going on. And they having given
my Atturney a <hi>Declaration</hi> againſt me, I prepared to
put in my <hi>Exceptions:</hi> and then on a ſudden (upon
I know not what by-deſign) they let fall their Action
in that Court, and arreſted me, this laſt <hi>vacation,</hi>
upon another Action in the Court of <hi>Marſhalſey,</hi> where
a new charge of expences was brought upon me,
with great loſs beſides of my time and Practice,
through perpetual attendance upon the Suit, till I had
brought the Cauſe on to be ready for a Trial there:
And truly, it had been then tried, had I not been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
by able Counſel, not to ſuffer ſo important a
Cauſe to be tried in a petty Court, but to remove it
back by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> into the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench</hi> again
as the more noble place; which I have done, and there
I expect a Trial this <hi>Michaelmas-Term:</hi> which brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
great expence upon me, and loſs of time; it
being the great Artifice of the Colledgemen, by tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
me from Court to Court, to tire out and ruine
me, and terrifie all others, if they can.</p>
            <p>Now being come to the fourth and laſt Point of my
diſcourſe, I humbly crave leave to wind up all, with a
ſhort account of my own <hi>Education</hi> and Practice.
They ſay I am an <hi>Apothecary;</hi> 'tis well 'tis no worſe;
and it had been well for their <hi>Worſhips,</hi> if they had at
firſt been bred ſo too; for ſo, the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> had not
been put to it, to acquaint them with the <hi>Materia
Medica</hi> and the way of Practice (as they are wont to
doe) at their coming to Town. I did indeed begin,
as they ought to have done; that is, learn to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Medicine: I was called from <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> nigh
<hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> (where I had ſometime been bred) to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49888:19"/>

               </gap>d him ſeven years, and became a
free-man of <hi>Dublin.</hi> The ableſt Phyſicians that ever
I met with abroad, were firſt bred <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> or
<hi>Chymiſts,</hi> or both, after they had qualified themſelves
with Univerſity-learning in other Arts and Sciences:
For, other Nations do think it as neceſſary for a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticioner
of Phyſick to be firſt bred in both thoſe
working employments, as it is for him that intends to
read, firſt to learn his Letters.</p>
            <p>After I had been thus initiated in the Univerſity
and afterward in learning the ſkill to prepare and
compound Medicine, my inclination next led me to
travel, to ſee what I could learn abroad. From
<hi>Ireland</hi> I took <hi>England</hi> in my way; and after ſome
time ſpent here, I paſſed into <hi>Holland;</hi> and from
thence into <hi>Germanie, France,</hi> and many parts of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to try in thoſe Countries what improvement
might be made in Phyſick: And at length I returning
into <hi>Holland,</hi> there took up my Reſt. It is about 26
years ſince I cured in <hi>Roterdam</hi> ſome that now belong
to the <hi>London</hi> Colledg, who at this time do live in
<hi>London.</hi> About the ſame time I lodged others of
them in my houſe, lent them my money, left my whole
employment for eight days together to ſhew them the
Countrey at my own charge, lodged ſome in my own
Bed. For which I have been invited with fair words,
and by Letters to receive a Recompence; but in the
preſent dealing of that <hi>Society</hi> behold my Reward.
I have been told ſince by the Chiefeſt of them, that
no Place would permit me to Practiſe as I do: And the
malignity of Spirit is riſen ſo high among them,
that I am ſued, terrified, threatned baniſhment from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49888:19"/>
my place of Practice; my very houſe and Laboratory
deſigned to Strangers (if a man may believe ſome of
their own Talkers;) and all to fright me away for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> whither they ſay I am going. Tis true, that
I have been invited to go thither, to reſide at <hi>Dublin,</hi>
by two of the Aldermen of that City, with large
Promiſes; and the like invitations I have had from
<hi>Holland,</hi> to return thither: But my Reſolution is to
abide where I now dwell, unleſs the <hi>Collegiates</hi> drive
me into <hi>London</hi> for ſhelter: For, one where or other
I will be within the ſcent of them, and invite ſuch ſick
as they leave off for incurable, if they can find in their
hearts to ſend them to me; and I hope they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
'tis as poſſible for me, as for an <hi>Old woman,</hi> to
cure ſuch as they too often have ſentenced to death,
for want of ſufficient Medicins. Whereſoever I ſhall
be, in City, or out, my houſe ſhall be open (as it now
is) to receive all poor diſeaſed Ones, and to furniſh
them freely with eaſie effectual Medicines, when they
muſt not come nigh the Gates of my <hi>All-wiſe Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</hi>
They have (I hear) lately propoſed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Apothecaries</hi> this delicate Tender, for the Cure
forſooth of the poor; that ſome few of their <hi>Fellows</hi>
ſhall attend at ſet-hours monthly at their Colledge, to
give Bills of Direction to the poor ſick: But upon
what Terms I pray you? Truly, 'tis with a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
bountiful <hi>Proviſo;</hi> provided that the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
will give <hi>gratis</hi> ſuch Medicines as they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.
Wonderful Charity at other mens Coſt!
They will be ſo noble, as to find <hi>Brains, Pen, Ink, and
Paper:</hi> Somewhat they think they muſt ſeem to do,
for mere ſhame; becauſe the poor, and the middle
ſort of Citizens have (for the moſt part) renounced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49888:20"/>
them as too tedious to their purſes, and in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts,
therefore are glad to flock for help to others:
but tis pleaſant to think of the worthy project, that
<hi>the poor 'Pothecary is to pay for all.</hi> But, by your leave
(ſays he) <hi>Two words to a Bargain;</hi> and ſo there is like
to be no more news of this fair propoſal, when
men have done laughing at it.</p>
            <p>By this I perceive, there is no danger that they
will draw away my poorer Cuſtomers from me;
for whoſe Relief I have prepared effectual Remedies,
ſuch as will according to the mind of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
cure <hi>Citò, Tutò, &amp; Jucunde;</hi> and fitted a Method of my
own, anſwerable to their Vertues, having ſpent 38.
years in laborious pains and Travels, to gain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and knowledge in Phyſick above the common
ſort; I have look't into the Practice of the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
and Artiſts of divers Nations, and compared
them with one another, and their opinions touching
the Nature of their Medicines, their manner of uſing
them, the operation of them, and their Doctrines about
Diſeaſes. I hope then, it will not be thought I Practiſe
without a Method; which though it be not the ſame
that the more Common Collegiates, and the <hi>mere
Academians</hi> do dote upon, yet 'tis much more direct
and plain to the purpoſe; and with it my Remedies
are ſuch as my ſelf and my Patients may depend upon.
And beſides the general extent of many of them,
I have other Medicines which are appropriated to
particular diſtempers. As for example, I have cured
deſperate <hi>Quartans,</hi> ſome of a Twelve months con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance:
But generally, in all <hi>Agues,</hi> I cure the fits
in a few daies: <hi>Quotidian</hi> fits I commonly take away
with <hi>one Doſe; Tertian two Doſes,</hi> and <hi>Quartan</hi> with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49888:20"/>
               <hi>three:</hi> which is not done by chance, the Medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch as is particularly appropriate to an Ague <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi>
Ague: It is a Coeleſtial Liquor (if I may ſo call
it) ſuited to all Palates and Conſtitutions, and to be
uſed at any time of the year; and will for performance
challenge a whole Regiment of Pots and Glaſſes.</p>
            <p>I would not be counted a fool in boaſting; for, it is not my
natural temper: but oppreſſion compells me thus to play the
fool, if in my Caſe it be a folly; For, I have reaſon to ſpeak out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that thoſe of his Majeſties friends who once were with him in
exile, may teſtifie who I am, and what ſervices I did them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-Sea
in their Sickneſſes; and I know they will, touching
their own Caſes, make a juſt Report. I could wiſh that moſt
noble Lady the Counteſs of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> were alive, to make up
the number in teſtifying on my behalf, how many of her friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I cured while ſhe was called my Lady <hi>Stanhope,</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> in
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Court. Colonel <hi>Bampfield</hi> is yet living,
who after he had conveyed away his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi>
from St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s, out of his Enemies hands into <hi>Holland,</hi> the next
year fell into a violent Fever; and when his Phyſicians deſpaired
of his Recovery, that Lady ſent to me then at <hi>Roterdam</hi> to haſten

he appeared a man of another Spirit than our <hi>Collegiates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and ſaid, <hi>I commit the Colonel to your care; and do you know, that
incurring him, you will not only oblige me, but the whole Court.</hi>—About
that time, I cured Sr. <hi>Francis Mack-worth</hi> of miſerable
pains; about the Cure of which he ſaid, he had before ſpent
much money in trying what he could in <hi>England, France,</hi> and
<hi>Holland,</hi> and had met with no eaſe; but it pleaſed God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
me to cure him in three weeks. A Gentleman who was
then Sr. <hi>Francis</hi> his Lieutenant, is now Captain to one of his

he liveth at this time in <hi>Pel-Mel.</hi> I could inſtance in a hundred

my own particular; therefore I draw now towards an end.
