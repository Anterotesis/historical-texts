            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>A COLLECTION of ſome Papers Writ upon ſeveral Occaſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Some few <hi>Conſiderations</hi> ſuppoſed uſeful, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vote of the <hi>Houſe of Commons, Friday</hi> the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> upon the Bill for the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the <hi>Exportation</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> and the melting down the Coyn of the Realm; humbly propoſed by Dr. <hi>Hugh Chamberlain,</hi> to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>GOLD and Silver, as all other Commodities, whether Foreign or Domeſtick, muſt be conſidered with reſpect to their real natural Value and Market-price, which are both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry variable, and not to be governed by Laws.</p>
               <p>The real natural Value of all Commodities, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Labour, Charge, and Hazard, in raiſing and bringing the ſame to a Market, and this varies it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; for Gold doth not coſt ſo much in <hi>Peru</hi> or <hi>Guiny,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103766:3"/>
as it doth in <hi>London, Paris,</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> The Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price varies according to the Multitude or Paucity of Chapmen, and the plenty or ſcarcity of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The multitude or paucity of Chapmen hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens according to their ſeveral neceſſities and pleaſures in the uſe of Commodities: Thus we ſee (where Gold is not the meaſure of Trade, as in ſome parts of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and in <hi>Africk</hi>) Iron is much more valuable, becauſe they have much occaſion for the one, and little or no uſe for the other, neither for Veſſels, Ornaments, nor Money. So likewiſe (tho Gold ſhould coſt you 3 <hi>l. per</hi> Ounce, if you can find but few Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and your neceſſities compel you to ſell) you muſt take 2 <hi>l.</hi> if you can get no more. And (if it ſhould coſt you but 2 <hi>l. per</hi> Ounce, if there are many Merchants) you may fell it for 3 <hi>l. 10 s.</hi> more or leſs; for 'tis not what Charge it ſtands you in, but the greater or leſſer number that hath occaſion for it, which alters and raiſeth the price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The plenty and ſcarcity of Commodity alſo varies the price, tho much above or below the natural Value. Thus a piece of Bread of a Penny natural va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, is oft ſold in a Siege for 5 <hi>s.</hi> And on the contrary, a Diamond formerly ſold for 10 <hi>l.</hi> when ſcarce, hath by clogging the Market yeilded but 5 <hi>l.</hi> tho poſſibly leſs than the Charge expended, which is the natural Value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nothing can poſſibly bring Gold or Silver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Foreign growth, into <hi>England,</hi> but the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Commodities of our own Growth or Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; or what our Natives can return from Foreign Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103766:3"/>
for their Labour; or what Foreign Travellers ſpend here to ſee the Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nothing can poſſibly carry our Gold and Silver out of <hi>England,</hi> but the conſuming more Foreign Commodities at prime coſt, than we get in value for the ſale of our exported Merchandize; or what Foreign Merchants and Mechanicks by their Labour and Thrift can ſave here to return to their own Country; or what our Nobility and Gentry ſpend abroad in their Travels; or what our Ambaſſadors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Foreign Miniſters, or our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Foreign Countries, or Mercinary Allies draw out of the Nation.</p>
               <p>So that 'tis neither changing the Denomination of our Coin higher or lower, above or under the natural Value and Market-price of the material (which Quantity and Uſe will regulate) can either gain, keep, or drive away our Gold and Silver, but only the abovmentioned bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Trade, over or under, which, like neceſſity, will over-rule all Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That which makes the variety of Value here at home betwixt Gold, Silver, and Bullion, is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion among themſelves, according as they exceed the Proportion ſetled by the Standard, in Uſe or Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For Example, When there is more uſe for Gold, or leſs quantity in Proportion than for Silver, Gold ſhall be dear, and exceed the Standard in the Market-price, tho the natural Value continues the ſame. And when there is more uſe for Silver, or leſs quantity in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than for Gold, Silver ſhall be dear, and exceed the Standard in the Market-price, tho the natural Value were the ſame. And when there is more uſe for Plate than for Money, Plate ſhall be deareſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and exceed the Standard in value; and Coyning ſhall not only ſtand
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103766:4"/>
ſtill, but very oft the Coyn ſhall be melted down. For if the quantity of Gold exceeds (in Proportion) the Silver, Gold ſhall be cheap. If Silver exceeds Gold, Silver ſhall be cheap: If Money exceeds Plate, Money ſhall be cheap: If Plate exceeds Money, Plate ſhall be cheap. And tho Money ſtill retains the ſame Denomination, it doth not always the ſame Value, being alſo over-ruled by the plenty or ſcarcity of other Commodities; for a Crown is not of the ſame Value when it will purchaſe but half a Buſhel of Wheat, as when it can a whole one; there being then either leſs Corn, or more need of it, or more Chapmen that come with more Money; but this variety is no prejudice to the Nation, in reſpect of the quantity of Gold and Silver; for when we have more Money, we have ſo much the leſs Plate; and if more in Plate, we have the leſs in Money. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is a very great damage to Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Money is living Riches, Plate but dead; that being capable of turning and improving Trade, when this is not.</p>
               <p>The Nobilities hoarding and carrying of Gold in their Pockets, and the great Gaming with Gold, will raiſe the price above Silver, tho the Proportion remains the ſame.</p>
               <p>From the Premiſes may be concluded, That raiſing the Value of our Money cannot keep it, tho it may give our Merchants ſome trouble to adjuſt the <hi>Par</hi> in their Exchange and Trade abroad. Nor lowering it cannot drive it away, without bringing as much or more in the room; but if we take no care to exceed in Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, all we can do will never keep our Money; and if we do exceed in Exportations, all Foreigners can do, can never draw it away. Exportations ſhould be ſufficient
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103766:4"/>
to anſwer the Charges that Foreign payments of Allies, Armies, Ambaſſadors, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Travellers, and returning ſtrange Dealers requires, as well as importing Foreign Commodities, or we muſt ſtill decline. Which Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Trade 'tis humbly conceived, may well deſerve the ſerious Care of this Honourable Houſe. This Duty I thought I ow'd my Country, and hope 'twill give no offence. If I have been miſtaken, I'll thank any that will rectify me.</p>

               <head>Some Conſiderations upon the Neceſſity of Calling in the Clipt and Counterfeit Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Written ſome time ſince.</head>
               <p>THE Clipt and Counterfeit Money now current in the Nation, is a loſs muſt certainly fall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and the longer deferr'd, the greater it will prove; whence will naturally ariſe three Conſiderations.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> How to prevent the increaſe of it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where to place this Loſs with moſt Juſtice and Conveniency?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What new Meaſures can be prudently taken to repair this Loſs to the Nation?</item>
               </list>
               <p>Upon the firſt Enquiry, It cannot be much amiſs to premiſe, that Money counterfeited and clipt in <hi>England</hi> is, <hi>per ſe,</hi> no Loſs to the Nation, tho 'tis to Particulars; nay, it may by chance be a Gain to the Nation. But all that is clipt and counterfeited beyond the Sea, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, is not only a damage to Particulars, but a dead Loſs to the Nation, which Importation can notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be no ways prevented as long as clipt and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Money is ſuffered to be current, which therefore becomes, <hi>per accidens,</hi> a Miſchief.</p>
               <p>The only Remedy therefore is, to cry down on the ſame day throughout the Nation, all the clipt and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103766:5"/>
Money which ſhall not be brought in within twenty four hours after ſuch publick Notice, that ſo there may be no time for either further Clipping or Counterfeiting, at leaſt, not beyond Sea, which is by much the greater Miſchief. Let ſuch Money be paid into the Chamber of the Adjacent Corporations, and into the County Courts, where each Perſon muſt have an Authentick Receipt of the Monies ſo paid in by Tale, and not by Weight or Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond enquiry is, where to place the Loſs?</p>
               <p>Even upon the whole Nation; for (ſince it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to make the Foreign and Domeſtick Offenders refund) it ſeems unjuſt to charge it upon other innocent particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, as well as unreaſonable to undo a few with a Burthen which the whole Nation can hardly feel: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Government ſhould think fit to charge ſome ſmall matter, as five <hi>per Cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or thereabouts upon Particulars, becauſe few will ſuffer much thereby, except the great money'd Men, who can beſt bear it.</p>
               <p>In the putting this into practice, great care muſt be taken, that there be no incouragement given to clip the Money remaining whole, and pouring in a great quantity of falſe Money. And ſecondly, That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not, tho for never ſo ſmall a time, be unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Market-money for preſent indiſpenſable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p>To prevent the firſt, The calling it all in in one and the ſame day throughout <hi>England,</hi> ſeems the likelieſt means And for the ſecond, That either all the Silver Plate ſome Weeks before the Prohibition be called in to be Coined, weight for weight, and ſent down to the ſeveral County Treaſuries, to be changed for indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103766:6"/>
Neceſſaries, together with Pence, Farthings, and Half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pence in Copper, coined on purpoſe without <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raud or Deceit, according to the Value allowed, upon a high Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. And to compel Perſons to bring in their Silver Plate to be coined, 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Ounce may be laid upon all Plate uncoined. Or elſe that five Shilling Tickets of Credit be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed payable in three or ſix Months, inſtead of Coining the Plate, and to be in the mean time current by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the laſt Inquiry, How the Nation may find ſome amends? It may be conſidered, whether 'tis not fit that no Tax whatever, except Pariſh Rates, be paid for one whole Year next enſuing: or but half Taxes for two Years: or quarter Taxes for four Years, for the Government may be as effectually ſupplied by voluntary Methods another way.</p>

               <p>The high price of Guineas at the preſent ſeems to be, what it really is, a great Grievance; but yet it is no more capable of being reduced or fixed by Law, than a Cuckow to be hedged in; for neceſſity, and the natural Value will always over-rule, which follows the plenty or ſcarcity of Silver in proportion to other Commodities, or to its ſeveral Uſes and Demands.</p>
               <p>The beſt Remedy is to make Gold and Silver more plentiful, and keep both to their due Standard, which will bring down their price without a Law, tho the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination ought by no means to admit of an Alteration: Or elſe to make them both leſs uſeful, and leſs neceſſary; for whatever is ſcarce, or ſo in proportion to its uſes, muſt ever be dear, nothing but a prudent Ballance of Trade

can poſſibly increaſe our Gold or Silver: And nothing can render its uſes leſs neceſſary, than a well-eſtabliſhed Land-Credit.</p>
               <p>Money-Credit cannot do it, and Reputation-Credit cannot only leſs do it, but is more dangerous.</p>
               <p>The hinderance of the Importation of Bullion, or the imprudent Permiſſion of its Exportation, are to be more lamented than the loſs of ten times the value of other Commodities. For,</p>

               <p>That bad Money thus made current, and hindred from increaſing, will make a quick Trade, and equal a ſmall Sum by frequent Circulation to a great Sum which moves ſlow.</p>
               <p>If by this means, Money can be prevented from being clipt, and counterfeit Money from being made, 'tis the ſpeedieſt and eaſieſt Redreſs without danger.</p>
               <p>That there can be no better reaſon pretended for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Bullion, but the <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, which ought to be regulated, if not thought fit to be prevented: But if there muſt neceſſarily be Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis better to export it Coined, and to have the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bear the Coinage charge, by which Manufacture ſome will be here imployed; the Credit of our Coyn abroad will be ſome Honour, and nothing but the Coinage loſt, which is among our ſelves, and 'tis likelier to return when coined than uncoined. And if the Merchant hath the ſame weight and fineneſs out of the <hi>Tower</hi> as he brought in, every one will bring it thither, let it be at what price it will abroad. And when more can be got by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities than by Money, none will export Money, and, that none may be, we ought to leſſen the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>Many Treatiſes have been writ on this Subject, ſome give us the Hiſtory of Coyn not altogether unuſeful; ſome are dreſt Mathematically, that their Aſſertions may ſeem the more cogent, but many of them are beſides the mark: Which is only to provide, That our Native and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured Commodities exoprted may exceed the Value of all Foreign conſumable Commodities imported, as much as, or more than our Foreign Expence of Armies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amounts to, and then Gold and Silver muſt of neceſſity be brought back to ballance the Overplus, and this no Law nor Cunning can hinder, and without this care no Law nor Cunning can preſerve us.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe we ſhould call two Crowns but five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, no Home nor Foreign Trader could come by this five Shillings, but for ten Shillings worth of Goods or Labour, and then 'tis the ſame thing.

               <p>Have the Bank-Dollers in <hi>Holland</hi> been altered in their Name or Weight by the riſe of Bullion there, which ſome report to be riſen, tho others deny it? Nor is there more or better reaſon here to alter our Standard.</p>

               <head>To the Honourable the Houſe of Commons, A Propoſal for making good the light and clipt Money; bumbly tendered by Dr. <hi>Hugh Chamberlain.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE ſaid Doctor for ſome Years laſt paſt made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Advantagious Propoſals to this Houſe, for paſſing currant Credit upon valuable Pledges. One of which was in <hi>February</hi> (93), reported by a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, practicable, and tending to the benefit of the Nation.</p>
               <p>That divers Perſons have this Seſſion made to this Honourable Houſe Propoſals evidently built upon the Doctor's Foundation, as can eaſily be made appear, when commanded.</p>
               <p>The Doctor relying upon the Juſtice of this Houſe for a preference, in caſe his Propoſal be but equal to thoſe; and depending upon their Wiſdom (in caſe the ſame be more advantagious) therefore humbly ſubmits to this Honourable Houſe what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That for all clipt and light Money brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Exchequer, Bills of Current-Credit ſhall be by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Lords of the Treaſury, iſſued out of the Office of Land-Credit, payable according to the Direction of this Honourable Houſe, at three Months certain from the date of ſuch Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103766:10"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all the new Money, ſo faſt as Minted, may be paid into the ſaid Office of Land-Credit, to anſwer the ſaid Bills, iſſued by ſuch Orders of the Lords of the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſince this Houſe hath thought fit to Vote but Twelve hundred thouſand Pounds to make good the Clipt Money, the ſaid Office of Land-Credit humbly offers to perform the ſame for Sixty thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> for Thirty Years; or an Hundred and twenty thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> for Fifteen Years; which is either Five <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> for Thirty Years; or Ten <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> for Fifteen Years, without Payment of the Principal Sum. And this Propoſal comprehends all the Advantages offered by Mr. <hi>Briſcoe,</hi> at two fifths cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Nation: But if that Gentleman (as ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) ſhall fall from his firſt Propoſal of One hundred thouſand Pounds, to Seventy five thouſand <hi>per Ann.</hi> for forty years, which will then be after the Rate of Four Pounds thirteen ſhillings and eight pence, <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> or Five <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> wanting one ſixteenth part for the forty years, yet will this Propoſal ſtill be one fifth in the whole cheaper to the Nation than his, and this may be redeemed at any time whenever the Parliament ſhall pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis humbly hoped, that this, being no ſmall ſervice at this time to the Nation, ſhall not want, at leaſt, an equal Encouragement from the Government with the Bank of <hi>England;</hi> it being on far better terms than Mr. <hi>Briſcoe</hi>'s, and as much ſuperior to his, as his to the Bank of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That if the Houſe ſhall think fit to enlarge their Allowance for Clipt and Light Money, and to grant their Charitable Relief to ſuch poor perſons as through
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103766:10"/>
Miſtake and Ignorance receive Counterfeit Money, the ſaid Office will undertake at the ſame rate of Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> for thirty years, or Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> for fifteen years, to perform the ſame: Which great Charity of this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe may preſerve abundance of poor Families from extreme Miſery, otherwiſe inevitable to them; their All often conſiſting in ſuch Counterfeit Money.</p>
               <p>That the Doctor, in the Infancy of this Increaſe of Counterfeit Money, did humbly inſinuate to divers Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the late Parliament, the dangerous and chargeable Conſequences, that, unleſs timely prevented, were likely then to enſue, and have ſince but too truly been verified; he now preſumes to offer to the Conſideration of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe, with all dutiful Deference to their great Wiſdom, That if ſome effectual Proviſion be not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately made, for the Employing and Maintaining the Poor, the Miſchievous Conſequences that may enſue the Neglect of it, may poſſibly prove fatal. To avoid which Danger, Propoſals may be humbly offered, whenever this Honourable Houſe will pleaſe to Command.</p>
