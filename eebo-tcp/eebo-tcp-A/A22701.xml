         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WHen the minde is firſt of al ſeaſoned with faith, which worketh by charity, it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by good life at length to come to a viſible knowledge and ſight of God; in which place, to the godly and pure in heart, there is a knowen and vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable beauty; the full ſight and contemplation whereof, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the higheſt happineſſe.

NOw what can be hoped for, which is not beleeued? But yet on the contrary, ſomething may bee beleeued, which is not hoped for.

Finally, diuers in the rules of Grammar doe borrow this word

for an example, to ſhewe how improperly it is vſed; who ſay, he vſed that word <hi>ſperare</hi> (which is to hope) for, or in ſtead of <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere,</hi> which is to fear. Ther is a faith therefore, both of euill things &amp; of good; becauſe both good and bad be beleeued, and that with a cheerefull, and not a fearefull faith. There is a faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of things paſt, things preſent, and things to come. For, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Chriſt died, which is already paſt. We beleeue that he ſitteth at the right hand of his father, which is at this inſtant. We beleeue that he ſhall come to iudge; a thing that ſhall be. A. faith, likewiſe, of things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to our ſelues, and alſo of things concerning other men. For euery man beleeueth that he had a beginning, and therefore that hee was not from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; whereof there bee many ſemblable inſtances. Neither do we onely beleeue many, things! touching other men in matter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23777:15"/>
of religion, but likewiſe alſo of Angels. Hope alſo is not but of good euents; and not alſo, but of things to come: properly like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerning him, who is thought to put a truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſame. Which being ſo, Faith is to bee diſtinguiſhed from Hope, as well by a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence agreeing with reaſon, as with the ſenſe of the word. For, as touching thoſe wordes, <hi>non videre,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>not to ſee;</hi> in that ſenſe, Faith and Hope be all one. For in the epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, which teſtimony the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous defenders of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctrine haue vſed, Faith is ſaid to be a knowledge of things which be not ſeene. Although on the other ſide, when any man ſhall ſay, that he beleeued not, either wordes, witneſſes, or any reaſons; but things preſent, which he plainely ſaw (that is to ſay, grounded his faith thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſeemeth not to be ſo abſurd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But indeede, wee doe more properly call that faith, which, as the ſacred ſcriptures haue taught vs, is of things inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Touching Hope alſo, the Apoſtle ſaith, that that hope is no hope at all, which is of things viſible. For to what ende doth a man hope in thoſe things which he ſeeth? But, if wee hope for thoſe things which wee ſee not, we patiently tarry in expectance thereof. Whereas the godly doe beleeue, that good things ſhall fall vnto their portion: it is as much to ſay, as they bee hoped for of the good. But now, what ſhall I ſay of Loue, without which, Faith is of no force? for indeed, Hope cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Loue. Finally, as the Apoſtle
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23777:16"/>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>The very Diuels doe beleeue, and tremble:</hi> howebe it, they neither hope, nor yet loue; but rather feare, in belieuing that the ſame ſhall come to paſſe hereafter, which wee doe hope for, and affect. For which cauſe, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth allow of that faith, which worketh by loue, and which alſo cannot bee without hope. To conclude therefore, neither loue can bee without hope, nor hope without loue; nor either of them without faith.</p>

For, if it bereaue it not of any good, it is not conſequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious or hurtful: but it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in depriuing it of that which is good.

                  <p>Two ſtrange poſitions maintained contrary to the vulgar opinion: the one, that there can bee no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſaid to be there, where there is not any good: and the other, that good is called euill; that is to ſay, one and the ſelfe ſame thing is both good and bad.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY this agument, there is not any euill, if there be not any good. But good which is void of euill, is abſolutely good. On the other ſide, in whom euill hath gotten a poſſeſſion, in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, good is either more or leſſe polluted: neither can there bee by any means, any euill, where ther is no good at all. There is a great myſterie therefore herein: as wherein, becauſe all nature, in as much as it is nature, is of it ſelfe good, it can haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning or conſtruction, beeing ſaid to be a nature that is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23777:22"/>
polluted and euil, but that which is good, is alſo euill: and that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertibly it cannot be euill, which is not likewiſe good. Becauſe all which is called by the name of nature, is good: neither ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing become euill, if the thing it ſelfe which is euill, had not an eſſence, nature, or being. There can therefore bee none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, if there be no good. Which aſſertion, though it may ſeeme abſurd, yet the coherence of this argument, doth as it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euaſion, driue vs to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. And we muſt take heed, leſt we ſtumble vpon that ſaying of the Prophet, where we reade, <hi>Woe be vnto them which ſay that good is euill, and that euill is good: who ſay that ſweet is ſower, and ſower ſweet: who call darkeneſſe light, and light darkeneſſe.</hi> But yet God doth ſay, <hi>that an euill man out of the treaſure of his owne heart, doth bring forth euils.</hi> Now what is an euill man, but an euill nature, becauſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23777:22"/>
we call nature? And if man bee in ſome meaſure good, or a kind of good, becauſe hee is nature; what other thing is an euil man, but an euill good? Howbeit, when wee ſeparate and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe two properties, wee doe alſo find, that he is not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euill, becauſe he is a man: nor therefore good, becauſe hee is ſinfull: but good, in as much as he is a man and euill becauſe he is a ſinner. Whoſoeuer therefore affirmeth, that man, as he is man is euill, or ſaith that that which is called good, is euil, he incurreth the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tece of the Prophet ſaying, <hi>Woe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſay that good is euill.</hi> For he doth depraue the work of God, which is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </argument>
               <p>WHerefore in theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which be called good and euill, that rule of Logicke faileth; affirming, <hi>that two cotra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot stand together in any one thing.</hi> For there is no firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment clowdy and cleere at one inſtant: no meat or drinke ſweet and ſower together: no mans body white and blacke in one &amp; the ſelfe ſame place: no beauty &amp; deformity in one face at once. Which thing is obſerued in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and almoſt in all contraries, that they cannot be in any one thing together. Now, ſeeing no man doubteth that good &amp; euill be contraries, ſo may they not

onely be together; but alſo euils cannot ſimply be without good things, or but in things which be good: although on the contrary, things which be good may bee without euils. For a man, or an angel, may bee not vnrighteous, becauſe vnrighteouſnes cannot be in any but either in a man, or in an angel. And theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries be ſo combined, as if ther were not good, wherein euill might dwell, euill ſhould haue no beeing at all. Becauſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not haue any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, not onely where to abide, but alſo from whence it may ſpring, and haue a beginning, except there were ſomething that might be corrupted. For, if good were not, neither ſhould there be corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is none other thing than a baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that which is good.

Wherein, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is a great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the caſe, in reſpect of the quality of the minde, and alſo of the cauſes moouing any man to lie. For, he doth not commit ſo great a ſinne, which lieth in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23777:29"/>
or directing another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he which lieth with an intent to doe hurt thereby. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not ſo much hurt, which ſetteth a trauailer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wrong way by lying, as hee which corrupteth the way of mans life, by deceiuing him with vntruths. And againe, no man is to bee held a liar, who affirmeth a falſhood, taking it for a trueth; becauſe, in as much as in him is, he hath no meaning to deceiue, but is rather deceiued himſelfe. Hee is not therefore to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a liar, but to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured either for temerity &amp; raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, who inconſiderately belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vntruthes, entertaineth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for truthes: But rather on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For, as touching his minde and inward motion; becauſe his tongue declareth not that which his heart thinketh, hee ſaith not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23777:29"/>
the trueth, although in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it fall out to be true which he affirmeth. Neither is he by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes to be freed from the guilt of a lie, which with his mouth ignorantly vttereth a truth, and yet wittingly lieth in his heart. Setting apart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore things themſelues, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whereof, any thing is auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and onely ſetting before our eies the intention of the ſpeaker, that man is better of the two, which through want of knowledge and capacitie, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth an vntrueth, becauſe hee taketh it for a veritie; than hee which contrary to his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, carrieth a minde to lie and deceiue, although indeede hee cannot truely iudge of that to be truth which hee affirmeth. For, the firſt of theſe 2. hath not one thing in his heart, and another in his mouth: But the ſecond (no doubt) howſoeuer it bee falſe or true which hee ſaith,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23777:30"/>
yet hath hee, notwithſtanding, one thing ſhut vp in his breaſt, and another thing in his tongue, which euill is a propertie inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the liar. And now to come to the conſideration of things which be held and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there is as great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the matter wherein any man is deceiued, or doth lie: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, that to bee deceiued is a leſſe euill than to lie, weighing therein, the intention of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, yet is it much more tolerable, in matters out of the compaſſe of religion, to lie and diſſemble, than to bee deceiued and miſled in thoſe things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the beleefe and knowledge whereof, God cannot bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: as in many particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it may more cleerely bee found out by him that will ſeeke after the truth.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23777:30"/>
who is dead; and another, who beeing deceiued, beleeueth that Chriſt after many ages to come, ſhall ſuffer a ſecond death.

Thirdly, hee which ſo farre-forth beleeueth an euill man to bee good, as that hee ſuffereth no hurt by him at all, is not thereby ſeduced to any hurt to himſelfe, neither doeth that deteſtation of the Prophet fall vpon him, pronouncing a woe vnto thoſe who affirme, <hi>that euill is good.</hi> For that ſaying is to bee vnderſtood of the things wherein men do offend, or commit euill, and not of the perſons themſelues.

that ſaying of the Prophet: but he who pronounceth that man to be honeſt, whom he taketh to be chaſte, not knowing him to be an adulterer, that man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, not in the true ſenſe of that doctrine of things that bee good and euill, but is deceiued by the cloſe carriage of men in their manners; calling him a good man, whom he thinketh to be indued with that which hee knoweth to be good, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming ſtill, that an adulterous perſon is euill, and a continent perſon good: howbeit, ſaying that this man is good, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is an adulterer, and that man to be euill, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee is an honeſt liuer.

in that he is the word, and on the other ſide, the ſonne of the holy Ghoſt, as he is man; as though the holy Ghoſt, as it were his father, did beget him of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his mother? Who dare be ſo bold, as to auouch this? neither is it needful by argument or diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to declare, what other abſurdities doe followe hereof; ſeeing this one aſſertion is ſo abſurd in it ſelfe, as the eares of the faithfull cannot indure to heare it.

Ghoſt doth proceed.</hi> How then doe we ſay that Chriſt was borne of the H. ghoſt, if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt did not beget him? or is it ſo ſaid, becauſe he made him? The reaſon is, becauſe as Ieſus
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23777:56"/>
Chriſt is God, all things were of his creation; but, as hee was man, he himſelfe was created &amp; made, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>For, he was made of the ſeed of Dauid according to the fleſh.</hi> But, ſeeing the whole Trinitie did create and make that creature, which the virgin did conceiue and bring forth, tho appertaining and adioyned to the perſon of the ſonne (for the workes of the Trinitie be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable) why is the holy ghoſt onely named in the making of this creature? Is it becauſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of theſe three bee named in any one worke, that the whole Trinitie is aſſiſtant in that work? It is euen ſo, and may be made plaine vnto vs by example or demonſtration. Howbeit, wee muſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

may the world, without impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, be called the ſonne of God, becauſe God made the ſame; neither elſe, that it was borne of him: but rather, wee may rightly ſay, that it was made, or created, or builded, or ordained by him; or vſe wordes of the like ſenſe. Seeing therefore wee doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that hee was borne of the holy Ghoſt, and the virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> it is a matter of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to diſcuſſe, how he ſhould not bee the ſonne of the holy Ghoſt, but the ſonne of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary;</hi> notwithſtanding, that hee was begotten both of the one, and of the other.

But on the contrarie, If hee had rather houlde theſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and earthly things in time of temptation, then Chriſt, then had hee not him for his foundation, in as much as hee preferred them before Chriſt; the foundation being the firſt thing that is to bee layed in any building.

Finally,</hi> Danaeus <hi>doth cite a comparatiue ſpeech of auntient Fathers, who affirmed that great ſinnes were to bee done away by penance, and ſmall offences by iteration or dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaying of the Lords Praier: leſt any man ſhould take a liberty to ſinne, hearing that enormious ſinnes might be redeemed by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; or on the other ſide, ſhould bee terrified and driuen to deſpair

are defiled and vnbeleeuing, but euen their minde and conſciences are defiled.</hi> How therfore ſhould all things be pure vnto the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, though they gaue almes, and were without faith?

               </argument>
               <p>NEither is it to be denied, that the ſoules of the deceaſed are releeued by the godlineſſe of their liuing friendes, when as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſacrifice of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is offered for them or almes diſtributed in the Church. But theſe thinges bee auaileable but onelie to ſuch, who when they liued, did meritorious workes to make them auailcable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, there is a kinde of life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo good, but that it needeth theſe helpes, after death; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo euill, but that it may bee benefited by them. And there is a kinde of liuing ſo good as needeth not theſe helpes: and there is a kinde of liuing ſo euill, that it can receiue no helpe or
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:23777:138"/>
benefit by theſe, when the courſe of this life is finiſhed. Wherefore in this life man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth a poſſibilitie of being releeued after this life, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth himſelfe to a neceſſitie of greeuous and helpeleſſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. For, let no man hope when hee is dead, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny after-merite to redeeme his neglect of well dooing while he liued, with God. Therfore theſe, deuotions, which the Church, doth ſoofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe in praying for the dead, bee not repugnant to that ſentence or aſſertion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, wherin it is ſaid, <hi>for we ſhal al appear before the tribunal of Chriſt to receiue iudgement according to our deedes in the fleſh, as they haue beene either good or euill;</hi> Becauſe euery man while hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the fleſh did ſuch thinges as deſerued this fauour of God, that the prayers of the Church might bee effectuall for him after his departure &amp; death. For, they are not auaileable for all.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23777:139"/>
And wherefore are they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable for all, but in reſpect of the diuerſitie of euery mans acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this life? When as therefore either the ſacrifices of the altar, or of any ſort of almes be offered for all ſuch as bee baptized and dead, they become actions of thankes-giuing for ſuch as were exceeding good, and peace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings for ſuch as were not excee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding euill: albeit for ſuch as bee exceeding euil, theſe helpes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail not at al after they are dead: howſoeuer they which be liuing do take comfort thereby. And to whom ſoeuer theſe things ſhall bee auaileable, they bee either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable to the full remiſſion of their ſinnes: or elſe that thereby their damnation may be the more eaſie and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>DIuers therefore, nay, verie many, doe vainely (out of humane affection) lament the euerlaſting paine of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their perpetuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without intermiſſion; and doe beleeue that it ſhall not be ſo indeed: wherein though they wil not contradict the ſcriptures, yet doe they priuately in their owne conceipts mitigate the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie therof &amp; drawe God to a more merciful ſentence, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the report therof in the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:23777:145"/>
holy ſcriptures, is more terrible, then true. For, ſay they, God will not forget to be merciful, or ſhut vp his louing kindnes in diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This ſaying is indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a godly Pſalme; but it is meant, without all doubt, of ſuch as be called the veſſels of Gods mercie: Becauſe they are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of their calamitie &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, nor in reſpect of their own merites, but of God who hath commiſeration of them. Or, if this may be thought to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpoken, it followeth not therefore that they ſhould think there may bee an ende of theit damnation, of whome it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>And they ſhal goe to eternall puniſhment:</hi> leſt by this means the felicitie alſo of them might be thought to hau an ende and determination in time, to whom it is alſo ſaide, <hi>The iuſt ſhall go to life euerlaſting.</hi> But let them ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if that may content them, that the puniſhmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bee mitigated in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

For, this damnation, is called the anger of God, and not a perturbation of Gods minde; So that in his anger, or during the continuance thereof, his mercies ſhould neuertheleſſe not bee ſhut vp, howbeit the ſame ſhould not make an end of eternall puniſhment, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue an intermiſſion or ſome eaſe of their torments, Becauſe the Pſalme ſayeth not, to make an ende of his anger, or after his anger was paſt, but during his anger.

               <p>NOw, for Charitie, which the Apoſtle pronounceth to be greater then theſe two, that is, faith and hope; by how much the greater it is in any man, by ſo much hee is the better in whome it is. For, when wee aske whether a man bee good or not, Wee aske not, what hee beleeues or hopes for, but what hee loueth. For, hee that loues aright, doubtleſſe beleeues and hopes aright. But hee which loues not, beleeues in vaine, though the thinges bee true hee doth beleeue: and hopes

For, although no man can hope without loue, yet it may and doth ſometimes fal out, that a man loues not that, without which hee cannot attaine the thing hee hopeth for. As, if a man hope for eternall life, and yet neither hath, nor loueth righteouſneſſe, without which no man attaineth eternall life. This is that faith of Chriſt which the Apoſtle commendes, which works by loue: and what it findes defectiue in loue, it asketh, that it may receiue, and ſeeketh that it may finde, and knocketh that it may bee opened vnto it. For, faith obtaineth what the lawe commandeth. For, without the gift of God; That is, without the holy Ghoſt, by which the loue of God is ſhed abroade in
