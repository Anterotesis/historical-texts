            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TREATISE Concerning the <hi>East-India Trade.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEfore I enter upon the particular proof of the Propositions in the Frontispiece, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Readers leave to mention some few general Opinions of my own concerning Trade, which I have long since entertained; and the older I grow in Experience, the more I am confirmed in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Trading Merchants while they are in the busie and eager prosecution of their particular Trades, although they be very wise and good Men, are not always the best Judges of Trade, as it relates to the Profit or Power of a Kingdom. The reason may be, because their Eyes are so continually fixt, and their Minds intent upon what makes for their pecuiiar Gain or Loss, that they have not leasure to expatiate or turn their thoughts to what is most Advantageous to the Kingdom in general. This I am told was the Opinion anciently of <hi>M. T. Cicero,</hi> and also <hi>Boden,</hi> that learned <hi>French</hi> Author, and lately of the Lord Chief Justice <hi>St. John,</hi> who was a principal <hi>Engineer</hi> in the first Act of Navigation. But whether it was their Opinion or not, I am sure it's true by manifold Experience; of which I could give pregnant Instances in the Age we


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48676:3"/>
live in, and former Councils of Trade since his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties happy Restauration, but that I design brevity, and to avoid all Personal reflections. The like may be said of all Shopkeepers, Artificers, Clothiers, and other Manufacturers, until they leave off their Trades, and being Rich, by the purchase of Lands, become of the same common Interest with most of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And upon the same reason I am of Opinion, and have found by Experience, that a mixt Assembly of Noblemen, Gentlemen, and Merchants, are the best Constitution that can be established for the making Rules, Orders, and By-Laws, for the carrying on any Trade for the publick Utility of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all Domestick or Foreign Trade, to any Place or Countrey, that doth not in the Result and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of it, increase the value of our <hi>English</hi> Lands (the good plight whereof is the main Basis of our Wealth, Freedom, and Safety) ought not only to be discouraged, but totally rejected.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all Monopolies, of what Nature or Kind soever, are Destructive to Trade, and consequently Obstructive to the increase of the value of our Lands; and that therefore, if there be any thing in the <hi>East-India</hi> Company's Charter, or any Charter of Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated Merchants; that hinders any of his Majesties Subjects of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> from coming into that Trade, upon as good Terms as others of his Majesties Subjects did, or yet may, it would tend to the general good of the Kingdom, that such Barrs or Hinderances were removed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am clearly of opinion (be it said without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) that if all Strangers inhabiting in any of his Majesties Kingdoms (so they be not suffered to be of


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48676:3"/>
Government) had as free liberty to enter into any of our Incorporated Foreign Trades, as any of his Majesties Native Subjects, as is practiced in the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Netherlands,</hi> it would greatly encrease the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and improve the value of Land.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That those narrow Clauses in the <hi>Turkey</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and other Charters, which limit the Traders to be Freemen of <hi>London,</hi> and not to be Shop-keepers, or other than such as they call Legitimate Merchants; as also the practice of admitting no Man to be free of the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company under 25 <hi>l.</hi> if he be under 25 years of Age, or 50 <hi>l.</hi> if above, are to the prejudice of the Nation in general, tho they may be for the advantage of the particular Traders, for which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they were calculated.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I am of Opinion, the Dutch, <hi>Nationally speaking,</hi> are the wisest People now extant, for the contriving and carrying on their Trades for the publick advantage of their Countrey. If any shall here object, that if it be so, I am mistaken in my former Notion, That Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are not always the best Judges of Trade; for the Dutch have most Merchants in their Councils. The Honourable Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> hath already answered for me, that their Councils are made up of very few or no trading Merchants, but of Civilians, or Sons of Merchants, that have long since lest off their active Trades, and have only now Stocks in their <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West India</hi> Companies, or in their Banks and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, or other publick Fonds.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That tho the Dominion of the Sea may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Arms, and fortunate Battels at Sea, it can never be retained, preserved, and maintained, but by the Excess and Predominancy of Forreign Trade.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48676:4"/>
9. That Domestick and Foreign Trade do (as we vulgarly say of Twins, but more truly of Trade) wax and wain together; and if it were not an impropriety of Speech, Land might be coupled with them.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I am of Opinion, that Silver and Gold, coined or uncoined, tho they are used for a Measure of all other things, are no less a Commodity than Wine, Oyl, Tobacco, Cloth, or Stuffs; and may in many Cases be exported as much to National Advantage as any other Commodity.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That no Nation ever was or will be considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Trade, that prohibits the Exportation of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. That though it may be best to be left free and indifferent, it is more for the publick advantage to export Gold or Silver coined than uncoined: By the former we gain the Manufacture, and something of Honour and Magnificence it is, to have his Majesties Royal Stamp pass current in all parts of the World.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I am confident, whatever Nation hath the <hi>lowest Interest,</hi> will certainly have their Lands in highest esteem and price; and that no Nation shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over-match the Dutch in Trade, till they mate them in the rate of Interest of Money.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That the Dutch gain much more by Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Foreign Commodities exported from their Provinces, of which the chief are Wines, <hi>East-India</hi> Goods, English Herrings, <hi>Greenland</hi> Oyl and Fins, than by all their own native Productions and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That it is as probable an attempt to wash a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amore White, as to hope that ever we can cope with the Dutch in White Herrring Fishing, Salt-droaging


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48676:4"/>
from St. <hi>Uvals</hi> to the <hi>East-Land,</hi> or the <hi>Russia</hi> or <hi>Greenland</hi> Trade, till the Interest of our Money be as low as theirs.</p>
            <p n="16">16. I always bear that deference to the consent of Nations and Numbers, that when-ever I see wise and great Nations, having different Interests, and various Forms of Government, yet conspire, as it were, in the same means, to accomplish the same ends of Profit., Power and Honour, I conclude, they are nearer the right way to those ends, than the wisest and best pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men living, that hold contrary Opinions, swayed by personal Profit or Loss, Pique or Prejudice.</p>
            <p n="17">17. I am of Opinion, with submission to better Judgments, that there is just as much need of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Merchants in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Holland,</hi> and no more. Where Companies are necessary the Dutch have them; and in such manner as is most necessary to the Nature and Commerce of the Countreys, for which they are incorporated. And I never heard of any Companies of Merchants there, but those of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> and both in Joynt Stocks; protected and defended by the Laws of the Provinces, which are of the same force as Acts of Parliaments with us.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That there is a necessity of a Joynt Stock in all Foreign Trade, where the Trade must be maintained by Force and Forts on the Land; and where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty cannot conveniently maintain an Amity and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence by Embassadors; and not elsewhere.</p>
            <p>I shall now return to what was proposed to be proved in the Title page, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48676:5"/>
               <head>I. <hi>That the</hi> East-India <hi>Trade is the most National of all Foreign Trades.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Which I prove thus: <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. WHat the Dutch, French, Danes, Portugals, and which, not long since, the Swedes, and now the D. of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> have with so great Charge and Expence attempted, and hedged about with Laws and Encouragements, must certainly be a Matter of the greatest National Consequence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Trade employs more great Warlike English Ships, that may carry from 50 to 70 Guns a-piece, than all the Trades of the World from <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Trade alone furnisheth us with Saltpetre, a Commodity so necessary, that in the late Kings time the Nation suffered greatly by the want of it; as is too well known and remembred.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Above four fifth parts of the Commodities Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by this Trade, are again Exported into Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts; by which the Navigation and Trade of this Kingdom is vastly encreased into <hi>Turkey, Italy, Spain, France, Holland,</hi> and other parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; by the Returns of which, more than treble the Bullion is Imported, that was first Exported to <hi>India;</hi> and the Wealth of this Kingdom is as greatly encreased, as by the direct Trade to and from the <hi>East-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Most of the <hi>East-India</hi> Commodities are of so small bulk, that if the Trade of the <hi>East-Indies</hi> were


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48676:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not in English hands, the Commodities, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Laws to the contrary, would come in from <hi>Holland</hi> (as the French Silks now do) with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only; then we should pay as much for Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which we now sell for 8 <hi>d.</hi> the pound, as we do for Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace, Cinnamon which is from 6 <hi>s.</hi> to 15 <hi>s. per</hi> pound; tho some of them are cheaper at the places of their Growth than Pepper is at <hi>Bantam;</hi> but enhaunsed to that price by the Dutch, having the sole Trade for them. By which I conclude this saves the Kingdom in that respect only, 500000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> that otherwise they would be outwitted of.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All Riches and Power in Nations, as well as private Families, consists in comparison. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Countrey may be accounted Rich, if he be much richer than other Gentlemen, his Neighbours, tho but of moderate Estate. So <hi>England</hi> may be said to be Rich or Strong, as our Strength or Riches bears a proportion with our Neighbour Nations, French, Dutch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and consequently whatever weakens or depopulates them, enricheth and strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>England.</hi> And most certain it is, That no Foreign Trade doth so work upon the Manufactures of our Neighbour Nations, as this Trade of the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> for the Staple Countreys for Silks and Fine Linnen, are <hi>Italy, France, Holland, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. insomuch, as it is reasonably computed, those Countreys, by the Importation of <hi>East-India</hi> Silks and Callicoes; not only into <hi>England,</hi> but from <hi>England</hi> into their own Countreys, are abated in those fine Manufactures above a Million of Pounds <hi>Sterling per Annum.</hi>

7. And which is a consideration of great weight, and may be of immense advantage to the strength, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousness and riches of this Nation in a few years. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath already the principal Trade of Woollen Manufactures, and now a quicker vent and export for them than ever it had in the memory of any man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But throughout Christendom I have ever been of Opinion that generally speaking, there are more Men and Women imployed in Silk Manufactures than in Woollen: of which likewise <hi>England</hi> hath obtained a considerable part, considering the short time since our Silk Broad Weaving began; which was but since Mr. <hi>Burlimach</hi> brought in Silk-Diers and Throwsters, towards the end of the late King <hi>James,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's Regn. And I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed the number of Families already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein in <hi>England,</hi> doth amount to above 40000. Now what should hinder, but that in a few years more, this Nation may treble that number in such Manufactures; since the <hi>East-India</hi> Company have of late years found out a way of bringing Raw Silk of all sorts into this Kingdom, cheaper than it can be afforded in <hi>Turkey, France, Spair, Italy,</hi> or any other place where it is made. Insomuch, as with <hi>East-India</hi> Silks, we serve <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi> and some other Markets from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. This Trade pays his Majesty about 60000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Custom; aad carries out of this Kingdom yearly, about 60 or 70000 <hi>l.</hi> in Lead, Tin, Cloth, Stuffs; and other Commodities, of the Production and Manufacture of <hi>England:</hi> Which is not so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with respect to the quantity, as in this, That what we send to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> of our own Manufactures, would not be sent at all, if the English Nation were


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48676:6"/>
deprived of this Trade; because neither Dutch nor French would enure the <hi>East-Indians</hi> to our English Manufactures: Of which we have clear instance in the Dutch Trade to <hi>Japan;</hi> where they industriously avoid introducing our English Cloth. Which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being exceeding large, rich and populous, and lying in such a Northern Latitude, might vent as much of our English Manufactures, as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> if we could gain a footing into that Trade: in the endeavour whereof the Company have already lost above Fifty thousand pounds <hi>Sterling.</hi>
               </p>

Tho the Company have lost so much in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Trade with <hi>Japan,</hi> they have lately got an Entrance into the Trade of <hi>Couchin-China</hi> and <hi>China:</hi> and have, for a few years past, settled Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in three Ports thereof, <hi>viz. Tywan, Tonqueen</hi> and <hi>Amoy,</hi> to their great Charge and Expence, without reaping any Profit thereby to this time, but a certain and constant Loss, which they did and do continue notwithstanding, out of a Zeal they have to promote the Consumption of our Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, in a Climate not altogether so hot as most parts of <hi>India</hi> are. Which probably may in some time turn to the publick advantage of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when those raging and bloody Wars are ended between the Chineses and Tartars.</p>

               <head>II. <hi>That the Clamors, Aspersions, and Objections made against the present</hi> East-India <hi>Company, are sinister, selfish, or groundless.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEfore I engage into the Discourse of Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the present <hi>East-India</hi> Company, I shall not stick to declare (though it be against the Sense of most of the now Adventurers) that in my judgment I am for a New Stock, provided we can come honestly by it, that is, without Injustice to the now Adventurers (who will be found to have deserved worthily of their Countrey, when their Actions and Themselves shall come to be impartially considered) and without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the Kingdom in general. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is a Matter of great difficulty; it being in Trade, as with Trees; great care is to be taken in removing an old one, least upon the removal it die, or at least suffer a shrewd stunt. Yet if the Wisdom of our Nation in that august Assembly of Parliament, now convened, shall incline to any a teration of the present Constitution, I think this time may be as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune as any. 1st. Because our Neighbours are not now at leasure (the <hi>French</hi> being very low in <hi>India</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> not altogether so Rampant as formerly) to make their Advantage of our Unsettlement, during the Transition from one Stock to another. 2ly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Profits of the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade were never so much cried up as now they are: So that, I hope, the Subscriptions may prove the larger to the ensuing


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48676:7"/>
Stock. And yet I must desire to be excused, if I think those that complain most of the Old, will not be found the forwardest Subscribers to a New Stock. 3ly. Because when we tell Gentlemen or others, they may buy Stock, and come into the Company when they please: They presently reply, They know that, but then they must pay 280 <hi>l.</hi> for 100 <hi>l.</hi> And when we say the intrinsic Value is worth so much; which is as true as 2 and 2 makes 4, yet it is not so soon Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to their apprehensions, notwithstanding it is no hard task to make out, that the quick Stock of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish East-India</hi> Company is at this time more than the <hi>Dutch</hi> quick Stock proportionable to their respective first Subscriptions; and yet their Actions now are currant at 440 <hi>l.</hi> or 450 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> In truth, I that have reason to inspect and know as much of it as any Man, had rather buy in this Stock, now it is, at 300 <hi>l.</hi> for 100 <hi>l.</hi> then come into any New Stock at even Money. Therefore, for general sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I could wish the Experiment of a New Subscription were tried. 4ly. If a New Stock were now establish'd, to please the Generality of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I should not despair but that such New Stock would have a Parliamentary Sanction; which this only wants, to be as strong in its Foundation, as it is in all other Nations; and which being obtained, I am persuaded would in less than an Age, render his Majesty as indubitably Sovereign of the Ocean, as he is now of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Seas adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. 5ly. If an English Company were settled upon such a Foundation, there would be more Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to maintain and defend some Trades by Arms, which cannot otherwise be enjoyed or secured: Which no Company built upon an uncertain Basis, can be


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48676:8"/>
supposed to adventure the Charge or Hazard of; while they are not sure to enjoy their Acquests in case of Success.</p>
               <p>But to return to my Theme, and muster up all the Objections I can remember to have heard against the present Company.</p>
               <div n="1" type="objection">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The first that comes to my Mind, is that of some of the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants: They say, <hi>The bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of so much Silk and so cheap, is a publick Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, and destroys their Trade, which depends wholly upon the Exportation of Woollen Manufacture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the</hi> East-India <hi>Company send out little Manufacture and much Bullion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="answers">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Lanswer, First, That it's strange Doctrine to any sort of Men skill'd in the Political part of Trade, That the making of a Material cheap, that is to be Manufactured at Home, or Exported again into Foreign Countreys, should be to the publick Damage of any Countrey.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants do Ship out much Cloth, I deny not; but as true it is, that they have Shipt out more Yearly since the great encrease of the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, and since themselves have made this Complaint, than they did in former Years. So that in Fact it doth not follow that the encrease of the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, and particularly of their Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Silk, doth hinder or diminish the Exportation of Cloth to <hi>Turkey,</hi> but rather the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The question is not now, Which Company sends out most Woollen Manufactures, but which is the most profitable Trade to the Nation: Which I hope, I have proved the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade to be; especially if the before-mentioned Consideration be taken in, that what English Commodities the <hi>East-India</hi> Company ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, 


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48676:8"/>
would not be exported at all, if the <hi>English</hi> had no Trade thither: Because other Nations that Trade thither are under Joynt-Stocks, and Political Councils, and consequently would send none of our Manufactures. But as long as there is a Market for our English Cloth in <hi>Turkey,</hi> if the <hi>English</hi> did not send it thither, the <hi>Dutch</hi> would; because in <hi>Holland</hi> there is no <hi>Turkey</hi> Company; but any Man, Native or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner may send what Commodities, and when they please, for <hi>Turkey,</hi> except they be staied for Convoy by some Act of State. And where all Men have liberty to Trade at Discretion, they will naturally deal in those Commodities they can get most by, be they Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign or Domestick.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Bullion be exported, and that hinder not the exportation of our English Manufactures, as in fact doth appear: And if for every 10 <hi>s.</hi> value sent out, 30 <hi>s.</hi> be brought in Bullion at the long run, which is most evident in the course of the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade; who can doubt but the exportation of Bullion in such a Trade, is a real and great advantage to the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Besides their Cloth, the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants do send out a great deal of Bullion themselves; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Entries at the Custom-House: In which they do well for themselves and their Countrey, but not well in complaining of others at the same time, for the same thing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The truth of the Case at bottom is but this, The Importation of better and cheaper Raw Silk from <hi>India,</hi> may probably touch some <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants profit at present, though it doth benefit the Kingdom, and not hinder the exportation of Cloth. What then? Must one Trade be interrupted because it works upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? At that rate there would be nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in a Nation <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> The <hi>Italian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

may quarrel the <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do now in a plentiful Year Import from <hi>Portugal</hi> 4000 Pipes of Oyl <hi>per Annum;</hi> as formerly they did not use to import above 100 Pipes annually. The Shoemakers pull down the Coblers; those that make Red Herrings destroy those that dry Sprats, because quantities of the latter pull down the price of the former. Of the same kind was the late project of the Inn-keepers to pull down the Haokney Coaches; and so might peradventure with much more probability of truth, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Merchants pretend that our Plantation Sugars spoil their Trade, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the exportation of our Woollen Manufactures to <hi>Portugal.</hi> Of which in reality the first part only is true. Our Plantation Sugars have brought down their <hi>Lisbon</hi> Sugars from 8 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Cent.</hi> to 2 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per Cent.</hi> within my memory: and yet the exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Woollen Manufactures to <hi>Portugal,</hi> is now greater than ever it was since <hi>England</hi> was a trading Nation. Just as it is and will prove in the <hi>Turkey</hi> trade; the Similie holds, and will hold thorowout.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If those <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants think the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade so good, why do they not come into it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The door is open always to them and all the Kings Subjects, buying and selling there is daily; and some Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others of quality and place, have lately bought Stock, and the <hi>East-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have taken nothing for their Freedom. The most they can take is 5 <hi>l.</hi> But if any <hi>East-India</hi> Merchants desire to trade for <hi>Turkey,</hi> they must answer several hard questions before they can be let in. 1. How old are you? 2. Are you a Freeman of <hi>London?</hi> 3. Are you no Shopkeeper, or a Legitimate Merchant? When you have answered all these questions to their


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48676:10"/>
content, if you are above 25 years of age, there's 50 <hi>l.</hi> to pay before you can trade; which is a great deal of money to part with, before one knows whether he shall get or lose by the Bargain.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The Silks, which the Company commonly bring in, are, the main part of them Taffaties, and other plain or striped Silks and Pelongs, such as are not usually made in <hi>England,</hi> but imported from <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> where lately, when Pelongs were scarce, many were made and imitated at <hi>Harlem,</hi> and from thence imported into <hi>England.</hi> So this importation works upon our Neighbours, preserves the ballance of

our Trade; and consequently encreaseth the Capital of our Nation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And which is beyond all contradiction, as will appear by the Entries at the <hi>Custom-house,</hi> a great part of the Wrought Silks, imported by the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, are again shipt out to <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and other foreign parts; which is a great and growing advantage to the King, and Kingdom in general: to the King, because for all Foreign Goods re-exported, his Majesty hath in consequence, the half Custom paid him by strangers, without taking a penny out of his Subjects Purses: and to the Kingdom, by preserving and meliorating the ballance of our Trade, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said: Besides the gain of Freight, Portage, Wharfage, Ware-house-room; and all other petty Charges: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which may be reckoned the advantage accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the expence of such Foreigners, while they stay here, as the Companies Sales do necessarily draw over hither.</p>

When and how they began to complain. 3. Why they complain. 1. For the time when; it was in the year 1674, or 1675, as I remember: Then they had the confidence to tell the Parliament, the Company would spoil the trade of Cloth; and bring the price of Wooll to nothing. But in fact, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany hath now stood Five or six years since that time, and much augmented their trade for <hi>India,</hi> but Wooll is advanced in price above 50 <hi>per Cent:</hi> and such a trade there is and hath been for woollen Manufactures, as <hi>England</hi> never see in any former Age. 2. Who


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48676:13"/>
they were that complained; not the poor <hi>Kentish</hi> Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers, that have lost their Trade; nor the <hi>Suffolk</hi> men, that have lost their Manufacture of Blew Cloth; but the <hi>Worcestershire, Glocestershire</hi> and <hi>Somersetshire</hi> men, that do now make and vend above twenty times the quantity of Cloth, which they did before this Company was erected. 3. How they began to complain; which, as I have been informed, was thus: Their first Petition was drawn only against the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company, for making but one Cloth Shipping in a year: but entertaining a certain Council (since famous for other matters) he told them, for some reasons best known to himself, they should draw their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the <hi>East-India</hi> Company likewise; which accordingly they did: but whether they were <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>English</hi> that paid the best Fees, that I could never discover. 4. Why they complained. That I believe few of them understood: It could not be because their Trade sunk; for that was manifestly and wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increased. It could not be because the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, as a Company, sent out less Cloth than was sent for <hi>India</hi> in the open trade: for the Entries at <hi>Custom-house</hi> will evidence, that the Company, since their last Incorporation, have sent out in some one year, above ten times as much Cloth, as was ever sent out in the time of open trade. But why then did they complain? Really I cannot tell; but peradventure their Council aforesaid, or some <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants, their Customers, might inform them, that if the Trade of <hi>India</hi> were open, there would be a new world for Cloth, that would vent as much as the old World. And if they had any <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Customers, no question they would not be backward to encourage so good a work.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THe first part of this Proposition is meerly Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical; and so well known to all that look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the present Age we live in, that the proof of it will require little pains. While the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had <hi>Portugal,</hi> and with it the Trade of <hi>India,</hi> they were able to invade <hi>England</hi> with a Navy, by them called <hi>Invincible:</hi> and so it was, as to mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, if the strength of it be barely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; but their Skill was not good, nor their Ships of a Fabrick fit for our Seas: their Cause was naught, and the Providence of Almighty God blasted them. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> since the <hi>Portugals</hi> sunk in the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, have grown so potent in and by the Trade of the <hi>Indies,</hi> that they have in three great and bloody Wars, contended with us for the Dominion of the Sea; and yet secretly do not allow us the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy. Tho they are not now at leisure to try the fourth War for it, yet if through the folly or madness of a few unthinking or self-interested men, we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our selves of the Trade of the <hi>East-Indies</hi> (which God in mercy to <hi>England</hi> forbid) we should certainly save them the experiment of fighting with us the fourth time. They would carry the Dominion of the Sea clear, and hold it for ever; or until their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth should be destroyed by Land force, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Broils.</p>
               <p>If any man shall say, Why then? Are the <hi>East-India</hi> Ships of such a mighty auxiliary Force, that without their aid we cannot over-ballance the <hi>Dutch</hi> in Naval Power? I answer, Those Ships, and the Men


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48676:16"/>
in them, are of very great Force; as will hereafter appear. But he that looks no further than into the bare force of the Ships and Men now employed by the Company, doth not see the tenth part of the way into this great Business: For if we should throw off the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, the <hi>Dutch</hi> would soon treble their strength and power in <hi>India,</hi> and quickly subdue all other European Nations in that Trade; as they lately did the <hi>French,</hi> notwithstanding their great strength at Home; and have since, I hear, quarrelled the <hi>Danes.</hi> By means whereof they would become sole Masters of all those rich and necessary Commodities of the <hi>East;</hi> and make the European World pay five times more for them, than now they do; as they have already done by Cloves, Mace, Cinnamon, and Nutmegs. Which would so vastly encrease their Riches, as to render them irresistible. All Wars at Sea, and in some sense Land-Wars, since the Artillery used, is become so chargeable, being in effect but dropping of Doits; that Nation that can spend most and hold out longest, will carry the Victory at last, with indifferent Counsels. If it be said, Where shall they have Men? I answer, If they have Trade and Money enough, they cannot want Men. Seamen are Inhabitants of the Universe; and where ever they are bred, will resort to the best Pay, and most constant Employment; especially in a Countrey where they cannot be prest or compelled into any Service against their Wills.</p>
               <p>But it must be further considered, That all other Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade in <hi>Europe,</hi> doth greatly depend upon <hi>East-India</hi> Commodities; and if we lose the Importation of them into <hi>Europe,</hi> we shall soon abate in all our other Foreign Trade and Navigation: and the <hi>Dutch</hi> will more than proportionably increase theirs. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion 


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48676:16"/>
of our Decay and their Increase, in such a Case, would indeed be exactly the same; but that the excess of price which they would make the <hi>European</hi> World pay for <hi>East-India</hi> Commodities more than now they do, would cause a disproportionable and greater increase of their Riches. The augmentation whereof would further enable them to overballance us and all others, in Trade, as well as in Naval strength.</p>
               <p>If it shall be said, Admit all that is writ upon this Head to be probable, is not the Consequence <hi>(viz.</hi> the security of the Liberty, Property, and Protestant Religion of this Kingdom) far fetcht, and brought in as popular phrases, to gain and please a Party, as the Clothiers and Artificers Petition was formerly on the other side. I answer, I cannot hinder Men from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own way: but God Almighty, that knows my Heart, knows that I scorn to use any such sacred terms to or for any such sinister or selfish respect, or to please any sort of Men living. All that I have or shall write in this Treatise, is what I do really and stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, upon very long and serious Meditation, and many Years conference with almost all sorts of Men, <hi>English</hi> and Strangers: And if notwithstanding I do err in some things (as <hi>humanum est)</hi> it is for want of better understanding. But to return to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Can any man that looks abroad into the World, doubt of the truth of that Observation, <hi>viz.</hi> That Trade never thrives in any Countrey that is not <hi>Protestant;</hi> though not in all that are so; for reasons which I could offer, but that they are not necessary here. Is it not obvious to every Man's understanding, that since Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, our Customs are encreased from 14000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> to above 700000 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num?</hi> Is it not evident that the People of the <hi>United</hi>


                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48676:17"/>
                  <hi>Netherlands,</hi> since their being Protestant, are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more in Trade and Wealth in 100 Years, than the ancient and fortunate <hi>Romans</hi> did in 400 Years after the foundation of their flourishing Commonwealth? Have not the <hi>French,</hi> since they were but <hi>Partie par paile,</hi> part <hi>Protestants</hi> and part <hi>Papists,</hi> increased more in Trade and Shipping in 100 Years, then they did in 500 Years before? I once discoursed a Popish Lord, soon after his Majestie's happy Restauration, who is since dead, who told me it was never well in <hi>England,</hi> nor would be, while we kept such a stir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout promoting of Trade. I confess I liked his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the worse for that expression, but I thought the better of his Parts. A Naval Power never affrights us; Seamen never did nor ever will destroy the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their own Countrey: They naturally hate Slavery, because they see so much of the misery of it in other Countreys. All Tyrannies in the World are supported by Land-Armies: No absolute Princes have great Navies, or great Trades: very few of them, though they have large Territories, can match that little Town of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> in Shipping. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> is powerful and populous, and is arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the height of Military Vertue; by which they are become formidable to us, as well as to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Who do we fear may destroy our Liberty, Property and Religion? (which three are one in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) but the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>French;</hi> which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise are two names for one thing; and so we should have found it, if God Almighty had not disappointed them. Now under God's Providence, what can best secure us from them but our Naval Strength, and what doth especially increase and support that, but our <hi>East-India</hi> Trade: which I think I have sufficiently 


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48676:17"/>
proved to the conviction of every impartial and unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed Englishman: And if so, the Consequence in this Proposition is most natural and irrefragable.</p>
               <p>But if notwithstanding it shall be replied upon me, that in the former part of the Discourse on this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I say, That Trade thrives in Protestant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; therefore the Protestant Religion is the cause of our so great increase in Trade and Navigation, and not the Trade of the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> I answer, First, That the great increase of Trade, is not a constant and infallible consequence of the Protestant Religion; because it proves not so in all Protestant Countreys: But whatever Nation increaseth in the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, never fails proportionably to increase in other Foreign Trade and Navigation. Secondly, Admit that our Reformation to the Protestant Religion, were one principal cause at first of our advance in Trade and Navigation; yet now it is manifest, that the increase of our Trade and Navigation, is a great means, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, to secure and preserve our Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Foreign Trade produceth Riches, Riches Power, Power preserves our Trade and Religion; they mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work one upon and for the preservation of each other: As was well said by the late learned Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> though in a different Case, in his History of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, That that Kings Fortune work'd upon his Nature, and his Nature upon his Fortune.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEfore I ingage in this Argument, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to explain, What's the Constitution of a Regulated Trade, such as the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company, and other like Companies of Merchants of <hi>London</hi> are. 2ly. What a Company United in a Joynt-Stock is. To begin with the first, A Regulated Company is hard to define, and harder to resemble. Its the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of a Trade to a certain number of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, exclusive to above 99 parts of 100; with power in the major part to hinder the lesser, from shipping out any Goods, but when the greater number think fit; and to levy a Tax upon the Trade at the discretion of the greater number of Votes. In brief, it is a Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclite, unto which (out of <hi>England)</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now in the World like, in any other Kingdom or Commonwealth whatsoever, that ever I could read or hear of: All those Trades that are regulated and confined to certain Persons in <hi>England,</hi> being open and free to all People, in all other Kingdoms and States. Their Courts are perfect Democracies; where one that trades but for 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> hath as good a Vote as another that trades for 20000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> In those Courts they appoint the time of Shipping, choose their Embassador and two Consuls; settle a Tax, which they call Leviations, upon the Trade. And although I have a profound veneration for all

things then settled in Church and State, and for those wise and worthy Councellors that assisted Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> in those infant times of our Reformation and Trade; and am apt to think, when those Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made, they were useful and proper to that time: Yet I must acknowledge that in my opinion, if all those Trades that are Regulated, that is, Confined to certain Persons only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were free and open to all the King's Subjects, as they are in <hi>Holland</hi> and all other places, it would be infinitely more for the general good of the Kingdom. Neither do I see any reason why the Trades of <hi>Turkey, Hamburgh, East-land, Russia,</hi> and <hi>Greenland,</hi> which in <hi>England</hi> are Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Regulated, as they call it, should need such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, or Regulation, more in <hi>England</hi> than they do in other parts of the World; or more than other Trades to <hi>Italy, France, Spain,</hi> or any other part of the World. And if something might be alledged for a Regulation, what can be said why it is not for the publick Utility, that all the King's Subjects might Trade to any Countrey if they please; whether they be Noblemen, Gentlemen, Men of the Gown, Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, or whatever they be: the more the better for the Common Good. To enforce which, much more might be said; but that's not my Business now.</p>
               <p>A Company in Joynt-Stock are a Corporation by Charter (and if it were by Act of Parliament, it would be much better for the Kingdom in general, as hath been said) into which Stock all the King's Subjects, of what condition soever, have at the foundation of it, liberty to Adventure what sum of Money they please. The Stock and Trade is managed by a Select Council, or Committee, consisting of a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Deputy, and 24 Committees, chosen annually


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48676:19"/>
by the Generality; in which every Adventurer doth not Vote a like, but proportionably to his Stock, <hi>viz.</hi> Every 250 <hi>l.</hi> Original Stock, hath one Vote; 500 <hi>l.</hi> paid in, hath two Votes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the first Stock is settled, no Man can come in but by Purchase; which every Englishman hath an equal liberty to do; and for which he pays nothing if he be a Freeman: if unfree, never above 5 <hi>l.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> the Company hath, by reason of our late Civil Wars and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, been interrupted several times, and there have been new Subscriptions: But in <hi>Holland,</hi> since the first settlement thereof, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1602, there has been no interruption or breaking up of the Stock, or new Subscription; and such continuance is certainly best for the Publick.</p>
               <p>Having described the nature of these two sorts of Companies of Merchants, I shall now descend to the proof of the Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That a United Stock is absolutely necessary to the carrying on the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade to National Advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. My first Argument I shall draw from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Experience of all other Nations. Certainly all the World are not weak in their Intellects whatever those Gentlemen think that complain of the <hi>East-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. If any shall tell me, this Argument will not hold universally; for the <hi>Portugals</hi> have a Trade for <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and yet have no Joynt-Stock. I answer, under those Gentlemens favour, I know there is a Joynt-Stock for this Trade in <hi>Portugal;</hi> or else there could have been no Trade worth speaking of. But true it is, that Joynt-Stock in <hi>Portugal,</hi> is the King's Exchequer, who reserves Pepper, Diamonds, Silk, Callicoes, and all other considerable <hi>India</hi> Commodities to himself; and leaves only some few Toys and trivial Commodities to his


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48676:19"/>
Subjects: and yet for want of a more perfect National Constitution, we have seen how the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade in <hi>India,</hi> notwithstanding the great Roots it had drawn in a long uninterrupted course of time, dwindled to nothing, when it came to be confronted and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, by the more National and better constituted Joynt Stocks of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The French Nation peradventure, were never go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by wiser Counsels for their own good, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the present King. They were some years past, zealously set upon the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade; and I am assured, spared for neither pains nor cost, to arrive at the best method; but gave immense rewards to any that could give them any rational light or informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to lay such a foundation of Trade, as might be proper for those Eastern Countreys. See what, how, and why they did resolve at last by the printed Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French Treatise, relating to that settlement; which will save me the labour of inlarging upon this Argument.</p>
               <p>

Every English Man that trades in an open or regulated Trade, must value his own money at <hi>6 per Cent.</hi> at least (or pay so much if he takes up money) because he can gain so much by it sleeping or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Those that work, or run hazards, hope to do better. Now if the Company, with their united Stock and Counsels, and money at <hi>3 per Cent;</hi> have much a do to hold up against the subtil <hi>Dutch;</hi> what shall poor private Merchants, of divided, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and contrary interests, do with their little se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Stocks at <hi>6 per Cent. per Anuum.</hi>

on in an open or regulated way, if other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did so (which is never to be granted) yet in regard that all other European Nations, do at this time trade there in Joynt Stocks; is it not as great madness to enter raw and private Persons, against such compacted and united Constitutious of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Councellors, as to fight a disordered undisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined multitude, against a well governed Veteran Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, supported with an inexhaustible Treasure; or, as it is to imagine, as some men fondly do, that we can maintain and defend our Protestant Religion against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without a National Church in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the Company should be destroyed, and the Trade left open, the Companies Priviledges and Immunities in <hi>East-India</hi> would be lost; which have cost this Company, as well as their Predecessors, vast sums of money to maintain and retrieve, after they were almost ruined in the late three years open Trade. If I am asked what those Priviledges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities are? They are <hi>so many</hi> and <hi>so great,</hi> as is scarce credible to any not acquainted with the Trade of <hi>India.</hi> For publick satisfaction, I shall mention some few of them; all would burden me to write, as well as the Reader. We have the liberty of Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money for our selves, and all other Nations; which passeth currant in all the King of <hi>Gulconda</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. We are Custom-free in almost all places, and in some, where the <hi>Dutch</hi> and all other Nations pay a constant Custom: particularly in all places of the Bay of <hi>Bengall,</hi> and up the great River of <hi>Ganges.</hi> At Fort St. <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Bombay,</hi> we have a right, and do impose a Custom upon the Natives, and all other Nations.</p>
               <p>In the Empire of <hi>Persia</hi> we are Custom-free, and have yearly from the Emperor 1000 Tomans, which is above 3000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in lieu of the half Custom of his


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48676:20"/>
own People, and all other Nations that trade thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of right it should be the full half Customs of that Port, which is more in value; and we should have an Officer in his Custom-house to receive our half part; but we rather content our selves with the 1000 Tomans aforesaid, than fight with him again for a right, which we are uncertain how long we may enjoy, by reason of groundless Clamours against the Company at home.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bantam</hi> we are at the set rate of 4000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars <hi>per Annum,</hi> for all our Customs, tho we increase our Trade never so much. In most places in <hi>India,</hi> we are in effect our own Law-makers, and can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and imprison any Natives that deal with us, or owe us money; and can inflict corporal punishments upon them (without controul of any of the Native or Moor Governours) till they pay or do us right, if our People there see cause for it.</p>
               <p>All our Black Servants there, which are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and all others imployed by us, or trading with us, are free and exempted from the jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Native and other Governours.</p>
               <p>We are in all places free in our Persons and Goods, and all imployed or priviledged by us, from all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Customs and Duties, in the Towns and Provinces we pass or bring our Goods thorow: which are very great in those Countreys, and paid by the Natives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. My fifth Argument is drawn from the great Losses, Damages, and Depredations, that this Nation sustained in that short time of three years open Trade, which are sufficiently known, besides the loss of Priviledges, increase of Presents to Governours, lowering our English Commodities, and advancing the <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities to such an odious excess, that


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48676:21"/>
at length the very private Traders themselves, were the forwardest Petitioners for a return to a Joynt Stock; of the truth of which, there be many yet alive that can attest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. This I draw from the nature of the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Governments. There are above 100 Kings and Raja's, which are Gentu Princes, but governing with absolute Power in their own Dominions; and as many Ports and Places of Trade: whereas in <hi>Turkey</hi> there are but <hi>two or three principal places of Trade and one Prince;</hi> with whom his Majesty by his Ambassador may conveniently have his Subjects there vindicated and righted, if there were no Company; as the <hi>French</hi> King, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> do. Whereas in <hi>India</hi> there would be need of Forty Embassadors; and all must have Instructions, and carry large Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents. The Companies Agents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> do many times find cause to send Embassies, Instructions, and splendid trains of Attendance and Presents, before the Committee in <hi>England</hi> know of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. This is drawn from the distance of the places. Letters do pass freely to and from <hi>Turkey</hi> in a short time: and in case of injuries done the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> his Majesties Men of War may soon go down from <hi>Tangier</hi> to revenge them. But <hi>India</hi> is at a far greater distance: no certain return of a Letter to be had once in Twelve moneths: and the Princes and Ports there, are at a wider distance one from another, than it is from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Turkey;</hi> and much more difficult to maintain a Correspondence by Letters in <hi>India</hi> from Port to Port; by reason of the set Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or Trade-winds, that blow six moneths together one way.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. Where-ever the English or any Europeans settle a Factory in <hi>India,</hi> they must presently build them large Houses, Ware-houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and maintain the appearance and splendour of a petty Court: and in many places where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany have not fixt Garrisons, they are forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their Houses, or else they will be despised and trampled upon by the Natives. If it be said, this may be done by a regulated Company. I answer, First, How shall they raise a Stock to buy those the Company have already; with their Lands, Islands, Towns, Garrisons, Guns and Ammunition: which I am sure (their Priviledges being put in likewise) have cost the Company above 300000 <hi>l?</hi> Next, How shall they maintain and defend them? By Leviations upon Goods. What? before there are any Goods to taxe. No, they shall raise a Joynt Stock, to make the first Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase; and after, take only a Taxe upon Goods to maintain them. These are absurd, incongruous, and impracticable Notions; for in a time of War and Danger, Men will forbear trading; as hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously observed by the Author of the printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So that there will be no Goods to taxe, when there is most need of Money. Whereas the Governours or Committees, have always in their hands a real Fond of above a Million of Money; and can borrow so much more in <hi>India</hi> in a few days, if they want it, their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit there, being as currant as ready Gold: having never been so much as stained. I shall say no more upon this Argument, in regard the printed Letter, afore-said, hath so copiously and convincingly cleared this point, beyond all contradiction, that I have no room left me to enlarge; but have reason to beg the Authors pardon, for what, in this, I have borrowed of him.</p>

The <hi>East-India</hi> Company of <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and all European Nations that trade to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> have power, by their Charters, to make War upon any Nation in <hi>India,</hi> at their Discretion; but not upon any European Nation, without his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties consent. This power they must and ought to have for the well carrying on of their Trades. This power the English Company have sometimes, but not often exercised: but if it were not known in <hi>India,</hi> that they have such a power, they should be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually affronted and abused by the Natives. Now who shall this Power be delegated unto, in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Company? To all English Men, or to a single Embassador, or to many Embassadors and Consuls?</p>

               <head>V. <hi>That the</hi> East-India <hi>Trade is more profitable and necessary to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> England, <hi>than to any other Kingdom or Nation in</hi> Europe.</head>
               <p>FIrst, This is so as we are an Island, and have our principal Security, as well as the increase of our Riches from our Trade and Strength at Sea.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And which I take to be a main considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, The Trade of <hi>India</hi> is to <hi>England</hi> not only a great, but an unmixt Advantage: Whereas to all our Neighbours, though the Trade of the <hi>East-Indies</hi> be a great Advantage, and accordingly courted and coveted


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48676:22"/>
by them; yet they cannot have it without some mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Loss in other respects; because some of them have the growth and production of Silk among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> They have likewise the sole Manufacture of plain Silks, such as Taffateis, Sarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are brought from <hi>India</hi> cheaper than they can make them at Home. Whereas in <hi>England,</hi> our Silk Manufacture consists not in those plain Silks, but in Flowred Silks and Fancies, changed still as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the Fashion alters. <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi> (and <hi>France,</hi> in some measure) have their principal Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in fine Linnens, Cambricks, Lawns and Hollands; which only Callicoe works upon, to the putting them very much out of request, in their own Countreys and and all other parts of Christendom. Whereas the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen we make in <hi>England</hi> is of the strong course sorts, generally used by the meaner People; which Callicoe doth not prejudice to any sensible degree. Neither is the Linnen Manufacture in <hi>England</hi> a matter worth taking notice of (whatever a few Gentlemens opinion is) But in <hi>Holland, Flanders, France,</hi> and some parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> it is their main Concern; being the subsistence of the Majority of their People, as the Woollen Manufacture is in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Dutch have a standing Contract with the King of <hi>Persia</hi> for all his Silk; which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 600 Bales yearly. Now in regard <hi>Bengall</hi> Silk in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> can be brought to <hi>Europe</hi> cheaper than <hi>Persia</hi> Silk: the <hi>Dutch</hi> by bringing Silk from <hi>Bengall,</hi> must of necessity in some kind preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice that Contract in the price of Silk; though it be the <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies own Contract, as well as the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants. Whereas we having no such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in <hi>Persia,</hi> do not work upon our selves, as they


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48676:23"/>
must of necessity: And yet they are wiser than to slight the Trade of <hi>Bengall</hi> for that cause. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument concerning the <hi>Dutch</hi> Contract in <hi>Persia,</hi> is so fully confirmed by the Companies Advices lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Persia,</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi> there did lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be excused from receiving their <hi>Quota</hi> of Silk, which is 600 Bales yearly, upon pretence of their want of Money to pay for it; which notwithstanding was forced on them by <hi>Sheeke Ally Cawne,</hi> the Emperor's Governor there. If it be here askt me, Why the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish East-India</hi> Company, seeing <hi>Persia</hi> is within their Charter, are not as wise as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to make a Contract likewise with the King of <hi>Persia?</hi> I answer, The <hi>Dutch</hi> got the start of us in that long before this Company was constituted; and we cannot possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve it yet: The <hi>Persians</hi> being a People most difficult to remove from any thing they have once determined. If it be here further retorted upon me, That by my own confession, the Importation of Silk from <hi>India,</hi> doth prejudice the <hi>English Turkey</hi> Merchants in the price of their Silk here. I grant it: But what is that to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in general? It's the interest of <hi>England</hi> that we should have Silk here (being a material to be Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured) cheaper than in any other part of <hi>Europe,</hi> where it grows: and so we shall infallibly, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany stand. But at the same time, I do expresly deny that the making of Silk cheap in <hi>England,</hi> doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Exportation of our Woollen Manufacture to <hi>Turkey:</hi> The contrary being as evident as the Sun at Noon-day, to any Man that has not the mist of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain or Loss hanging before his Eyes; as before is demonstrated in those two pregnant, experienced, unanswerable Instances, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the price of Portugal Sugars hath abated (in which formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48676:23"/>
all our returns from that Countrey were made) we have increased exceedingly in the Exportation of Woollen Manufactures to that Countrey; and even in the Trade of <hi>Turkey</hi> it self for many years: And to this very time, as the price of <hi>Turkey</hi> Silk hath abated, the Exportation of our Woollen Manufacture hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased: and so it will still, though Silk should come to half the price it bears now in <hi>England.</hi> Upon the proof whereof, by time, I dare hazard all that little I have in the World. Besides, when all is done, and if the <hi>Turkey</hi> Merchants might have their Will, to the irrepairable damage of their Common Countrey; what would they be the better? Except by an Act of Parliament we could as well hinder the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and other Neighbours from trading in <hi>East-India</hi> Silk, as we can the <hi>English East-India</hi> Company. Is not this dealing our Childrens Bread to Strangers? Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Selves, and strengthening our Enemies, whilst they laugh and stand amazed at our Indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>For a Conclusion, That the present and future Ages may know in what Condition the English <hi>East-India</hi> Trade stood, when the Company was assaulted by the private designs of parcicular Men; I shall add an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the present posture of their Affairs, <hi>viz.</hi> Last year the Company sent out (which are not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned) for the Coast of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> and the Bay of <hi>Bengall,</hi> Four three Deck-Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Eagle,</hi> burden 590 Tuns, and 118 Seamen, besides Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

               </p>
               <p>Note that the Ships are generally bigger than they are let for, and the Company employ none but Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-built Ships; and that besides what they sent out last Year, and are sending this, they have always a considerable Stock left in the Countrey, to make and provide Goods before-hand.
