            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ngenuous honorable Lord, I know not what blinde custome methodicall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity hath thrust vpon vs, to dedicate such books as we publish, to one great man or other; In which respect, least anie man should challenge these my papers as goods vncustomd, and so extend vppon them as forfeite to contempt, to the seale of your excellent censure loe here I present them to bee seene and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Prize them as high or as low as you list: if you set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie price on them, I hold my labor well satisfide. Long haue I desired to approoue my wit vnto you. My reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent duetifull thoughts (euen from their infancie) haue been retayners to your glorie. Now at last I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forst an opportunitie to plead my deuoted minde. All that in this phantasticall Treatise I can promise, is some reasonable conueyance of historie, &amp; varietie of mirth. By diuers of my good frends haue I been dealt with to employ my dulpen in this kinde, it being a cleane diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vaine from other my former courses of writing. How wel or ill I haue done in it, I am ignorant: (the eye that sees round about it selfe, sees not into it selfe): only your Honours applauding encouragement hath power to make mee arrogant. Incomprehensible is the heigth
<pb facs="tcp:10658:3"/>
of your spirit both in heroical resolution and matters of conceit. Vnrepriueably perisheth that booke whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to wast paper, which on the diamond rocke of your iudgement disasterly chanceth to be shipwrackt. A dere louer and cherisher you are, as well of the louers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, as of Poets themselues. Amongst their sacred num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I dare not ascribe my selfe, though now and then I speak English: that smal braine I haue, to no further vse I conuert, saue to be kinde to my frends, and fatall to my enemies. A new brain, a new wit, a new stile, a new soule will I get mee, to canonize your name to posteritie, if in this my first attempt I be not taxed of presumption. Of your gracious fauor I despaire not, for I am not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fames out-cast. This handfull of leaues I offer to your view, to the leaues on trees I compare, which as they cannot grow of themselues except they haue some branches or boughes to cleaue too, &amp; with whose iuice and sap they be euermore recreated &amp; nourisht: so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept these vnpolisht leaues of mine haue some braunch of Nobilitie whereon to depend and cleaue, and with the vigorous nutriment of whose authorized commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation they may be contiually fosterd and refresht, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wil they grow to the worlds good liking, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fade and die on the first houre of their birth. Your Lordship is the large spreading branch of renown, from whence these my idle leaues seeke to deriue their whole nourishing: it resteth you either scornfully shake them off, as worm-eaten &amp; worthles, or in pity preserue them and cherish them, for some litle summer frute you hope to finde amongst them.</p>

and monuments do you thinke an ingenious infant of my age might enact? you will saie, it were sufficient if he slurre a die, pawne his master to the vtmost pennie, &amp; minister the oath on the pantoffle arteficially. These are signes of good education, I must confesse, and arguments of In grace and veriue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed. Oh but <hi>Aliquid later quod non patet,</hi> theres a farther path I must trace: examples confirme, list Lordings to my procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges. Whosoeuer is acquainted with the state of a campe, vnderstands that in it be many quarters, &amp; yet not so many as on London bridge. In those quarters are many companies: Much companie, much knauerie, as true as that olde adage, Much curtesie, much subtiltie. Those companies, like a great deale of corne, doe yéeld some chaffe, the corne, are cormorants, the chaffe are good fellowes, which are quickly blowen to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with bearing a light hart in a light purse. Amongst this chaffe was I winnowing my wits to liue merily, and by my troth so I did: the prince could but command men spend theyr bloud in his seruice, I coulde make them spend all the monie they had for my pleasure. But pouerty in the end parts frends, though I was prince of their purses, and exacted of my vnthrift subiects, as much liquid allegeance as anie keisar in the world could do, yet where it is not to be had the king must loose his right, want cannot be withstood, men can doe no more than they can doe, what remained then, but the foxes case must help, when the lions skin is out at the elbowes.</p>
            <p>There was a Lord in the campe, let him be a Lord of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, if you wil, for he kept a plaine alehouse without welt or gard of anie Iuibush, and solde syder and chéese by pint and by pound to all that came, (at that verie name of syder, I can but sigh, there is so much of it in renish wine now a dayes.) Wel, <hi>Tendit ad sydera virtus,</hi> thers great vertue belongs (I can tell you) to a cup of syder, and verie good men haue solde it, and at sea, it is <hi>Aqua coelestis,</hi> but thats neither heere nor there, if it had no other patrons but this péere of quart pots to authorize it, it were sufficient. This great Lorde, this worthie Lord, this noble Lord, thought no scorne (Lord haue mercy vpon vs) to haue his great veluet bréeches larded with the droppings of this daintie liquor, &amp; yet he was an olde seruitor, a cauelier of
<pb facs="tcp:10658:6"/>
an ancient house, as it might appeare by the armes of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestrie, drawen very amiably in chalke, on the in side of his tent doore.</p>
            <p>He and no other was the man, I chose out to damne with a lewd monylesse deuice: for comming to him on a daie, as he was counting his barrels, &amp; setting the price in chalke on the head of euerie one of them, I did my dutie verie deuoutly, and tolde his <hi>alie</hi> honor, I had matters of some secrecie to impart vnto him, if it pleased him to grant me priuate audience. With me young <hi>Wilton,</hi> quoth he, marie and shalt: bring vs a pint of syder of a fresh tap into the thrée cups here, wash the pot, so into a backe roome he lead mee, where after hee had spit on his finger, and pickt off two or thrée moats of his olde moth eaten veluet cap, and spunged and wrong all the rumatike driuell from his ill fauoured Goates beard, he badde me declare my minde, and there vpon he dranke to me on the same. I vp with a long circumstance, alias, a cunning shift of the seuentéenes, &amp; discourt vnto him what entire affection I had borne him time out of mind, partly for the high discent and linage from whence he sprung, &amp; partly for the tender care and prouident respect he had of poore soldiers, that whereas the vastitie of that place (which afforded them no indifferent supplie of drinke or of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals) might humble them to some extremity, and so weaken their hands, he vouchsafed in his own person to be a victualer to the campe (a rare example of magnificence &amp; honorable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie) and diligently prouided, that without farre trauel, euery man might for his money haue syde: and chéese his bellyfull, nor did he sell his chéese by the way onely, or his syder by the great, but abast himselfe with his owne hands, to take a shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers knife, (a homely instrument for such a high personage to touch) and cut it out equally like a true iusticiarie, in little penny worthes, that it woulde doo a man good for to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So likewise of his syder, the pore man might haue his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate draught of it (as there is a moderation in all things) as well for his doit or his dandiprat, as the rich man for his halfe soule or his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why you are euerie childs felow, any man that comes vnder the name of a souldier and a good fellowe, you will sitte and beare companie to the last pot, yea, and you take in as good part the homely phrase of mine host heeres to you, as if one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted you by all the titles of your baronie. These considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I saie, which the world suffers to slippe by in the channell of carelesnes, haue moued me in ardent zeale of your welfare, to forewarne you of some dangers that haue beset you &amp; your barrels. At the name of dangers hee start vp, and bounst with his fist on the boord so hard, that his Tapster ouerhearing him, cried, anone anone sir, by and by, and came and made a low leg and askt him what he lackt. Hée was readie to haue striken his Tapster, for interrupting him in attention of this his so much desired relation, but for seare of displeasing me he mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his furie, and onely sending him for the other fresh pint, wild him looke to the barre, and come when hée is cald with a deuilles name. Well, at his earnest importunitie, after I had moistned my lips, to make my lie runne glib to his iourneies end, forward I went as followeth. It chaunced me the other night, amongst other pages, to attend where the king with his Lords, and many chiefe leaders sate in counsel, there amongst sundrie serious matters that were debated, and intelligences from the euery giuen vp, it was priuily informed (no villains to these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

if I would expire the miserie of his vnspeakable tormenting vncertaintie. I being by nature inclined to <hi>Mercie</hi> (for in deed I knew two or three good wenches of that name) bad him har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his eares, &amp; not make his eyes abortiue before their time, and he should haue the inside of my brest turnd outward, heare such a tale as would tempt the vtmost strength of life to attend it, and not die in the middest of it.

            <p>I might well haue left here, for by this time his white liuer had mixe it selfe with the white of his eie, &amp; both were turned vpwardes, as if they had offered themselues a fayre white for death to shoote at. The troth was, I was verie loth mine hoste and I should parte to heauen with dry lips, wherefore the best meanes that I could imagine to wake him out of his traunce, was to crie loude in his eare, hough host, whats to pay, will no man looke to the reckning heere, and in plaine veritie, it tooke expected effect, for with the noise hee started and bustled, like a man that had beene scard with fyre out of his sléepe, and ranne hastily to his Tapster, and all so belaboured him about the eares, for letting Gentlemen call so long and not looke in to

them. Presently be remembred himselfe, and had like to haue fallen into his memento againe, but that I met him halfe waies, and askt his Lordship what he meant to slip his necke out of the coller so sodainly, and being reuiued, strike his tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster so rashly.</p>
            <p>Oh, quoth he, I am bought &amp; solde for doing my Country such good seruice as I haue done. They are afraid of mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my good déedes haue brought me into such estimation with the communalty, I sée, I sée it is not for the lambe to liue with the wolfe.</p>
            <p>The world is well amended, thought I, with your Sider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, such another fortie yéeres nappe together as <hi>Epemenides</hi> had, would make you a perfect wise man. Answere me, quoth he, my wise young <hi>Wilton,</hi> is it true that I am thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dead and buried by these bad tongues?</p>
            <p>Nay, quoth I, you shall pardon me, for I haue spoken too much alreadie, no definitiue sentence of death shall march out of my wel meaning lips, they haue but lately suckt milke, and shall they so sodainly change theyr food and seeke after bloud?</p>
            <p>Oh but, quoth he, a mans friend is his friend, fill the other pint Tapster, what sayd the king, did hee beléeue it when hee heard it, I pray thée say, I sweare to thée by my nobility, none in the worlde shall euer be made priuie, that I receiued anie light of this matter from thée.</p>
            <p>That firme affiance, quoth I, had I in you before, or else I would neuer haue gone so farre ouer the shooes, to plucke you out of the mire. Not to make many wordes (since you will néeds know) the kings laies flatly, you are a miser &amp; a snudge, and he neuer hopt better of you. Nay then (quoth he) question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse some planet that loues not syder hath conspired against me. Moreouer, which is worse, the king hath vowed to giue <hi>Turwin</hi> one hot breakfast, onely with the bungs that hee will plucke out of your barrells. I cannot staie at this time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte each circumstance that passed, but the only counsell that my long cherished kinde inclination can possibly contriue, is now in your olde daies to be liberall, such victuals or prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as you haue, presently distribute it frankly amongst poore souldiers, I would let them burst their bellies with syder, and
<pb facs="tcp:10658:8"/>
bathe in it, before I would runne into my Princes ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a whole sea of it. The hunter pursuing the beauer for his stones, hee bites them off, and leaues them behinde for him to gather vp, whereby hee liues quiet. If gréedie hunters and hungry tel-tales pursue you, it is for a little pelfe which you haue, cast it behind you, neglect it, let them haue it, lest it bréed a further inconuenience. Credit my aduice, you shall finde it propheticall, and thus I haue discharged the parte of a poore friend. With some few like phrases of ceremonie, your honors suppliant, &amp; so forth, and farewel my good youth, I thanke thée and will remember thée, we parted.</p>
            <p>But the next daie I thinke we had a dole of syder, syder in houles, in scuppets, in helmets, &amp; to conclude, if a man would haue fild his bootes full, there hee might haue had it, prouant thrust it selfe into poore souldiers pockets whether they would or no. We made fiue peals of shot into the towne together, of nothing but spiggots and faussets of discarded emptie barrels: euerie vnderfoote souldiour had a distenanted tunne, as <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> had his tub to sléepe in. I my selfe got as many confiscated Tapsters aprons, as made me a Tent, as bigge as any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie commanders in the field. But in conclusion, my welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Baron of double béere got him humbly on his mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones to the king, and complained hee was olde and striken in yeres, and had nere an heire to cast at a dogge, wherefore if it might please his maiesty to take his lands into his hands, and allowe him some reasonable pension to liue on, hee shoulde bee meruailous wel pleased: as for the warres, he was wearie of them, and yet as long as highnes shoulde venture his owne person, hée would not flinch a foot, but make his withered bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a buckler, to beare off anie blow that should be aduanced agaynst him.</p>
            <p>The king meruailing at this strange alteration of his great marchant of syder, (for so hee woulde often pleasantly tearme him,) with a little further talke bolted out the whole complotment. Then was I pittifully whipt for my holy day lie, although they made themselues merrie with it many a faire winters euening after.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding his good asse-headed honor mine

            <p>This was one of my famous atchieuements, insomuch as I neuer light vpon the like famous foole, but I haue done a thousand better ieasts if they had bin bookt in order as they were begotten. It is pittie posteritie shoulde bee depriued of such precious recordes, and yet there is no remedie, and yet there is to, for when all fayles, welfare a good memorie.

            <p>Euen in this expedition of Turwin (for the king stoode not long thrumming of buttons there) it happened me fall out (I would it had fallen out otherwise for his sake) with an vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mechanical Captaine. You must thinke in an armie, where tronchio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are in their state house, it is a flat stab once to name a Captaine without cappe in hand. Well, suppose hee was a Captaine, &amp; had nere a good cap of his owne, but I was faine to lend him one of my Lords cast veluet caps, and a weather-beaten feather, wherewith he threatned his souldiers a farre off, as <hi>Iupiter</hi> is sayde, with the shaking of his haire to make heauen and earth to quake: suppose out of the paringes of a paire of false dice, I apparelled both him and my selfe many a time and oft: and surely not to slander the deuill, if anie man euer deserued the golden dice, the king of the Parthians sent to <hi>Demetrius</hi> it was I, I had the right vaine of sucking vp a die twixt the dintes of my fingers, not a creuise in my hande but coulde swallowe a quater trey for a néede: in the line of life many a dead lifte dyd there lurke, but it was nothing towards the maintenance of a family.

brother, I coulde haue done no more for him than I did, for straight after his backe was turnd, I went in all loue &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the Marshall generall of the field, &amp; certefide him that such a man was lately fled to the enemie, and gotte his place bedgd for another immediatly. What because of him after you shall heare. To the enemie he went and offered his seruice, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling egregiously on the king of England, he swore, as he was a Gentleman and a souldier, hee would bee reuenged on him, and let but the king of France follow his counsell, hee woulde driue him from <hi>Turwin</hi> wals yet ere ten dayes to an end. All these were good humours, but the eragedie followeth. The French king hearing of such a prating fellow that was come, was desirous to sée him, but yet he feared treason, wherfore he wild one of his minions to take vpon his person, and he would stand by as a priuate man whilest hee was txamined. Why should I vse anie idle delayes? In was Captaine Gogges wounds brought, after he was throughly searched, not a louse in his doublet was let passe, but was askt <hi>Queuela,</hi> and chargd to stand in the kings name, the mouldes of his buttons they turnd out, to sée if they were not bullettes couered ouer with thread, the codpéece in his deuills bréeches (for they were then in fashion) they sayd playnly was a case for a pistoll, if hée had had euer a hovnaile in his shooes it had hangde him, &amp; he shuld neuer haue knowen who had harmd him, but as lucke was, he had not a mite of anie mettal about him, be tooke part with none of the foure ages, neither the golden age, the siluer age, the brasen nor the yron age, onely his purse was aged in emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse, and I thinke verily a puritane, for it kept it selfe from anie pollution of crosses. Standing before the supposed king, he was askt what he was, and wherefore became. To the which in a glorious bragging humour be aunswered, that hée was a gentleman, a captaine commander, a chiefe leader, that came a way from the king of England vppon discontentment. Questiond particular of the cause of his discontentment, hee had not a word to blesse himself with, yet faine he would haue, patcht out a polt-foote tale, but (God he knowes) it had not one true legge to stand on. Then began he to smell on the villaine so rammishly, that none there but was readie to rent him in
<pb facs="tcp:10658:12"/>
péeces, yet the minion king kept in his cholar, and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him farther, what of the king of Englands secrets (so aduantageable) he was priuie to, as might remoue him from the flage of Turwin in thrée daies. Hee sayde diuerse, diuerse matters, which askt longer conference, but in good honestie they were lies, which he had not yet stampt. Héereat the true king stept forth, and commanded to lay handes on the lozell, and that he should be tortured to confesse the truth, for he was aspie and nothing else.</p>
            <p>He no sooner sawe the whéele and the torments set before him, but he cride out like a rascall, and sayde hee was a poore Captaine in the English camp, suborned by one <hi>Iacke Wilton</hi> (a noble mans page) and no other, to come and kill the French king in a brauery and returne, and that he had no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world.</p>
            <p>This confession could not choose but moue them all to laughter, in that he made it as light a matter to kill their king and come backe, as to goe to Islington and eate a messe of creame, and come home againe, nay, and besides hee protested that he had no other intention, as if that were not inough to hang him.</p>

               <hi>Adam</hi> neuer fell till God made fooles, all this coulde not kéepe his ioyntes from ransacking on the whéele, for they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed either to make him a confessor or a martir in a trice, when still he sung all one song, they tolde the king he was a foole, and some shrewd head had knauishly wrought on him, wherefore it should stand with his honour to whip him out of the campe and send him home. That perswasion tooke place, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was he lasht out of theyr liberties, and sent home by a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralde with this message, that so the king his master hoped to whip home all the English fooles verie shortly: answere was returned, that that shortlie, was a long lie, and they were shrewde fooles that shoulde driue the French man out of his kingdome, and make him glad with Corinthian <hi>Dionisius</hi> to play the schoole-master.</p>

            <p>Another Swizer Captaine that was farre gone for want of the wench, I lead astraie most notoriously, for he béeing a monstrous vnthrift of battle axes (as one that cared not in his anger to bid flie out scuttels to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie of the circumstance is, that after he had courted me and all, and giuen me the earnest pennie of impietie, some sixe crownes at the least for an antipast to iniquitie, I fained an impregnable excuse to be gone, and neuer came at him after.</p>
            <p>Yet left I not here, but committed a little more scutcherie. A companie of coystrell clarkes (who were in hand with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and not of anie souldiers colour) pincht a number of good mindes to Godward of theyr pronant.

halfe as they. My masters you may conceiue of me what you list, but I thinke confidently I was ordayned Gods scourge from aboue for theyr daintie finicalitie. The houre of theyr punishment could no longer be proroged, but vengeance must haue at them at al a ventures. So it was, that the most of these aboue named goosequil braccahadocheos were méere cowards and crauens, and durst not so much as throw a pen-full of inke into the enimies face, if proofe were made, wherefore on the experience of their pusellanimitie I thought to raise the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my roguerie. What did I now but one daie made a false alarum in the quarter where they laie, to trie how they would stand to theyr tackling, and with a pittifull out-crie warned them to flie, for there was treason a foot, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed and beset. Upon the first watch worde of treason that was giuen, I thinke they betooke them to theyr héeles verie stoutly, left theyr penne and inke-hornes and papers behinde them for spoile, resigned their deskes, with the mony that was in them to the mercie of the vanquisher, and in fine, left mée &amp; my fellowes (their foole-catchers) Lords of the field: how wée dealt with them, their disburdened deskes canne best tell, but this I am assured, we fared the better for it a fortnight of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayes after. I must not place a volume in the precincts of a pamphlet, sléepe an houre or two, and dreame that Turney and Turwin is wonne, that the king is shipt againe into England, and that I am close at harde meate at Windsore or at Hampton court. What will you in your indifferent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allow me for my trauell, no more seigniorie ouer the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than I had before? yes, whether you will parte with so much probable friendly suppose or no, Ile haue it in spite of your heartes. For your instruction and godly consolation, bée informed, that at that time I was no common squire, no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertroden torch-bearer, I had my feather in my cap as big as a flag in the fore-top, my French doublet gelte in the belly as though (lyke a pig readie to be spitted) all my guts had beene pluckt out, a paire of side paned hose that hung down like two scales filled with Holland chéeses, my long stock that sate close to my docke, and smoothered not a scab or a leacherous hairie sinew on the calfe of my legge, my rapier pendant like a round

sticke fastned in the tacklings for skippers the better to climbe by, my blacke cloake of blacke cloth, ouer-spreading my backe lyke a thorubacke, or an Elephantes eare, that hanges on his shoulders lyke a countrie huswiues banskin, which shee fastens her spindle on, and in consummation of my curiositie, my handes without gloues, all a more French, and a blacke badge edging of a beard on the vpper lip, &amp; the like sable auglet of excrements in the first rising of the anckle of my shinne. I was the first that brought in the order of passing into the court which I deriued from the common word <hi>Qui passa,</hi> and the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds phrase of armes <hi>Passant,</hi> in this begun sincerity, hée was not a Gentleman, nor his armes currant, who was not first past by the pages. If anie prentise or other came into the court that was not a Gentleman, I thought it was an indignitie to the preheminence of the court to include such a one, and could not be salud except we gaue him armes Passant, to make him a Gentleman. Besides, in Spaine, none compasse anie farre waie but he must be examined what he is, &amp; giue thrée pence for his passe. In which regard it was considered of by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon table of the cupbearers, what a perilsome thing it was to let anie stranger or out-dweller approch so néere the precincts of the Prince, as the great chamber, without examining what he was, and giuing him his passe, wherevppon we established the lyke order, but tooke no monie of them as they did, onelie for a signe that he had not past our hands vnexamined, wee set a red marke on either of his eares, and so let him valke as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall. I must not discouer what vngodly dealing we had with the blacke iackes, or how oft I was crowned king of the dronkards with a court cuppe, let mee quietly descend to the waining of my youthfull dayes, and tell a little of the sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sicknesse, that made me in a cold sweate take my héeles and runne out of England.</p>
            <p>This sweating sicknesse, was a disease that a man then might catch and neuer goe to a hot-house. Many masters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to haue such seruants as would worke till they sweate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but in those dayes he that sweat neuer wrought againe. That Scripture then was not thought so necessarie, which sayes, Earne thy liuing with the sweat of thy browes, for then

It was inough if a fat man did but trusse his points, to turne him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the pearch: mother <hi>Cornelius</hi> tub why it was lyke hell, he that came into it, neuer came out of it. Cookes that stande continually basting their faces before the fire, were nowe all cashierd with this sweat into kitchin-stuffe: theyr hall fell in to the kings handes for want of one of the trade to vpholde it.

Looke how in May or the heat of Summer we lay butter in water for feare it shuld melte awaie, so then were men faine to wet their clothes in water as Diers doo, and hide themselues in welles from the heate of the Sunne.</p>
            <p>Then happie was he that was an asse, for nothing wyll kill an asse but colde, and none dide but with extreame heate, The fishes called Sea-starres, that burne one another by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue heate, were not so contagious as one man that had the sweate was to another. Masons paid nothing for haire to mix their lime, nor glouers to stuffe their balls with, for then they had it for nothing, it dropt off mens heads and beardes faster than anie Barber could shaue it. O if haire bréeches had then béene in fashion, what a fine world had it béene for Taylers, and so it was a fine world for Tailers neuerthelesse, for hee that could make a garment sleightest and thinnest, carried it awaie, Cutters I can tell you, then stood vpon it, to haue their trade one of the twelue Companies, for who was it then that would not haue his doublet cut to the skin, and his shirt cut into it to, to make it more colde, It was as much as a mans life was worth, once to name a fréeze ierken, it was treason for a fat grosse man to come within fiue miles of the court, I heard where they dide vp all in one family, and not a mothers childe escapt, insomuch as they had but an Irish rug lockt vp in a presse, and not laide vpon anie bedde neither, if those that

iest, so now I became a martiallist in earnest. Ouer sea with my implements I got me, where hearing the king of France and the Swizers were together by the ears, I made towards them as fast as I could, thinking to thrust my selfe into that faction that was strongest. It was my good lucke or my ill, I know not which, to come iust to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fighting of the battel, where I sawe a wonderfull spectacle of bloud shed on both sides, here the vnwildie swizers wallowing in their gore, like an oxe in his doung, there the sprightly French sprawling and turning on the stayned grasse, like a roach newe taken out of the streame, all the ground was strewed as thicke with battle axes, as the carpenters yard with chips. The plaine appeared like a quagmire, ouerspread as it was with trampled dead bodies. In one place might you beholde a heape of dead mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered men ouerwhelmed with a falling stéed, in stead of a tombe stone, in another place a bundle of bodies fettered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in theyr owne bowels, and as the tyrant Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours vsed to tie condemned liuing caitifes face to face to dead corses, so were the halfe liuing here mixt with squeazed carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses long putrifide. Anie man might giue armes that was an actor in that battell, for there were more armes and legs scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the field that daie, than will be gathered vp till dooms daie, the French king himselfe in this conflict was much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, the braines of his owne men sprinkled in his face, thrice was his courser slaine vnder him, and thrice was hée strucke on the breast with a speare, but in the end, by the helpe of the Uenetians, the Heluesians or Swizers were subdude, and he crowned victor, a peace concluded, and the cittie of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain surrendered vnto him, as a pledge of reconciliation. That warre thus blowen ouer, and the seueral bands dissolued, like a ccow that still followes aloofe where there is carrion, I flew me ouer to Munster in Germanie, which an Anabaptisticall brother named <hi>Iohn Leiden</hi> kepte at that instant against the Emperor and the Duke of Saxonie. Here I was in good hope to set vp my staffe for some reasonable time, déeming that no Citie would driue it to a slege except they were able to holde out, and pretily well had these Munsterians held out, for they kept the Emperour and the Duke of Saxonie sound plaie for

There was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortment from it, but néedes thother I woulde, wherefore comming to my mistres as she was then walking with other Ladyes of estate in paradice at Hampton court, I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie besought her of fauour, that shee would giue me so much gracious leaue to absent my selfe from her seruice, as to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell a yeare or two into Italy. She verie discreetly aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mée, that if my loue were so hot as I had often auouched, I dyd verie well to applie the plaister of absence vnto it, for absence, as they saie, causeth forgetfulnesse, yet neuerthelesse since it is Italy my natiue Countrie you are so desirous to sée, I am the more willing to make my will yours. <hi>I pete Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> go and séeke Italie with <hi>Aenaeas,</hi> but hée more true than <hi>Aenaeas,</hi> I hope that kinde wit-cherishing climate will worke no change in so wittie a breast.

The chiefe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their entertainment were these: first, the heads of their vniuersitie, (they were great heads of certaintie) met him in their hooded hypocrisie and doctorly accoustrements, <hi>secundum formam statuti,</hi> where by the Orator of the vniuersitie, whose pickerdeuant was very plentifully be sprinkled with rose wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a verie learned or rather ruthfull Oration was deliuered (for it raind all the while) signifieng thus much, that it was al by patch and by péece meale stolne out of <hi>Tully,</hi> &amp; he must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, though in emptying their phrase bookes, the ayre emptied his intrailes, for they did it not in anie ostentation of wit (which they had not) but to shewe the extraordinarie good will they bare the Duke, (to haue him stand in the raine tyll he was thorough wet) a thousand <hi>quemadmodums</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propters</hi> he came ouer him with, euery sentence he concluded with <hi>Esse posse videatur</hi>: through all the nine worthies he ran with praising and comparing him, <hi>Nestors</hi> yeares hee assured him off vnder the broade seale of their supplications, and with that crowe troden verse in Uirgil, <hi>Dum iuga montis aper,</hi> hee packt vp his pipes, and cride <hi>dixi.</hi>

            <p>Right noble Duke (<hi>ideo nobilis quasi no bilis</hi>) for you haue no bile or cholar in you, know that our present incorporation of Wittenberg, by me the tounge-man of their thankfulnes, a townesman by birth, a frée Germane by nature, an oratour by arte, and a scriuener by education, in all obedience &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, most bountifully bid you welcome to Wittenberg: wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sayde I? O orificiall rethorike wipe thy euerlasting mouth, and affoord me a more Indian metaphor than that, for the braue princely bloud of a Saxon. Oratorie vncaske the bard hutch of thy complements, and with the triumphantest troupe in thy treasurie doe trewage vnto him. What impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent spéech with his eight partes may not specifie this vnesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable guift holding his peace, shall as it were (with teares I speake it) do wherby as it may séeme or appeare, to manifest or declare &amp; yet it is, &amp; yet it is not, &amp; yet it may bee a diminitiue oblation meritorious to your high pusillanimitie &amp; indignity. Why shoulde I goe gadding and filgigging after firking flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado Amphibologies, wit is wit, and good will is good will. With all the wit I haue, I here according to the premises, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp vnto you the Cities generall good will, which is a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Canne, in manner and forme following, for you and the heires of your bodie lawfully begotten, to drinke healths in. The scolasticall squitter bookes clout you vp cannopies &amp; foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes

            <p>Gentle Duke, without paradox be it spoken, thy horses at our owne proper costs and charges shall knéed vp to the knées all the while thou art here in spruce béere &amp; lubeck licour. Not a dog thou bringst with thée but shall be banketted with rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish wine and sturgion. On our shoulders we weare no lamb skin or miniuer like these academikes, yet wee can drinke to the confusion of all thy enemies. Good lambes-wooll haue we for their lambe skins, and for their miniuer, large minerals in our coffers. Mechanicall men they call vs, and not amisse, for most of vs being <hi>Maechi,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, cuckolds &amp; whooremasters, fetch our antiquitie from the temple of <hi>Maecha,</hi> where Mahomet is hung vp. Thrée parts of the world, America, Affrike and Asia, are of this our mechanike religion. <hi>Nero</hi> when he crid <hi>O quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus artifex pereo,</hi> profest himselfe of our fréedome. Insomuch as <hi>Artifex</hi> is a citizen or crafts-man, as wel as <hi>Carnifex</hi> a scholler or hangman. Passe on by leaue into the precincts of our abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Beny Duke, frolike in our bowre, and perswade thy selfe that euen as garlike hath thrée properties, to make a man winke, drinke, and stinke, so wee wyll winke on thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, drinke to thy fauorites, &amp; all thy foes shall stinke before vs. So be it. Farewell.</p>
            <p>The Duke laught not a little at this ridiculous oration, but that verie night, as great an ironicall occasion was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, for he was bidden to one of the chiefe schooles to a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die handled by scollers. <hi>Acolastus</hi> the prodigall childe was the name of it, which was so filthily acted, so leathernly sette foorth, as woulde haue moued laughter in <hi>Heraclitus.</hi> One as if he had béene playning a clay floore stampingly troade the stage so harde with his féete, that I thought verily he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to doe the Carpenter that sette it vp some vtter shame. Another floung his armes lyke cudgelles at a peare trée, in so much as it was mightily dreaded that hee woulde strike the candles that hung aboue theyr heades out of
<pb facs="tcp:10658:22"/>
their sockets, and leaue them all darke. Another did nothing but winke and make faces. There was a parasite, &amp; he with clapping his hands and thripping his fingers seemed to dance an antike to and fro. The onely thing they did well, was the prodigal childes hunger, most of their schollers being hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, and surely you would haue sayd they had ben brought vp in hogs academi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not a iest had they to kéepe their auditors from sléepe but of swill and draffe, yes now and then the seruant put his hand into the dish before his master, and almost choakt himselfe, eating slouenly and rauenously to cause sport.</p>
            <p>The next daie they had solempne disputations, where <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Carolostadius</hi> scolded leuell coile. A masse of words I wot well they heapt vp against the maste and the Pope, but farther perticulars of their disputations I remember not. I thought verily they woulde haue worried one another with wordes, they were so earnest and vehement. <hi>Luther</hi> had the louder voice, <hi>Carolostadius</hi> went beyond him in beating and bounsing with his fists, <hi>Quae supra nos nihil ad nos.</hi> They vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered nothing to make a man laugh, therefore I wil leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mary theyr outward iestures now and then would affoorde a man a morsell of mirth: of those two I meane not so much, as of all the other traine of opponents and respondents. One peckte like a crane with his fore-finger at euery halfe sillable he brought forth, and nodded with his nose like an olde singing man, teaching a yong querister to kéepe time. Another would be sure to wipe his mouth with his handkercher at the end of euerie full point. And euer when he thought he had cast a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure so curiously, as he diu'de ouer head and eares into his auditors admiration, hee would take occasion to stroke vp his haire, and twine vp his mustachios twice or thrice ouer while they might haue leasure to applaud him. A third wauerd and wagled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A fourth swet and foamed at the mouth, for verie anger his aduersarie had denied that part of his sillogisme which he was not prepared
<pb facs="tcp:10658:22"/>
to aunswere. A fifth spread his armes like an vsher that goes before to make roome, and thript with his finger &amp; his thumbe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought he had tickled it with a conclusion. A sixt hung downe his countenance lyke a shéepe, and stutted and slauered verie pittifully when his inuention was slept aside out of the waie. A seuenth gaspt and gapt for winde, and grened in his pronunciation as if he were hard bound with some bad argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Grosse plodders they were all, that had some learning and reading, but no wit to make vse of it. They imagined the Duke tooke the greatest pleasure and contentment vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to heare them speak Latine, and as long as they talkt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Tully</hi> he was bound to attend them. A most vaine thing it is in many vniuersities at this daye, that they count him excellent eloquent, who stealeth not whole phrases but whole pages out of <hi>Tully.</hi> If of a number of shreds of his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences he can shape an oration, from all the world hee carries it awaie, although in truth it be no more than a fooles coat of many coulours. No inuention or matter haue they of theyr owne, but tacke vp a stile of his stale galimafries. The leaden headed Germanes first began this, and we Englishmen haue surfetted of their absurd imitation.

doting on the rumour that went of him, desired him before the Duke and them to doe something extraordinarie memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>One requested to sée pleasant <hi>Plautus,</hi> &amp; that he would shew them in what habite hee went, and with what countenaunce he lookt, when he ground corne in the mill.

            <p>Greate was the concourse of glorie <hi>Agrippa</hi> drewe to him with this one feate. And in déede hée was so cloyed with men which came to beholde him, that hée was fayne sooner than hée woulde, to returne to the Emperours court from whence hée came, and leaue Wittenberg before hee woulde.

            <p>God be mercifull to our pandor (and that were for God to worke a miracle) he was séene in all the seuen liberall deadly sciences, not a sinne but he was as absolute in as sathan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Sathan could neuer haue supplanted vs so as hee did. I may saie to you he planted in vs the first Italionate wit that we had. During the time we lay close and toke phisick in this castle of contemplation, there was a Magnificos wife of good calling sent in to beare vs companie. Her husbands name was <hi>Castaldo,</hi> she hight <hi>Diamante,</hi> the cause of her committing was an vngrounded ielous suspition which her doating husbande had conceiued of her chastitie. One <hi>Isaac Medicus</hi> a bergomast was the man hee chose to make him a monster, who beeing a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> courtier and repairing to his house very often, neither for loue of him nor his wife, but onely with a drift to borrowe monie of a pawne of waxe and parchment, when he sawe his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deluded, and that <hi>Castaldo</hi> was too charie for him to close with, he priuily with purpose of reuenge, gaue out amongest his copesmates, that hee resorted to <hi>Castaldos</hi> house for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end but to cuckolde him, &amp; doubtfully he talkt that he had and he had not obtained his sute. Rings which he borrowed of a light curtizan that he vsed to, hee woulde faine to bee taken from her fingers, and in summe, so handled the matter, that <hi>Castaldo</hi> exclaimd, Out whore, strumpet, sixe penny hackster, away with her to prison.</p>
            <p>As glad were hee almost as if they had giuen vs libertie, that fortune lent vs such a swéet pue-fellow. A pretie round faced wench was it, with blacke eie browes, a high forehead, a litle mouth, and a sharpe nose, as fat and plum euerie part of her as a plouer, a skin as slike and soft as the backe of a swan, it doth

me good when I remember her. Like a birde she tript on the ground, and bare out her belly as maiesticall as an Estrich. With a licorous rouling eie fixt percing on the earth, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times scornfully darted on the tone side, shee figured foorth a high discontented disdain, much like a prince puffing and stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the treason of some mightie subiect fled lately out of his power. Her verie countenance repiningly wrathfull, and yet cléere and vnwrinkled, would haue confirmed the cléernes of her conscience to the austerest iudge in the world. If in any thing she were culpable, it was in being too melancholy chast, and shewing her selfe as couetous of her beautie as her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was of his bags. Many are honest because they knowe not how to be dishonest: she thought there was no pleasure in stolnebread, because there was no pleasure in an olde mans bed. It is almost impossible that anie woman should be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently wittie, and not make the vtmost pennie of her beautie. This age and this countrie of ours admits of some miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exceptions, but former times are my constant informers Those that haue quicke motions of wit, haue quicke motions in euerie thing: yron onely needes many strokes, onely yron wits are not wonne without a long siege of intreatie. Golde eastly bends, the most ingenious mindes are easiest moued, <hi>Ingenium nobis molle Thalia dedit,</hi> saith <hi>Psapho</hi> to <hi>Phao.</hi> Who hath no mercifull milde mistres, I will maintaine, hath no wittie but a clownish dull flegmatike puppte to his mistres.</p>
            <p>This Magnificos wife was a good louing soule, that had mettall inough in her to make a good wit of, but being neuer remoued from vnder her mothers and her husbands wing, it was not moulded and fashioned as it ought. Causelesse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct is able to driue deceite into a simple womans head. I durst pawne the credit of a page, which is worth ams ase at all times, that she was immaculate honest till she met with vs in prison. Marie what temptations shee had then when fire and flare were put together, conceit with your selues, but hold my master excusable.</p>
            <p>A lacke he was too vertuous to make her vicious, he stoode vpon religion and conscience, what a hainous thing it was to subuert Gods ordinance. This was all the iniurie he woulde

offer her, sometimes he woulde imagine her in a melancholie humour to be his <hi>Geraldine,</hi> and court her in tearmes corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent, nay he would sweare shee was his <hi>Geraldine,</hi> &amp; take her white hand and wipe his eyes with it, as though the very touch of her might stanch his anguish. Now would he knéele and kisse the ground as holy grounde which she vouchsafed to blesse from barrennesse by her steps. Who would haue learned to write an excellent passion, might haue bin a perfect tragicke poet, had he but attended halfe the extremitie of his lament. Passion vpon passion would throng one on anothers necke, he would praise her beyond the moone and starres, and that so swatly &amp; rauishingly, as I perswade my self he was more in loue with his owne curious forming fancie than her face, and truth it is, many become passionate louers, only to win praise to theyr wits.</p>
            <p>He praised, he praied, hee desired and besought her to pittie him that perisht for her. From this his intranced mistaking extasie could no man remoue him. Who loueth resolutely, will include euerie thing vnder the name of his loue. From prose he would leape into verse, and with these or such lyke rimes assault her.

The Duke of Florence neuerthelesse sent for him, and demanded him of his estate, and the reason that drew him thereto, which when hée was aduertised of to the full, he granted all Countries what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, as wel enemies and outlawes, as friendes and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, frée accesse and regresse into his dominions vnmole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, vntill that insolent triall were ended.</p>
            <p>The right honourable and euer renowmed Lorde <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Howard</hi> Earle of Surrey my singular good Lorde and master, entered the listes after this order. His armour was all intermixed with lyllies and roses, and the bases ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bordered with nettles and wéeds, signifieng stings, crosses, and ouergrowing incumbrances in his loue, his helmet round proportioned like a gardeners water-pot, from which séemed to issue forth small thrids of water, like citerne stringes, that not onely did moisten the lilles and roses, but did fructifie as well the nettles and wéedes, and made them ouergrow their liege Lordes. Whereby hee did importe thus much, that the teares that issued from his braine, as those arteficiall distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions issued from the well counterfeit water-pot on his head, watered and gaue life as well to his mistres disdaine (resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to nettles and wéedes) as increase of glorie to her care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>causing beautie, (comprehended vnder the lillies and roses.) The simbole thereto annexed was this, <hi>ex lachrimis lachrimae.</hi> The trappinges of his horse were pounced and boulstered out with rough plumed siluer plush, in full proportion and shape of an Estrich. On the breast of the horse were the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partes of this greedie birde aduaunced, whence as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, hee reacht out his long necke to the raines of the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, thinking they had beene yron, and styll seemed to gape after the golden bit, and euer as the courser dyd rayse or curuet, to haue swallowed it halfe in. His winges, which hee neuer vseth but running, beeing spreaded full sayle, made his lustie steede as proude vnder him as he had béene some other <hi>Pegasus,</hi> and so quieueringly and tenderly
<pb facs="tcp:10658:30"/>
were these his broade wings bound to either side of him, that as he paced vp and downe the tilt-yard in his maiestie ere the knights were entered, they séemed wantonly to fan in his face and make a flickering sound, such as Eagles doe, swiftly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing their praie in the ayre. On either of his winges, as the Estrich hath a sharpe goade or pricke
wherewith hee spurreth himselfe forwarde in his saile-assisted race, so this arteficiall Estrich, on the imbent knuchle of the pinion of either wing, had embossed christall eies affixed, wherein whéele wise were circularly ingrafted sharpe pointed diamonds, as rayes from those eies deriued, that like the rowels of a spurre ran déep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his horse sides, and made him more eager in his course.</p>
            <p>Such a fine dimme shine dide these christall eies and these round enranked diamonds make through their bolne swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bowres of feathers, as if it had beene a candle in a paper lanterne, or a gloworme in a bush by night, glistering through the leaues and briers. The taile of the Estrich being short and thicke, serued verie fitly as a plume to tricke vp his horse taile with, so that euerie parte of him was as naturally coapted as might be. The word to this deuice was <hi>Aculeo alatus,</hi> I spread my wings onely spurd with her eies. The morral of the whole is this, that as the Estrich, the most burning sighted bird of all others, insomuch as the female of them hatcheth not hir egs by couering them, but by the effectual raies of hir eies) as he, I saie, out strippeth the nimblest trippers of his feathered condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in footmanshippe, onely spurd on with the néedle quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning goade vnder his side, so hee no lesse burning sighted than the Estrich, spurd on to the race of honor by the sweete raies of his mistres eies, perswaded himselfe hee should outstrip all other in running to the goale of glorie only animated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by her excellence. And as the Estrich wil eat iron, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low anie hard mettall whatsoeuer, so would he refuse no iron aduenture, no hard taske whatsoeuer, to sit in the grace of so fayre a commander. The order of his shield was this, it was framed like a burning glasse, beset round with flame colourd feathers, on the outside whereof was his mistres picture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned as beautifull as art could portrature, on the inside a naked sword tied in a true loue knot, the mot, <hi>Militat omnis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:10658:30"/>
Signifieng that in a true loue knot his sword was side to defend and maintaine the high features of his mistres.</p>
            <p>Next him entered the blacke knight, whose beauer was pointed all torne &amp; bloudie, as though he had new come from combatting with a Beare, his he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

His bases were all imbrodered with snakes &amp; adders, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of the abundance of innocent bloud that was shed. His horses trappinges were throughout bespangled with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie spottes, which are no blemishes, but ornaments. On his shield hee bare the Sunne full shining on a diall at his going downe, the word <hi>sufficit tandem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him followed the knight of the Owle, whose armor was a stubd trée ouergrowen with iuie, his helmet fashioned lyke an owle sitting on the top of this iuie, on his bases were wrought all kinde of birdes as on the grounde wondering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, the word, <hi>Ideo mirum quia monstrum,</hi> his horses fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture was framed like a cart, scattering whole sheaues of corne amongst hogs, the word <hi>Liberalitas liberalitate perit.</hi> On his shield a bée intangled in shéepes wooll, the mot <hi>Frontis nulla fides.</hi> The fourth that succéeded was a well proportioned knight in an armor imitating rust, whose head piece was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured like flowers growing in a narrowe pot, where they had not anie space to spread their roots or dispearse their flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing. His bases embelisht with open armed handes scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring golde amongst trunchions, the word <hi>Cura futuri est.</hi> His horse was harnished with leaden chaines, hauing the out-side guilt, or at least saffrond in stead of guilt, to decypher a holie or golden pretence of a couetous purpose, the sentence <hi>Cani capilli mei compedes,</hi> on his target he had a number of craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wormes kept vnder by a blocke, the faburthen, <hi>Speramus lucent.</hi> The fift was the forsaken knight, whose helmet was crowned with nothing but cipresse and willow garlands, ouer his armor he had on <hi>Himens</hi> nuptiall robe died in a duskie ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and all to be defaced and discoloured with spots &amp; staines. The enigma <hi>Nos quoque florimus,</hi> as who shuld saie, we haue bin in fashion, his stead was adorned with orenge tawnie

eies, such as those haue that haue the yellowe iandies, that make all things yellow they looke vpon, with this briefe, <hi>Qui inuident egent,</hi> Those that enuie are hungrie. The sixth was the knight of the stormes, whose helmet was round moulded like the Moone, and all his armour like waues, whereon the shine of the Moone sleightly siluerd, perfectly represented Moone-shine in the water, his bases were the banks or shores that bounded in the streames. The spoke was this, <hi>Frustra pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> as much to say, as fruitles seruice. On his shield he set forth a lion driuen from his praie by a donghill cocke. The worde, <hi>Non vi sed voce,</hi> not by violence but by his voice.</p>
            <p>The seuenth had lyke the gyants that sought to scale hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in despight of Iupiter, a mount ouerwhelming his head and whole bodie. His bases out-layde with armes and legges which the skirts of that mountain left vncouered. Under this did hee characterise a man desirous to climbe to the heauen of honour, kept vnder with the mountaine of his princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and yet had hée armes and legges exempted from the suppression of that mountaine. The word, <hi>Tu mihi criminis author</hi> (alluding to his Princes commaund) thou art the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of my imputed cowardise. His horse was trapt in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie stringes of tree rootes, which though their increase was stubbed downe to the grounde, yet were they not vtterly dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but hop'd for an after resurrection. The worde, <hi>Spe alor.</hi> I hope for spring. Uppon his shield hee bare a bal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of which notwithstanding sprung (as a good Childe of an ill Father) fragraunt Blossomes of delightfull Maye Flowers that made (according to the nature of Maye) a most odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous smell. In middest of this his snowie curled top, rounde wrapped together, on the ascending of his creast sate a solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nightingale close encaged with a thorne at her breast, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this mot in her mouth, <hi>Luctus monumenta manebunt.</hi> At the foote of this bush represented on his bases, lay a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of blacke swolne Toades gasping for winde, and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:10658:31"/>
liu'de grashoppers gaping after deaw, both which were choakt with excessiue drouth, and for want of shade. The word, <hi>Non sine vulnere viresco,</hi> I spring not without impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, alluding to the Toades and such lyke, that earst laye sucking at his rootes, but nowe were turnd out, and neere choakt with drought. His horse was suited in blacke sandie earth (as adiacent to this bush) which was here and there pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with short burnt grasse, and as thicke inke dropped with toyling ants &amp; emets as euer it might crall, who in the full of the summer moone. (ruddie garnished on his horses forehead) hoorded vp theyr prouision of grain agaynst winter. The word <hi>Victrix fortunae sapientia,</hi> prouidence preuents misfortune. On his shield he set forth the picture of death doing almes déeds to a number of poore desolate children. The word, <hi>Nemo alius explicat.</hi> No other man takes pittie vpon vs. What his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was héerein I cannot imagine, except death had done him and his brethren some greate good turne in ridding them of some vntoward parent or kinsman that woulde haue beene their confusion, for else I cannot see howe death shoulde haue béene sayde to doe almes déedes, except he had depriued them sodainly of their liues, to deliuer them out of some further mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, which coulde not in anie wise hée because they were yet liuing.</p>
            <p>The ninth was the infant knight, who on his armour had ennameld a poore young infant, put into a shippe without tackling, masts, furniture, or any thing. This weather bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ill apparelled shippe was shaddowed on his bases, and the slender compasse of his body set forth the right picture of an infant. The waues wherein the ship was tossed were fretted on his steads trappings so mouingly, that euer as he offered to bounde or stirre, they séemed to bounse, and tosse, and spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle brine out of theyr hoarie siluer billowes. Theyr mot, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opem me copia fecit,</hi> as much to saie, as the rich praye makes the théefe.</p>
            <p>On his shielde hée expressed an olde Goate that made a young trée to wither onely with biting it. The worde thereto <hi>Primo extinguor in aeuo.</hi> I am frost-bitten ere I come out of the blade.</p>

lists scape scot-frée they were so eager. Others because they would be sure not to bee vnsadled with the shocks, when they came to the speares vtmost proofe, they threw it ouer the right shoulder, and so tilted backward, for forwarde they durst not. Another had a menstrous spite at the pommell of his riuals saddle, and thought to haue thrust is speare twixt his legges without rasing anie skinne, and carried him cleane awaie on it as a coolest asse.

Till this daie not a Romane (if he be a right Romane in déed) will kill a rat, but he will haue some registred remembrance of it. There was a poore fellowe during my remainder ther, that for a new trick he had inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of killing <hi>Cymess</hi> &amp; scorpions, had his mountebank banner hung vp on a high piller, with an inscription about it longer than the king of Spaines stile.

Saint Austen compareth heretiques vnto them. The chiefest thing that my eyes delighted in, was the church of the 7. Sibels, which is a most miraculous thing. All their prophestes and oracles being there enroulde, as also the beginning and ending of their whole catalogue of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Gods, with their manner of worship.

Let mee bee a Historiographer of my owne misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and not meddle with the continued Trophées of so olde a triumphing Citie.</p>
            <p>At my first comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> I being a youth of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish cut, ware my haire long, went apparailed in light cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and imitated foure or fiue sundrie Nations in my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre at once: which no sooner was noated, but I had all the boyes of the Citie in a swarme wondering about mee. I had not gone a little farther, but certaine Officers crost the waie of me, and demanded to sée my rapier: which when they found (as also my dagger) with his poynt vnblunted, they would haue hal'd me headlong to the Strappado, but that with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I appeased them: and my fault was more pardonable, in that I was a stranger, altogether ignorant of their customes.</p>
            <p>Note by the waye, that it is the vse in <hi>Rome,</hi> for all men whatsoeuer to weare their haire short: which they doo not so much for conscience sake, or anie religion they place in it, but because the extremitie of the heate is such there, that if they should not doo so, they should not haue a haire left on their heads to stand vpright, when they were scard with sprights. And hee is counted no Gentleman amongst them that goes not in black: they dresse their iesters and fooles onely in fresh colours, and say variable garments doo argue vnstayednes and vnconstancie of affections.</p>

For the earth it was counterfeited in that likenes that Adam lorded out it before his fall. A wide vast spacious roome it was, such as we would conceit prince Arthurs hall to be, where he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted all his knightes of the round table together euerie penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost. The floore was painted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beautifullest floures that euer mans eie admired, which so lineally wer delineated, that he that viewd them a farre off, and had not directly stood poa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly

Other trées y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bare no fruit, were set in iust order one against another, and diuided the roome into a number of shadie lanes, leauing but one ouer-spreading pine trée arbour, where wee sate and banketted.

He that is a traueller must haue the backe of an asse to beare all, a tung like the tayle of a dog to flatter all, the mouth of a hog to eate what is set before him, the eare of a merchant to heare all and say nothing: and if this be not the highest step of thraldome, there is no libertie or fréedome.

would make him his bond-man, or hang him. <hi>Zadoch</hi> (as all Iewes are couetous) casting with himselfe hee should haue no benefite by casting mee off the ladder, had another policie in his head: hee went to one Doctour <hi>Zacharie</hi> the popes phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that was a Iewe and his Countrey-man likewise, and tolde him hee had the finest bargaine for him that might bee. It is not concealed from mee (sayth he) that the time of your accustomed yearely Anatomie is at hand, which it behooues you vnder forfeiture of the foundation of your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge verie carefully to prouide for. The infection is great, and hardly will you get a sound bodie to deale vpon: you are my Countrey-man, therefore I come to you first. Bee it knowen vnto you, I haue a young man at home faine to me for my bond-man, of the age of eightéene, of stature tall, streight limm'd, of as cleere a complection as anie painters fancie can imagine: goe too, you are an honest man, and one of the scattered Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you shall haue him for fiue hundred crownes.

She hauing receiued this answere, with a lustfull collachrimation lamenting my Iewish Premunire, that bodie and goods I should lyght in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of such a cursed generation, inuented the moanes of my release.</p>
            <p>But first Ile tel you what betided me after I was brought to Doctour <hi>Zacharies.</hi> The purblinde Doctour put on his spectacles and lookt vppon mee: and when he had throughly viewd my face, he caused mee to bee stript naked, to feele and grope whether each lim were sound, and my skin net infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then hee pierst my arme to ses how my bloud ranne:

            <p>O the cold sweating cares which I conceiued after I knew I should be cut like a French summer dublet. Me thought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the bloud began to gush out at my nose: if a flea on the arme had but bit me, I déemed the instrument had prickt me. Well, well, I maye scoffe at a shrowde turne, but theres no such readye waye to make a man a true Christian, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe he is taken vp for an anatomie. Ile depose I praid then more than I did in seauen yeare before. Not a drop of sweate trickeled downe my breast and my sides, but I dreamd it was a smooth edgde razor tenderly slicing down my breast and my sides. If any knockt at doore, I supposed it was the beadle of Surgeons Hall come for mee. In the night I dreamd of nothing but Phlebotomie, bloudy fluxes, incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, running vlcers. I durst not let out a wheale for feare through it I should bléed to death. For meate in this distance I had plum-porredge of purgations ministred mee one after another to clarifie my bloud, that it should not lye cloddered in the flesh. Nor did he it so much for clarifying phisicke, as to saue charges.

Herewith the pope cald <hi>Iuliana,</hi> and askt her what strong concocted broth she had brought him. She knéeled downe on her knées, and sayd it was such as <hi>Zacharie</hi> the Iew had deliuered her with his owne hands, and therefore if it mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked his holines she craued pardon. The Pope without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sifting into the matter, woulde haue had <hi>Zacharie</hi> and all Iewes in Rome put to death, but shee hung about his knees, &amp; with crocodile teares desired him the sentence might bee le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and they bee all but banisht at most.

This request at the first was seald with a kisse, and the popes edict without delaye proclaimed throughout Rome, namely,

I cold to minde the assertion of some Philosophers, who said the soule was nothing but bloud: then thought I, what a filthie thing were this, if I should let my soule fall and breake his necke into a bason. I had but a pimple rose with heate in that part of the veyne where they vse to pricke, and I fearfully misdée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it was my soule searching for passage. Fie vppon it, a mans breath to bee let out a backe-doore, what a villanie it is? To dye bleeding is all one as if a man should dye pissing.

            <p>In this meditation did they seaze vpon mee, in my cloake they muffeld mee that no man might knowe mee, nor I see which waye I was carried. The first ground I toucht after I was out of <hi>Zacharies</hi> house, was the Countesse <hi>Iulianaes</hi> chamber: little did I surmise that fortune reserued mee to so faire a death. I made no other reckoning all the while they had mee on their shoulders, but that I was on horse-backe to heauen, and carried to Church on a a béere, excluded for euer for drinking anie more ale or béere. <hi>Iuliana</hi> scornfully que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiond them thus (as if I had falne into her hands beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation), what proper apple-squire is this you bring so sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiously into my chamber? what hath he done? or where had

Heeres a wench (said he) of as cleare a skin as <hi>Susanna,</hi> shee hath not a wemme on her flesh from the soale of the foote to the crowne of the head: how thinke you master doctor, will shee not serue the turne?</p>
            <p>She will, said <hi>Zacharie:</hi> and therefore Ile tell you what charge I would haue committed to her. But I care not if I disclose it onely to her. Maid, (if thou béest a maid) come he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mee, thou must be sent to the countesse of <hi>Mantuaes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a small péece of seruice, whereby being now a bond wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thou shalt purchase fréedome, and gaine a large dowrie to thy marriage. I know thy master loues thée derely though hee will not let thée perceiue so much, hee intends after hee is dead to make thée his heire, for he hath no children: please him in that I shall instruct thée, and thou art made for euer. So it is, that the pope is farre out of liking with the countesse of <hi>Mantua</hi> his concubine, and hath put his trust in me his phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to haue her quietly and charitably made away. Now I cannot intend it, for I haue manie cures in hand which call vpon me hourely: thou if thou béest plac'd with her as her wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting maid or cup-bearer, maist temper poyson with her broth, her meate, her drinke, her oyles, her sirrups, and neuer bee bewraid. I will not say whether the pope hath heard of thée, and thou maist come to bee his lemman in her place, if thou behaue thy selfe wisely. What, hast thou the heart to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough with it or no? <hi>Diamante</hi> deliberating with her selfe in what hellish seruitude she liu'd with the Iew, and that she had no likelihood to be releast of it, but fall from euill to worse if she omitted this opportunitie, resigned her selfe ouer whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be disposed and emploid as séemed best vnto them. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, without further consultation, her wardrop was rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rigd, her tongue smooth fil'd &amp; new edg'd on the whetstone, her drugs deliuerd her, and presented she was by <hi>Zadoch</hi> her master to the countesse, together with some other slight new-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After her furie had reasonably spent it selfe, her breast began to swell with the mother, caused by her former fretting &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and she grew verie ill at ease.

Then was the maid in her grandames beanes, and knew not what should become of her: I heard the Pope tooke pitie on her, and because her trespasse was not voluntary but chance-medly, he assigned her no other punishment but this, to drinke out the rest of the poyson in the glasse that was left, and so goe scot-frée.

            <p>It is not so naturall for me to epitomize his impietie, as to heare him in his owne person speake vppon the whéele where he was to suffer.</p>
            <p>Prepare your eares and your teares, for neuer till this thrust I anie tragicall matter vpon you. Strange and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull are Gods iudgements, heere shine they in their glory. Chast <hi>Heraclide,</hi> thy bloud is laid vp in heauens treasurie, not one drop of it was lost, but lent out to vsurie: water powred forth sinkes downe quietly into the earth, but bloud spilt on the ground sprinkles vp to the firmament.

            <p>This is but a glose vpon the text: thus <hi>Cutwolfe</hi> begins his insulting oration.</p>
            <p>Men and people that haue made holy-daie to behold my pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned flesh toile on the whéele. Expect not of me a whining pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent slaue, that shal do nothing but crie and saie his praiers, and so be crusht in péeces. My bodie is little, but my minde is as great as a Giants: the soule which is in mee, is the verie soule of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> by reuersion. My name is <hi>Cutwolfe,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor worse by occupation, than a poore cobler of <hi>Verona,</hi> coblers are men and kings are no more. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of my comming hether at this present, is to haue a fewe of my bones broken (as we are all borne to die) for being the death of the Emperour of homicides <hi>Esdras</hi> of <hi>Granado.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two yeares since in the stréetes of <hi>Rome</hi> he slew the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eldest brother I had named <hi>Bartoll,</hi> in quarrelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a curtizan. The newes brought to me as I was sitting in my shop vnder a stall knocking in of tackes, I think I raisd vp my bristles, solde pritch-aule, spunge, blacking tub, and punching yron, bought mee rapier and pistoll, and to goe I went. Twentie months together I pursued him, from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Caiete</hi> passing ouer the riuer, from <hi>Caiete</hi> to <hi>Syenna,</hi> from <hi>Syenna</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> from <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Parma,</hi> from <hi>Parma</hi> to <hi>Pauia,</hi> from <hi>Pauia</hi> to <hi>Syon,</hi> from <hi>Syon</hi> to <hi>Geneua,</hi> from <hi>Geneua</hi> backe againe towards <hi>Rome:</hi> where in the way it was my chance to méet him in the nicke here at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> as I will tell you how. I saw a great fray in the stréetes as I past along, and manie swords walking, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon drawing néerer, and enquiring who they were, answer was returned mee it was that notable Bandetto <hi>Esdras</hi> of <hi>Granado,</hi> O so I was tickled in the spléene with that word, my heart hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:10658:49"/>
I will not what should become of my féete, nor knew what I did for ioy. The fray parted. I thought it not conuenient to single him out (being a sturdie knaue) in the street, but to stay till I had got him at more aduantage. To his lodging I dogd him, lay at the dore all night where hee entred, for feare hee should giue me the slip anie way. Betimes in the morning I rung the bell and crau'd to speake with him: vp to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dore I was brought, where knocking, hee rose in his shirt and let me in, and when he was entred, bad me lock the dore and declare my arrant, and so he slipt to bed againe.</p>
            <p>Marrie this quoth I is my arrant. Thy name is <hi>Esdras</hi> of <hi>Granado,</hi> is it not? Most treacherously thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bartoll</hi> about two yeres agoe in the streetes of <hi>Rome:</hi> his death am I come to reuenge. In quest of thée euer since aboue thrée thousand miles haue I trauaild. I haue begd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine me the better part of the waye, onely because I would intermit no time from my pursute in going backe for monie. Now haue I got thée naked in my power, die thou shalt, though my mother and my grandmother dying did intreate for thée. I haue promist the diuell thy soule within this houre, breake my word I will not, in thy breast I intend to burie a bullet. Stirre not, quinch not, make no noyse: for if thou dost it will be worse for thée.</p>
            <p>Quoth <hi>Esdras,</hi> what euer thou bee at whose mercie I lye, spare me, and I wil giue thee as much gold as thou wilt aske. Put me to anie paines my life reserued, and I willingly will sustaine them: cut off my armes and legs, and leaue me as a lazer to some loathsome spittle, where I may but liue a yeare to pray and repent me. For thy brothers death the despayre of minde that hath euer since haunted mee, the guiltie gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worme of conscience I féele may bee sufficient penaunce. Thou canst not send me to such a hell, as alreadie there is in my hart. To dispatch me presently is no reuenge, it wil soone be forgotten: let me dye a lingring death, it will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred a great deale longer. A lingring death maye auaile my soule, but it is the illest of ills that can befortune my bodie. For my soules health I beg my bodies torment: bee not thou a diuell to torment my soule, and send me to eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:10658:49"/>
Thy ouer-hanging sword hides heauen from my sight, I dare not looke vp, least I embrace my deaths-wound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares: I cannot pray to God, and plead to thée both at once. Ay mee, alreadie I see my life buried in the wrinckles of thy browes: say but I shall liue, though thou meanest to kill me. Nothing confounds like to suddaine terror, it thrusts euerie sense out of office. Poyson wrapt vp in sugred pills is but halfe a poyson: the feare of deaths lookes are more terrible than his stroake. The whilest I viewe death, my faith is deaded: where a mans feare is, there his heart is. Feare neuer engenders hope: how can I hope that heauens father will saue mee from the hell euerlasting, when he giues me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the hell of thy furie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heraclide</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now thinke I on thy feares sowen in the dust, (thy teares, that my bloudie minde made barraine). In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of thée, God hardens this mans heart against mee: yet I did not slaughter thée, though hundreds else my hand hath brought to the shambles. Gentle sir, learne of mee what it is to clog your conscience with murder, to haue your dreames, your sleepes, your solitarie walkes troubled and disquieted with murther. Your shaddowe by daye will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright you, you will not sée a weapon vnsheathd, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately you will imagine it is predestinate for your destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This murder is a house deuided within it selfe: it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornes a mans owne soule to informe against him: his soule (beeing his accuser) brings foorth his two eyes as witnesses agaynst him: and the least eye witnesse is vnrefutable. Plucke out my eyes if thou wilt, and depriue my trayterous soule of her two best witnesses. Digge out my blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tongue with thy dagger, both tongue and eyes will I gladly forgoe, to haue a little more time to thinke on my iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to heauen.</p>
            <p>Deferre a while thy resolution. I am not at peace with the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rld, for euen but yesterdaye I sought, and in my surie threatened further vengeaunce: had I face to face aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse, I should thinke halfe my sinnes were forgiuen. A hundred Diuells haunt mee daily for my horrible murders:
<pb facs="tcp:10658:50"/>
the diuells when I dye will be loath to goe to hell with mee, for they desir'd of Christ he would not send them to hell before their time: if they goe not to hell, into thee they will goe, and hideously vexe thée for turning them out of their habitation. Wounds I contemne, life I prize light, it is another worlds tranquilitie which makes me so timerous: euerlasting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, euerlasting howling and lamentation. It is not from death I request thee to deliuer me, but from this terror of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments eternitie. Thy brothers bodie onely I pierst vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, his soule meant I no harme too at all: my bodie &amp; soule both shalt thou cast awaye quite, if thou doost at this instant what thou maist. Spare me, spare me I beseech thée: by thy owne soules saluation I desire thee, seeke not my soules vtter perdition: in destroying me, thou destroyest thy selfe and me. Eagerly I replide after his long suppliant oration; Though I knewe God would neuer haue mercie on mée except I had mercie on thée, yet of thée no mercie would I haue. Reuenge in our tragedies continually is raised from hell: of hell doo I estéeme better than heauen, if it affoord me reuenge. There is no heauen but reuenge. I tell thée, I would not haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke so much toyle to gaine heauen, as I haue done in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thée for reuenge. Diuine reuenge, of which (as of the ioies aboue) there is no fulnes or satietie. Looke how my féete are blistered with following thée from place to place. I haue riuen my throat with ouerstraining it to curse thée. I haue grownd my téeth to pouder with grating and grinding them together for anger, when anie hath nam'd thée. My tongue with vaine threates is bolne, and waxen too big for my mouth. My eies haue broken their strings with staring and looking ghastly, as I stood deuising how to frame or set my countenance when I met thée. I haue nere spent my strength in imaginarie act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on stone wals, what I determined to execute on thée. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate not, a miracle maye not repriue thée: villaine, thus march I with my blade into thy bowels.</p>
            <p>Stay, stay exclaimed <hi>Esdras</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and heare mee but one word further. Though neither for God nor man thou carest, but placest thy whole felicitie in murder, yet of thy felicitie learne how to make a greater felicitie. Respite me a little from thy
<pb facs="tcp:10658:50"/>
swords poynt, and set mee about some execrable enterprise, that may subuert the whole state of Christendome, and make all mens eares tingle that heare of it. Commaund me to cut all my kindreds throates, to burne men women and children in their beds in millions, by firing their Cities at midnight. Be it Pope, Emperour or Turke that displeaseth thée, he shal not breath on the earth. For thy sake will I sweare and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare, renounce my baptisme, and all the interest I haue in any other sacrament. Onely let me liue how miserable soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, be it in a dungeon amongst toades, serpents and adders, or set vp to the necke in dung. No paines I will refuse how euer proroged, to haue a little respite to purifie my spirit: oh heare me, heare me, and thou canst not be hardned against me.</p>
            <p>At this his importunitie I paused a little, not as retyring from my wreakful resolution, but going back to gather more forces of vengeance. With my selfe I deuised how to plague him double for his base minde. My thoughts traueld in quest of some notable newe Italionisme, whose murdrous plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme might not onely extend on his bodie, but his soule also. The ground worke of it was this. That whereas he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised for my sake to sweare and forsweare, and commit <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>-like violence on the highest seales of religion: if he would but thus farre satisfie me he should bee dismist from my furie. First and formost he should renounce God and his lawes, and vtterly disclaime the whole title or interest he had in anie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt of saluation. Next he should curse him to his face, as <hi>Iob</hi> was willed by his wife, and write an absolute firme ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of his soule to the diuell, without condition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Thirdly and lastly (hauing done this), hee should praye to God feruently neuer to haue mercie vppon him, or pardon him. Scarce had I propounded these articles vnto him, but he was beginning his blasphemous abiurations. I wonder the earth opened not and swallowed vs both, hearing the bold tearmes he blasted forth in contempt of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Heauen hath thundred when halfe lesse contumelies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it haue béen vttered. Able they were to raise Saints and Martirs from their graues, and plucke Christ himselfe from the right hand of his father. My ioints trembled &amp; quakt
<pb facs="tcp:10658:51"/>
with attending them, my haire stood vpright, &amp; my hart was turned wholly to fire. So affectionately and zealously did hee giue himself ouer to infidelitie, as if sathan had gotten the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of our high Maker. The veyne in his left hand that is deriued from his heart with no faint blow he pierst, &amp; with the bloud that flowd from it, writ a ful obligation of his soule to the diuell: yea, more earnestly he praid vnto God neuer to forgiue it his soule, than manie Christians doo to saue theyr soules. These fearfull ceremonies brought to an end, I bad him ope his mouth and gape wide. He did so (as what wil not slaues doo for feare). Therwith made I no more adoo, but shot him ful into the throat with my pistol: no more spake he after, so did I shoote him that hee might neuer speak after, or repent him. His body being dead lookd as blacke as a toad: the diuell presently branded it for his owne. This is the fault that hath called me hether. No true <hi>Italian</hi> but will honor me for it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge is the glory of Armes, and the highest performance of valure: reuenge is whatsoeuer wee call law or iustice. The farther we wade in reuenge, the nerer come we to the throne of the Almightie. To his scepter it is properly ascribed, his scepter he lends vnto man, when he lets one man scourge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All true <hi>Italians</hi> imitate mee, in reuenging constantly, and dying valiantly. Hangman to thy taske, for I am readie for the vtmost of thy rigor. Herewith all the people (outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously incensed) with one conioyned out-crye yelled mainely, Away with him, away with him, Executioner torture him, teare him, or we will teare thée in péeces if thou spare him.</p>
            <p>The executioner néeded no exhortation herevnto, for of his owne nature was he hackster good enough: olde excellent hee was at a bone-ache. At the first chop with his wood-knife would he fish for a mans heart, and fetch it out as easily as a plum from the bottome of a porredge pot. Hee would cracke neckes as fast as a cooke crackes egges: a fidler cannot turne his pin so soone, as he would turn a man of the ladder. Braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did hee drum on this <hi>Cutwolfes</hi> bones, not breaking them outright, but like a sadler knocking in of tackes, tarring on them quaueringly with his hammer a great while together. No ioynt about him but with a hatchet he had for the nonce, he
<pb facs="tcp:10658:51"/>
dissoynted halfe, and then with boyling lead souldred vp the wounds from bléeding. His tongue he puld out, least he should blaspheme in his torment: venomous slinging wormes hee thrust into his eares, to kéep his head rauingly occupied: with cankers scruzed to péeces hee rubd his mouth and his gums. No l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this horror left they him on the whéele as in hel: where yet liuing, hee might behold his flesh legacied amongst the soules of the aire. Unsearchable is the booke of our destenies. One mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der begetteth another: was neuer yet bloud-shed barrain from the beginning of the world to this day. Mortifiedly abiected and danted was I with this trunculent tragedie of <hi>Cutwolfe</hi> and <hi>Esdras.</hi> To such straight life did it thence forward incite me, that ere I went out of <hi>Bolognia</hi> I married my curtizane, periormed manie almes deedes; and hasted so fast cut of the <hi>Sodom</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> that within fortie daies I arriued at the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Campe twixt <hi>Ardes</hi> and <hi>Guines</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> where he with great triumphes met and entertained the Emperour and the French King, and feasted manie dayes. And so as my Storie began with the King at <hi>Turnay</hi> and <hi>Turwin,</hi> I thinke méete heere to end it with the King at <hi>Ardes</hi> &amp; <hi>Guines.</hi> All the conclusiue Epilogue I will make is this; that if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue pleased any, it shall animate me to more paynes in this kinde. Otherwise I will sweare vpon an English Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, neuer to bee out-landish Chronicler more while I liue. Farewell as manie as wish me well. <hi>Iune</hi> 27. 1593.</p>
