            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Century, in this part of the World; and that, above all others, that of <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi> was the moſt Beneficial, have long ago projected to ſhare in it with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But by the Policy of thoſe who had already felt the Sweets of it, and who feared a Diminution of their Gain, they found, till of late Years, unſurmountable Difficulties.</p>
            <p>But in the Year 1688. they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the moſt part, Early ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Revolution, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Preſent Majeſty with great Zeal, they thought they might.

            <p>About Three Years ago, under the Adminiſtration of the Earl of <hi>Twidale,</hi> who was mightily influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this Affair by Secretary <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Son of the late Laird <hi>Warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> an Act was touched by the

Sums of Money; and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> had a Project of Subſcribing an Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound. But the Parliament ſitting here about the time when the Diſcourſe of this Great Affair was at the hotteſt, the Companies moſt concerned, made their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to them, and prevailed ſo much, that they quite daſhed all Subſcriptions here; and that they might, if poſſibly, quite Ruin the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Project, they addreſſed His Majeſty, That he would take all care, and uſe all poſſible Methods to ſuppreſs it; they obtain'd a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, That ſome Methods ſhould be taken, and His Majeſty making ſome Reflections upon what had paſſed, was pleaſed to expreſs himſelf, <hi>He had not been well ſerved in</hi> Scotland. But the Act being paſſed, and the whole Kingdom being engaged in it, it was looked upon as next to an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, to have it Repealed.

            <p>THE <hi>Scots</hi> ſeeing that no Subſcriptions from <hi>England</hi> were to be expected, the Frowns of the Parliament having quite diſincouraged all here; and that the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> were for preferring a preſent and certain Gain before Great Expectations, being reſolved to Keep all meaſures with <hi>England,</hi> they reſolved to ſtand upon their own bottom, and to ſhew to the World that they were not ſo Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical as ſome gave out, they ſet themſelves more warmly to carry the Project on, and accordingly ſubſcrib'd 400000 <hi>l.</hi> moſt of the Nobility and Gentry, and all the Cities and Royal Boroughs unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly concurring, giving the World a ſufficient Proof that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42773:6"/>
was neither ſo Poor, nor ſo Diſ-jointed, as ſome people would have it believed. This Great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation being laid, the Superſtructure went on apace; Firſt, they bought them a Noble Houſe in <hi>Miln-Square</hi> in <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to ſerve both for the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Company, and a Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. Then they began to build and buy Ships, both for Burthen and War, the chief of which are the St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the <hi>

            <p>After they had procured Ships ſufficient for the preſent Deſigns of the Company, there was a great Debate among the Company, to what part of the <hi>Indies</hi> the Ships

               </gap>ious Rumors of the <hi>Scots</hi> Deſigns. But the firſt Project laid by <hi>Mr. Paterſon,</hi> about Ten Years ago, for ſettling a Colony in the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> prevailed. Accordingly Three Stout Ships and Two Tenders were Equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Port of <hi>Leith</hi> in the <hi>Frith,</hi> and all manner of Proviſion and Warlike Stores put on Board, with about Twelve Hundred Seamen and Soldiers, the Complement of the laſt being the moſt Select Foot of <hi>Scotland;</hi> they ſayl'd from the <hi>Frith</hi> with a proſperous Gale, and went round by the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and having a proſperous Voyage, about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>November,</hi> the laſt Year, 1698. arrived ſafe in the Bay of <hi>Darien,</hi> having loſt few or none of their men.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were arrived ſafe in the Bay, after their hearty Thanks to Almighty God for their ſafe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, they fell to ſounding the Coaſts, and found within a great

Chain of Iſlands (among which is the Golden Iſland, by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> called St. <hi>Katherine),</hi> a moſt large and Capacious Port, where Ships of the greateſt burthen may ſafely ride ſecure from wind and weather.</p>
            <p>The Entrance of the Port, to which they have given the Name of <hi>the Port of New St. Andrew,</hi> is not above Canon-ſhot over; ſo that it's very capable of being defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Attacks of any Enemies, they having already raiſed Platforms for that End. Upon the Low Neck of a Promontory within the Bay, which contains not above Thirty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of Land, they have begun to build them ſuch Houſes as ſo ſhort a time can give them leave; which they have covered over with the Leaves of the Tree called <hi>Plantain,</hi> whoſe Leaves are about a Foot and a half long: For the better ſecurity of the New Fort, they have cut the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> or Neck of Land on which it ſtands, for about 130 paces and let

            <p>THE Country of <hi>Darien,</hi> is one of the moſt Famous <hi>Iſthmus</hi>'s in the World, It's about a hundred and twenty Miles long, and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore broad. If it were poſſible to Cut a Channel from Sea to Sea, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Shipping, it would facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Navigation of the World two Parts in three; but it's next to an impoſſibility, for it's almoſt a continued Chain of Mountains, of which ſome are as high as any of the Alps; eſpecially thoſe towards the <hi>North</hi> Part, which is only deſcribed in theſe Papers, none of the Colony being able to give ſo exact an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>South</hi> as yet.</p>

The Valleys are watered with Rivers and Perpetual clear Springs, which are moſt pleaſant to drink, being as ſoft as Milk and very Nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing.</p>
            <p>The Rivers that fall into the <hi>North</hi> Sea, becauſe of their ſhort courſe are not Navigable; for they have their riſe from the high Chain of Hills above, which reaches all along the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles, and ſometimes leſs of the Sea. From the top of the Hills, is one of the moſt pleaſant Proſpects imaginable; for you have there a clear view of the <hi>North</hi> Sea, and the Various making of the ſhore, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Adjacent <hi>Iſlands,</hi> which are called <hi>Samballas,</hi> between which, and the continent runs a Channel about a League over; which makes all along the Coaſt Numberleſs ſafe Harbours, and ſupplys the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Rivers which are ſmall, and commonly (becauſe of the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Land Floods in the rainy ſeaſon, that carries down infinite Earth and

Mud) are barred with flat Oazy Shol's.</p>
            <p>Theſe Hills are Clothed with tall Trees without any underwood, ſo that one may Gallop conveniently among them, many Miles free from Sun and Rain, unleſs of a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. The Air makes on the tops of the Trees a pleaſant Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Muſick, ſo that one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony conſidering the Coolneſs, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Murmuring of the Air, and the infinite beauty of a continued Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arbor, called them the ſhades of Love.</p>
            <p>Between theſe Hills and the Sea, are gentle declivities and a rich fat ſoyl full of all manner of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, among which are many not known to us in Europe. It's capable of any improvement, but towards the ſhore in many places, eſpecially near the Mouths of Rivers are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſles, in which grows a Tree which riſes from ſeveral Roots, to which was given the Name of the <hi>Stilt</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42773:9"/>
               <hi>Tree,</hi> becauſe the Roots like Stilts are entangled one among another. It's a Tree of about a foot Diameter. It has red bark and may be good for dying and dreſſing of Leather. This Tree is very troubleſome to Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, becauſe it makes a continued thicket.</p>
            <p>The whole Country is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended between the eight and tenth degree of Northern Latitude, and has its Name from the River called <hi>Darien;</hi> whereby its Northern Coaſt is bounded to the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> It's more ſubject to Rain than any other Country in the ſame Latitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its Mountainous ſcituation, between the Atlantick or Northern Ocean, and the pacifick or <hi>mare del Zur.</hi> The Rains begin in <hi>May,</hi> and laſt four or five Months, but are very gentle at firſt like <hi>April</hi> ſhowers, but after are more Violent, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſometimes they make a kind of a deluge covering the ground in ſome places ſeven or eight Foot all on a ſuddain, and carrying down
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42773:10"/>
Trees with great Impetuoſity, but thoſe that are acquainted with the Country know how to avoid the danger. But thoſe Rains even in the wetteſt months are not ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but there are many fair Days, and ſometimes a week together with ſmall Thunder, ſhowers and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breeſes of Air. The pleaſant dry Months are <hi>December, January, February, March</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> The Sky is then very ſerene, and not ſo much as a Cloud to be ſeen, and notwithſtanding the warm ſcituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Climate, it's extreamly Pleaſant, every thing having a freſh verdure and odour, the Air gently fanning the Inhabitants, ſo that the heat is ſo far from being trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome that it's delectable.</p>
            <p>But the Country tho it be Rich and Fruitful on the ſurface, is yet far Richer in its Bowels, there being great Mines of Gold; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties were certainly informed that not above twelve Leagues from New <hi>Edenborough,</hi> was a great Mine of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42773:10"/>
this pretious mettal, on which were employed near a Thouſand Blacks, and that in the River of <hi>Sancta Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> which is not above Thirteen Leagues from this Colony, and which falls into the <hi>South</hi> Sea, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> every year get Gold duſt to the value of a Million.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the Reader, to give him an Account of the manner of getting the Gold duſt, which is as follows. They have little Wooden Diſhes which they dip into the water and take it up half full of ſand, and at every dipping they find ſome Gold mixed with the ſand, they ſhake the ſand and the Gold goes to the bottom, and the ſand riſes and goes over the brim of the Diſh with the water, then with a Loadſtone they extract the Iron duſt from it, and ſo it's clear from any other oar or filth. This can only be done in the fair Seaſon, for the Rivers are too deep in the wet, and then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42773:11"/>
is the Gold brought down by the impetuous deluge from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. It's eaſy to gueſs from this what vaſt Mines may in time be diſcovered, when Art and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry are joyned together, and of what importance it will be to <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> to take all poſſible meaſures to preſerve this Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE Reader in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had mention of a League made between the <hi>Dariens</hi> and the Company: It will not be improper here, to give an Account of the reception of the Deputies and the manners of <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Colony had refreſhed themſelves a ſhore, and taken all poſſible precautions againſt any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſurprize, by ſuch fortifications as could be made in ſo ſhort a time; It was agreed on by all, that it would add much to the ſecurity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42773:12"/>
of the enterprize, if they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a League and ſtrict bond of friendſhip with the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom they knew to be great Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extirpate them, but could never prevail by reaſon of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible paths of the Country. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſome Deputies were ſent out, among whom was Mr. <hi>Paterſon,</hi> the chief Projector of the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. They found the <hi>Indians</hi> were, as it's before related, very tractable, and had certain intelligence that one of their great Kings (as they call their chief Captains in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) was not far off upon the great ridge of the Mountains, and would be very glad to underſtand their deſign, and enter into any League againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whom they Mortally hated. They ſet out with a ſmall train to give no occaſion of Jealouſie, and had ſeveral ſlight Merchandiſes; as Beads, Linnen and Woolen Cloaths and other things, which they knew would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſents to the wild <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42773:12"/>
They found the Country, thro' which they paſs'd, of an exceeding Rich ſoyl, but much covered with Wood as above related, only here and there they met with ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which the <hi>Indians</hi> called in their Language <hi>Savannah</hi>'s; where they plant their <hi>Mari,</hi> a kind of Corn ſomething like wheat, upon little hillocks, at a little diſtance one from another. Theſe <hi>Savannahs</hi> are not level, but conſiſt of ſmall Hills and Valleys, with pleaſant ſpots of Wood intermixt, which ſerve both for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profit, of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> were ſo ſecure, that they ſaw ſeveral of them ſleeping in Hammocks tied to two Trees, and had no other covering or Canopy, but large Plantan Leaves, for they were told by their Prieſts, or rather Magicians (who went a Conjuring, which they call Panawing, as ſoon as our Fleet arrived) that the People newly arrived, would be a great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42773:13"/>
againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> their Enemies, and would never moleſt them in any matters of Religion, but live in good Correſpondence with them; if they failed not on their Part.</p>
            <p>The Panawing is performed, as the Deputies were informed, with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous yellings and ſhrieks, in which they imitate ſometimes the hiſſing of Serpents, ſometimes the croaking of Toads, ſometimes the yelping of Foxes and Barking of Dogs; to which they joyn the noiſe of ſeveral ſtones ſtruck together, and of a ſort of Drums made of Bambo's; they labour ſo hard and ſtrain themſelves ſo much, that they are all in a great ſweat, and often fall into ſtrange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and trances for a conſiderable time, and then renew their ſhrieks again, till the Oracle be given. The great Enemy of mankind and lover of diſcord invited by ſuch jarring Muſick, at laſt viſibly appears and audibly gives his Anſwer, which for the moſt part proves exactly true,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42773:13"/>
that he may the better delude theſe poor Creatures, who ſtand in great awe of him.</p>
            <p>But to return to where we left off, after they had made two eaſy days Journey, they arrived at the place where the King was, which was on the top of a very high Hill, which had a Noble Proſpect toward the <hi>North</hi> Sea, as far as the Eye could reach, and was Crowned with a moſt Noble Grove of Stately Trees; ſome of which were eleven Foot Diameter, which bears a Cod about the bigneſs of a Nutmeg, full of ſhort Wool, which when ripe is blown about by the wind, and is of ſmall uſe; tho it's ſomething like Cotton.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the King had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the Deputies were near at hand, he ſent a few Perſons of the beſt Quality to Conduct them to his preſence: theſe were attended with a ſort of Muſitians who play'd upon a kind of Pipes made of ſmall hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42773:14"/>
Bamboes, and Reeds full of notches, with which they made a kind of whining noiſe, but nothing Muſical to European Ears, and all the Company, to keep Conſort, made a humming at the ſame time to themſelves.</p>
            <p>As they approached nearer, they were diverted with a Dance of 40 Men in a Ring, who ſtretched out their hands and laid them on one anothers ſhoulders, moving gently ſideways round in a Circle, wrigling themſelves into a thouſand ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Poſtures, ſomething like the Highland Dances in <hi>Scotland:</hi> After they had Danced a pretty while, one of the Company jumped out of the Ring and Play'd ſeveral Antick Tricks, throwing and catching a Lance, bending back towards the ground, and ſpringing forward again with great Activity, to the no ſmall admiration of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42773:14"/>
Moſt of them were ſix foot high, ſtrait and clean limb'd, big-bon'd and full breaſted, their faces were round, with ſhort bottle Noſes, Eyes large and ſparkling, white even Teeth.</p>
            <p>Their hair was ſtrait, long and black, which they wore down to the middle of their back or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hanging looſe at it's full length, they often ſcratched their heads, and when they found any lice, they would immediately put them in their Mouth and eat them; it's ſuppoſed they have not the uſe of Combs.</p>
            <p>They had no Beards, neither does any of the Nation wear any, but has it, as well as the hair in other parts, pulled up by the Roots, by their Women, except the Eye-Brows and Eye-Lids; for which purpoſe, becauſe they have not the uſe of ſmall Pincers, they moſt dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly make uſe of two ſticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42773:15"/>
which they pinch the hair and pluck it up.</p>
            <p>Their Colour, as is the reſt of the Nation, was Orange Tawney (for this deſcription may ſerve for the whole Nation, and therefore the digreſſion is the longer) they had newly anointed themſelves with Oyl, which they make uſe of, to make their Bodies ſhine and to make their Skin ſmooth and ſupple, and hinder it from Parching; they had drawn upon their Skins many Figures of Birds, Fiſhes and Trees, in many parts of their Bodies, but eſpecially of their Faces, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours were red, yellow and blue, they are laid on with Pencils made of jagged and beaten ſticks.</p>
            <p>They were quite Naked, and had not ſo much as a rag about them, only a piece of a <hi>Plantain</hi> Leaf, which was rolled up into the Figure of an extinguiſher, and but half covered their privities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42773:15"/>
They had all a peice of an Oval thin Plate of Gold, which covered their Mouth from corner to corner, and hung dangling over their Lips, being fixed to the inner part of the Noſe.</p>
            <p>They had ſeveral Chains of teeth, ſhells, Beads, hanging from the Neck down upon the Breaſt, and to the Pit of the Stomach, which was looked upon by them as the greateſt peice of Finery, and the more weighty and more numerous the Chains are, the more they value themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Dreſs.</p>
            <p>But to put an end to this long, yet neceſſary Digreſſion: When they were come to the top of the Hill, and almoſt in ſight of the King, to ſhew how welcom they were to both Sexes; they were entertained by a Dance of Women, who behaved themſelves with great modeſty and activity, dancing in a Ring, as the men did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:42773:16"/>
The had every one of them a peice of Cotton Cloath about their mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, tied behind with a Thread, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to their Ankles: they were very plump and fat, well ſhaped, and had lively brisk Eyes, but ſomething ſhort, and a little too thick.</p>
            <p>Their Features were very regular, their Hair long and black, which was tied together with a ſtring juſt behind the Head.</p>
            <p>Theſe Women danced ſtill before the Depu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, till they were arrived in the King's Preſence, whom they found ſeared under a Tree of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary bigneſs, upon a kind of a Throne made of ſeveral Logs of Wood, piled neatly one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and covered with a ſort of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-coloured Cloath, which he had purchaſed of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for a great Sum of Gold; he had on his Head a Diadem of Gold Plate, about ten Inches broad, indented at the top, lined within with Net-work, made of ſmall Canes, and a Robe ſhaped
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42773:16"/>
ſomething like a Frock, of <hi>Cotton,</hi> down to his heels, with a Fringe of the ſame Cotton above a Span long, with ſhort wide open Sleeves, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching only to the middle of his Arms; his Face was painted with Red, as if he deſign'd War upon ſome of his Neighbours; he had a Plate of Gold hanging over his mouth, of an Oval Figure, covering his mouth from corner to corner; he had hanging at each Ear a Pendant made of two large Plates of Gold, faſtned to a Ring, the one hanging before to the Breaſt, and the other behind on the ſhoulder: the Plates were about 8 Inches long, and ſhaped like a heart.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who attended him wore on their Heads a kind of a Diadem made of Cane work, indented and jagged at the top, wrought very fine, and well painted, ſet round at the top with long beautiful Feathers, in the form of a Crown.</p>
            <p>They all wore ſeveral Chains of Teeth, hanging down from the Neck
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42773:17"/>
above a Foot. The Teeth were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented and over-run, tallied and notched exactly with the other, which made them look like a ſolid peice of Bone.</p>
            <p>The Deputies, after they had made a Low Obeyſance to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, were conducted by the Maſter of the Ceremonies, who is always a principal man, to ſome Seats made of Logs of Wood, covered with Cotton Cloth, juſt over-againſt the King's Throne, but much lower. After they were ſeated, they were by the ſame Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies commanded to give an account of the Affairs they had to tranſact with his Majeſty. Then Mr. <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the Firſt of the Embaſſy, roſe up, and after due reverence, made a ſhort and pithy Speech; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which was, <hi>That they were come from the uttermoſt Coaſt of the World, being the Subjects of a Mighty Prince, to admire his Grandeur, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabliſh Traffick, and to make a ſtrict League with him againſt all Enemies whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42773:17"/>
There was a moſt profound ſilence during the Speech, and it was obfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that his Majeſty ſmiled, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten twirled the Plate of Gold which covered his mouth, which was a fign that he was extreamly pleaſed. But I cannot here omit one thing which happened juſt when the Speech was ended, which was no ſmall cauſe of Laughter: A Drove of Monkeys came leaping up and down the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Trees, and made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſqueaking, ſometimes breaking the little Branches, and throwing them down among the people, and piſſed among them, and hung down by one another's Tails, in a Chain; and ſwinging in that manner till the lowermoſt catch'd hold of a Bough of another Tree, and drew up the reſt; and it's by this means that they paſs from top to top of high Trees, whoſe Branches are a little too far aſunder for their leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Indians</hi> looked upon this as a very good <hi>Omen,</hi> and interpreted it thus, <hi>That as the Monkeys by this Stratagem were a mutual aſſiſtance one</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42773:18"/>
               <hi>to another, ſo the</hi> Scots <hi>and</hi> Indians <hi>would be, and that all would end in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this little Diverſion was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, all was huſhed again in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence. Then, by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Order, a Noble <hi>Indian</hi> ſtood up, and made a Speech; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which was, <hi>That the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Men were welcome; that there ſhould be nothing wanting that they could poſſibly aſſiſt them in; that a League ſhould continue while Gold and Floods were in</hi> Darien (an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion uſed there to ſignify Perpetuity) <hi>and that they might be aſſured of it the more, his Majeſty would Swear it by his Teeth, and Touching of Lips with his Fingers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Speech was ended, the Deputies were ordered to withdraw, which they did, making a Profound Reverence to his Majeſty. Then they were conducted to a pleaſant cool place; at a little diſtance from the place of Audience; where they were
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42773:18"/>
entertained with a ſort of Drink made of <hi>Indian</hi> Mace, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, but of a Souriſh Taſte, and is very windy.</p>
            <p>The Deputies asked if they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſort of Drink? Upon which preſently was brought in great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhes a milder drink, called, <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law,</hi> which is made of Ripe Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which is not unpleaſant to the Palate. After they had been treated in this place about an hour, a Meſſage came from his Majeſty to invite them to Dinner, which was made ready under another huge Tree; for Houſes here are none; this being only a place for Summers Diverſion, where they fear no Rain or change of weather for ſome months.</p>
            <p>They found the King Seated on a low Seat, with ſome few of the Nobility ſtanding about him; after due reverence paid him, they were commanded to ſit down at a little diſtance from His Majeſty, who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42773:19"/>
was at the head of the Table which was made of twigs, moſt curiouſly wrought, and covered thick with <hi>Plantain</hi> Leaves, inſtead of Cloth and Napkins, and inſtead of Knives, there was a kind of a Dagger which they uſe in War, called a Macheat: In the middle of the Table was an Earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel full of ſalt, which is very ſcarce in the inner Parts of the Country, and another of Pepper, which is very plentiful, and much uſed in Dreſſing all their Victuals.</p>
            <p>The firſt courſe was of fleſh meat, which was ſtewed in very ſmall Pieces in a Pipkin, with Roots and Green <hi>Plantains,</hi> and <hi>Bonanos,</hi> with a great deal of Pepper, which was ſtewed too much and poured out into Earthen Diſhes; It reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extreamly well, and perfumed the whole place.</p>
            <p>The next Courſe was for the moſt Part of the fleſh of two ſorts of Beaſts, called by <hi>Indians</hi> Peccory
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42773:19"/>
and Narree, which was broyled upon Grid-Irons made of Wood; it was ſerved up without any ſawce; but when it came to the Table, one of the waiters ſtrew it all over with Salt and Pepper.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Courſe was of Fiſh, ſome boiled in Earthen Pipkins with Pepper and <hi>Bonanos,</hi> and ſome broiled upon the <hi>Indian</hi> Grate, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Barlecues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, for a kind of deſert was ſerved in dryed <hi>Plantains, Bonanos,</hi> and a kind of a musk Fig with ſome Baſtard Cinnamon, with which the Country abounds.</p>
            <p>Every one had at his right hand, two or three Calabaſhes of ſeveral of the above-mentioned Liquors, to take and drink when he pleaſed without any Cups, and another of Curious Spring Water.</p>
            <p>The King in Eating, dipt his two fore fingers of the right hand bent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42773:20"/>
hook wiſe, and took up therewith out of the Diſh as with a ſpoon, as much as he could, ſtroking it a Croſs into his mouth. After every mouthful, he dipt his fingers into the water by his ſide, for Cleanlineſs and Coolneſs, ſor the meat he eat is exceſſive hot; he eat no bread with it; but at every three or four mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls he dipt his finger in the ſalt and ſtrok't over his Tongue.</p>
            <p>All Dinner time he was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Muſick, Vocal and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, which ſeemed to be very diverting to him; tho to the Gueſts it ſeemed harſh and jarring; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, was the great Achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of himſelf, and Anceſtors, and concluded with a Song to well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Gueſts.</p>
            <p>After Dinner was over, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties withdrew and were Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the place, where they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed themſelves after the morning Audience.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Their Game and Manner of Hunting.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THEY had not been long there, when a Meſſenger came to them to ask them if they would be pleaſed to divert themſelves with Hunting, for News was brought the King, that a great drove of Peccary was come down the Hills. This Peccary is a kind of a wild hog, very black with little ſhort Legs, yet runs ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Its Navel is upon the back, and if upon the killing this Beaſt, the Navel is not cut away from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs within four hours at fartheſt, it taints all the fleſh and makes it ſtink intollerably; but if it be taken away, it will keep well ſeveral days, and is well taſted and very Nouriſhing Meat. But to return to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, all things were made ready,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42773:21"/>
the Dogs were brought out, which are ſmall ill ſhaped Curs, with rough ſtragling hair and very ſlow; So that they rather ſerve for ſtarting Game, then running it down. The Hunters which were all on foot, here being no Horſes, had every one his Bow and Arrows, his Lance, and a long Knife which they call a <hi>Macheat;</hi> being thus accoutred, they ſet forward, and the Women made frequent Prayers for their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The King with the Deputies ſtood upon a Hill, where was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Proſpect, and where they ſaw the whole Hunting without ſcarce moving a ſtep; with their Men and Dogs and ſome Nets they had (which are made of a ſort of Graſs that we called ſilk Graſs, of which ſtrong thread is ſpun) they ſurrounded four or five of them, ſo that they could not eaſily eſcape. They ſeemed not to value the Dogs which durſt not attack them, but ſtood barking at them, as it were at Bay. But the Hunters from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind ſome ſhrubs, ſhot them with

their Arrows, and they made away with ſeveral of them in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and run very faſt for a while, but the loſs of Blood ſoon ſtopped their Carreer. Then they came in with their Dogs and Killed them with their Lances in a trice, then they cut them into four quarters immediately, and raiſed a mighty ſhout, which was Anſwered by the King and the People about him; ſome Playing upon a kind of a Trumpet made of Bambo, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an unmuſical ſtrain, the Death of the Peccary; as ſoon as the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary was brought to the King, he made the Deputies a Preſent of two of them.</p>
            <p>At Night they took leave of the King, and were Conducted to the fore-mentioned place of retirement, where were hung ſeveral large Hammocks made of ſilk Graſs, and tied from Tree to Tree; the Night was pleaſant and refreſhing, and every body ſlept as well as if he had been in the beſt furniſhed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42773:22"/>
Chamber; there was all round a mighty ſilence, and the pleaſant murmuring of the wind in the tops of the Trees gently moved us to ſleep; neither were we troubled with the leaſt fly or inſect, which are very ttoubleſome in low ſwam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ground. But it's not here to be forgot, that a proffer was made of ſome young Women to ſolace the Deputies, which was modeſtly refuſed. Every body ſlept ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till about Sun riſing, when we were awaked by a noiſe of Paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naners, of which enough has been ſaid above.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of their return to Fort St.</hi> Andrews.</head>
            <p>AFter they had dreſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed themſelves with ſome of the Peccary Barlecued, or broil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Wooden Grate, they walked up and down thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Groves, and paſſed two Days more with almoſt the ſame Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and Ceremonies as at firſt. The third day Early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had their Audience of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge;</hi> and ſeveral young Boys of the Chief Nobility, were recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Deputies to be Educated, and to Learn the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, who were kindly received by them; who were glad to have ſo many Pledges for the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaty, and which was the greateſt mark imaginable of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42773:23"/>
their ſincerity, they were re-condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted down the Hills with almoſt the ſame Ceremonies and Dancings they had at their coming up. All was pleaſant and gay, onely the mothers of the young boys made at firſt a mighty howling, and beating of their Breaſts; but they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by their Husbands, who told them, <hi>It would onely be for a while, and that the Deputies would ſend ſome Boys of their Nation to be trained up in their ſtead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our return we met with a ſort of Wild Hog, called <hi>Warree</hi> by the <hi>Indians:</hi> It is very good Meat; it has little Ears, but very great Tusks, and the Hair, or Briſtles, is covered with a long and thick Set. It's a fierce Creature, and dreads no Beaſt whatſoever: But one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany quickly diſpatch'd it with a Slug ſhot out of a Fowling Peice. The Noiſe of the Shot rouzed at the ſame time a ſtately horned Buck, who made his eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42773:23"/>
We ſaw abundance of Rabbets, which are as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ge as Hares, which have no Tai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, but little ſhort Ears, with huge large long Claws: They have no Burroughs, but lodge in the Roots of Trees. Several of them were Killed. They are excellent Meat, and eat much moiſter than <hi>European</hi> Rabbets.</p>
            <p>We met with whole Droves of Monkeys, moſt of them black, ſome few white; ſome with large Beards, others Beardleſs, which were then fat, the Fruits being ripe, and are very agreeable meat.</p>
            <p>We ſaw many other ſorts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, of which a further Account will be given in a particular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, by an ingenious Gentleman who deſigns the Natural Hiſtory of theſe parts. But we neither ſaw Bullock, Horſe, Aſs, Sheep, Goats, nor ſo much as a Cat, tho they be much troubled with Rats and Mice. So that one may make their Fortunes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42773:24"/>
by Cats, as <hi>Whittington</hi> did, who was twice or thrice Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which confirms that common Tradition of his ſudden acquiring of great Riches.</p>
            <p>The Countrey we returned thro was very Woody, onely here and there were ſome pleaſant large Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, where grows great plenty of <hi>Maiz,</hi> which makes a ſubſtantial ſtrong Bread, but it eats ſomething dryer and harſher than our Wheat. It produces a wonderful increaſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Thouſand for One. The Planting and Gathering of it is the Work of the Women. The mens Employment is only hunting and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing.</p>
            <p>There are infinite quantities of Cedar, very high and large. The Wood is very Red, of a curious Grain, and of a very fragrant ſmell The onely uſe they make of them is for Canoa's and Periago's, the firſt being much leſs than the ſecond; which latter ſometimes, tho all of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42773:24"/>
one Tree hollowed, will conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently carry fifty or threeſcore men.</p>
            <p>There are great ſtore of Plantains which produce an excellent Fruit: The <hi>Indians</hi> ſet them in Rows, and they make very delightful Groves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonano</hi>'s grow here in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: They are a ſort of Plantains; the Fruit is ſhort and thick, ſweet and mealy; it eats excellently well raw; but the Plantain eats beſt when it's boiled.</p>
            <p>But the Crown of all is that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Food which we call the <hi>Pine-Apple,</hi> ſhaped ſomething like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichoak, as big as a man's head. It grows like a Crown on the top of a ſtalk, about the thickneſs of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man's Arm, and a Foot and a half high. The Fruit is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 7 pound weight, incloſed with ſhort prickly Leaves. This Fruit has no Kernel in it. 'Tis very juicy, and ſeems to taſte of all the Delicious Fruits together. It ripens at all times
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42773:25"/>
of the Year, and is raiſed from new Plants. The Leaves of the Plant are broad, about a Foot long, and grow from the Root. Some of the Company would have called it, <hi>The Vegetable Manna,</hi> which would have been no improper Name; for it has a thouſand Delights in its Taſte, and may ſupply the Defects of all ſorts of Fruits. Its Leaves ſerve for cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering of Houſes, and Bed-cloaths o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Hammocks. Two or three of them will defend one from the Sun and the Rain.</p>
            <p>We ſaw Sugar-Canes in abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but the <hi>Indians</hi> know not how to make Sugar; they will carry them as they walk, under their Arms, and now and then take a peice of one of them and chew it, and ſuck out the Juice.</p>
            <p>Baſtard Cinnamon Trees grow in moſt places, which bear a ſort of a Cod ſomething ſhorter than a Bean Cod, but much thicker. It's thought if they were tranſplanted, the Bark
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42773:25"/>
might in time be little inferior to the fam'd Cinnamon of <hi>Ceilon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There grows plentifully two ſorts of Pepper, the one called <hi>Bell-Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> the other <hi>Bird-Pepper,</hi> which are both much uſed by the <hi>Indians;</hi> both ſorts grow on a ſhrubby Buſh, about a Yard high. The <hi>Bird-Pepper</hi> has the ſmaller Leaf, and is much more eſteemed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and is capable of great Improvements.</p>
            <p>Red Wood, fit for Dyers, is no leſs plentiful than the former. The Trees are commonly about 40 Foot high, about the thickneſs of ones Thigh. The <hi>Indians</hi> with this, and a Kind of Earth, dye Cottons for their Hammocks. It makes a bright lively Red.</p>
            <p>The Tobacco that grows here is not ſo ſtrong as that in <hi>Virginia,</hi> which we attributed to their want of Skill in managing it; for they raiſe it onely from Seed, and never tranſplant it, as they do in all the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42773:26"/>
Tobacco-Countries. When it's cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they ſtrip it from the ſtalks, and laying 2 or 3 Leaves upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they roll up all together ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, into a long Roll, leaving a little hollow; round this they roll other Leaves, cloſed hard, till it be as big as ones Wriſt, and 2 or 3 foot long: They ſmoak it in Company thus: A boy lights one end of the Roll, and burns it to a Coal, wetting the part next it, to keep it from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting too faſt. The end ſo lighted he puts into his mouth, and blows the ſmoak thro the whole length of the Roll into every body's Face in the Company. Then they ſitting in their uſual Poſture upon Forms, make with their hands held hollow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a kind of Funnel round their Mouths, and Noſes, they ſnuff it up greedily, and are extreamly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and look on it as the greateſt of Refreſhments.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the moſt remarkable things we obſerved in our going and returning, beſides great variety of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42773:26"/>
Fowl, which deſerve a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Account; which is lett to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Natural Hiſtory, here being no room for ſuch large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we were come within ſight of <hi>St. Andrews Fort,</hi> we all fell down on our Knees to give God moſt hearty thanks for our Succeſs, and happy Return, and were preſently met by a great part of the Garriſon. Never were People ſo careſſed, tears of Joy ſtanding in every bodies eyes; and there was great ſtriving among them about getting the Education of the <hi>Indian</hi> Boys, who in ſo ſhort a time had moſt of them learned a great many words of our Language. So that it's not doubted but in a ſhort time they will attain the Perfection of it, as ſome of our Little ones will do of theirs, who are ſpeedily to be ſent to remain with the <hi>Indians,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Agreement in the League, which it's hoped will ptove as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as that made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Charlemain</hi> and King <hi>Achaius.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns, will do their utmoſt to diſturb us, but unleſs they be aſſiſted by ſome other Nation, we have no great Reaſon to fear them; for the daily confluence from all parts, of great Shoals of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Strength of the Scituation of Fort St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the League with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the frequent Defiles
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42773:27"/>
will render it an Enterprize too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for them. They made ſome fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attempts from St. <hi>Maria;</hi> but we diſpatching a few ſelect men, under the Command of Capt. <hi>Montgomery,</hi> met them in a Plantain Walk, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſperſed them, took above 100 Priſoners, and among the reſt their Chief Commander <hi>Don Domingo de la Rada,</hi> who is as yet a Priſoner at Fort St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there till we have a Good Account of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> treatment of Capt. <hi>Pinkarton,</hi> who commanding the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin Tender,</hi> was forced by diſtreſs of weather under the Walls of <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> and made Priſoner laſt <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> a little before the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Skirmiſh hapned.</p>
            <p>As we grow ſtronger, we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure a part in the <hi>South Sea,</hi> from whence it's not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 6 weeks Sail to <hi>Japan,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>China.</hi> So that bating diſtreſs of weather, by bringing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditys of thoſe Countries over this narrow <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> the Riches of thoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42773:28"/>
Kingdoms may in 4 or 5 months time arrive in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Intereſt <hi>England</hi> has in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the Preſervation of this Colony, it's needleſs to diſpute, ſince they have Arts and Means to ſhare in the Riches of <hi>Scotland;</hi> And all our Nobility and Gentry muſt, for their own Intereſt, attend the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently diſperſe their mony among them. All theſe Circumſtances concurring, makes us hope it will be one of the moſt thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Colonies in the world, and that all Attempts againſt it will prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive, which ought to be the wiſh of all the Inhabitants of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
