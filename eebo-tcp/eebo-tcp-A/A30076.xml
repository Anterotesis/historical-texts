            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis ſmall Worke is undertaken for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good, as well of the Inhabitants, as the Adventurers, and therefore requires a familiar pen, and plain matter, more then height of ſtyle: the Author had rather do good, then be commended; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſed to let the Work be uſhered in by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of others: he is not ignorant, what a ſlight eſteem this place hath amongſt the generality of the people, and knowes a good name is ſooner loſt then recovered, and that when men joyn with common fame to deſtroy a good Work, the Devill hath got a victory;
<pb facs="tcp:56957:4"/>
wherein 'tis extreamly conſiderable, how great an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he hath alwayes been to the Planting of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, eſpecially, in places where (as here) the Natives own him for their God: Therefore let no man won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the good of this place hath been ſo much obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſince now they know by whom.

            <head>The principall Motive, that drew the Author to this Worke, was,</head>
            <p>THat finding many Gentlemen have unſetled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with a deſire to better their fortunes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places, and in this condition, inquiſitive after the ſeverall Plantations abroad, to the end they might make choice of the beſt, in which they are much troubled with the various relations both by books and men, whoſe onely aime is to draw all men to themſelves; and to further that Work, are liberall to abuſe all other places but their own: by which means men are diſperſt abroad in ſeverall ſmall numbers, at great diſtances from each other, which is very
<pb facs="tcp:56957:5"/>
uncomfortable and diſccuſolate, whereas if they had been all directed to any one good place, they might have been in this time a great and flouriſhing people: and finding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (without diſparaging of other places) that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Virginia</hi> is abundantly ſtored with what is by all men aimed at, <hi>viz.</hi> Health and Wealth, ſo that there wants nothing to their happineſſe that go over, but good Inſtructions, which were never yet endeavoured, more then to ſhew the place; I thought that man that ſhould kindly take the ſtranger by the hand, and lead him to it, ſhewing him not onely the richest Mines, but alſo how to dig them, would deſerve much thanks.</p>

               <p>I Am in the next place, in order to the Cure, firſt to diſcover the Diſeaſe of this Country, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Diſeaſe.</note> of which,</p>
               <p>The Government is the greateſt of all; for no wiſe man will either tranſport himſelfe, or ſend his eſtate to ſuch a place where is no ſetled Government, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Lawes to preſerve mens lives and eſtates, and to maintaine honeſt commerce.</p>
               <p>The Government is, by Governour, Councell, and Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The Governour is commonly a Stranger, ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and is to laſt but three yeares, in which time, he muſt not be blamed, if he doe his owne Worke.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other things, he can call Truſtees and Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to be of the Councell, which puts the Adventurer to a ſtand.</p>
               <p>And this well conſidered, hath gone a great way in the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>For, by it Juſtice is ſtifled, and the Adventurer muſt never hope for Juſtice, ſince the Debtor is by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours favour, made both Judge and Party; by which meanes 'tis cleare, the greater the Aduenture the ſurer loſt, for the Truſtee ſhall be the ſooner a Councellor.</p>
               <p>In theſe things I ſpeake experimentally of ſuch as were before, but doe not charge the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, for by their care the Plantation is in ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable condition of recovery.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Next, by the People.</head>
                  <p>The Aſſembly in manner as it hath beene choſen, hath been miſchievous, for they have not beene elected for their honeſties and abilities, but by their great Port, although maintained with an Adventurers purſe; and ſuch was the Aſſembly, when moſt of them being bound to pay Mony-Debts, made an Act of Aſſembly, that they ſhould pay their Debts in <hi>Tobacco</hi> at 12. d. <hi>per</hi> li. when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56957:12"/>
it was ſold at the ſame time in the Countrey for one penny.</p>
                  <p>The Laws were bad, and worſe adminiſtred, by which meanes induſtrie was diſcouraged, and ſtrifes counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced.</p>
                  <p>The Councells time, that ſhould be better ſpent for the encouraging of others, taken up in hearing, but not determining unneceſſary ſtrifes.</p>
                  <p>Next, the Diſeaſe growes by the Commoditie they have and doe make their Staple; which,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the very infancy of the Plantation, they have made <hi>Tobacco</hi> their Staple, which hath been ſent for <hi>England</hi> in ſuch quantities, as many yeares there hath beene ſome hundred thouſand pounds weight, not worth the fraught and cuſtome, and by this means many a poore Planter hath been deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Tobacco</hi> being once in the ground, is never out of hand till in the Hogs-head; and, which is the miſery of it, the Moneths of <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> being the very height of the Summer, the poore Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant goes daily through the rowes of <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſtooping to worme it, and being over-heated he is ſtruck with a Calenture or Feaver, and ſo periſheth: This hath been the loſſe of divers men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Tobacco</hi> is ripe but once in the year, and Ships goe for <hi>Virginia</hi> at that time when they may have the <hi>Tobacco</hi> for their home-ward fraught, there being nothing elſe to lade them, which makes many here in <hi>England</hi> thinke, that it is a yeares Voyage to <hi>Virginia,</hi> whereas if there were other Commodities to lade Shipping, they might go and return in four or five Moneths at the moſt, by which meanes many a man that would willingly have gone away in <hi>March,</hi> had there beene Shipping to tranſport him, is of another minde, or hath otherwiſe ſettled himſelfe before <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> comes, which is the uſuall time of going.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56957:13"/>
Fourthly, that by ſhips going in this manner, they are peſtered with people, who thereby are very much indangered in their healths, and the paſſenger is at as much more charge in his tranſportation as otherwiſe he ſhould be, for he payes 5 l. 10 s. for a mans paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and keeping his men at charge in the Cookes Shops in Saint <hi>Katherines</hi> five or ſix weekes, ſtands him neare in 3 li. a man more, whereas, if ſhips were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly going, it would not ſtand him in above 4 li. 10 s. a man.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> Treachery, like a malignant diſeaſe, hath hindred many friends from viſiting it, for the maſſacre in 1622, wherein was ſlain 350, hath ſcared many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from coming to it, which if truly underſtood would not fright the meaneſt ſpirit, ſince the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing truſt and confidence in the <hi>Indian,</hi> gave the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, for it was not the ſtrength of millions could injure them. And whoſoever ſhall reade the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the maſſacre, ſet out 1622, will find there is no danger in them, except you give them weapons, and ſtand ſtill whilſt they deſtroy you.</p>
                  <p>And next, the miſcarriage of good deſignes for Staple commodities hath added much, wherein I could inſtance in particular, by whom the deſignes of making <hi>Pot-aſhes, Rape,</hi> and <hi>Walnut Orle,</hi> and other Staples, as alſo ſetting up Saw-Mills, were ſet on foot, and the particular reaſons how they came to fail; which was not for want of the Countries being plentifully ſtored with materialls, but by other caſualties: the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars would take up too much room in this place; My deſire being to make this ſo ſhort as the very eſſence of the matter will beare, that it may not tire but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and fully ſatisfie the Reader: wherefore I will give you ſome few generalls, whereby ſuch may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as ſhall come after, how to avoid the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes they fell under.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56957:13"/>
1. The firſt is, that this Country being in it ſelf ſo rich as is before ſet forth, many men ayming from ſmall ſtocks to be ſuddenly rich, have ſpent themſelves in courting their deſigns, and when all parties were agreed, not ſo much money left, as would procure the Licence to marrie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Next, having built their deſignes upon ſome one Artificers life, his death hath brought deſtruction to the Worke.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or the Worke being here formed and ſent over, ſome principall part hath beene loſt, or broken, and none in that Countrey able to repaire the loſſe, the Worke hath ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Or elſe having fully outed themſelves at the firſt, what they intended to adventure, and upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a ſuddaine and certaine returne, when in ſtead thereof they have beene ſaluted with a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to pay, or a particular to provide a ſecond ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; and being put by their confident expectation, they fall into deſpaire, and ſince it will not come at the firſt pull, give it over.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They goe in partnerſhip, and upon ſome pettie difference draw ſeverall wayes, and let the deſigne to the ground.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A ſixt is, that when men come freſh over, their Credits are ſound, and ſo ſoone forget wherefore they came, idling out their time, till their new-contracted Debts overtake them, and ſo they and their deſignes are loſt: And this I have knowne to be the loſſe of many a good deſigne.</p>
                  <p>Malitious tongues hath impaired it much: For it hath beene a conſtant report amongſt the ordinarie ſort of people, That all thoſe ſervants who are ſent to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> are ſold as ſlaves: whereas the truth is, that the Merchants who ſend ſervants, and have no Plantations of their owne, doe onely transferre their Time over to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56957:14"/>
others, but the ſervants ſerve no longer then the time they themſelves agreed for in <hi>England:</hi> and this is an ordinarie courſe in <hi>England,</hi> and no prejudice or hurt to the ſervant.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, the unfitneſſe of the people tranſported for the Worke, or being fit, not well ordered, hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Countries recoverie very much.</p>
                  <p>The uſuall way of getting ſervants, hath been by a ſort of men nick-named <hi>Spirits,</hi> who take up all the idle, lazie, ſimple people they can intice, ſuch as have profeſſed idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and will rather beg then work; who are perſwaded by theſe <hi>Spirits,</hi> they ſhall goe into a place where food ſhall drop into their mouthes: and being thus deluded, they take courage, and are tranſported. But not finding what was promiſed, their courage abates, &amp; their minds being dejected, their work is according: nor doth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſtudie any way how to encourage them, but with ſowre looks, for which they care not; and being tyred with chaſing himſelfe, growes careleſſe, and ſo all comes to nothing. More might be ſaid upon this ſubject, were it fit: 'tis moſt certaine, that one honeſt labouring huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman ſhall doe more then five of theſe.</p>

               <p>HAving thus conſidered the Diſeaſe, and how contracted, I ſhall preſcribe a plaine and eaſie way for the Recoverie, which ſhall be, firſt, by a wholſome and equall Government, that may incourage, delight, and ſecure all men.</p>
               <p>Before you enter into the Government, obſerve the Propoſer, whom you ſhall finde more imployed about the Foundation then the Building, ſince 'tis found, that the firſt failing, the ſecond cannot ſtand: And that he may not appeare altogether ignorant of what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, 'tis fit you ſhould underſtand, that amongſt other things he lookt into the Fabrick of <hi>Englands</hi> Lawes, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56957:14"/>
finding Reaſon the Key, he endeavoured to enter, where at the very firſt, his Reaſon quarrelled with that part of the Building. wherein the diſſent of fee-ſimple eſtates was lodged, ſince the doore onely opened to let in the brothers of the whole bloud, but was ſhut againſt the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the half, although they were the children of one father; and that rather then let them in, though ſo neere, the eſtate muſt look an heire of the whole bloud, though he can but call Couſin at never ſo great a diſtance, who as it were ſhall ſnatch the eſtate away, as if the half bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were all Baſtards. And prying further into this part, he found many miſchiefes depending on it; to inſtance one for all: A man in povertie marries as poorely, and hath a ſonne; the Wife dyes, he after marries richly, and hath many children, purchaſeth a fee-ſimple eſtate, then dyes: the ſonne by the firſt venture, enters and dyes; his Couſin, it matters not in what degrees diſtant, ſhall wipe the reſt of the children of the eſtate which was brought by their owne mother. My reaſon told me, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers owne children ſhould be ſucceſſively let in before the Couſin of the whole bloud: but being ſatisfied in knowing the harſh reaſon of this Law, which was onely to preſerve the eſtate in the whole bloud in a right line; he ventured further, deſiring to underſtand the unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, but met ſuch contrarieties of Judgements &amp; Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, both in Law and Equitie, upon the ſelfe-ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, occaſioned by the ſtrength of Reaſon, more prevay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with one Judge then another, &amp; Rules in Pleading, accompanied with various Circumſtances and Niceties, full of Intricacies, and multitudes of Officers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (to know which ſeverally, requires an Age) had ſwell'd theſe Buildings to that vaſtneſſe, that he plainely ſaw, it was not one mans whole lives ſtudie could make him Maſter thereof; all which proceeded from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Laws of other Nations, who in ſeverall times had power over this Kingdom: all which conſider'd, made
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56957:15"/>
him retire, and to content himſelf in ſeeking upon what foundation this ſtrange and Labyrinth-like building was erected, which he diſcovered to be politick reaſon, and then he thought whether (ſince the ground-work in the general was ſo good, &amp; thoſe who had the Government ſo minded) thoſe parts of the foundation, that are ſo harſh and rugged, might not be altered and made more ſmooth and equall, and the building made to anſwer: but he found it could not be, without apparant danger to the whole, ſince ſo many with ſeverall titles had built their eſtates upon it.</p>
               <p>Next, he apprehended to take the whole building down, and the foundation from the beſt of the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls new laid, and then, whether men might not in the mean time, and untill the fabrick ſhould be again erected, lodge their eſtates in ſome ſafe hand, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them back, after the ſtructure finiſht, by ſome generall and free title: he was preſently anſwered; That happily many in poſſeſſion would willingly conſent, but thoſe intereſſed in eſtates Tayl, the heires of the whole bloud, and of the half, the heires according to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Cuſtomes, the Lords of Manours, and their Cuſtomary Tenants, and many more of like nature, would never agree about the redelivery of them back. By which he perceived it was impoſſible to alter any of <hi>Englands</hi> Lawes, with Juſtice to all intereſts, onely ſome thing might be done to prevent the miſchiefe that lay upon the Subject in the courſe and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lawes, and this no better way, then having in all times faithfull and able Lawyers, and that there might be ſome better way found out to make ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to profeſſe the Law, to ſpend more time in their ſtudies, before they undertake to adviſe men how to loſe their eſtates.</p>
               <p>All which being weighed, he was reſolved, that no ſtructure could be ſo commodious and delightfull, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56957:15"/>
when it is carried up intire, with conſideration, that in caſe the Family increaſe, there might be additions without defacing.</p>
               <p>Wherfore having by the means aforeſaid a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the foundation of <hi>Englands</hi> Laws, &amp; having by experience found many miſchiefs and inconveniencies to grow from ſeverall parts thereof, he conſidered, whether he might not venture from thence to deſign a pleaſant and intire building, wherewith all men (not otherwiſe clog'd and fettered with eſtates, held by Ancient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate titles &amp; Cuſtomes) might be taken, and chearfully contribute to the work: &amp; upon enquiry after a place to ſet his Frame upon, he found the forraigne Plantations were already hard at work about it; but having ſurveyed their Draught, he clearly ſaw they had left too many doors for inconveniences, &amp; which was worſe, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was miſtaken, and ſo the higher they built, the more dangerous. All which was eaſy to be rectified, ſince in reſpect they were as yet but pin'd together with their intereſt under a common title, and ſlightly faſtned with perſonall ties: being glad of this advantage, that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he might be the Author of ſo good a work, he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully undertooke the Modelling the ſame. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Government is no other then the extraction of power into the hand of one or more, to the end it may be diſpenced upon all occaſions for the peoples good &amp; ſafety, he conſidered, that thoſe in whom the power reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought to be for wiſdome, juſtice, and integrity, drawn from the very quinteſſence of the people, which muſt be done by a through knowledge of each other, whereby they would be able from amongſt themſelves, to ſet the beſt, the firſt ſtep towards the Government, and they preſently to have power over thoſe that choſe them, but not to be in the Chuſers power to call back; the higheſt power, after, ſhall by ſteps raiſe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their abilities, which you'l find more plain in the following Government.</p>

                  <p>All debts to be paid by any Planter in the yeare to come, ſhalbe acknowledged before the Superintendents of the Diviſion wherein the Planter lives, otherwiſe not to be recoverable which acknowledgement ſhall have the force of a Judgement.</p>
                  <p>If a Merchant complaine of his Factour, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in preſence of the Councel, ſhall appoint either two Aſſiſtants or any Superintendencie to take the accompt and certifie the Councel that Juſtice may be done.</p>

                  <p>The Superintendents may put in ſuch perſons to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the eſtate and take ſuch ſecurity from them, as they ſhall thinke fit for the whole Diviſion ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the eſtate to the Governour, and the whole Colonie ſhalbe anſwerable to the partie intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

                  <p>Studie this Modell of Government, and compare it with any other that hath been, or is now in being, and you ſhall finde prevented thoſe miſchiefes, that like ſo many degrees of poyſon make ſome giddy, others deadly ſick, ſwelling them to burſting. In it you may, ſee every man harmoniouſly working, according to his ſeverall indowments of minde and body: firſt, to preſerve it in health, by ſtifling in the infancie all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and love-breaking ſtrifes; next, to feede, clothe, and enrich it, reſolving with ſpeed to make their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth flouriſh; which cannot be doubted, ſince in it all are ſo much pleaſed and delighted: the common people fitting and chuſing the ſtones for this ſtrong and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Building, the Governour and Councell laying and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56957:23"/>
ſetting theſe ſtones (ſo provided) for the beſt advantages, whilſt the Adventurer is ſearching for, and ſending ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls from all places.</p>

                  <head>Another good meanes to the Recovery muſt be by raiſing Commodities for the conſtant imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Shipping; and although this ſpeak it ſelf, yet examples will doe well.</head>
                  <p>And firſt let us look upon New <hi>England,</hi> a Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begun thirteen yeares ſince <hi>Virginia,</hi> viz. in the yeare 1620, the ground no more comparable to <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> then the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is to the South of <hi>England,</hi> they have no Sugar, Indigo, Ginger, or any other of the rich Commodities before ſpoken of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they grow there; yet in this little time of 28 years they are become a flouriſhing people, and with many gallant Ships built, and every way fitted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls raiſed out of their own Countrey; and alſo ladden with their own Native Commodities, drive a Trade with all the world, inſomuch as men ſhall ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome miſſe paſſage for New <hi>England</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> once in two Moneths; and by this means, have many fine Towns, and are full of people.</p>
                  <p>Next look upon that little Iſland of <hi>Barbado's</hi> not much bigger then the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> which lay languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the diſeaſe <hi>Virginia</hi> now grones under, (till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this five or ſix years paſt,) you may ſee how by the ſtrength of an indifferent Staple Commodity, <hi>viz</hi> Sugar, Indigo, Cotton Wool, &amp; Ginger, it is ſtrangely recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there's whole Fleets of Ships conſtantly going &amp; coming between it and <hi>England,</hi> ſo that Paſſengers are going, thither conſtantly, and they are grown to that height of Trade, that it hath been affirmed to me from very good hands inhabiting in that place, that the laſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56957:23"/>
yeare there was from all places imployed thither above onehundred Sail of Ships, and they are ſeldome without twenty, or thirty Sail in their harbour.</p>
                  <p>Yet I can well remember the time, when their fame was much worſe, then <hi>Virginia's</hi> now is.</p>
                  <p>By this means, they have great numbers of men tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves of all degrees.</p>
                  <p>And all this is forſt, by the commodity; for their Government is not ſo good that any wiſe man ſhould be in love with, nor is this Iſland ſo extraordinary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to intice men above other places, alſo the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers have had as indifferent meaſure there.</p>
                  <p>And this well and wiſely conſidered, how much more ſhall that place flouriſh, whereby a ſweet and harmonious Government all men ſhall have faire and honeſt dealing, in a land full of pleaſure and delight, yielding abundance of the beſt Staple commodities in the whole world.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The next help to the Recovery, must be by the commodity, we are to fix upon, wherefore, we will examine all, and make choice of the beſt.</head>
                  <p>There is without queſtion in this Country, ſtore of Gold, and Silver Mynes, which I could clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but the diſcovery will bring ruine to the place, for all Princes, and Potentates clayme an intereſt in Gold and Silver, which they will reach with their ſwords. I ſhall ſay no more of them.</p>
                  <p>The next is Sugar, Indigo, Cotton Wool, and Ginger, the very Commodities of the ſaid Iſland; all which will grow on the Southermoſt part of <hi>Virginia,</hi> but yet they will not do the work, for firſt the Sugar Canes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56957:24"/>
and <hi>Indigo</hi> ſeeds to plant, muſt be brought from the <hi>Barbado's</hi> or ſome other place, and then they are two or three yeares before perfect; and experienced men will alſo be wanting, and will be a work in reſpect of the charge, that but a few can compaſſe: and which is worſt of all, the ſaid Iſlands having gotten the ſtart, will make thoſe commodities drugges, before our Harveſt; for in this little time, <hi>Indigo</hi> is fallen from nine ſhillings <hi>per</hi> pound, to three ſhillings ſix pence, and I have heard ſome of the Gentlemen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſay, that <hi>Indigo</hi> in a very little time will not quit coſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are fine commodities for wiſe men to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, indifferent quantities, but not to be the Staples that muſt do the work.</p>
                  <p>The next in conſideration, will be Wine, Reiſons, Dyes, and Drugges; truly great quantities of theſe, will make them Drugges indeed: beſides, the time and money ſpent before they can be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, may happily make the poore Planter, with the horſe ſtarve, whilſt the graſſe grows.</p>
                  <p>Yet I confeſſe all theſe are very good to be brought on by degrees, without prejudice to the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
                  <p>The next that offer themſelves, are Mynes of Copper, Tinne, Iron, and Lead, of all which, there is plenty in <hi>Virginia.</hi> Theſe are clearly of the beſt ſort of Staples, but they require a great deale of charge and time to bring them to perfection, and there is much of caſualty happens in the working raiſed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if we run greedily upon them, they may chance to be too heavy for us, either in lifting, or carrying.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore my advice is, that theſe things may be ſtoln upon, at moſt leaſure time, and when we have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56957:24"/>
built a ſure foundation upon Staple Commodities of a quicker production.</p>
                  <p>And now will I think of Silk, Pot-aſhes, Rape, and Walnut oyle: and theſe are very good Staples. But yet when I conſider, we are not all Pot-aſhes, nor Oyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, nor Maſters of the Silk-worme myſtery, nor can preſently be at the charge, theſe are not ſuch as muſt be built upon for the preſent Staples.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſay, but a ſingle, double, or treble purſe, ſo as they be ſtrong, may eaſily with great advantage effect any of the aforeſaid Staples; and by degrees, the reſt may follow.</p>
                  <p>Then we find in the Countrey Maſts for Ships, Pitch, Tarre, Roſſine, Turpentine, Clapboard, and Pipeſtaves: Theſe are good Staples, but groſſe Commodities, and moſt of them fitter to be made uſe of in the Countrey for building ſhips, and will do well when there are no other Fraughts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe in their proportions are ſure Commodities, and will helpe exceedingly, after better Staples are ſet upon.</p>
                  <p>I will now preſent you with <hi>Englands</hi> Staples, amongſt which I find Corn, Hemp, Flax, Rape-ſeed, Cattle, Wool, to which I will adde one more, that cannot be had in <hi>England,</hi> and that is Rice, I am ſure we can all be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Plough, and ſhall ſoon be Maſters of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>And here I fix for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for that we may all fall to theſe workes ſo ſoone as we are landed, and the ſeaſon come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe Flax, Rice, and Rape-ſeed will grow all the Countrey over, and Wheat in all places, where the ground hath beene broken up before, of which there is plenty upon every Plantation which is paſt bearing of Tobacco, yet the beſt for Wheate; and there be divers other places, where VVheat will proſper
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56957:25"/>
exceedingly, that are not over-rich; for in many places, where the ground was never broke up, 'tis too rich for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Corn, ſending up the Stalk ſo high, that the wind layes it: and Cattle are there already in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                  <p>The principalleſt reaſon is, that many Ships may be yearely laden by a few hands imployed in Corn, Rice, Rape-ſeed, and Flax, and if you obſerve but the following Scale, you ſhall find three hands to make yearly above twenty two tunnes of Corne, and Flax: and ſo proportionably a thouſand hands imployed in Wheat, Rice, Flax, and Rape-ſeed, will yearely lade fifty Sail of Ships, of one hundred and fifty Tunne a Ship; by which it is evident that an infinite Trade by Sea might be ſuddenly driven, there being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this place above 15000 men, beſides women, and children, and ſuch numbers of Ships conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comming and going, would quickely people the Countrey: and it is not from the purpoſe to ſhew the failings of the firſt Adventurers for want of this foundation, for if you peruſe their books Printed 1622, you ſhall find after they have told you, what the beauties are of the place, that their Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they intended, were Cordage, Pot-aſhes, Iron, and the like; in all which many hands can make but ſlow worke, as to the lading of Ships, for the advantage of this place is, to raiſe the beſt of rough Commodities to be tranſported. Where hands are plenty, labour is cheap.</p>
                  <p>And for the greater incouragement, there is in this Countrey all materialls for the building and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat finiſhing Ships, to carry theſe Commodities to their Markets: Before I go further, let me recollect my ſelfe, and thinke what a bleſſed Countrey muſt this be, where Gods bleſſings ſeverally diſtributed upon other Countries meet all in one.</p>

                  <p>Now having thus fitted our ſmall Family, I ſhall

adviſe them, when they come over, how to ſettle, which ſhall be in this manner, either for the firſt yeare joyn ſtrength with ſome Planter there, where he ſhall find them all willing to receive him, either to diet, or he diet himſelf, and lodge with them; yet it will be beſt for him to board; for he may board himſelf, and his two men for twenty pound a year, and in this I ſpeak much with the moſt; for my ſelf was offered eight yeares ſince, by Captain <hi>Matthewes,</hi> Captain <hi>Pierce,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, to board all my Family at five pound a head, and to have better entertainment then any Gentleman in <hi>England</hi> for thirty pound a year, and now diet is much cheaper, and of this let no man doubt, ſince in the North of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> and in the Weſt he may diet at the ſame rate, and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the reaſon is, where money and Trade is not quicke, diet is cheap, ſo that if he reſolve this courſe, which is far the beſt, then much of the aboveſaid charge might be ſaved, inſomuch as he might carry over another ſervant for the ſame charge, and being thus fitted, I ſhall adviſe him, to fall upon ſome piece of the Planters ground, that is cleared, and left by the Planter, becauſe hee hath wrought it out of heart with Tobacco, and is to him of no uſe, yet the beſt for this Deſigne, of which grounds, there are great quantities, the Planter will give him leave for nothing, or for a very inconſiderable matter, and when his ſeed is in the ground, then he ſhall have good time to look out where to fix, and after he hath taken his firſt years crop, then to remove to that place he intends to ſettle, where he ſhall have one hundred, and fifty Acres, for ever; that is to ſay, fifty Acres for each man he tranſports; and his Crop by Gods bleſſing, will then inable him to build a pretty houſe, and treble his ſtrength in Servants; and next yeare a Gentleman.</p>

Let not our young Planter fear that he ſhall want a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for being new come over, and uningaged in the Countrey, his credit for any thing he ſhall want, will be as good as the beſt mans in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but let him not be bold with it, leſt he forget his errand, and loiter out his time in good fellowſhip, then which, there can be nothing more dangerous, ſince he is but now entring into his preferment: This Caveat is good, for it hath loſt many a man.</p>
                  <p>And now having fitted him to his work, I will adviſe him in it.</p>
                  <p>He ſhall plough but twenty three Acres, twenty whereof he ſhall ſowe with Wheat, and three with Flax, for which work I will allow him eight weekes with two hands, which may with much eaſe be done, the ground being light: but if the <hi>Dutch</hi> plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes in uſe, as I doubt not but this yeare it will, then one man doth the work of ploughing, and the two ſpare hands ſhall fall upon the incloſing the ground that is a ploughing, and after the ſeed is in the ground, the third hand falls in, there being nothing elſe to do till Harveſt; long before which, I doubt not, but the encloſing 23 Acres will be done, when they may fall to building their new houſe, or preparing of ground againſt the next year by incloſing.</p>
                  <p>The Harveſt being come, the Flax is firſt to be reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which I ſhould have told you before, muſt not be ſowne till <hi>May,</hi> for which worke and the beating out the ſeed, I allow three weeks; then comes the twenty Acres of Corne to be reaped, for which I allow three weeks; there needs no trouble of carting till it be threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for it ſhalbe threſhed or trodden out with Oxen in the Field; I ſhall allow ſix dayes in worke for watering of the Flax; for the threſhing of the Corne I allow ten weekes, but if it be trod or rubbed out as in the Iſlands with Oxen, a fortnight and leſſe will doe it; I allow
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56957:27"/>
twenty five weekes for dreſſing nine hundred ſtone of Flax, in which a man ſhall dreſſe but two ſtone a day, in this worke the year is compleatly ſpent; in <hi>England</hi> I know it would be done in two thirds of the time, but I had rather value it as I doe, that every man may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the truth of the propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Now, notwithſtanding what is ſo confidently report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the great increaſe of this Country, of which truth I am ſatisfied, I ſhall onely eſteeme it equall with the beſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground; and then five quarters from an Acre of Wheat, and three hundred ſtone at 4 li. to the ſtone of Flax, and ſixteene buſhells of Flax-ſeed from an Acre ſhall well content me; if there be more; it will diſcourage no man, and it is well known, we have ſome ground in <hi>England,</hi> that beares neere ſix quarters of Wheat, on an Acre: and divers of the Flax-maſters about <hi>London</hi> have confeſt the Propoſition for Flax, to be true.

                  <p>And I am confident a worſe Market cannot be had, I hope having propoſed every thing we buy at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rate, and every thing we ſell at the loweſt rate, and in the worſt Market; you will be ſatisfied of the reality of the propoſition, and that it is a ſure Foundation for a greater building.</p>
                  <p>I ſee you have ſomething elſe, pray what is it? you would know what the poore Planter ſhall doe to ſupply him till the returne of his Adventure, and then what ſhall become of him if his Adventure miſcarrie?</p>
                  <p>Truly you have give me that advantage by your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of dangers, that I ſhall inſure the Adventure and the new Planter at the end of the two firſt yeares, ſhall inſure him ſelfe to be in a better condition then the Gentleman that in <hi>England</hi> hath 200. li. <hi>per annum,</hi> and ſhall every yeare double his eſtate at the leaſt, and this with much eaſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I muſt tell you that our Planters credit is ſtrong, either in the Countrey with the Planters, or with the Merchants, for ſo much if not more then his commoditie is worth; his old ſtock is ſtill the ſame, and therefore wants nothing, but to pay for his and his mans diet and their wages for the fore-going yeare, which is 30. l. yet I will allow him to ſpend the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus above 100. li. which in the Country was 72. li. or in <hi>England</hi> will be more, &amp; this 100. l. in goods he ſhal ſend by the laſt Shipping that comes for <hi>England,</hi> he needs not fear to have his Market foreſtall'd ſince his commoditie is ſo Staple, and his advantage will be, that hee may
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56957:29"/>
ſend his letters of advice to his friends by the firſt Ships, that they may in <hi>England</hi> before hand know, what Ships the Adventure comes in, and cauſe the 100. l. Adventure to be inſured, which hath been uſually done for 50. s. and the Adventure being arrived in <hi>England,</hi> I propoſe it to be laid out for the Planters good in manner following.</p>
                  <p>50. li. for the paſſage and cloathing of ſix men, which it will plentifully doe, ſince they will need nothing but cloathes and to pay their paſſages.</p>
                  <p>06. li. In two Guns, powder and ſhot, Plough, Irons, and Iron-tooles, as he ſhall appoint.</p>
                  <p>30. li to be inveſted in Commodities as he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to buy more Cattle in the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>02. li. 10. s. paid for the Premio of the firſt enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>11. li allowed for petty charge, and content his friends that ſhall doe his buiſines.</p>
                  <p>02. li. 10. s. to enſure the Adventure to <hi>Virginia.</hi> 100—00</p>
                  <p>And now is our Planter ſecure of his eſtate, and when the Adventure comes over, he is nine men ſtrong, and by their reaſonable endeavours may againſt the next return, in the follwing year by the rule aforeſaid, have an eſtate of above 600. li. 00. s. beſides his ſtock, which ſhews him he is in a happy condition.</p>
                  <p>And to encourage the new Flanter, let him conſider with himſelfe that it is but two or three yeares care, to bring him to this ſafe harbour, and what paines and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is taken by the poore Farmer in <hi>England,</hi> getting his bread with the ſweat of his browes, and after eating it with care and ſorrow, &amp; all this but to pay his Land-Lord's Rent, and to procure ſome ſmall ſubſſiſtance; whereas here is no Rent to pay, and yet the Land twice as good as the beſt in <hi>England,</hi> food plenty, coſt nothing but taking, which is done with much eaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56957:29"/>
Rice, and Rape-ſeed are farre richer Commodities, and done all with the ſame or leſſer care and labour, theſe grow beſt upon the richeſt ground, and therefore moſt fit for the Countrey, the increaſe and profit much greater then thoſe I have taken to illuſtrate the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by, for my deſire was, to examine the meaneſt of the ſaid Staples; and let the beſt alone to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>If all this will not make <hi>Thomas</hi> a Believer, let him then enquire of the principalleſt ſtraights and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchants, walking the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and they ſhall tell him, that when they can be ſatisfied that there is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Corne, Rice, Hemp, or Flax to be had, there ſhall be no want of ſhips, and ready money paid for it, at the rate that I propoſe, they will tell him a hundred pound hath been uſually aſſured from <hi>Virginia</hi> for 50s.</p>
                  <p>Thus having brought the Planter to happineſſe in this life, I ſhall with ſome few admonitions ſhake hands and leave him to the God of mercies prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that God be by him and his Family truly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and before and after work his bleſſing be duly implored.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall adviſe him that he let not his mind riſe with his riches, for that is the ready way to forget that God that gave them, and to make them like the ſweeteſt ſinnes that delight the body, but poyſon the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he halt not between this and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other deſigne, let it appeare never ſo beautifull, but fall cloſe to this, till he hath put himſelfe paſt danger.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that he make no uſe of his Credit, but for abſolute neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>For other adviſe, he ſhall find them under the title of adviſe in the end of the book.</p>

And now let me turn back, and look upon my poore Spirited Countreymen in <hi>England,</hi> and examine firſt the meaneſt, that is, the poore ploughman, day-labourer, and poore Artificer, and I ſhall find them labouring, and ſweating all dayes of their lives; ſome for fourteen pence, others for ſixteen, eighten, twenty pence, or two Shillings a day; which is the higheſt of wages to ſuch kind of people, and the moſt of them to end their dayes in ſorrow, not having purchaſed ſo much by their lives labour, as will ſcaace preſerve them in their old dayes from beggery: where by adventuring themſelves, in a foure, or five weekes voyage (at moſt) over the Seas; which is nothing; they may with leſſe labour, and care, in foure or five yeares ſee themſelves in a condition never again to want; but to live like Gentlemen, and that by their owne Trades they have been bred in, for where a great Merchant-like Trade is driven, as will be ſuddenly in this place; all Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and handicraft labour is dear, which will appeare more plain, if we here in <hi>England,</hi> conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betweene the North parts, where you may have a labourer for foure, five, or ſix pence the day, and <hi>London</hi> where we pay twelve, fourteen, or ſixteen pence the day, the reaſon is becauſe of the great Trade that's driven at <hi>London</hi> by Merchants, and the little or Trade in the North.</p>
                  <p>Next I ſhall look upon the poore Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">For if 60. li. aforeſaid ſhall produce above 170 l. <hi>per annum.</hi> 200 li. which is the Eſtate I here value, may produce much more then 300 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and the Maſter live plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> with ten, fifteen, or twenty pound <hi>per annum</hi> land, or the value thereof in his purſe; which with continuall care helps him to eat bread; yet this Eſtate weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the aforeſaid Scale, will truly tell him, that being tranſported to this place he is a Gentleman of three hundred pound a yeare at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56957:30"/>
Then come I ſadly to look upon the poore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of fiftie, ſixtie, or a hundred pound <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> who was happily the youngeſt Sonne of ſome Gentleman, of a great Eſtate, which was ſettled upon the eldeſt ſon and this to keep up the Familie, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the younger Children might be quiet, there is ſome ſuperfluities thereof, thrown amongſt them, which together with their Gentility, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of an elder Brothers death, holds them up; till Children and Charge ſucks them under miſerie: Let theſe men timely bring their eſtates to this ballance, and they ſhall make themſelves Elder Brothers.</p>
                  <p>The Merchant is ready for receiving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, <note place="margin">Adventurer is in the ſenſe of the book him that ſends to plant The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate with the increaſe.</note> and to performe his part; but that is to be done without the Scale: yet I muſt joyne him with the Adventurer; for which I know in time he will give me thankes: and my Advice ſhall be to him, and the Adventurer to bring foure or five hundred pound to the Scale, and they will finde it profitable without danger: for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will make the Scale go true.</p>
                  <p>The man of money too, if his heart will ſerve him, may weigh two or three hundred pound at this Scale, and he will finde it in two yeares, more then ballance the yearly uſe of foure or five thouſand pound, and the Government for his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, will aſſure him, that his money is placed ſecure.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, I propoſe to the Gentlemen or Elder Brothers, (who have had or now have great Eſtates) that it is good policy to have two ſtrings to their bow, for it hath been a thing taking very much with wiſe men not to adventure all their eſtates upon one title, nor in any one County, and their wiſdome never appeared ſo much as in theſe diſtracted times; for when the enemy had poſſeſſion of their eſtates, in one County they have

                  <p>And they being onely bound to land the Paſſengers in <hi>Virginia</hi> at large, or elſe in ſome particular River; they take no further care, but at the place where they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſign their Ships to go, they ſet their Paſſengers on land, which many times falls out to be diſtant from the Plantations, to which the moſt of the Paſſengers are bound ſome thirty, forty, or fifty miles and more, and ſome of the Paſſengers being ſickly at their landing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh before they arrive at their home.

ſhore in the very ſtrength of Winter, which is about the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> and being weake are ſpoiled with cold, whereas if they had been ſet down at their Plantations, they would ſoone recover their healths.</p>
                  <p>The beſt and cheapeſt way for thoſe that intend to go at theſe time, which for the reaſons aforeſaid are the worſt, as alſo being longeſt, in that they go above 200 leagues out of the way, hauling over to the <hi>Azoras</hi> or Weſterne Iſlands, for the advantage of the wind.</p>
                  <p>Let them upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> inquire what Paſſengers are going, and there make a conſortſhip of thoſe who live neareſt together in the Countrey, and having made themſelves up a conſiderable number of thirty or forty, let them then bind the Maſter to ſet them downe with his Ship, at or ſo neere that particular place they deſigne to go to, as the Ship can come.</p>
                  <p>But the better way will be, if they can make up ſo many Paſſengers a will give a Ship a fraught, then to hire a Ship amongſt themſelves, to ſet them downe at their place in <hi>Virginia,</hi> which will make the Planters ſtock go further by a third part, then it would doe by tranſporting himſelf as aforeſaid; which I demonſtrate in manner following.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe I had 120 Paſſengers, and 100 tuns of goods.</p>
                  <p>I look out for a Ship of 150 Tuns, which will doe it very well, and hire her either by the Month or the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which I ſhall find beſt cheap; this Ship I can have for 100. li. a Month, but in reſpect they will not let her for a leſſe time then five or ſix Months, and I having no commoditie as yet to relade her home, I will therefore agree for the Voyage outward, and after I am ſet down, let him make his beſt advantage of any imployment he ſhall meet with, and to performe this ſervice I can have him for 300. l. at the moſt, the Owners victualling their owne Company, and finding all things perteining to the Ship; but you may obſerve, if you will take upon you a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56957:32"/>

falſe rumours hath lockt up this paradice of the earth from many a deſerving man, but the truth is let thy titles be what they will, thou art but a Gentleman, and very many ſuch thou ſhalt find there, who to prevent thy asking will freely and with all ſweet reſpects invite thee to be their Gueſt, and compt themſelves ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded that you'le entertaine their Motion; men of lower condition ſhall find the like with as heartie wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to their Beefe, Bacon, and Bag-pudding, as ever <hi>Tom</hi> gave <hi>Dick,</hi> or <hi>Winifred</hi> gave <hi>Parnell</hi> in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; and being thus fitted they will willingly leave you their ground for a crop, or you may looke out to ſeate your ſelfe upon your owne, which ſo ſoone as you have made choice of, will by the Court be confirmed to you and your Heires for ever.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have fitted you with Servants, before your comming into the Countrey, but ſince it is onely our fancies have beene there to take a view againſt our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come, wee'le not goe without Servants.</p>
                  <p>And of Servants the beſt are beſt cheape.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Ile not advice the Spiriting way, which ſends Drones to the Hive, in ſtead of Bees, but that you take ſtout Labourers and good Worke-men, giving them honeſt wages from 3. li. to 10. li. a yeare accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quallity of the men, for if we in <hi>England</hi> can pay 2. or 300. li. <hi>per annum</hi> rent for a Farme, and give great wages, we may much better give wages where our ground is twice as good, and no rent paid.</p>
                  <p>Beſides it keepes a Servant in heart, and makes him at all times willing to put forth his ſtrength in that Maſters ſervice, that gives him meanes to thrive, and taking this courſe you may pick and chuſe your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>Onely this I muſt adviſe, that you agree with your Servant for foure yeares at leaſt, and conſidering that you pay his paſſage, and are at other charges with him,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56957:34"/>
let the charge be proportioned upon the foure or more yeares wages that he is to ſerve you, and ſo deduct it every yeare.</p>
                  <p>And for Servants encouragement, they ſhall finde themſelves at the very firſt in the condition of Journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for foure or five yeares, and before ſeven yeares end he ſhall have a faire eſtate.</p>
                  <p>I will in the firſt place helpe the weakeſt to avoid the trouble of the ſtrongeſt, whom I ſuppoſe may have three pound the firſt yeare, and preſuming for that he went well cloathed out of <hi>England,</hi> it will be all his owne at the yeares end, with this three pound Ile buy him a Haifer, and ſend twenty ſhillings of it into <hi>England</hi> in ſome commoditie of the Countrey, as to ſay three or foure flitches of Bacon or the like, which he may well doe with twenty ſhillings and more; and for that the Bacon of <hi>Virginia</hi> ſurpaſſeth our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> which I have often experimented here in <hi>England,</hi> I doubt not but at the leaſt (for I love to value all things of this nature at the leaſt) it will yeeld him eight groates a ſtone, and ſuppoſing his foure flitches way but twenty ſtone which they'le doe (and ten more) he hath here in <hi>England</hi> for his Bacon two pound three ſhillings foure pence, and this lade out in Pins, Laces, &amp; Combes, for the Maids ſhall in <hi>Virginia</hi> be double, and now his Cow hath Caved, and he hath five pound in his purſe, beſides his yeares wages to receive, which tells him he hath now ſerved his Maſter two yeares.</p>
                  <p>And following this courſe if I find him at the end of his time with leſſe then ſixty pound in his purſe, beſides his Stock of Cattle, I ſhall ſay he hath either been an extraordinary ill Husband or a negligent ſimple Fellow which if he have not.</p>
                  <p>Let him bring his 60. li. to the aforeſaid Ballance and then (if he looke up to God) he may ſee himſelfe fit to wooe a good mans Daughter.</p>

Beſides this there are better things, for men will plant very little Tobacco, and at leiſure time he may without any prejudice to his Maſter, plant 50. li. in Tobacco a yeare, which as the quantitie faules will riſe in price, and may be worth to him 2. s. 6. d. <hi>per</hi> li.

                  <p>Nor is this all, for he will find in the end of this Book, I ſhall adviſe his Maſter to give him ſomething elſe.</p>
                  <p>Truly I would ſay ſomething to Maid-Servants, but they are impatient and will not take advice but from a Husband, for if they come of an honeſt ſtock and have a good repuce, they may pick and chuſe their Husbands out of the better ſort of people, I have ſent over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but never could keepe one at my Plantation three Moneths, except a poore ſilly Wench, made for a Foile to ſet of beautie, and yet a proper young Fellow muſt needs have her, and being but new come out of his time and not ſtrong enough to pay the charges I was at in cloathing and tranſporting her, was content to ſerve me a twelve Moneth for a Wife.</p>

               <p>ANd when I conſider this way hath been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but the ſucceſſe: for by it divers honeſt men

have been loſt, I ſhall let love alone to worke with Chriſtians, for with <hi>Indians</hi> it cannot, ſince there muſt be an acquaintance to procure familiaritie upon which truſt and confidence is repoſed, which is the common foundation of love, but the <hi>Indians</hi> being a wild people and of a ſubtill and treacherous nature, as ſad experience tell us we muſt not acquaint our ſelves with them to truſt.</p>
               <p>Next I will conſider force and that hath bin fatall to the <hi>Indians,</hi> there having beene great numbers of them ſlaine.</p>
               <p>And this will not doe till they be wholy vanquiſhed, which is a worke (although a ſmall number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> may, and can deale with great numbers of <hi>(Indians</hi> not, to be effected, but with a vaſt expence both of money and time, in reſpect of the largeneſſe of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, wherein the Countrey is, being much bigger then many <hi>Englands, Scotlands</hi> and <hi>Irelands</hi> together.</p>
               <p>Wherefore and for that this courſe agrees not with the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, I ſhall not think of it.</p>
               <p>I will therefore conſider of a third way, in which (not leaving our dependance upon God for his aſſiſtance) I ſhall look upon nature.</p>
               <p>And I will examine the ordinary courſe of taming wild and fierce beaſts, theſe differing from them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that they are endued with naturall reaſon.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, the more you thwart nature, the fiercer you make it: And therefore we are firſt to ſtudy, what they are moſt enclined to: and having found it, then to fit them with thoſe things they naturally are delighted in, and ſo by degrees you take from them all feare; which is the principall abſtacle, and at laſt reclaime them: this is enough for the Generall.</p>
               <p>Now to come to our wilde people, who being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with naturall reaſon, I doubt not, but they may more eaſily reelamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56957:36"/>
Firſt, therefore I will inquire what moſt predommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in nature, and I find ambition to be to the princ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall marke that nature aymes at.</p>
               <p>For all men are naturally ambitious either of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, honour, or of wealth, to attaine which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dangers harſheſt ſtudies and the hardeſt labours are made pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt make uſe of ambition being the univerſall net of nature to take theſe men.</p>
               <p>Now let us looke what it is that drawes us to this net and we ſhall find it to be a ſence of our own naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and it was the caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> our firſt Parents, wherefore I ſhall ſay, that if the Devill could by this meanes worke upon them, to ſo bad an end, God will aſſiſtus by the ſame meanes (ſince it is to a better end) to work upon theſe it being to his glory.</p>
               <p>Now in order to the reclaming of theſe men we muſt conſider.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that they are ignorantly naked in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things, but what they are prompt to by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for ſelfe preſervation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Countrey affording plenty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to ſuſtaine nature, they take little care for the future.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that being thus provided, they ſeeke not nor care for comerce.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that for the reaſons aforeſaid they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon any other people, and care not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verce with any but themſelves.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if ever they be reclaimed it muſt be.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by making them ſenſible of their nakedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By taking them off from their confidence upon nature, whereby they may take care for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that they may deſire comerce.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that they may be brought to depend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56957:36"/>
And for that they cannot be talkt into a ſight of themſelves, I ſhall propoſe that we gently ſteal through their nature, till we can come to pull off the ſcale from their eyes, that they may ſee their owne nakedneſſe; which muſt be done in manner following.</p>
               <p>Either by making them ambitious of Honour, or by making them ambitious of Riches.</p>
               <p>In the firſt we muſt take their Werowances or great men: they already being at that lock of being one better then another.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond, let us not doubt but we ſhall take them all, for there is but a very few men in the World either Chriſtian or Heathan, that are not taken with it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall adviſe that ſlight Jewells be made at the publique charge of thirty or forty ſhillings price, and one better then the reſt, of ſome ſuch toyes as they ſhall moſt affect, which fitted with Ribands to weare about their necks or their heads, as their cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them is; ſhalbe ſent from the Governour of the Plantation in his own, and alſo in the name of the People and the Governour to diſtinguiſh them by ſome pretty titles, which ſhould be alwaies after obſerved; as alſo to make ſome of them favourites, and to ſollicite their preferment with their King, &amp; this by degrees will kindle the fire of Ambition, which once in a flame muſt be fed, and then is the time to worke.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond I ſhall adviſe, that their nature be obſerved what way it moſt poynts at, and then fit them with what they moſt deſire, and if by degrees you can bring ſome of them to weare ſlight looſe Garments in Summer, or to keep them warme in the Winter; which if you can effect, the worke is halfe done, and this I am confident is very eaſie: for a little to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the place I write of, they are fallen into a way of cloathing themſelves without courſe <hi>Welch</hi> cloath of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56957:37"/>
Blew and Red colours, and the better ſort of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in this place do weare Coats of Skinnes, with the Furre ſide next to their bodyes in the Winter, and the Skin ſide in the Summer: and that you may perceive them already comming, they have for the moſt part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their old Faſhion, of making their Coats, and now in imitation, make them like <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloakes; but this muſt be at the publick charge, they having few valuable Commodities to purchaſe them, yet the charge will not be great, for I ſhall adviſe that this be not practiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the generallity, but upon ſome one King and his People that are moſt tractable, and of the neareſt neig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and they are commonly about two hundred or two hundred and fifty <hi>Indians,</hi> and five or ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a man will do it; beſides, there will be ſomething to retribute the charge, <hi>viz.</hi> Beaver, Otter, and other Skinnes, <hi>Indian</hi> Corne, Beanes, and Peaſe, with other things, ſo that it is poſſible the charge may be defrayed, and having won theſe, you need not fear the comming in of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The poore <hi>Indian</hi> being cloathed, his ſight is cleared, he ſees himſelfe naked, and you'le finde him in the ſnare.</p>
               <p>For now they begin to vye who is the better man, which muſt be determined by their Cloathes, and to purchaſe them, they'le be at their wits end, ſince they have nothing valuable, and if you draw the net wiſely they are ſure.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be conſidered, that although their minds be fetter'd, yet their nature is not tamd, wherefore you muſt thinke of propoſing ſome thing to them, that may inable them to be Maſters of Cloathes, which muſt in no wayes trench upon their liberties.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the firſt place you may propoſe eaſie workes, and draw them on by degrees, and you ſhall finde, that for themſelves they will worke, but not for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56957:37"/>
You ſhall likewiſe propoſe to their King, that if hee'l ſend thirty or forty men to helpe in your Harveſt, hee ſhall have a Cloake, or Breeches and Doublet, or the like, and his men ſhould have every one ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Or otherwiſe, ſet them to peeling of Hempe, or brak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Flax in Winter, where they ſhould for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to incourage them, have more then they earned, and then bring them to drive the Plough, or threſh Corne, or the like, but in no wiſe let them continue at any one worke to a diſlike, but play with them, you ſtill fitting varietie of workes to their fancies; thus by degrees (God aſſiſting) you ſhall make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer themſelves: by this meanes in two or three yeares you will draw them to a confidence in you, to truſt their Children to be brought up by you, and they'l learne <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which will be a good ſtep to bring them to Chriſtianitie. Having brought them thus farre, you need not be directed how to leade them further, your owne reaſon and profit will doe it; never feare their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling back, for their owne ends ſhall keepe them to you, becauſe their minds will prompt them to pride, and they'l cover to be finer then their fellowes.</p>
               <p>And now have you opened their eyes, made them care for the future, drawn them to commerce, and made them depend.</p>
               <p>And in the end, by Gods mercy to them, make them good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Thus have I done with the <hi>Indians:</hi> onely this take notice of, I do not adviſe that at any hand you ſuffer them to come into your houſe, or any further then your field or out-working houſes, neither admit more of them to come then you can maſter, and that they alwayes come without their armes, untill you ſee them ſo ſenſible of their poverty, that they come neceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to worke.</p>

               <head>SECT. VII.</head>
               <p>I Am now to adviſe the Adventurer, Planter, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, of ſuch things as are proper to them.</p>
               <p>Having before adviſed of the miſchiefe of procuring of Servants, and of the convenience and inconvenience of the uſuall paſſage to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and how to prevent the inconveniency, as alſo of a better way of paſſage, and like wiſe to diſpoſe of your ſelfe in the Countrey when you come firſt there, and what commodities to fall preſently upon, I ſhall now adviſe.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Firſt to the Adventurer.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, that whatſoever his deſigne be, not to depend upon the life of any one man for the perfecting the worke, but to ſend two at the leaſt of equall abilitie, and one to ſucceed the other in caſe of death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that for whatſoever belongeth to Art, that it be here made in <hi>England,</hi> leaſt when the worke comes over, none be found there able to do it, and ſo it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, or if there be any principall in it, that may be indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to be loſt or broken, that he ſend two of the ſame for feare of falling.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that if there be Parteners in the buſines, they ſo Article that the fayler to ſupply his part, ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit it to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, whatſoever the deſigne be, yet ſend over a Plough or two, for this if their deſigne faile, or untill the deſigne be perfected, will turne to accompt, and make them great gainers.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Secondly to the Planter.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, that they take the Planters leave where for the preſent they ſhall reſide, and doe not neglect the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56957:38"/>
opportunitie of falling into the ground with the Plough ſo ſoone as the ſeaſons come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that when the Corne is in the ground, then <note place="margin">Chuſing of ground.</note> is the time to looke out for the place, they ſhall after ſettle themſelves upon, in which they muſt take care not to ſettle on the places neere the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſalt water, for they are there, as here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> all aguiſh, next that they make choice of ſome place neere a navigable River, where they may have the conveniency of freſh Marſhes, Meadows, and Fiſh, and if they can where ſome pleaſant riſing Hills be, but at no rate doe not ſtrugle too farre from Neighbours, for that's diſconſolate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, let them build their Houſes of Brick, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with Timber, let it be done with ſubſtantiall <note place="margin">Building of Houſes.</note> compleat lengths (ſince they have Timber enough) which will ſave halfe charges in Carpenters worke, line it on the inſide thick with Loame, and cover it with Lime, for that will make it warme in Winter, make your modell or plate-forme ſuch that when your family ſhall increaſe you may adde to your buildings without defacing or inconveniencing any roomes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, examine the ground and ſowe proper ſeed in the proper parts, ſowe not Wheat in the richeſt, for <note place="margin">What ſeed to ſowe, &amp; upon what ground.</note> that will be too rich, and will not turne to accompt, but in your richeſt ſowe Rape, Rice, or Flax-ſeed, and two or three crops of this, will bring the ground to beare Wheat your life after.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England</hi> chuſe good Servants, able Worke-men; and give them good wages, fear not the wages: of every <note place="margin">Carrying of Servants.</note> ten Servants let foure be Boyes, and ever after ſend for good luſty Youths, for they will ſerve eight or nine yeares, whereas men will hardly be gotten to ſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four or five, and taking this courſe the Boyes wil be Men when the Mens times expire, and being trayned up in the ſervice under good men, they will prove excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Servants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56957:39"/>
Fifthly, That the ſervants may do their work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble in over-ſeeing, or without fretting or vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Maſters patience, I ſhall adviſe ſuch a <note place="margin">Servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> way, as they may worke for themſelves, and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters together for be well aſſured, the beſt of them; will work more to get themſelves a Shilling, then to get you ten, and that they may with much content, and profit to themſelves, make their Servants ſhew the beſt of their abilities, it were good to conſider what or how much of any worke to be done by a Servant in a day would be ſatisfactory, and then that being done, he ſhould have an allowance for what he ſhould do more. As for Example; two ſtone, or two ſtone and a half of Flax to be dreſt in a day is indifferent, I would then give him foure pence a ſtone, for what he ſhould do more: this will extreamly incourage the Servant, and very good uſe may be made of it, or let him have the remainder of the day to plant a little Tobacco for himſelfe, or for any other thing; I have tried all wayes, but never found the like.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That for ſuch Servants as are above the age of twenty yeares, who can deſerve wages in <hi>England,</hi> give them wages in manner following, <hi>viz.</hi> three pound the firſt yeare, and ſo increaſe the wages twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings a year to the end of their time.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, and for youths, when they ſhall attain to the age of twenty one years, to give wages, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing to the end of their time, in manner aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, and to undertake to give the Servants. 30 actes of land, at the end of their time, to them and their heirs for ever: which land ſhall be given the Maſter, by the Court, for them.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, That they agree with Artificers for ſhares.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, that they enquire after all advantagious Commodities that are produced from the Earth, and learn how to bring them to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, that they enquire after all manner of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56957:39"/>
ſlight Engines, that will ſave hand-labour, there being nothing dear in the Countrey but labour.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, and for that the Maſters will be at charge of tranſporting and cloathing them; let that charge be deducted proportionably every year out of their wages.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly, they muſt be carefull to Covenant with their Servants, to forfeit for every dayes work they ſhall neglect, double the value of their dayes labour: but for neglect in harveſt, ten times the value.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, the difference that may ariſe between the Maſter and Servant, upon their Covenants, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Superintendents.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They muſt ſhew their Servants Indentures to the Court, and then they ſhall have 50 Acres of land for every ſervant ſetled upon them, and their heirs for ever, which fifty Acres, is over and above what the Servants ſhall have.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>For Servants.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, they to Covenant with their Maſters, not to plant above two hundred weight of Tobacco <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> whereas heretofore a Servant planted 1500.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this will take off all mens depending on Tobacco, which hath been the fatall commodity of that Countrey, and Maſters will find a better way to employ their Servants.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that they looke their Maſters Covenant, to give them thirty. Acres of land, and pay them the wages they ſhall agree for in money, or the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Countrey, money worth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let the Servant agree with his Maſter upon the ſum laid our for him before his tranſportation, that he be not abuſed therein when he contes into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and let the ſame be ſet down in the Indentures.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this carefully obſerved, with the rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed in this book, will aſſure the Servant, that at the end of his time, he ſhall be in a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, never more to ſerve any man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56957:40"/>
A ſingle man that can but pay his paſſage, may have ten pound a yeare for his ſervice, and be found meat and drink.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if any Gentlemen or others with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and alſo Artificers in any Trade, Labourers or Servants ſhall be deſirous to tranſport themſelves for the bettering of their fortunes, either to this place, or any other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations abroad, let them repair to the Authour, who for the love he bears his Countrey, will freely adviſe them how to diſpoſe of themſelves for their greateſt advantage, which ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to do much more with one hundred pounds then they could heretofore do for one hundred and fifty pound, of which benefit the Planter ſhall alſo have the Advantage, and Servants ſhall be upon ſure termes knowing their work, and their conditions, and they ſhall ſee plainly that in a little time, they ſhall by Gods bleſſing, become men of good eſtates, he will alſo adviſe how they may tranſport themſelves with the beſt ſafety in theſe times, from any danger of being taken.</p>
                  <p>And if any Gentlemen that ſhall not go themſelves, but are deſirous to adventure, he will direct them how they may beſt diſpoſe thereof for their advantage, and that in eighteen Moneths they ſhall be reimburſed their principally money, and after ſhall, conſtantly receive much above fifty pound for every hundred pound they adventured at firſt, and owners of Ships ſhall have good imployment, for their Ships not letting them lie rotting by the Walls, as <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> now and heretofore they have done. The Authour is ſenſible that theſe offers are ſomething large, yet let no man doubt of the truth thereof, the being inabled thereto by his deare bought experience, and all men may be ſatisfied, that it hath been rarely found, that any one particular good work hath been faln upon, but ſome one man hath
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56957:40"/>
originally been the Authour, or the originall motion hath proceeded from one mans breaſt. Thoſe rich Mines of the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> were firſt offered by one man to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh: but he not having faith enough to believe, or not willing to venture a little money to be ſatisfied of the truth, refuſed it: and after, it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the ſame man to the then King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who hearkened to him; and all the world knowes, that from this one mans motion, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have within this 150 yeares received from thence many thouſand millions of pounds: beſides, it hath extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched the Gentlemen, and Merchants of that Kingdom. Many of the like examples might be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but they are ſo generally known to all men, that Ile ſay no more, onely that there was ſome time ſpent, after the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſet footing in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> before he could come by travell to the Mynes; and theſe places the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have inhabited much more time then the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Subjects had done in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> before they diſcovered that Countries wealth. But God, that is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all good things, hath not in all this time beene pleaſed to let any man looke further then Tobacco; and no man can ſay, but that he is now pleaſed freely to offer his bleſſings beſtowed upon theſe Countries, in the riches thereof, to us, ſince all this time, there was never any man that had the heart to labour for the Generall good in this nature before.</p>
                  <p>Reader I cannot let thee goe till I have againe put thee in mind of my Epiſtle to thee, in which I diſcovered the great Obſtructor of this Countries proſperitie; who I know being now againe alarm'd, will fiercely ſend his Spirits abroad with lyes and calumnies to abate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples courage, ſince his Kingdom will be ſo much indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, by the through planting of this place with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
