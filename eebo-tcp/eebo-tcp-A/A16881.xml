         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE
TO THE CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Reader, containing a large and
plaine direction to all the simpler sort,
how to vse this aright; and an earnest
exhortation to all sorts to giue
themselues instantly to wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and prayer.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin wished (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and louing Reader)
that as I haue gone brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thorow the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
and Articles of
the faith, to set downe the true watch;
so I would take some paines in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to go thorow the Lords Prayer, to
set downe the rule and summe of prayer,
for the further perfecting and our better
<pb facs="tcp:19934:6"/>
performing the same watch. Whereupon
notwithstanding my great inabilitie, in
respect of many of my brethren, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Lords former mercie, who
shewes his power in weakenes; and that
by this motion of diuers, he seemes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
my poore labour in this also, I haue
attempted likewise to make triall herein:
the better to inable the simpler sort, and
to stir vp all sorts to this holy dutie of
prayer; that wee may obtaine strength
from the Lord to keepe his watch more
faithfully, with innumerable other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
procured by the same. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waying well into what dangerous
times we are fallen; wherein the greatest
part (as it is much to be feared) in such
a declining to Atheisme, and generally
to extreame coldnes or luke-warmenes,
do seldome or neuer pray priuately; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
perhaps they vse the Lords Prayer
without vnderstanding. And of those
who vse to pray, some although they
<pb facs="tcp:19934:6"/>
pray much, yet they do it verie supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
to the prouoking of the Lord, and
hurt of their owne soules, insteed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
any true comfort therein; as all
our popish sort doe. Others haue a desire
to pray, but want abilitie or leasure; as all
our young and weak Christians. A third
sort droope in their troubles, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and feares, &amp; are at their wits end,
as <hi>Iacobs</hi> sons, not knowing what way
to take, and so continue fretting &amp; vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselues, or attempt vnlawfull
meanes for their reliefe and comfort. A
fourth are afraid to vse the Lords Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as a prayer, because they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the power and meaning of it in
so short a forme. A fifth haue gone forth
with our Sauiour into the garden, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
and beginning to watch &amp; pray,
which yet through our long peace, ease
and prosperitie, are fallen a sleepe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sort liue in monstrous sinnes, as in
oppression and vnmercifull dealing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb facs="tcp:19934:7"/>
secret vncleannesse and the like,
without repentance; and yet imagine
that they do pray, that their prayers are
accepted, and that they shall be heard in
the day when they crie, deceiuing their
owne soules. A last sort, and those one
only and scarse to befound abide therein
with our Sauiour, in watching, cries and
teares; wrastling and weeping as <hi>Iacob</hi>
for the deadly malice &amp; bloodie threats
of <hi>Esau;</hi> and holding vp their hands
with <hi>Moses</hi> against <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and
also to pacifie the Lords wrath, that it
may not be powred out vpon his people,
for all our grieuous prouocations. To
witnes my loue therefore yet further to
all these, and all other the Lords people, I
haue thought it my dutie, to offer this
weake labour also vnto the Church of
God, commending the successe vnto him
who is only wise, and worketh by what
instruments it pleaseth him, and aboue
all that we are able to conceiue: yet not
<pb facs="tcp:19934:7"/>
before I had first communicated it vnto
some, much reuerenced of all, for their
learning and pietie. Now I onely craue
pardon to speake freely, to each of these
sorts particularly.</p>
            <p>And first to you that pray not at all,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
looke but vpon the necessitie of prayer,<note place="margin">Harken you that pray not at all.</note>
and consider well in what state you stand

you are in state of damnation, hauing all
things accursed vnto you, and working

tarrie for the execution of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and then if God open your eyes to

<pb facs="tcp:19934:8"/>
for the maner of vttering your requests;
ayming at this specially, that by daily

fresh memorie: which being the true
perfection and paterne of all holy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
doth in the infinite wisedome of God
comprehend whatsoeuer wee can aske.
That so you hauing first gathered by
wise obseruation in the watch, a true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of your owne speciall sinnes and
wants, together with the maine sins and
wants of the Church and Land, may be
able of your selues both for matter and
words, to make a most holy confession of
sinnes, and powre forth your supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
according to your necessities, with
comfort and assurance. I haue set them
downe in two formes, both containing
the same matter, as they are one set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

because of our wearinesse in the best

the other somewhat more largely, for the

Not intending to tie any necessarily euer

of these sixe petitions; As when we would
pray for the glorie of God, or to kindle
the zeale of it in our hearts, or that hee
would shew his glorie in the preseruation
of our King and Realms, to vse the first.
For the Church of God and perfect vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:19934:9"/>
therein, and against the proude ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
thereof; or to get more assurance
that we are true members of it, to vse the
second petition. The third for cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in doing Gods will or submission to
the same. The fourth for dependance on
God, for the things of this life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all worldly cares. The fifth for
forgiuenes of sins. The last against dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or feare of temptation, or any euill
whatsoeuer. I haue laboured to set downe
the heads so plainly in the margent, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
them by figures, that euerie
one that is desirous to learne, hauing but
the seuerall parts of the Lords prayer in
his mind may meditate of them happily
at his worke, or as God giues any leasure;
first marking how many things are
chiefely to bee learned in the Preface;

need that hee hath of them, our miserie
without them, and our happinesse in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying

them; stirring vp his heart to a
vehement desire of them: and then at

of himselfe according to the same order;

be the speediest teacher to the simplest to

heauier then the whole earth vpon you:
that you would giue all the world, if you

at your death the iudgement threatned
vnto <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> shall surely light vpon
you,<note place="margin">Ierem. 22. 18. 19.</note> that none shall lament or mourne

            <p>And for you that would neuer spare

opens your eyes to discerne the true profit

to this businesse of the Lord, and set your

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And in a word, so many of you as can

and make any request for this present

could neuer vtter so much as one speech,
no not in secret to your Father in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
nor make any one supplication for any
heauenly thing with feeling; how can
you thinke that euer you were touched
with Zeale of Gods glorie or his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
or how can you imagine that you
can be the children of the heauenlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or haue any interest in the Lord
and his kingdome; or be any thing but
meere worldlings, sauoring onely the
world, and it alone your portion, hauing
a world of miseries and torment remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for you for euer? Learne therefore
to praie aboue all; you will finde this a

all the wealth &amp; pleasures of the world.
<pb facs="tcp:19934:18"/>
For what you would haue, this will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie
procure you, as far as shall be
good; and whereas all the honors, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
riches and friends in the world,
can neuer giue you any true contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
nor adde one minute vnto your life; this

with abundant ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and make you liue and raigne with
Christ for euer in the heauens.</p>
            <p>Now so many as acknowledge that

<pb facs="tcp:19934:19"/>
you, then euer formerly you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and much better it had bin for you,
that you had neuer seene this way of life,
thus plainly and easily set before you, and
how you may either helpe to preserue the
whole, or at least escape your selues from
the euils to come; then after you haue
knowne it, and subscribed in your hearts
to the truth and necessitie of it, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie
put your hands to the plow, to looke
backe againe. Remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife; if
you be out of Sodome hie for your liues,
vntill you be safe in Zoar; and being safe
your selues, learne to be as importunate
with the Angell of the Couenant, when
you but thinke of the sins of the Land, as
faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> was: comforting
and incouraging your selues in this, that
you are not alone but many with you,
and the Lord hath yet his ten righteous
left, in all quarters some, that mourne
and crie for all the abominations. If in
this attempt I haue failed of that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<pb facs="tcp:19934:19"/>
I humblie craue pardon; and also
that my good will may be accepted, in
this endeuour intended chiefely to helpe
the simple. Vouchsafe me your better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and I shall willinglie follow it.
My desire is to labour herein also to
bring this together with the watch to
more perfection, if I shall find it accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that it may bring the least good
to Gods Church; in which I desire not
to liue one day longer, then I may bee
some way profitable. I haue so oft made
reference to the watch as to a maine
ground of prayer, and for that this is as
a second part, and an vnseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
thereof,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 13. 14. 18.</note> (as the Apostle makes

<pb facs="tcp:19934:20"/>
that you would examine it betweene the
Lord and your owne consciences (to

I say, not asleep in this deepe security,
but either throughly awaked by the law,
or as they were vpon the instant of the
discouerie of the gunpowder plot; or at
any time before any of our great deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
fullie accomplished in the midst
of our extreame dangers. Remember
but whether your hearts weare not then
as my heart is now; that if God had done
with vs as he then threatned, he had not
been most righteous, and wee iustlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
it. Did not all hearts tremble in
the acknowledgement of the truth of his
Maiesties sacred speech in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
house at that time? And who
would not haue confessed in any of these
dangers, that it had not been full time
for each to haue betaken himselfe to this
<pb facs="tcp:19934:20"/>
armour; to haue run to God by instant
supplication, and stood vp in the breach;
and for euery one to haue learned to
watch and pray? And must not our
case since be far more desperate, wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
receiued thus our third most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
admonition, together with so many
mercies still heaped vpon vs? Let vs but
thinke what wee haue done since that
time, to secure vs from the finall execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his vengeance: haue we not most
fearefully increased the transgression, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still many degrees backwards, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from the Lord, and suncken deeper
in our rebellion, insteed of turning to
him according to our oft promises, and
his infinite mercy? Besides our impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in sinning; and our eating vp one
another in euery corner and degree, rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
al things to the vttermost farthing,
and all commonly to maintaine pride
and all excesse; countenancing the lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
in euery place, disgracing and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:19934:21"/>
vpon the vpright, that he that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines

Let but the shamelesnes of that one sin of

although we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not imagin that euer
it was practised in halfe so odious a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as it is ordinarilie with vs euerie
where, in scorning the Lord to his face,
and sacrificing to Satan. Our cloakes of
Ciuility wil proue but <hi>Adams</hi> figleaues.
Inquire of your own hearts, whether this
be not the generall verdict of all whom
God hath touched, or who retaine any of
their ancient feeling; yea whether the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
blind may not grope it; that there was
neuer such a declining to all loosenes, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
prophanenes &amp; euen Atheisme heard or
read of in any age, where the Gospell was
professed, nor that sinne was practised
with so high a hand. And then answere
<pb facs="tcp:19934:21"/>
plainly, whether the Lord may not iustly
get himselfe glory of vs, in the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his iustice, and the power of his
wrath against our sins; seeing the riches
of his mercies in sparing and deliuering
vs, haue made vs so far to exceede, as to
deny the tokens of his wrath, and despise
him to the face; scorning and hating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much as a holy care to serue him
according to his wil. Or what followes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men (eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most equal &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful)
after the third admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at most,
but the due execution &amp; final expulsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
And whether we haue not iust cause to
feare and seeke to pacifie his wrath? Or
whether hee may not most righteouslie
cause his owne children to crie in feeling
the miseries which haue not cried out in
seeing the abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; seeking to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
him: and also whether hee may not
iustly pluck the world fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which hath
so bewitched &amp; plucked vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. And
to conclude, whether it be not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:19934:22"/>
that we each awake and meet him in
time with intreaty of peace, because he is
so merciful, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be awaked of him and
crie day and night (as his people in the
Captiuitie) when it is too late, and he will
shew no mercy vntill his work be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
